How anyone can hate a film with such good humour and a sense of fun is beyond me.,"I can certainly reconcile myself with someone's DISLIKE of the film, and I would expect such people not to view if they have a good idea beforehand that this won't light their fire; but I can't understand those who claim to love this type of genre before watching who then precede to rip the film to shreds.  The good humour mentioned in my summary isn't represented by a particular sharpness of script or a reliance on slapstick, but rather a general attitude pervading the film which smacks of those involved having a darn good time.  In the case of director Sommers this manifests itself often in a threatened overdose of CGI, but when the effects are this good such profligacy where they're concerned is hardly a problem.The manifesto is clear almost from the start - find a wafer-thin premise with which to allot your ghouls enough screen time and then just let them loose in a suitably gothic arena.  As such, Jackman's Van Helsing often finds himself relegated to the role of a bystander, so perhaps the fact that the film bears his name is a bit of a misnomer; however, like I said, we're pretty much in contrivance territory as far as 'plot development' goes, so it should be seen as just another brand name to hang a silly hat on.  In this regard it may pain Jackman the most, since it leaves him still searching for a leading man role in the style of Crowe's ""Gladiator"" to really leave his print indelibly (""X-Men"" is an ensemble piece.)  His best moment actually comes before the main brawls begin - testing out various items of weaponary Inspector Gadget stylee!The lack of focus on the main character shouldn't perturb the audience too much though; if they prepare themselves for a monster royal rumble in the grandest tradition then they should find themselves leaving well satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining,"I don't understand all the bad press this movie got. In a way, maybe that's for the best. Like The Avengers movie (which got similarly scathing reviews) my expectations for Van Helsing were absolutely rock bottom. So it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise when I found the film to be fun, entertaining and quite enjoyable overall. People here are complaining about the CGI monsters. What's the beef? This is the 21st century. What do you want? A very well done CGI Mr. Hyde (voiced by Robbie Coltrane, no less) or some guy in a ripped tuxedo baring his teeth a la Spencer Tracy? Fire up those computers and bring on the CGI! Actually I found the CGI effects quite good for the most part. You want bad CGI, then check out James Bond surfing down a glacier in Die Another Day.So I'll join the minority and say that Van Helsing is well worth watching. Jackman is fine as always and the rest of the cast holds their own. The plot is just fine as well. This is a monster movie, not The Usual Suspects.Pop yourself a big bowl of popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good stuff,"Having watched the film (more than once)i must say that i think that the person who wrote the comment ""A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie"" is being silghtly childish. You cannot watch a film like Van Helsing with out taking it with a pinch of salt - it is a movie with vampires, werewolves and the frankenstine monster in at all at once for goodness sake. So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn't matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit ""off"" in places. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to any one who likes action/fantasy films and is up for a bit of fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Silly but Fun,"Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Were it not for these two gifted performers, this movie would be beyond silly. As it is, the plot is almost pretextual for the special effects.The Eye Candy factor is high, though. Hugh Jackman as the tortured hero, filmed in the dark all of the time, makes us weak in the knees. Kate Beckinsale does magnificent physical feats while squeezed into a corset.The story: Van Helsing (Jackman) is essentially a bounty hunter of supernatural monsters, a job he took on at the request of the church as apparent penitence for sins he cannot even remember. As a reward for his centuries of service, he hopes to make his way to Heaven instead of Hell.Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is the last survivor of a family of Transylvanian vampire hunters. Her brother has become a werewolf and she is conflicted about whether he should live or die.Naturally Anna and Van Helsing team up to rid Transylvania of the evil vampire overlord. Van Helsing has a tool kit Batman would envy, and Anna maintains an arsenal of monster-killing weapons that would make a survivalist proud. Between the two of them, the monsters don't stand a chance.Put your mind on hold, suspend disbelief and intolerance for the occasional leap of reason, enjoy a slightly randy friar (Van Helsing's sidekick), and go along for the ride. Van Helsing is a great Sunday afternoon video.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I saw it twice!,"This movie is very very very good. Screw what the critics say. This movie is very action-packed, in your face, has great effects and it's funny too.The way the brides transform from creepy bat monsters to beautiful women is really cool.And Richard Roxburgh is really cool as Dracula. I almost didn't recognize him as the duke from Moulin Rouge!The only part I didn't really like was Frankenstein's monster. He looked cool, I just didn't like his character. But other than that it's no big deal.Also, Hugh Jackman and Will Kemp are extremely hot in this movie!For all you fans of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, you're gonna love this one!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Silly, lacking in plot, but good fun","It's big, it's dumb, it's cheesy as hell, but I found it to be enormous fun. This was made to be a roller-coaster ride and by that token it should be judged.Actually after the opening pastiche of the Boris Karloff Frankenstein movie, I thought this had the potential to be a 5 star movie. It was very atmospheric and had me hooked. However the film never really captures any sense of magic from there onwards.The main body of the movie does go on a bit, and it could have done with some attempt to create engaging characters. Plot and story are not always necessary for fun movies, but you do need characters with a level of interest to capture the mind, otherwise you tend to find yourself not giving a s**t. I felt Van Helsing did verge into this territory, but for the most part it's so fast paced this doesn't matter so much. The points where it does try to introduce plot are the moments where it really does fail. In fact there is too much going on that is never really explained, and I think it would've been better not to have bothered at all, than use the nonsense Sommers resorts too. For example the attempts at backstory to Van Helsing. Better to have one of those interlude chatty scenes you have in the Indy films, where it establishes he's a dude, rather than the poor attempts at angst and pathos. Really bad was the moment he gets upset over Frankie's Monster. What the hell was that all about?Hmm maybe I took that a bit seriously, but the movie knows what it is, why try be something else. I also thought that that masked ball sequence was a natural conclusion, the eventual finale at the castle felt like an add on, which lacked any real punch.Far better was Van's introduction to Transylvania, with the benefit of some neat angles and panning shots, the crossbow battle with the brides was cool. The coach chase was exciting without being exhilarating, but kept the flow going, so it's a shame some more bad plot gets thrown in, especially when it was involving the underwritten Velkan. That's the film's main problem - overkill of characters, with little space given to any of them to evolve.Finally a word on the CGI. I thought it was very good, especially the morphs that were used. The very first moment Drac starts to turn made me jump a touch, and when the vampires turns into their fanged, contorted state it looked pretty scary to me. The wolfman transformation, with the ripping flesh looked genuinely painful. At this point I was thinking the CGI was genuinely stunning. I'd have preferred the finale if it had just been Van vs Drac though, having CGI characters fight felt uninvolving, and Drac in snarly state was far better than the beast he turns into.This is a movie to genuinely switch of the brain and enjoy. At times there's too much going on and perhaps a bit too much swinging about for my liking, but it's an adrenaline filled ride. I'd probably give it 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Just Camp,"I'm really baffled at the hateful negative response to this film. No it's not Oscar material, it's just good campy fun. If you're a fan of old monster movies, James Bond and Indiana Jones flicks, and over-the-top humor in an action/horror movie, then you get it. I guess if you're looking for a summer action flick that takes itself too seriously, then you're out of luck with this one.I admit that the film runs a little to long, the chemistry between Beckinsale and Jackman leaves something to be desired, and the Frankenstein ""monster"" (though well-intentioned to give a nod to ""Young Frankenstein"") is really annoying. But the entertainment spawning from the hokey fun that ""Van Helsing"" is all about, makes these flaws so forgivable.For me, I'll take the over-acting screaming Brides of Dracula, the silly homages to dozens of classic action and horror movies, the cheesy one-liners, and the not-so-convincing special effects. Isn't that what monster movies are all about?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Helsing is one of those movies that's flawed but offers an entertaining experience,"I recently revisited Van Helsing (2004) on Tubi. The storyline revolves around a renowned monster hunter summoned by the Vatican to Transylvania to address a vampire problem. Accompanied by an apprentice, he encounters a vengeful gypsy woman with a shared target-Dracula. Together, they unite to rid the countryside of the legendary vampire.Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising), the movie features Hugh Jackman (Logan), Kate Beckinsale (Underworld), Richard Roxburgh (Moulin Rouge), David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) and Kevin O'Connor (The Mummy).This is the ""Wild Wild West"" of horror movies. Despite its potential, the film falls short. The Frankenstein opening is well executed, this has an excellent cast and an entertaining selection of monsters. However, excessive CGI, a lame Dracula ambition, and an underwhelming ending hinder its success. The soundtrack is cheesy too, yet strangely, I find always find myself watching this every time it's on.In conclusion, Van Helsing is one of those movies that's flawed but offers an entertaining experience. I'd give this a 5-5.5/10 and still strongly recommend it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Double-O Van Helsing, Superhero","First a word of warning. There are a number of people who would be best advised to avoid Van Helsing. If you dislike cgi, if you're a purist, if you're looking for something ""realistic"", or if you're looking for a slower-moving, understated film that's a deep character study, you'll more than likely hate this film.Set around the turn of the 20th Century, Van Helsing features the titular hero (Hugh Jackman) taking a break from his usual ""monster slayer"" activities, which are commissioned by the Catholic Church, to pursue a grand plot initiated by Dracula (Richard Roxburg) involving the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley), the Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and the two last surviving members of a Transylvanian family that has long been battling the vampire.Van Helsing is a fast-paced, computer graphics-laden horror/adventure/fantasy film wherein Universal re-imagines its core stable of classic horror characters. I actually like cgi, I'm not a purist, I love the genres--I'm not looking for realism, and I love fast-paced action-oriented thrill rides as much if not more than I love character studies.As for the character remakes, Van Helsing becomes a slick retro-Matrix-styled macho action hero, part James Bond/007, part Indiana Jones, part Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a secret Catholic Church order filling in for the Watcher's Council and the Bond ""Q Branch"" combined. Dracula becomes a suave, scheming, mad scientist who looks like a romance novel hero. Frankenstein's Monster becomes much closer to Mary Shelley's depiction of an intelligent, loquacious, tormented, slapdash victim of a misguided doctor. And the Wolf Man, when wolf, becomes a cgi generated over-sized, super-agile, hyperactive beast. That should already turn off all of the purists.The look of the film is lush, with lots of unusual point of view shots, exotic locations and computer-generated environments. CGI is used extensively for the human characters in the film as well as the monsters--it's frequently employed to enable physics defying stunts and amazing, far-ranging ""computer camera"" transitions. Van Helsing provides a good argument for such extensive digital assistance, as many of the visuals would be simply impossible to achieve through any other means and substituting some of the creatures with mechanicals, animatronics, special effects makeup and the like would have caused the film to go far over its already outrageous estimated budget of 160 million.The plot, while not deep on characterization, couldn't be more full of events and action. Combined with the extravagant visuals and quickly changing, sprawling locations, the result is epic in scope. Director/writer Stephen Sommers, who was also responsible for remaking the image of another classic Universal character in The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001) (probably the reason the Mummy is not present in here), begins Van Helsing in a black and white scene that wonderfully recreates the feel of the James Whale-lensed Frankenstein films, including referencing a number of shots, scenes and characters from those classics.After the titles, we move into a color-filled world ala The Wizard of Oz while we're treated to a brief character-establishing scene of Van Helsing battling Mr. Hyde in the bell tower of Notre Dame. Sommers then quickly whisks us away to the Vatican, where Van Helsing receives his orders.This whirlwind beginning can be almost overwhelming--it certainly is visually--and it takes a moment to get up to speed and catch our breath, but once we settle into the town square of Transylvania, we're enraptured by the story and the pacing reaches a more sustainable level. Although fantastical at heart, the performances from the principle cast members help anchor the film in ""reality"". Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Roxburgh, Henley and David Wenham all turn in nuanced performances that imply the depth of character that the film does not have the time to fully explore.The intense action throughout the film combined with the cgi and spectacular sweeping camera moves often gives Van Helsing a feel somewhere between a comic book film and a video game. That fact might turn some viewers off, but as innovative, suspenseful, exciting filmic art, this is years ahead of most other recent releases. In fact, the sophisticated technological wizardry and entrancing epic storytelling is somewhat reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings films, which makes me wonder just what other viewers see in those to enable them to consistently sit high on the IMDb Top 250 list while Van Helsing struggles to attain a slightly above average rating. Perhaps Van Helsing deserves a more tempered first or second viewing from those who have summarily dismissed it due to unjustified expectations/preconceptions. This really is an outstanding film that at least deserves to be appreciated on a technical level, and should be easy enough to enjoy for its action-oriented storytelling prowess as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"It may have been corny, it may have have overused its CGI. But, hell, I loved it anyway!","Yeah, I know this isn't a masterpiece of cinema and I can already tell half this nation's populace hates it despite a good run at the box office last summer. But still I went into this movie just looking for a good time (that and am a huge fan of old school monster films) and thats what I got. For the uptight and so called expert critics, let me spell it out for you: ITS A POPCORN MOVIE! OF COURSE EVERYTHING GOING TO BLOWN UP TO THE MAX AND GO OVER THE TOP! IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS, THEN DON'T CLAIM YOU DO AND BASH A FILM BECAUSE OF IT! *Ahem* alright on to my review.Plot: Helsing and his assistant, a frair named Carl, are sent to Translvaynia to protect the last of a gypsy family from being stuck in purgatory due to a curse Dracula put on them. In the process however Helsing must also stop Drac's plan of engulfing the world in darkness all the while battling his minions. Throw in a plot device involving Frankenstein's monster and you have a pretty cool adventure brewing.I'll admit for a movie that suppose to be about Helsing. They kinda dropped the ball on the story. There's way too much emphasis on the gypsy girl rather him and they don't flesh out his back story about his lost memory and his supposed history with Dracula. Also the movie has a few nonsense parts (the talk with the creepy undertaker) which kinda slows down the film a bit. But still the movie stays on a linear path and the set-ups up to confrontations are well done. Not to mention the confrontation themselves even if some are a little silly (ballroom scene (though a good homage to the Fearless Vampire Killers), the fight with the last bride, Igor and Dracula himself). Yes their CGI laden but I don't care, its a supernatural movie after all. So what better way to do them.The actors seem very comfortable with their roles and looks to be having a great time. Extra props go out to the dude who played Frankenstien's monster, I was really feeling for him. Easily one of the best characters in the movie.Add to that some excellent backdrops and clothes to which the film really draws you into its 19th century world. Yes the movie is full of flaws but it only for fun and only wants to entertain to which it success in spades. If you don't like it, well fine. But for all who love a good popcorn flick or a fan of old school monsters, you can look no further. Van Helsing is just the ticket for a simple good time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but somehow not as great as it should be","'Van Helsing' has always been a bit of an enigma to me. I own it and have watched it every so often and I can never quite put my finger on what exactly is wrong with it. Obviously, I quite like it, but it always leaves me with the feeling that it should have - somehow - been so much better.The film was practically made for me - I love Hugh Jackman and he makes a great 'monster hunter.' Kate Beckinsale is naturally sexy as his kick-a$$ love interest. David Wenham adds some comic relief as Van Helsing and Richard Roxborough is brilliantly campy as Count Dracula. Then there are more monsters crammed into this film than Jabba the Hutt's palace. What more could I want? Um, I don't exactly know, but I'm not alone in my confusion. Van Helsing was supposed to be the start of some sort of action/horror franchise. It was certainly given the budget and star-power to launch such a venture. However, it was - almost - a financial flop. It was sort of successful, but not enough to get a proper sequel (there is a lower budget animated one, but that wasn't the original intention).Perhaps it's the overuse of CGI? Sometimes everything on screen starts to blur into one mass of animation. Perhaps it's that the characters are a little too indestructible to be believable. Seriously... these (supposedly totally human) characters get dropped from great heights again and again and just get up like nothing has happened - a minor gripe, but it always bugged me.If you're a fan of 'old school' horror, i.e. you know about the Dracula/Frankenstein myths then you might like this, because it certainly pays homage to the classics. It has a lot of charm (kudos to Frankenstein's monster and Drac himself), but somehow falls slightly short of being the modern day classic it was meant to be.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The art design is phenomenal, the shots are well placed and excellent use of lighting and color and some of the best horror characters of all time. Yet, the script, acting and special effects are all equally horrible. There are two modes of this film:Standing around over explaining the plot Or engaging in clichéd action sequences with no decent payoff.Don't bother with this title. Or any other Stephen Sommers title for that matter. He has proved to be one of the most inept directors of all time.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Helsing - Homages R Us,"If you're a purist-any kind of purist-stay away from Van Helsing. But if you love the Universal horror films of the 30's and 40's or the Hammer films of the 50's and 60's and don't mind re-imagining them, then go. Check your brain at the door, buy a large popcorn and a soda and sit back for a fun ride.The film is a complete reworking of everything you think you know about all the big guys. Present for your enjoyment are Dracula, the Wolf man, Frankenstein's monster and a guest appearance by Mr. Hyde. And of course, tying the whole thing together is our hero, Van Helsing (yummily played by Hugh Jackman). Named Abraham in Stoker's book but called Gabriel in the film, VH doesn't appear in any book other than Dracula, but in the more than a century since his `birth' we've become accustomed to his presence as the elder statesman of monster killers.Completely re-imagined in this new production, VH is now young, handsome, and virile and apparently as immortal and indestructible as the creatures he chases. Don't expect great resolutions or deep explanations here, there are none. Don't expect Academy Award level acting, some of the actors apparently phoned in their performances while others decided to take up the slack. The resultant scenery chewing is uneven, but never boring. The dialogue, not to put too fine a point on it, is absurd and sometimes unintentionally, howlingly funny.The makers of this film are clearly fans of the genre. The subject matter is treated with a loving sledgehammer. As the film progressed my companion and I made a game of naming all the classics represented. In addition to those you might expect, we were able to recognize allusions to `Young Frankenstein,' `Star Wars,' `Aliens,' `Raiders of the Lost Ark,' `Gremlins,' `Romancing the Stone,' `Lord of the Rings,' `Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' `Twister,' ""Wild, Wild West"" and any James Bond film you care to name among others. If you go, try it yourself.If the producers were intending to frighten us, they failed dismally; but if they only intended to entertain us they succeeded, if not brilliantly, at least admirably. I'm uncertain if they intended quite so much humor, but both my companion and I laughed out loud most of the way through.In addition to inside jokes, the film is filled with extraordinary visual images. From the opening encounter between VH and a startlingly oversized and athletic Edward Hyde, physicality is the order of the day. Everyone, including Van Helsing's friar sidekick is a magnificent specimen. Even Frankenstein's monster (who I nicknamed `Sparky' for the electrical discharges from his partially exposed brain) is hideously beautiful. Also, the cinematography is breathtaking. Both real scenery and CGI imagined are dazzling. I especially loved the castles Dracula and Frankenstein. Both edifices were Mad Ludwig's Neuschwanstein Castle as imagined by Tim Burton. I'd almost say that if the film had no other virtues at all, it would still be worth the price of admission for the incredible beauty of its backgrounds. However, the real star of the film is the (you guessed it) special effects.Transformation scenes abound. At any point in the film you are only moments from watching someone turn into something. And what wonderful things they are. Vampires don't become simple bats, but snake-jawed, full size harpies. The Wolf man sprouts saber tooth fangs as he rips the human skin from his body. Frankenstein's monster's flesh partially peels from his skull and is smoothly pushed back into place and Mr. Hyde morphs from grinning giant menace to pitiful human corpse.Not to put too fine a point on it, everyone-vampires, villagers, heroes, even horses and cattle go airborne sometime during the film. Dracula's three brides take the prize for most hang time. These ladies would be a wonderful asset to the Transylvanian Air Force with their dizzying dives, spins and barrel rolls. The camera gives us a bat's eye view of their deadly aerobatic ballet. When not in full flight Dracula and his wives walk up walls, across ceilings and carry on family quarrels while hanging from the rafters by their toes. Those characters that do not fly on their own power are lifted aloft and usually dropped soon after. The rest are climbers, scrambling up and down castle architecture like houseflies on speed. Interestingly, no one is ever seriously hurt or even has a hairstyle mussed.The scenes shift so rapidly that it becomes difficult at times to follow the story. Fortunately, the gossamer plot is as deep as a kiddie's backyard swimming pool, so it isn't too much of a problem. Only the barest bones are needed to carry us from one action sequence to the next. Although there is no nudity and not a cussword is uttered, the film is violent. Well, of course it's violent--and about as traumatic as a Road Runner cartoon. Still, it earns its PG-13 rating. Leave the little 'uns home. The throbbing, pounding soundtrack keeps the attention even when not very much is happening.Is Van Helsing a great film? No. Absolutely not. Is it a good film? No, not really. Is it entertaining? Yes. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

You want fun?  It's fun,"I think it fairest to watch a movie more in terms of what it means to be, than in terms of what I think it should be.  (For an example of how wrong you can go by violating this, see Roger Ebert's review of The Fellowship of the Ring, which should have been titled ""How I Would Have Shot the Book"" [and thank God he didn't].)But I digress.Stephen Sommers wanted to ramp up the action, the looks, the story, and the plain old zing-bang-pow.

This is a fabulous film with fantastic special effects, good acting, a strong story, and a first rate soundtrack!  Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Gabriel Van Helsing is fantastic, as is Roxburgh's part as Count Dracula.  Van Helsing's search to find Dracula and complete his mission is not only bold daring, but full of great creature moments and awesome action.  David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) does a great job as the comic relief Friar who aids Van Helsing and Anna in their fight against Dracula and the other creatures they face.

Stylish but Cartoonish . Not deep,This is an action adventure horror thriller. Van Helsing is the stylish vampire hunter. Hugh Jackman has very little to do here apart from looking good and saying one-liners. The movie has too much action and a very loud background score. The background score and the yells from the demonic characters get irritating after the point. It does not scare you and the CGI looked very cartoonish to me. It did not look real at all.

Somebody deserves to be staked for this...,"Five minutes into this film I was already squirming in my seat. I've never walked out of a movie before, I think it's foolish to judge a film unless you have seen it in its entirety. Van Helsing almost had me running for the door.

That's no excuse for this pile of poo...""Oooo, you cynical folk are being too hard on it"" I hear some of you deranged individuals cry...The Mummy had the same pitch as this movie, including the use of an old Universal monster.

"Silly, Fun Adventure","Many, many people have seen ""Van Helsing"" and said it is trash, a waste of time, etc, etc. But what they don't understand is that sometimes, with so much happening in the world, people need to let it all go so they can get some thrills from movies.The plot of Van Helsing is somewhere between simple and complex. The back story is that Count Dracula and his three brides have given birth to countless offspring throughout the hundreds of years they've been living as vampires. They themselves were created from the living, but their children were not. They were born of the undead, and have never had the chance to come to life... or the afterlife vampires live. They simply are dead.Then, Dracula comes upon a mad scientist named Dr. Frankenstein, whom wants to discover the secret of creating life. He helps the doctor in his sort-of admirable task of creating life, hoping to use his creation to bring life to his children. But it is not to be. As the film opens, Dr. Frankenstein is killed by Dracula, who no longer needs him, and his monster, whom Dracula needs to give the essence of life to his children, appears to perish in a fire.A year later, Gabriel Van Helsing, a tortured man without a past is sent to Transylvania by the ""Holy Order""... An organization of all of the religions of the world. With the assistance of a trusty sidekick, the still living monster of Frankenstein and a beautiful young woman, he must hunt down and destroy Dracula before he can give life to his thousands of children.The reason I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 is that is never seems to get the recognition it deserves. It has great action, great actors, and a great story. (At least for a summer film) It's not the type of movie to be taken seriously, it's the type to sit down with some friends, have some popcorn, and get ready for a silly, scary, fun ride. I love it!. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An under appreciated movie,I watched this film in cinema when it was first released. I enjoyed it but it wasn't until ten years later when I rewatched it that I thought this is a good Vampire Movie for the time it was made and is very action oriented unlike most vampire movies which are usually slow burners. This movie changed the pace for once and gave the action it promised I would recommend watching this movie to anyone who enjoys Monster movies heavy on the action and low on the dialogue. Sometimes it's nice to watch a movie and not think for a while so enjoy.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ahhh...the summer is here peeps, turn off your brain and enjoy!","I'll begin with the good things about the movie. ... ...Okay now to the bad. Where could i begin? You have a movie with three of the greatest monsters ever created and things some how go horribly wrong. If i may for a moment say that this movie should've been Castlevania the movie but i'm extremely glad it wasn't as it would've been an insult to the series of video games which had deeper, stronger plots than this thing. Its obnoxiously loud, makes no effort for a little character development and makes some horrible use of the aforementioned monsters, including some sorry excuses for CG. Luckily for Mr. Jackman that he has the XMen franchise to live off of and lucky for Kate Beckinsale that she is a hottie because neither of these two have offered much of anything else in any of their other movies and offer even less in this one(what is up with that accent Kate?). Van Helsing makes quick work of getting its characters into situations where they look cool and say cool things. Unfortunately they end up not looking so cool and saying things that are irritating. Its as if the characters know they are in a movie and know that they can't be stopped because the script says so!I'll finish off with this last thing. I subject myself to all kinds of movies. I enjoy great, timeless dramas as much as do dumb summer fair so its not as if i'm a pretentious film student who can't turn off the brain and enjoy some eye candy. There is room for all kinds of films in my mind and neither is more or less important. Anywho, I DO NOT walk out of a movie for any reason, not even to pee. I'm there, i'm giving two hours of my time for the movie. This is my philosophy and for 20 plus years of movie watching i've NEVER once walked out. For Van Helsing i not only took a trip to the bathroom but i went for a cigarette too! I could care less about what was happening which is a sign that not one character was interesting. Not one character seemed genuine nor interesting. So welcome in the summer crop of Hollywood crap with open arms and blank stares, its going to be one long summer movie season!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ghoulies,"It starts off at the end of the 19th century and there's a reference to Wellington at Waterloo, but it feels like it comes from a much older period. Apart from that it's a really enjoyable film. It incorporates all of the ghouls and monsters of traditional Hammer Horror in a tongue in cheek 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' way.The cast are very good. David Wenham is a very underrated and diverse actor and he really proves that here. I was also quite surprised by the fantastic performance by Richard Roxborough as Dracula. Hugh is as always superb and so God damned handsome.It's corny and cheesey, but done in a comic book style that makes it easily accessible and in some ways suitable for kids. There is after all a lot of culture here as well as the horror elements, besides a few nightmares will build character.The CGI is a few levels above 'Neville Longbottom on the broom' but still not what we are now used to in these more recent years.It's a shame that they canned the idea of making sequels as I really think that it had legs. I will have to watch the TV series instead.738.75/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
People expect WAAAAY too much from this kind of movie.,"Van Helsing is a fun action/adventure flick which pays homage to the Universal horror films while still aiming to be an entirely different movie. At what it's trying to do, it largely succeeds; with good action scenes, likeable main characters, tons of classic film references, and a Dracula who is basically an over-the-top version of Bela Lugosi (though played with enough charisma to make it work).What it does not try to do is be a remake of any of these classic horrors, or to be anything other than an action movie. Therefore, to use these more serious titles as a yardstick for this film is absurd.The two biggest flaws are the CGI, which does look fake in places, and the acting, which includes some wooden moments from Jackman as well as a lot of overacting from everyone else. That being said, the over-the-top nature of the story helps stop these elements from feeling out of place.In my opinion, it's a film which has held up well, and which makes for a good watch around Halloween. Especially if you've already had your fill of slasher movies and are now in the mood for something light-hearted.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Over the top, Dumb Fun, Awful and Entertaining","For every twelve things this movie does poorly there is three or four things it does really well. Fast paced and full of silly plot devices and cliches. Moves at such a fast pace that you only have time to laugh at the silly plot devices. If you enjoyed Victor Frankenstein (2015) or the 40's Universal Dracula/Frankenstein/Wolfman mashups or even the lesser Hammer Gothic horrors, you will find something here to like. Imagine any of those but pumped up on early 2000's CGI crowding the screen with non-stop movement. It's cheesy, it's filled with bad to repulsively trashy dialogue and with a few fun twists.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Completely Derivative,"This movie was absolutely awful. When Hollywood is set to invest 160 million dollars in a project one would imagine some small fraction of that would be spent on a decent script....evidently not. Everthing...the look, characters, and plot points of this film are lifted from other, better movies. The director seemed to feel that no exposition was necessary, we would all go along with whatever preposterous premise he chose to splash on screen. So the fact that Van Helsing is part of a secret organization headquartered at the Vatican which employs Buddhist monks and Muslim mullahs didn't need any explaining, it passes by with barely a mention so that we can get to the next chase scene. It all went down hill from there. YAWN!!!I left the theater feeling I had been duped by the Hollywood spin machine into spending my hard-earned money on drivel.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very cheesy and corny but fun and entertaining ride.,"I guess this movie could be considered a guilty pleasure as it is very cheesy and goofy but it honestly is a fun popcorn movie. While nowhere near as solid of a picture as The Mummy (1999), Stephen Sommers does deliver another original action packed adventure set in the world inspired by classic universal monster movies. The world/lore of the film is too large to be explored in just 1 movie, which does lead to the film feeling bloated in ideas, though it does not lack in imagination. Hugh Jackman delivers as a cool action hero version of Van Helsing, though the character's writing does lack the charm that Brendon Fraser had in The Mummy. Richard Roxburgh sines as an alluring Dracula, displaying charm, sadness and menace all while playing it up for an action film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Jane Austen's ""Destroy All Monsters!""","This film is a brilliant and psychologically complex treatise on Victorian era social mores as seen through the eyes of Van Helsing, a rapscallion character who overcomes his impoverished beginnings to climb the social ladder and eventually reach the pinnacle of high society. It's his cockeyed optimism that allows him to go from rags to riches with an almost Dickensian charm, but in classic irony normally suited for Shakespearan tragedy it is also that very trait the leads him on a path to danger and horror. There's also brilliant social satire as seen through the colorful characters from Transylvania, who bring both shock and scathing black humor in their representation of the nomadic, exotic outsiders than so many proper Victorians feared would infiltrate and poison their gilded society.Just kidding, of course. ""Van Helsing"" is wall to wall special effects and hammy acting dancing across poorly lit set designs. Classic movie buffs are turned off in the first few minutes with the over-the-top alleged ""homage"" to the black and white Universal horror flicks. The plot is arbitrary and pointless, though with so much going on and Kate Beckinsale in tight corsets, I suppose this does have some entertainment value for ten year-old boys. I watched this one rainy Saturday afternoon and left twice to clean my bathroom and mop my kitchen floor, and I didn't miss a thing.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as bad as they say ...,"Partly because I'd heard in so many reviews that this movie was awful, and party just because it was one of the biggest flops of the year, I didn't have very high expectations of this one. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so damn much.This movie follows the story of Doctor Gabriel Van Helsing, who we all know from Bram Stoker's Dracula as an ageing professor who takes on the evil count. Here, however, he is a young and handsome demon hunter / acrobatics expert with an array of cool weapons. In the opening scene of the movie we see Doctor Frankenstein, under the supervision of Dracula, bringing his monster to life while the torch-wielding peasants are already storming his castle. Meanwhile, Van Helsing takes on Mr Hyde in the Notre Dame Cathedral. These scenes pretty much set the tone of the whole thing. The plot has absolutely no internal consistency, but when the film looks this good, how much does it really matter? ... yes, it's stupid, but if you can get in the right frame of mind it can also be a lot of fun.The acting unfortunately isn't that great ... Hugh Jackman isn't really given a whole lot to work with as far as his Van Helsing character is concerned, and for the most part he simply gives his 'Wolverine' performance all over again, especially towards the end. Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress and has the perfect face for Gothic horror, as best shown in Underworld, but here with her silly Transylvanian accent and looking like Catherine Zeta Jones, it just doesn't work. Probably the most memorable performance comes from David 'Faramir' Wenham, who provides most of the comic relief as Van Helsing's bible-bashing sidekick.In terms of special effects it's pretty amazing -- this movie did, after all, have a ludicrous amount of money thrown at it ($160 million), but perhaps relying so heavily on CGI was a mistake. Many directors have said that if an effect can be achieved physically, often that's the best route to take. And here, the computer-generated stuff is at times very distracting as rather than being involved in the plot you're sitting there thinking, ""Oo, doesn't that creature look good?"" The soundtrack is also very cool (even the bits stolen from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"").It's unfortunate that this wasn't the box-office hit it was clearly intended to be, but if you're in the mood for a big, stupid, fun action movie that makes no sense and has absolutely no point to it, this one is as good as any.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Silly garbage,"If you have extra 9 euros and 2.15 hours to spend and can't think of anything else to do, give the money to a next person passing by. That way you can at least do something useful with your time...This film includes a horse carriage that catches fire from contact with werewolf and explodes on collision!It's totally mindless mix of classic horror characters brought alive with CGI action that defies all physics and physiology. It's supposed to be a horror film but at least to me it was a comedy, of the unintentional kind.  If you go see it, you get the most out of it by trying to catch all references to other movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very fun!,"Van Helsing (2004) is fun and pretty well made in different aspects. It has good acting throughout by all the actors, especially by Beckinsale and Jackman. Kate Beckinsale really is a great choice for the role she fulfills, she has the correct physical look/appearance, and she fits in all the other ways as well, good cast call. Hugh Jackman is obviously playing the main character here, Van helsing. Hugh also gives a fine performance, and he also physically fits the role, he's very stoic at times but then heartfelt at times when he needs to be, and he's strong/muscular, which of course is necessary with all the action scenes and maneuvers he must perform. Speaking of action scenes, the special effects and the actual fighting in this movie is all very well done, and I don't mean to say that it's the best thing in any action movie you'll see, but it suffices. I also really like the way they did Dracula's wives, seductive and menacing at the same time, which of course is the way Dracula's wives are supposed to be. I thought the plot was entertaining and I thought it was executed well. So all in all Van Helsing receives a seven out of 10 as far as quality goes.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I liked it!,"Hello everyone..Ya know, I had one of those weeks at my job...the kind where it was 'do or die' and no matter how hard you would try...you knew when the lay-off slip comes along it would be you?Well, it wasn't me and I was over reacting. Like I feel many (not all!)who are writing adversely about this film is doing.You see, after a week like that, I needed something to take my mind off that world. To relax, to unwind, to enjoy. I got to see Van Helsing and it did the trick. I laughed, I was entertained, I forgot about the seriousness of the world and enjoyed mindless, fun entertainment for a few hours. Does anybody know how rare that is these days? Some folks wish to be a ""shock-jock"" type of critic or seem to want to look for so much in nothing -- and sometimes, you just need to let your mind go, have an imagination and be open. Van Helsing is not a Documentary, it's not an independent film, its not an art house film. This is one of those films that just wants you to have a good time.I liked this film very much, I liked the CGI - to a point (okay, I'm a fan of Lon Chaney and Lon Chaney Jr.) and I liked Hugh. I've enjoyed Kevin O'Connor of late and knew that was him as Igor..well, he had the best line in the film that just cracked me up. The ""brides"" made ALL the guys from 15 to 21 get REALLY interested in the film...as did the character Anna. (Isn't that what it's about these days?!) And the Monk..well..let me just say, bravo to the actor for making a ""departure"" from his last known famous role. He did well. And it was kinda..nice..seeing the old Universal creatures on screen in THIS the new millenium, even though I loved them better in the old films, but WHO is looking at the old films? Well, this is one of those movies that may MAKE newer moviegoers do that. At least, I hope so.Entertaining, fun, visually interesting. Was worth my matinee money.  For those who want more ""seriousness"" in their plots, please go to an art house film. (But it's my guess that those who have something to say against this film, wouldn't be caught dead going into an art house to see a 'serious' film.)So lighten up.

how bad can one movie be,"the answer is...this bad.  i have never seen a more disappointing movie in my entire life.

Quite impressive...,"I remember when writer and director Stephen Sommers unleashed the movie ""Van Helsing"" upon the world back in 2004, and I have to say that I was blown away by this movie. It was such an action packed and grand adventure that just brought together a handful of the iconic screen monsters in a very enjoyable movie.And I have sat down to watch ""Van Helsing"" a couple of times since 2004, and the movie continues to be every bit as enjoyable with each viewing as it was previously. So writer and director Stephen Sommers definitely hit the nail on the head with this movie.The storyline is well written and immediately draws in the audience, taking them on a fast-paced adventure. There is a lot to take in throughout the movie, and thus ""Van Helsing"" can be seen numerous times, as each time brings something new out into the light. A great accomplishment for writer and director Stephen Sommers.The cast ensemble in ""Van Helsing"" is great, with the likes of Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and Richard Roxburgh in the leading roles. The movie also have some nice appearances and performances by the likes of Shuler Hensley, David Wenham, Kevin J. O'Connor, Alun Armstrong, Josie Maran, Elena Anaya and
Silvia Colloca.For a horror fan such as myself, then ""Van Helsing"" is quite the treat, as it takes a lot of iconic horror characters and put them together in the same storyline. I mean, you have the likes of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dracula, werewolves and Frankenstein's monster all together in the same movie. So what it there not to like?Visually then ""Van Helsing"" is every bit as impressive and enjoyable as it was back in 2004. The CGI effects still hold their own, even now 18 years later. And the visual effects in ""Van Helsing"" add so much flavor to the movie, that I will actually say that the movie is well-worth watching for the special effects alone.If you haven't already seen ""Van Helsing"", then you most certainly should do so, should you be presented with the opportunity to watch it. This is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie. This is a movie that I return to watch every now and again, and it every bit as enjoy and entertaining each time.My rating of ""Van Helsing"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Name Helsing, Van Helsing","This is a cinematic run through all the Universal Monsters, with a very, very thin story, but a lot - probably too much - action. Is this a horror movie? Well, definitely not. This is a dinamic romp, winking at the best action movies ever made, with a lead character who is a mix of Indiana Jones and James Bond (mostly the latter), and we have a very good looking (can I say gorgeous?) heroine, a classic villain who as usual steal the scene with the better jokes of the movie, and a bunch of other characters, that are as usual thin as paper but normally fun or really beautiful (the vampire brides are as usual very beatiful). In this respect the movie is good, probably only a little too long and too similar to a comic book adaptation (but it is better than the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).

One of the worst movies made by a major Hollywood studio I have ever seen...,"... and I qualify that because of course there are worse films out there, but they were often made by poverty row studios with no budget. Universal Studios is not poverty row.Why did I give it three stars? Because effects and cinematography have to count for something, and that this film has in spades. But in the plot and direction departments, this thing is one ugly mess. Van Helsing is the legendary vampire hunter, often ably played by Peter Cushing over at Hammer studios back in the 50s and 60s. Here you have another fine actor, underrated Hugh Jackman, playing Van Helsing, but you'd never get that by what goes on here.So Universal drags out every legendary horror character in their catalog - not just Dracula, who actually IS a vampire. They manage to incorporate the Frankenstein monster and The Werewolf too. Bring in the mummy, the invisible man, and the creature from the black lagoon and the gang would all be here. There really is no plot to speak of, just lots of flying female vamps so you can get some gratuitous nudity in, and then there is a plot line installed to lampoon Jackman's role as Wolverine over at Marvel.The bottom line - there must be something better you can do with your time. If not, then you need either a hobby or a job.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
People sometimes miss the point,"I personally love this kind of tongue-in-cheek, change of the usual film. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was that, as was Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. If people looked at them more as just visually entertaining with a bunch of sharp one-liners, and tried to stop making them the next big action movie, or trying to read a life change message somewhere in there, they'd have more fun! I loved the real mix of actors appearing in this movie - I was straight to IMDb after watching it to see if I was right or wrong about who played who. I especially liked the straight-in beginning - no credit break to kill the run of the film. The black-and-white beginning, going to colour soon after, was not new, but echoed nicely with the old Hollywood movies that the start was echoing. Altogether, a great fun watch. But that's just me!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not that worse,"It wasn't that worse like many wrote. It was a typical Steven Sommers film. A lot of FX, many action, nice beauties trying to act and a more or less acceptable story line. I think, the worst thing was the syncro into german, or some silly dialogues. But, there were also some good things to mention: The end was surprisingly, the characters are interesting and overall it was a good pop-corn-movie but only a second class film. I was a little bit disappointed about some silly parts, especially the questions ""Why Count Dracula tried to get children?"" or ""Why only the Wolf Man can kill the Count?"" or even why the story of Van Helsing's past hasn't been answered completely. Perhaps, there will be some answers in a sequel?...It has failed to be as good as ""The Mummy"" (my quote: 8/10), but it wasn't really disappointing.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not camp enough unfortunately,"I've seen some comments on this film suggesting that it has been misunderstood because, really, it's just a camp, cult film. The problem I have with it, is that if that was the intention, it fails because it's just not camp enough, and if that wasn't the intention, it fails because it's dire. Camp dire is fine. Just plain dire isn't. If I was Bram Stoker, I'd be suing from beyond the grave.Now I loved director Stephen Sommers ""Mummy"" movies, especially the first one, which was lots of fun, I really like fine actors Hugh Jackman, Richard Roxburgh (wonderfully camp in Moulin Rouge) and David Wenham and I was fairly open minded about Kate Beckinsale as I'd hardly seen her in anything before, so I sat down to watch this movie (on pay per view at home) perfectly willing to be entertained. I rarely watch a movie about which I can find nothing good to say, but this was one of those rarities. From the incoherent script, to the confused plot, to the ear splitting sound track, to the overuse and abuse of CGI, to the tacky Brides of Frankenstein (or whatever those girlies were supposed to be. When it comes to scantily clad women, erotic is good, tacky isn't), to Kate Beckinsale's silly costume, to the revolting peasants, the entire thing was such a mess. I think it just proves again that the quality of a movie bears little relation to how much money you throw at it, and that there is really no substitute for a decent script.I'm not averse to special effects movies. Try and imagine films like, say, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, or Star Trek: First Contact or last year's War of the Worlds, without special effects. Doesn't really work, does it? And those are all movies I loved, because the effects are used to enhance the story, to tell it better. But what you have at the core of those films, is a good exciting story, well written, and with characters you care about.Who cares about any of these guys? Van Helsing fails mostly because it substitutes special effects for character and story, and then tries to take itself seriously. It's quite a cynical film, hoping to find an audience dumb enough to lap it up.I'm still trying to imagine what good actors like Jackman and Wenham were doing in this? Maybe it was one of those movies that's much more fun to make than to watch, I'm sure they had a blast in Prague, or where ever it was, and earned enough to pay the mortgage for a few months. I'm also well aware that as a middle aged woman I'm probably not the target audience for Van Helsing. So it really only remains to say that I sat down to watch it with my two teenage kids, one of each sex. They hated it too, and gave up watching long before I did. When a movie is so bad that my teenage son would rather do his homework than watch - that's bad!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Non-stop homage to the classics,"The kind of film I normally avoid. Being a connoisseur of the old Universal films of the 30s and early 40s, I refused to watch it out of loyalty for the franchise that Lugosi and Karloff and Chaney created. Then I happened to watch the opening scene. This movie has no plot that could engage anyone with half a brain, mixes up lore and myth (when I go to the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris I expect to see Quasimodo, not Mr.Hyde of Edinburgh, especially as the former is at least Universal property), smothers everything in cgi, throws in one lame plot device after another to extricate itself from the holes it digs for itself etc etc etc. and yet... for someone 13 and under it is the kind of movie to be seen over and over again. Kind o like the originals (it's hard to defend the integrity of films such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman after all). Not one dull moment, some wonderful characterisations of old classics (I particularly enjoyed that of Dracula), a great soundtrack and some loving attentions of detail that stand out amidst the sloppy and lazy areas such as when a piece of paper obtained centuries earlier still has the exact same shape and hue as the outlying wall from which it was removed). The atmosphere too evokes something out of Karl Freund. www.lairdkeir.spaces.live.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An interesting foray into Universal's past,"It's been obvious over the past few years that Hollywood is lacking imagination. There have been more sequels, prequels, remakes and recycling of characters and stories in the past 5 years than I care to admit to watching. Though there are always good and bad, this one falls in the grey area, leaning towards the good.Van Helsing has been played by many a character but I like this one the best. The movie is chalk full of great animation, fantastic action sequences and some of the best costumes I've seen in a little while. Though the story is a familiar one, this ""version"" does a good job of introducing a new generation to an old classic.Though I would have liked to see less ""monsters"" in this movie (what will they work with next? Not too many left from Universal's old vault)it still managed to keep me interested through. I do think that this is a little on the long side and at one point I wondered when they were going to get on with the story. The story itself is nothing new though some of the ""new"" details were interesting. An entertaining flick, this may be too much for those of us who watched some of these originals but it is a great intro for a new generation of movie watchers. Surprisingly, I found this very enjoyable and well worth my hard earned money.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I compare all horrible movies to this one.,"Quite possibly this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Sometimes I'll see very bad movies and I'll say to my friends, ""It was almost worse than Van Helsing,"" and they get the hint. I actually saw this in theatres thanks to a friend of mine, and at some points the entire audience would burst out in laughter at parts that weren't supposed to be funny. I personally left the movie before the end because I was so bored. The plot and blending of different stories together just doesn't do it. I actually hated it and found myself in an awful mood the rest of the day. Trust me on this one as someone who loves movies, don't waste part of your life watching this film.

Rip roaring homage to classics,"This is a very ""Stephen Sommers"" film, were you not to know it is the same director as the Mummy you would guess it within 20 minutes. However it should be pointed out that this is not a bad thing at all. The movie is a rip roaring adventure with some wonderful camp humour and great special effects. The plot consists of Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) being part of a special order of the Vatican to kill all unhuman / evil creatures, so amazingly he is sent of to Transylvania where he is to kill Dracula, the sub plot being that Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) is the last in the line of a family who's mission for centuries has been to kill Dracula themselves. If Anna dies before Dracula, being the last in the line will condemn the whole family to eternal damnation.While the plot isn't the strongest in the world, it actually doesn't make any difference as the special effects and incredible pace of the film doesn't really give you much chance to contemplate any deeper meanings or plotlines.The poster campaign has featured heavily on this film containing Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's monster, though there are other wonderful classic characters which make the film an even bigger joy to watch for example Igor and Dr Jekyll with the former character becoming a wonderful stereotype of the hunchbacked laboratory assistant.Strangely, the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale doesn't have the same spark or passion as Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in the Mummy saga, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the two characters are not the typical leading man and lady who will obviously fall in love, which again gives this film quite a refreshing edge.David Wenham as Carl, a friar sent to look after Van Helsing gives the comedy edge with wonderful one liners and a constant cheeky glint in his eye.The monsters themselves are a perfect homage to Hammer Horror / Boris Karloff films although I personally found Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) a little bit too camp and less evil although his character was certainly a more evil Dracula than has been seen recently. His 3 brides are possible the surprise highlight of the film turning from beautiful women to gargoyle-like creatures in a split second are a joy to watch in every sense of the word.The wolfman metamorphosis is (as has been reported) an incredible piece of special effects, with the victim tearing off his skin to reveal fur and vice versa throughout the change. But the important thing here is the word victim! Stephen Sommers has kept very close to the original stories portraying the wolfman as a helpless victim ""it's not his fault, he can't help it"" and this is no truer than in the excellent portrayal of Frankensteins Monster (Shuler Hensley) who as written by Mary Shelley is not an evil creature out for destruction, but more a lost soul out simply to be able to exist.My only complaint would be that some of the CGI effects take over. While Sommers has obviously learnt from the travesty that was the CGI Scorpion King, there are times when characters are swinging from walls and ropes that you feel you are watching an animation rather than a live film. However, because these effects are also extremely well done, it is more of a criticism on the viewer who has obviously been spoilt with such effects recently.The pastiges of this film are truly a joy, with references to James Bond (in a highly enjoyable scene about selecting weapons), X-men, Matrix, Aliens, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Rocky Horror and countless other more obvious Horror classics.Hugh Jackman (finally deserving his first lead role) is incredible and this role shows what a fantastic (and without doubt one of Hollywoods hunkiest) actors he is. This is truly his film and deservedly so, not that he ever wasn't in my eyes, but this film has now made him one of the industries hottest property!This is an adventure of a film which all ages will enjoy and I highly recommend it, there isn't time to find fault as the pace will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Every horror fan's dream come true!,"Don't believe the bad reviews of this film. It is excellent. It has all the right material and it really does well with it. In the end it all works out. The CGI are probably the best I have seen in any movie. The Van Helsinger character is everything the Batman movie should have been. He is The Dark Knight par excellence. He is the Indiana Jones of the 19th century. This movie is about as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and far better than the other Indiana Jones movies. It is really great to see Dracula, Dr.Frankenstein, Frankenstein's monster, the Wolfman and Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde in one movie. It is like an edition of ""Leauge of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" with a special eye for horror. Maybe the action becomes a bit too much sometimes but the young Van Helsing is an action character as opposed to the older who is more scientifically minded. Anyway, the bad reviews are given by people who don't appreciate horror. Don't believe it. This is the dream of every horror fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly awful,"This is the first time I have ever been tempted to walk out of a movie within the first five minutes, but since I paid 11 bucks for it, I figured I would stick it out. Hugh Jackman was miscast, and Kate Beckinsale looked great but her accent was horrible. Richard Roxburgh (as Count Dracula) was actually pretty good. He was the only one who really looked like he was having fun as he chewed the scenery. Unfortunately, he was the only one who took this route for his performance. The comedy was stale, the action was cookie-cutter, and the plot was uninteresting. I felt like this movie didn't know what it wanted to be. I think it could have been a pretty decent, campy, fun film, but instead, it just takes itself way too seriously and ends up scoring extremely high on the unintentional comedy scale as a result.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Either too much romance for a horror/action movie, or too much horror for a romantic film.","Van Helsing is a great movie for horror/action buffs.  The special effects are top notch, and the storyline is easy to become immersed in.  Will Kemp's acting seemed over-dramatic in some scenes, but his role was integral to the plot.  Richard Roxburgh does a great job in his role as Dracula, making the Count an easy character to hate.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale shine in their roles.  However, the gratuitous romance scenes seemed out of place. The cast of characters (monsters) are well though out, and mesh with the story well.  Some comedy is thrown in, but not too much - just enough to get a chuckle every so often. The end leaves something to be desired in my opinion, but this is definitely a movie worth watching!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Garish, loud, silly....and a lot of fun.","I have never been a fan of the brainless summer film.  That isn't to say that summer film's are, as a rule, brainless.  Over the past few years we've been treated to some very well-written, thoughtful popcorn movies during the summer movie season and this year promises some of wonderful potential. However, movies like ""Armageddon"", ""The Mummy Returns"" and ""Mission: Impossible 2"" have left me cold and looking for the exit sign.  I willingly admit that ""Van Helsing"" shares far more in common with these movies than it does the more intelligent summer films, but for some bizarre reason, I found myself smiling a lot during the film.  Yes, it's obnoxiously loud.  Yes, there are plot holes you could drive a semi through.  Yes, the acting ranged from O.K. to MST3K atrociousness.  But the sets are fantastic, the atmosphere inviting and...darn it all...the bad stuff was entertainingly bad.  In fact, it seemed intentional.  The thick-as-pine-sap accents were completely in keeping with the goofy tone that underlines the entire movie. The jokes are broad and the pace is brisk.  The deliberate stagey nature of the movie is obviously in homage to the old horror films that inspired it. It may not be as smart as they were, but it doesn't want to be.  This may be the best brainless summer film I've ever seen.  Most likely because it has no intention of even trying to be anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sommers oversteps his boundaries,"Van Helsing is called upon by the Vatican to kill Count Dracula. Along the way he meets Frankenstein's monster and other assorted critters in a big old homage to every single ""Monster A"" meets ""Monster B"" movie ever made.The problem is, when the wolfman met the mummy, it was a B-movie back then and it's a B-movie now. Add to that the fact that Stephen Sommers is not a very good director and an even worse writer and what you have is a story that would struggle to make it as a comic book much less as a feature-length movie.All throughout this misadventure into stupidity, Sommers tries to imbue his characters with personality and the story with some meaning. He fails on both counts. He wants to entertain us (I'm assuming) but instead winds up wasting about two hours of our time.Hugh Jackman does his best, but every line he is given is such a clunker that no matter how much you want to like him or his character, you just can't. Kate Beckinsale once again proves why she should never be allowed in front of a camera - every time she lays that horrible accent on us, you just want Dracula to rip her throat open so we can be done with her.Except that if he did, she'd turn into one of those hideous CGI critters that someone, somewhere mistakenly thought would be a good idea.This movie is a convoluted, idiotic mess designed to sell toys and rip our movie-going dollars from our pockets. Don't waste your time.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"There's some fun to be had, but most of it's buried in this mess.","* 1/2 out of ****The first fifteen minutes of Van Helsing are promising: a black-and-white prologue depicting mad scientist Frankenstein and his monstrous creation is a nice little homage to the Universal Pictures of past times. It's nicely juxtaposed with the movie's opening action sequence, an exhilarating battle between the titular Van Helsing and the evil Mr. Hyde (a silly special effect, but used well in this opening scene), with plenty of over-the-top stunts that are thrilling to watch.But most of the rest of the film is a complete and utter mess, so much that I wouldn't be surprised if the movie saw an afterlife as a cult classic of sorts. Truth be told, I sort of admire the movie's outrageousness and I honestly can't bring myself to totally hate it, but I sure as hell can't say I liked it, either.Hugh Jackman stars as Van Helsing, the Vatican Church's assassin of evil creatures. A clumsy monologue between Van Helsing and one of the priests serves as exposition, though you would think this conversation is one they would have had a long time ago (yeah, I understand it's to bring the audience up to speed but there are less idiotic ways of doing it). We're also introduced to a secret hideout under the Church with an arsenal of weaponry and inventions.Van Helsing's latest assignment is to head to Transylvania and help the remaining Valerious family (pretty much just Kate Beckinsale) kill the vampire Dracula, who if not vanquished, will somehow prevent the Valerious clan from entering Heaven. Van Helsing's also got another incentive for going: there's an insignia on a paper from Transylvania that looks a lot like the symbol on his ring. You see, he has no memory of his past, except lots of nightmares involving ancient wars he couldn't possibly have been part of (this, too, is clumsily introduced and is something that one would think he would have mentioned long ago). For this mission, Van Helsing brings along friar Carl (David Wenham), a milquetoast inventor but nonetheless faithful companion. Along with Anna (Beckinsale), they set out to end Dracula's reign of terror before he can finish with a plan that could bring to life thousands of his offspring.Beckinsale's introductory scene is also pretty cool (and also very silly), with lots of slow-mo, as she helps her brother fight off a Dracula-controlled werewolf. It's also a decent action sequence in its own right. Soon afterward, Van Helsing's arrival leads to yet another battle scene, this time between the Anna's townspeople and Dracula's sexy brides. This, too, is another passably enjoyable sequence, if also a little overdrawn.Come to think of it, most of the action scenes in this movie are passably competent, but not much more. I did like the coach chase, and I enjoyed almost every scene involving flying vampires (so long as they're not of the baby bat variety). But after a while, it's just overkill, particularly the insane climax, where we actually witness Frankenstein swinging around on rope and accidentally knocking over not one but two villains who are about to kill our heroes on two separate occasions. The baby vampires are also ridiculously lame, and a possibly exciting action sequence set inside an elaborate masquerade conveniently ends very quickly with the use of a ""grenade"" (think Blade II).The performances are about what I expected, overdone but fitting. Matter of fact, despite some initially annoying turns catching me off-guard (David Wenham's Carl, for instance), most of the leads actually kind of grew on me after a while. That said, Jackman is a tad bland, surprising when you consider what a charismatic actor he normally is. The gorgeous Beckinsale is fine in her role, even if her cringe-inducing accent isn't. Wenham scores some laughs as Carl, none more effective than a scene where after he's saved a hot chick who asks how she can repay him, he answers with a ""naughty"" request. Richard Roxburgh is quite amusing as Dracula, hamming it up in every possible moment and proving quite enjoyable to watch. Kevin J. O'Connor also delivers a few good laughs as Igor, I especially loved his response to why he keeps torturing the werewolf.But there's only so much fun performances can do to keep such a poorly crafted and written film afloat. Lots of questions go unanswered; why would Frankenstein the monster show any feelings for his master when you consider the fact he never even speaks to him (the movie opens with the scientist proclaiming ""it's alive!"", then is killed by Drac less than five minutes later, hardly enough time for Frank and the monster to bond)? Why has the Vatican waited so long to send Van Helsing to kill Dracula when considering he's presumably had many assignments beforehand? Why does Van Helsing bring along Carl for this mission? Why does that creepy, white-haired Transylvanian guy stay out in the middle of night when there are vampires and werewolves lurking about? How exactly does Dracula maintain control over his werewolves and why exactly does he even need them? Why is the werewolf antidote confined in such an elaborate manner when it proves to be something Dracula would hypothetically need to take hold of in quick fashion?A few of these questions might actually have been answered but with all the indecipherable accents and loud score and soundtrack, I couldn't tell you. The foley guys must have had a field day cranking up every sound threefold, and Alan Silvestri's overwrought score has this distracting tex-mex style twang in the background. The story, in general, is convoluted, but put together with so little coherency that every time an action sequence pops up, its random appearance is more disjointed than thrilling.The CGI is extremely overwhelming, but instead of creating a visually atmospheric and engulfing environment, it's a goofy example of extreme overload. F/X shots are inserted with little care to their effectiveness, and the film is packed with obvious and annoying CGI stunts. It's actually almost as bad as LXG in this regard, but is at least not nearly as bloated (from a running time POV) and visually plain as Pirates of the Caribbean (which gave us little more than underused CGI skeletons and a lot of plain-looking islands and warships).The movie's super-cheesy final scenes lead me to wonder if Sommers was on crack when he included those last few f/x shots. I hate to say it, but he's now almost on the same level of George Lucas when it comes to pasting together plot, action, and special effects. Hard to believe this is the same guy who gave us the terrifically entertaining The Mummy, but with every successive film, he's actually going further and further away from what made his first blockbuster such a joy",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautifully scary childhood memories,"Vampires, werewolves and other bloodthirsty nocturnal creatures have been on our plate for a long time now but it's not easy for them to become boring as everyone wants to give its own touch to the monsters. So here comes yet another attempt to charm the world with noire adventures of spectacular hunter of supernatural, the owner of the best fells of hair of 2004 - Mr. Van Helsing.Stepping on ice you hope to make a safe but thrilling journey to the other bank, however, within a few steps a cracking sound widens through the silence and you slump under the layer of refreshing and incredible story. The chills are spreading further as Alan Silvestri's score kicks in and expedition to 1887 becomes a sole point of your attention for the next couple of hours.
The tones are dark, cold and bearing a constant brand of terror, which is sustained with amazing attention to the details: you are surrounded with so many tiny as well as enormous XIX century items that sliding glance from the screen raises an out-of-time bewilderment. From time to time you are treated with a ""drive by"" jokes that are fast, make you grin and don't distract you from the taken direction of search for the fear.Concentrating the attention on the characters I cannot forget all those outlandish accents, which didn't put the feeling of Transylvanian welcome. Disregarding this, you get the whole family of monsters and some unexpected appearances with a neat look. I am just obliged to say that here the werewolves blow my mind with their vigor, slimness and those sexy pointy ears: the best portrayal that I've ever seen.Arriving to the conclusion I am really impressed by the journey, wishing the continuation of the feast.

There are elements of an Indiana Jones battles Dracula vibe, but not plotwise.  There weren't many slow parts as the action seemed to role right along with the story without seeming forced.

"Spectacular Adventure With Frankenstein, Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Werewolves... and Van Helsing - A Must-See Movie","In 1887, Van Helsing is in Paris chasing Mr. Hyde. After eliminating him, Van Helsing goes to Rome, where he receives a new assignment from the Vatican: to help Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp), the last members of a catholic family, to fight against Dracula. With the company of the monk Carl (David Wenham), they go to Transilvania, where they fight, together with Anna and Frankenstein, against Dracula, his three brides and a werewolf. This movie is a spectacular adventure. I participated of a promotion in a Brazilian cable television (Telecine) and I won the tickets for the `avant-premiere' of this film on 05 May 2004, in one of the last movie theaters in Rio de Janeiro not located in malls, but on the street (Cine Palácio). With a huge screen, excellent sound system and high headroom, these factors highlighted the wonderful gothic photography of this film, which in some parts recalls the German expressionism. The beginning of the story in black and white is very impressive, and I dare to say that it is a great homage to the monsters of Universal studio. The state-of-art special effects are amazing. I have not recognized Kate Beckinsale in her role of Anna: she is strong, wearing curled long hair and believe me, more beautiful than usual. The story is funny, full of action, therefore it is a must-see film.  When I watch, for example, an Ingmar Bergman's movie or an art film, I expect a message of life, something to think about. When I see movies like `Pirates of the Caribbean', `Kill Bill', `Indiana Jones', `The Mummy', `The Lord of the Ring', `Harry Potter', `Spider Man' etc., I expect a great adventure. And what is Van Helsing's proposal? A breathless action movie, having lots of humor (the gay style of Dracula, most of the scenes with Carl, the English accent of Dracula and his three brides, Mr. Hyde looking like Hulk etc.), a romance between Van Helsing and Anna, special effects where sometimes we are not able to identify what is real or not, a great homage to famous monsters, therefore, it is excellent for its proposal of entertainment. I still bet that it will be included in the IMDB Top 250 list pretty soon.

Start with the sequence with Van Helsing hunting down an amazing life like Mr. Hyde and dare not to be impressed. I have not witnessed this kind of special effects in any other movie to date! And...the fine work keeps coming: the transformation of the werewolves, the flying vampires, Frankenstein, and finally Dracula himself, with his amazing castle.

"Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolves, Dracula, Mr. Hyde, the gangs all here.","I think I've got this film critic business figured out.  After reading many of the reviews for Van Helsing, the great majority of which soundly panned the film, I have come to the following conclusion:  Critics loathe the summer film season.  They especially seem to loathe high budgeted special effects extravaganzas such as Van Helsing, especially when the trailers for it have been bombarding our senses for months, and you can't turn on the TV without hearing about it.  One would have to assume that they when they view a film such as this, there is a certain amount of bias working against it. So in reviewing the $200 million dollar Universal extravaganza, I think my job is supposed to be to blast the film into Hades with another scathing review.  Sorry, I can't do it. As it turns out, I did enjoy the film.What Writer and Director Stephen Sommers does do is to entertain us with a multitude of exciting hair raising sequences, aided by some spectacular CGI effects, and a cast of characters that hearken back to the old black and white films of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, and Dracula. Even Mr. Hyde is on hand briefly to liven things up.The film opens with a black and white sequence that is straight out of the original Frankenstein film.  Everything is here just as it should be, including Dr. Frankenstein, his not so loyal servant Igor, the monster himself, and the torch bearing citizens of Transylvania who are intent on having Frankenburgers courtesy of the Doctor and his protégé. What is different however, is that Count Dracula himself is on hand for the unveiling of Dr. Frankenstein's Monster, and has his own personal agenda to attend to.  Unfortunately for Count Dracula, the Monster regards Dr. Frankenstein as Daddy Dr. Frankenstein, and doesn't take too kindly to what the Count has in store for him.  It's a stunning, cleverly written opening to the film, and sets a relentless which barely leaves you time to breathe as it hurdles on fast forward from one action laden episode to the next.From the creation of Frankenstein Monster's we are immediately taken to the Notre Dame Cathedral where Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, is doing battle with Dr. Jekyll's alter ego Mr. Hyde.  By placing Hyde in the cathedral, Sommers manages also to pay a little big of homage to The Hunchback of Notre Dame. His mission, which comes directly from Rome, is to try and bring Hyde back to Rome alive to be studied if possible.  It is here with his own wry perspective on the matter that Jackman reminded me of a late nineteenth century James Bond.  He'll do the job and get it done, but he'll do it his way, orders or no orders.  It's a nice minor touch that immediately gives Jackman's Van Helsing a distinctive touch of personality not seen in any previous film incarnation of the character.Later, Van Helsing is ordered by Rome to travel to Transylvania to aid the lovely Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) in her quest to find and destroy Count Dracula.  It seems Anna and the family from which she is descended from, have been after Dracula for some time.  The only members of the family who are left to continue on with the quest are Anna and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp), and should they die before finishing their mission, their family will be damned to eternity in purgatory.  Along with Van Helsing is a Rome inventor and sidekick, Carl (David Wenham).  (He's a Friar not a Monk, and so is entitled to certain worldly pleasures).  It's a great bit that adds  some welcome humorous touches, lest we begin taking things a bit too serious.Where this film also excels is not just the adrenaline rushing action sequences.  Sommers uses the CGI, not just for a myriad of heart-pounding special effects,  but is smart enough to create an atmosphere where we can easily accept the notion that this is indeed Europe in the late nineteenth century.  In one scene, as the camera traverses the landscape of Paris, we see in the background a half-built Eiffel Tower.  It is this kind of meticulous attention to details that help lift this film a couple of notches above others in the genre by transporting us into a world we can immerse ourselves in completely.If the film has a fault, it is minor.  In the early moments, one is not sure if we are going to be witnessing an action film or a spoof.  Much of this is due to the initial campy over the top portrayal of Dracula by Richard Roxburgh and a few of his female disciples.  After the opening sequence during the creation of Frankenstein's Monster, Roxburgh and everyone else seems to settle down into just the right tone needed for the remainder of the running time.If you go into Van Helsing knowing that your are going to get two hours plus of non-stop sights and sounds to hammer your senses, along with some harmless mindless entertainment, you'll enjoy the film in all aspects.  It is highly imaginative, and very entertaining.  I had fun, and that's all I asked for.  And if I get what I ask for I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Van Helsing is a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Artistically barren,"Tonight, I saw possibly the most artistically barren movie ever. Why was this movie made? The acting was flat, the story line practically non-existent, and there was zero chemistry between the characters, especially the male and female leads. Not that the actors had much to do. The CGI effects completely dominated and doomed every scene. With every explosion, every hideous metamorphosis, every miraculous near-miss, I kept thinking, ""Well, there's another ridiculously expensive special effect that adds nothing to the movie."" After a few minutes of this, I started dozing off.IMDb readers, don't waste your time or money on this. If you crave CGI effects, watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".

Creative Fairy Tale,"The movies that somehow stick with you over time are not just those that are excellent or which have been awarded by Oscar or other titles, but instead those that dont quite make it that far, those that capture your imagination of what it could have been and those that give you a fairy tale of something you already know.Van Helsing fulfills the last two points for me. It is made with a desire to impress young people, with a phenomenal cinematography, very good up and coming actors and it is covered with a moral theme. It starts very well, in the mode of League Of Extra Gentlemen, trying to suprise and raise your interest while making it awry, intense, non compromising to traditional ways and adventurous. Hugh Jackman hits the screen very confidently as he usually does in such movies and plays the hero as expected with Kate Beckinsale in her prime, intending to make angels feel bad about being angels and enter into a world of Count Dracula and Age of Heroes, accompanied by spectacular pieces, which does impress for what it presents but doesnt hold water for what it follows. The interplay with Jackman is actuallythe best part of the film and they hit it best with each other in something of a phenomenal ride. Unfortunately, as good as the first half gets, the second half and towards the end gets duller by the minute because it fails to keep up its premise by complicating the job of the hero and the side woman into other tracks of personal problems, lack of villainous intent and downed story. In such a time and place like the movies potrays there must be more desire to interplay dangerously into a world that is full of possibilities and paths to explore.

Can anyone sell me back 2 hours of my life?,"Within 5 minutes of the opening, I knew I'd made a mistake by entering the theatre. After 20 minutes, I began to think that the box office should issue cyanide capsules along with your ticket to this show. It's not much of a horror show, but it is a nightmare ordeal to experience.There isn't much of a story or character development. There's barely an effort to create any sense of time and place. The dialogue and action is laughably insipid. There is never any sense of peril or suspense, because almost everything is obviously pasted together on a Mac. (NOTE TO DIRECTORS: If I can see that the hero is fighting a CGI monster on top of a CGI Notre Dame, rather than a monster with some physical presence on a set that resembles a real cathedral, what's so thrilling about that? Where is the sense of real danger? If I see a runaway stagecoach driving down a CGI path heading for a CGI canyon, what's supposed to make me care?) Even the costumes are out of place: Jackman is dressed like the mysterious, brooding hero of a postmodern Western, and Beckinsale in her bodice and lycra pants appears to have been pulled from a Meat Loaf video.All that's here is Wolverine from the X-Men fighting some CGI versions of famous monsters, presented with a relentless assault of loud noise (in Surround Sound!), going through the paces of various ridiculous and implausible scenarios. I had to sit through it until the end because I was with a group, but I actually slipped out for 5 minutes in the middle just so I could get a break. Towards the end, I started to feel like I wanted to cry. Seriously. Like another reviewer said, I felt like Alex in A Clockwork Orange being forced to watch such horrible images until I broke. As I walked out after the show, I wanted to ask the concessions people if they could sell me back the last two hours of my life.It was one of the worst movie-going experiences of my entire life. If somebody asks you to see this next weekend, save yourself. You might even consider breaking off a friendship to avoid this drain on the soul.

"This is, dare I say it, fang-tastic.","Universal's greatest monsters are back, this time in a monster mash unlike any other. Stephen Sommers, director of ""The Mummy"", brings a new set of rules and updates to his creatures and makes Van Helsing an awesome, well-equipped action hero. So let's spread our wings, charge up, and take a bite into this action-packed creature feature.Plot: Dracula, the Prince of Darkness, had Dr. Frankenstein create his monster for a nefarious purpose, but the vampire lord loses both the good doctor and his creation. A year later, having finished business in Paris (Mr. Hyde), monster hunter Van Helsing, alongside his genius sidekick Carl, is sent by the Knights of the Holy Order to Transylvania to kill Dracula while protecting Princess Anna from him. However, Dracula has three brides, a werewolf, and other creatures under his control. With the help of Carl, Anna, and Frankenstein's monster, Van Helsing sets out to stop this monster madness with an arsenal of crazy weapons and an attitude to match.This is a great tribute to the classic monster movies. Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster have great updates, cool designs, and unique twists to their characters. Van Helsing is tough as nails and Anna is both sexy and strong. Both characters do have soft spots, especially for each other. Carl, along with many other things in this movie, is pretty darn funny. It's great the way all these characters are tied together in this crazy battle for the fate of the world.With a complex story, nice effects, fun music, good comedy, and awesome action scenes, this movie is sure to please. A must-see film. Check it out. Be sure to bring stakes, crosses, silver bullets, and fire.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Silly, But Great Fun!","'Van Helsing' is a potential box-office blockbuster. Agreed, its Silly, But Great Fun nonetheless! Even a decade later since its theatrical release, this Action-Horror Flick, still holds its own merit!'Van Helsing' Synopsis: The notorious monster hunter is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula who is using Dr. Frankenstein's research & a werewolf for some sinister purpose.'Van Helsing' is visually towering & even in terms of execution, its pretty impressive. The Action Set-Pieces, as well as The Graphics, are excellent. Stephen Sommers's Screenplay, however, is not full-proof. Luckily, the fun quotient & the thrill remains in-tact. Sommers's Direction, on the other-hand, is stylish. Cinematography is superb. Editing is sharp enough. Art & Costume Design, are awesome. Make-Up is greatly done.Performance-Wise: Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, is impeccable. The ever-terrific actor pitches in a heroic, tough performance, that works from start to end. Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious, is sexy & classy. And although Richard Roxburgh makes for a worthy Dracula, I found his performance to be slightly stilted, at times.On the whole, 'Van Helsing' is unapologetic fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I Wish I Had Stayed Home.,"I went to see Van Helsing thinking I would at least be partially entertained. I was wrong. I was bored out of my everlovin skull. The acting was abominable, and it was probably the best thing about the movie. I have rarely been exposed to such a toxically bad script. The ""monsters"" looked like something from the movie Shrek, and I'm not exaggerating. As a matter of fact I think Mr. Hyde was played by Shrek if I'm not mistaken. The outfits worn by the Van Helsing character and the unbelievable heroine were so ridiculous that I had to consciously force myself not to roll my eyes. And the Werewolf... Lord! How do I describe the failure of the Werewolf? Computer generated monsters are NOT scary, they are fantastical. A Werewolf is a fictional extension of a psychopath. Since, In reality, people are the most frightening thing on Earth, psychopathic killers are the most frightening people. A Werewolf is basically a hyper-psychotic, bent on killing and mutilation. It is therefore essential that for a Werewolf to be frightening, or for just about any humanlike monster to be frightening, the monster must be played by an actual human. that is another reason why the monsters in this film are such a disgrace to all the classic monsters of the past. This movie leaves out the human element; an element that must be present for any movie to succeed on ANY level or genre. By the way... since when does a guy turning into a werewolf have the ability to crawl backwards up a wall like Spiderman?",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Enjoyable...when it doesn't take itself too seriously,"Enjoyable...when it doesn't take itself too seriously.Vampire/werewolf/monster/whatever-hunter Van Helsing (played by Hugh Jackman) and his faithful sidekick Carl (played by David Wenham) go to Transylvania to track down Count Dracula (played by Richard Roxburgh). They end up in a town whose inhabitants are tormented by vampires. Among the town's leaders is a local vampire-fighter, Anna Valerius (Kate Beckinsale).Had heaps of potential...as a comedy. There are some great lines and funny scenes in the movie, and many of the them are thanks to Carl / David Wenham. Richard Roxburgh's great campy portrayal of Count Dracula is also wonderful - reminded me of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.However, the movie too frequently regards itself as a drama - even worse, an action-drama - and this is where it suffers. The dramatic plot is weak and the action scenes are dull and generic.So what you have are some great funny scenes interspersed with, and generally swamped by, dull action scenes. Very uneven.Overall, okay, but could have been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van-tastic!,"Hugh Jackman in Wolverine-esque mode pre X-Men. He's the vampire slayer Van Helsing transformed, in lurid modern day comic book style, into a superhero, and by the end of the movie he has become a werewolf to boot!
He warms up by fighting a very Shrek-like ""Mr Hyde"" voiced by Robbie Coltrane, who doesn't have to fake a Scottish accent, before moving on to encounter Dracula, Igor, Frankenstein, a Werewolf and Dracula's three Brides.
Leave any treasured memories of the traditional stories you may have at the door, as they have been cannibalised and rearranged almost beyond recognition.
I find this movie very attractive visually, I think the set design, effects and action sequences were very well conceived and executed. The basic story structure is sound enough for me, and all the actors to a fine job.
However they just try to cram in too much action, which comes at the expense of any meaningful character development, and much of the dialogue is disappointing.
I think this could have been a classic, but instead it ends up being another movie that feels like a video arcade game.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It Sucked,"Too Loud, too much cartoonish special effects and not enough dialogue. Underworld was a better movie than this. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was better. You don't screw around with classics like this. Frankensteins' Monster was in fact a Monster, a dumb and mostly kind monster but still a monster. In this movie he had better lines than anybody else, he even talked better, and those accents !! God where did they come up with those. The Mr Hyde looked like the very same Mr Hyde from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, at any rate very little difference. And the ending......arghhhhh it was awful.  This movie had the same crappy CGI that HULK had.  Well I guess for those of you new generation people who have never read the classic novels or watched any of the classic movies and have never seen a movie withour a ton of stupid special effects it may be okay. But not for me. I did like most of the settings and at least Van Helsing looked cool, but he wouldnt have gotten far without his sidekick.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Proudly in the ""Liked It"" Camp !","NO SPOILERS. NONE !! Charge forth !!I was pretty sure (nay, *positive*) that I was going to hate this one. Well, it's another CGI Action movie (budget was over $150 mil, so you know what's coming), as has become the trend recently, and I generally hate those.This one would be a flop without Hugh Jackman, but thankfully he's here and looking better than ever, and playing something like a shallow version of Wolverine. The movie is an aggregate of several types: A vampire movie, an action movie, a classic monster movie, and an Eye Candy movie that totally delivers. MOST of the effects are pretty good - only a handful miss the mark, and Jackman, well... He is the Ultimate Eye Candy, especially when clad in Turn of the Century romanticism. The female viewers will surely be satisfied (no complaints here on the detailed leather costumes, glittering weapons, and flowing black cloaks!) and the vampire people and action movie buffs will get their fill, too.Some aspects of it are annoying, like the constant use of computer effects, unfortunately at the expense of dialogue and character development. And that strangling outfit Beckinsale wears is ugly and eventually irritating to look at. Some of the dialogue is a little ""off,"" too, but I guess that's to be expected in this type of flick.Where you'd expect it to crash, 'Van Helsing' does provide a detailed and almost believable plot that gives the monsters credible reason to interact. There were a few times during the screening I attended when you could hear people muttering worried ""Oh no""s at the key points of the story; the thing was pretty darn involving, perhaps disturbingly so.It was obvious that some explanatory scenes had been sharply cut (unfortunately), but the film was coherent and tended to answer its various questions as it went along. It was nice to see the characters and the audience simultaneously confused over certain plot elements, and then learn the reasons together.Most of all, 'Van Helsing' could have been helped by fewer effects and much more dialogue. And as others have mentioned, it goes too far toward making the main characters invincible. Part of a great action movie is a great hero (and a beautiful co-star and a bumbling sidekick, of course), but that relies on his being human enough to fail sometimes and feel pain, or at least lie on the ground for a while after he's taken such a pummeling. Maybe that is the distance between Van Helsing and Wolverine.Overall, this was a terrific, guilty pleasure, even for someone who isn't into monster flicks. Go for the antiquity, the scenery, the incredible costumes and cool weaponry, and an awesome Dracula, too!Score: A solid ""B,"" for doing what it sets out to do.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
THE WORST MOVIE OF THIS YEAR,"Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man-on-a-mission, determined to rid the world of its most evil, nightmarish creatures.

But in Transylvania, he's not the only vampire hunter.

The film's CGI sets are as handsome as you'd find produced by the finest game machines.Many, many times dialogue is idiotic: It has about as much life as a drained corpse.

A TRIBUTE TO THE CLASSIC MONSTERS,"I can't understand why this film doesn't receive a 10 star rating like the one I just gave it. I hope that after reading this review some IMDb reviewers may be motivated enough to give this campy film the attention and respect it rightfully deserves.Van Helsing (2004) clearly was conceived as a homage to the Universal Horror films of the 1930s and 1940s, featuring a ""near gothic"" theme that showcased classic horror monsters. With Van Helsing, these classic characters are mostly here; vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, and even Mr. Hyde.The most clever addition comes from actor Richard Roxburgh's outrageously fun portrayal of Count Dracula. If you close your eyes, Roxburgh's Dracula sounds oddly like the hilarious Ren (from the cartoon series, Ren & Stimpy) yet he retains the murderous focus of all classic vampires. Roxburgh's performance is melodrama to the highest degree. He embraces the iconic role with deep respect. His performance is laced with subtle humor and it shows in every scene.Dr. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) certainly is not the scientifically focused character you'll remember in Dracula (1931). But he is just as interesting in this version. Plus, he's far deadlier.I won't comment on Frankenstein's Monster or the Werewolf other to say you won't be disappointed in either. They have elevated these roles to spectacular heights, both physically in form, and philosophically in intellect. These ""escalated takes"" on the film's classic monster characters is what I found most intriguing. Van Helsing breaks all the rules and conceptions of the previous films quite pleasantly, making you hope there will be a sequel in the future. But alas, it was not to be. The box office results were simply too disappointing.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Above average,"Stephen Sommer, of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns fame, directs his next big adventure, Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckingsale in the lead roles. Just like The Mummy, Van Helsing is an above action action flick that works on most levels, even though the film isn't excellent by any means. What's really missing for me are strong performances and a solid score (as Alan Silvestri provided for The Mummy Returns). However, the story concept is interesting, combining horror legends Count Dracula, Frankenstein Monster, and The Wolf Man into one film. That in itself makes this movie a curiosity to see, if only for just one viewing. Above average, 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exuberantly moronic and awful,"Leave it to Stephen Sommers do outdo himself in the schlocky film-making department (see my MUMMY II review). I've never seen a movie exuberantly & giddy in its awfulness. This film is so moronic, on so many levels that it creates an all new style of cinema, a style that will never catch on (hopefully...) if one looks at the disappointing box office. The ""filmmaker"" doesn't care for anything but big noisy moments where everyone is screaming, or falling off of this wall or that cliff, all done in a extreme schlocky manner, including an orgy of terrible CGI, bad makeup, stupid characters and a plethora of incongruous elements so disparate that the end product looks like it was truly dreamed up by a 5 year old boy suffering from extreme ADD.Sommers actually tried to make Van Helsing into a medieval James Bond, with the villain, being a campy Dracula (and his three hysterical bimbos) trying to destroy the world with their GREMLIN-like offsprings by having them energized by the ""lifeforce"" from Frankenstein's Monster. If that made any sense to you, you need to see a shrink!The film is filled with soooooooooooooo many mistakes and goofs that it defies total logic, even for a film that belongs in the horror/fantasy genre. If werewolves only change in moonlight, how come Anna's brother was a werewolf during the daytime? Helsing recklessly firing his automatic crossbow in that village, even if there are people all around...I'm surprised no one was accidentally killed. Why did the lightnings strike the centuries-old stone overpass when the goofy Friar tried to cross it? And what happens to Anna at the climax. Moments like these basically show how Sommers was just winging it (and then some...) and had no idea what to do with Universal's classic monsters. The scene when Frankenstein's Monster swings across the overpass, only to crash through a window and tackles the female vampire, accidentally saving Anna, is by far the DUMBEST scene ever conceived in the history of cinema. That scene is filled with so many mistakes (why doesn't Anna just leave the room?) that Ed Wood would have been jealous of Sommers for creating something that actually eclipses everything the legendary bad filmmaker ever tried to make.VAN HELSING is definitely one of the worst films ever made!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Helsing is excellent summer movie fun! ***1/2 out of 5,"I really like this film. It features non-stop eye candy, a likable hero, spooky settings, and tons of monsters, what's not to like?Stephen Sommers is a director who basically goes all out and likes to pack on action sequence after action sequence. He isn't someone out to make a dramatic Oscar winning film, he's just out to make good, fun, likable, special effects laden popcorn films and I respect that.The monsters here are well done, especially my favorite monster, the Wolfman.. er.. Wolfmen. They are quite scary looking actually and definitely how I feel werewolves should be portrayed.Alan Silvestri really packs a punch with his flamboyant and highly original score. One of his absolute best.There are action films and then there are action films that literally don't let you catch your breath. This is one of the later.There are a couple of small cheesy scenes and lines of dialog, but I believe they can be easily dismissed as the script really isn't bad at all. In fact there are some pretty good memorable lines here and there.What can I say? I enjoyed it unlike a lot of reviewers here... but then again, I think a lot of people really enjoyed it. It made a killing at the box office.Here's hoping for Van Helsing's Return!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Helsing doesn't deserve its early grave and should be resurrected for more fun adventures.,"Why do people love to hate such an enjoyable movie? Van Helsing falls much more in the adventure genre than horror but still has a little of the edge of a scary movie. Stephen Sommers' influence can be felt throughout with a lot of the same charm that made The Mummy (1999) so great. Van Helsing showcases many of the Universal classic monsters while building a shared universe that should have been explored more than once. With big names like Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale, blockbuster effects, goofy fun moments, and all the adventure one could hope for. Van Helsing deserves way more love and a lot less disdain. Sure it isn't a perfect movie, but it was a much better attempt at a shared Monsterverse than Tom Cruise's The Mummy (2017) and was entitled to more.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hysterical fun offered for those prepared to accept it...,"OK. Deep breath. Reputation about to be destroyed. Career as reviewer gone.I liked Van Helsing.No, no, no! Let me explain. I think it's awful. The script is terrible. The plot non-existent. It's all just an excuse for some action sequences to be tied together. Now, here's my point: what's wrong with that? I am beginning to rail against the pre-defined notion that all films have to be a Citizen Kane type experience. They must aspire to be the ultimate cinematic achievement they can be. The storyline must be Shakespearean in scope. The dialogue must be a gift from Mamet. The performances must give De Niro sleepless nights for months.Not always.Sometimes they can just be fun. And that's what Van Helsing is, it's fun. It's ridiculous, it's hokey, it's silly. But by God, sat in that darkened theatre watching Frankenstein's Monster swing on a rope, Dracula do bloody battle with a Werewolf and the Brides camp it up like harpies possessed, you've just got to roll with it and laugh.You want to be po-faced? Hell you could rip this to pieces. Nothing makes any sense. The story is riddled with contrivances and conveniences too numerous to mention. Vampire and werewolf lore is shown the nearest exit and told to be cool or else. The dialogue is so cheesy, even Karloff would die of shame saying it. But here's the point. The film doesn't care.Not in a self-aware kind of way you understand. This isn't some post modern exercise in hip irony. Hugh Jackman doesn't wink at the camera. Roxborough doesn't let the mask slip and reveal that he knows it's all bunkham. You know why? Because they're having fun too! And director Stephen Sommers? He's bouncing up and down in his little directors chair smacked out on sugar having the time of his life playing with the biggest toy set money can buy.This is clearly a labour of love for Sommers. At the end of the credits is the note 'For My Father.' You just know that when he was 9 Sommers watched every universal Horror movie at least 25 times and lapped it up. He watched them with his father and talked about how cool it would be if the Monsters all met up for a big fight and what would happen. This is that film. This is the film a fan makes. This is the film an obsessive makes to honour the memory of watching monster movies with his father.Now, I can hear people whispering ""if he wanted to honour Dracula and Frankenstein he should have made a serious adaptation of the books rather than urinating all over Shelley and Stoker's prose and turning them into a funfair ride."" Point taken and accepted. But Sommers doesn't care about the books. He cares about the films. He cares about Karloff and Legosi and Lon Chaney Jr. He cares about damsels being captured and villagers carrying blazing torches and pitchforks and silver and transformations. He cares about the joy of watching a monster create carnage. You want to delve into the sexual awakening of young women in a suffocating society? Or explore the male masturbation fantasy of creating life without the help of woman kind? Move along please, nothing to see here. You want to watch vampires attack a coach travelling at breakneck speed though the Transylvanian forest carrying Frankenstein's Monster with a Werewolf in hot pursuit? Step right this way.Van Helsing is not a great film. It's debatable whether or not it's even a good film. But it most definitely is a fun film. And sometimes, that's all you need.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not bad, but not the best of the action horror flicks","I had such anticipation for this film, having heard it was going to be directed by the guy who gave us The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. More of the classic Universal monsters in one film. Frankenstein, the werewolves, and Dracula. And Hugh Jackman as the monster slayer. Plus lots of Eastern European sets. It may not be an Oscar contender but it did its job as a popcorn film that could entertain those who don't want to think hard. It's also good for those of you who didn't care for the Mummy due to the casting of Brendan Fraser as the main character. Even though I did enjoy Van Helsing, I hoped that there'd be a better plot. But it's good as a popcorn film, as previously stated. If you liked the classic Universal monsters and want action, or if you're following Stephen Sommers, give this a go.

This movie sucks,"The one line summary basically sums up my feelings about this film.  I went into Van Helsing hoping that it would be a great way to start off the long awaited summer movie season.  Instead, I got the ultimate peice of S*** that is not worth viewing even once. (I snuck out and went to see some of Kill Bill at one point.)One way to describe Van Helsing is that it is lke a Johnny Depp movie, the only reason you might want to see it is because of Depp's prescence. In this case, that honor goes to leading man Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman.  he does a pretty good job playing the average demon hunter.  Other than that, well, the film is basically an accident waiting to happen.Terrible acting and sub-par effects don't come close to the amount of familiar scenery and concepts that I have seen in other films.  If you've seen Blade, Blade II, Mortal Kombat 2 and The Lord of the Rings 3, you've seen alot of Van Helsing before.In short, this flick should be shipped directly to video & DVD and used for target practice.

Excellent Adventure,"In May, 2004, I watched the opening screening of Van Helsing in Rio de Janeiro.

My opinion is exactly the same: Van Helsing is a spectacular adventure, full of special effects, having very funny moments, and with very unfair reviews. I am very curious with these contradictory point of views, since practically all my friends and colleagues who saw 'Van Helsing' love this movie and share my opinion; the DVD is full of extras and is one of the top ten in the lists of the most sold DVDs in Brazil; therefore, I do not understand why the high number of bad reviews.

The length of the movie is also a problem as it looks that the movie is been stretched unnecessarily.Acting is decent and Hugh Jackman had done a fantastic job, Richard Roxburgh was equally impressive, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham were average but effective.Screenplay of the movie is average and as mentioned the movie looks stretched. The movie could've been great with an effective and crisper screenplay. There comes a point where the movie starts loosing it's grip on the viewers and couldn't get connected with the viewers easily.

Horror stew in Hulk-vision,"Hugh Jackman could have spared himself the trouble of trying to act among an otherwise cardboard cast and settings that fit the special effects - it all looks as tasteless as is barely acceptable in something like a Hulk-sequel. The script is mainly an inconsistent sequence of clichés from various, unrelated and hardly compatible horror traditions, turning the eponymous vampire-killer into a universal monster-slayer trained by a secret Catholic order as an orphan, with some other implausible twists. The genre normally requires accepting a few unrealistic premises, but here there is almost nothing beyond that to make it worthwhile. The result is rather infantile, hardly good enough even to be mentioned in the history of Dracula-movies.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
""" To you it's a mirror,  for  the Prince of Darkness, it's a doorway to Hell ""","If you're a fan of Gothic stories, this movie is just what the doctor ordered. Nearly every conceivable horror creature created for the silver screen is resurrected for this masterpiece. Mary Shelley's Frankenstine born in 1818, Bram Stoker's Dracula penned in 1897, the fable Lycanthrope, Wolfman and even Robert Louis Stevenson's duel identities of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are part of this magnificent and horrifying menagerie. The story also includes Dracula's Black Transylvanian castle, the pathetic hunchback assistant Igor and an army of throat-ripping, flying children of the night. But just to round-out the story the famed vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing takes center stage to this nightmarish saga. The film is called "" Van Helsing "" and is a living tribute to all the horror stories of the 1930's 40 and 50's. What this movie offers is a collection of those dark tales and nightmares we thought we'd forgotten in our youth. Not so, with the incredible special effects this film uses, those black dreams return and are more terrifying than ever. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, with Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula. Kevin J. O'Connor is Igor and surprisingly Alun Armstrong plays Cardinal Jinette. Samuel West is Dr. Victor Frankenstein with Robbie Coltrane and Stephen Fisher both playing Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. For those seeking eye candy there is Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran as Marishka. From start to finish, there is so much action, drama and savage physical confrontation it's nearly impossible to turn away. What puzzles me is the main characters' constantly fall from dizzying heights to crash against everything from thick wooden beams to concrete and stone barriers of all kinds and yet few bones are ever broken.

A Really Fun Movie,"This is a really fun movie.  I went to the premiere tonight and, while the actual event was good, the movie just rocked me.Like another reviewer here said, it's a beautifully shot visual effects movie.  But it's more than that because I also thought that the new Star Wars movies looked beautiful, but they didn't keep me interested because there was nothing more than visual effects.  Hugh Jackman was a great hero and the monsters were perfect.  No, it's not completely faithful to the legends we've seen in the classic movies, but that didn't bother me at all. Each monster took on a new life of their own and it was great to see how they could all blend together smoothly.Obviously, Hugh Jackman is the lead, but the movie belongs to the director, Stephen Sommers.  He seems to have a good time with his movies and he keeps things moving really quickly (and loudly!), with not much time to recover from each scare or each laugh.  It's not scary like The Shining, it's not even scary like the original Dracula, its scares are more like brief frights, followed by a laugh.  Honestly, it's the epitome of a fun movie.

Cheesy but fun!,"Van Helsing is just a fun,cheesy popcorn movie. Some of the cgi effects looks dated now. It's still a fun watch in 2019. I thought this version of Dracula was abit weak init they could of done more with the Dracula character. Kate Beckinsale was hot init. Most of the action sequences was quite good. I loved Van Helsing crossbow style gun. Sucks we didn't get to see a sequel. I had fun still watching Van Helsing again. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Helsing,"Van Helsing is not your typical movie. From being a fast paced action/horror movie, the plot is rather interesting. It keeps the audience's attention with all the action and all the circumstances faced.The actors fit so well into their roles. With the great acting the story had a great flow. The film sure went far into putting in great detail. To the actors, creatures, and the story line, Van Helsing was planned to be a great fantasy movie. This movie is highly recommended to people who love fantasy, action/ horror movies. The shots also add to the greatness of the movie. The locations are absolutely breath taking and the camera shooting techniques add great perspectives. Van Helsing is a monster movie that can't be passed up.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
terrible!!!,"What a waste of time! at least it was worth waiting for the movie to end: the closing-titles are nice to watch and you can enjoy the good music without getting annoyed by the brainless story. We should be used by that kind of stories... so why is it even worse with this one? The whole art-design looks like paperwork, the CG looks too artificial, the acting is poor (even Jackman's :-( ), the b/w-sequences look cheap... and so on :-( sorry!

Don't be deterred by bad reviews,"This is the best film I've seen lately- not because of any dramatic impact that it carries, but simply because it is a fun, well-designed, monster flick. Understand that you can't go into a movie featuring Frankenstein's Monster and expect Shakespeare. The plot is admittedly thin, and the Universal Monsters have been around for so long that they've become somewhat unimpressive, but the director has done a very good job of minimizing these factors to create a visually and emotionally appealing film. The sets and characters are beautifully designed; there are no real instances of bad acting; the action is fast-paced and not too predictable; and the whole thing combines to create one really great adventure film, if you only give it a chance. I'm glad that I did. A must-see for vampire-lovers, and for those who liked The Mummy and Pirates of the Caribbean.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Typical brainless so-called 'horror film'  for mainstream audience.,"""Van Helsing"" is easily one of the worst so-called 'horror films' of 2004.Why people compare this CGI-laden piece of crap to Universal classics or Hammer vampire movies is beyond me.Instead of focusing on suspense the film is loaded with tons of unimpressive CGI-imagery.The script is painfully weak and the characters are totally one-dimensional.Admittedly,the opening scene is pretty good as it follows a mob of angry villagers as they storm Dr.Frankenstein's castle.It's shot in black and white andfor a little while,anywaycaptures the eerie,fog-ridden atmosphere of such horror staples as ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Wolf Man"".After this short prologue we meet Van Helsing and the film quickly becomes stupefying mess.The dialogue is particularly atrocious and there is no suspense or gore,just lots of loud noises and computer animated vampires and werewolves.The film may be entertaining for popcorn eaters,but everyone who calls himself or herself a true horror fan will hate it.2 out of 10.Avoid this travesty like the plague.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Meant to be a campy monster flick - and delivers!,"Van Helsing was never meant to be a world-shattering, ground-breaking feast of cinematic platinum by any stretch of the imagination. What it stood for was pure fun. Unfortunately, in this 'enlightened' day and age, a lot of people do seem to consider this idea somehow inferior and primitive.""Fun?? Forsooth! Movies aren't supposed to be fun! What do you think this is, the entertainment industry?""This isn't one of the best movies ever made, nor is it among my all-time favourites. But I can watch it any time and still be entirely pleased by the time the amazingly spiffy credits roll around. You don't go to see a movie like this with the same standards in mind as going to see 'The Shawshank Redemption' or 'The Godfather', and nor should you judge and review it as such. I went into theatre with a taste for popcorn, iced tea, and campy thrills and got everything I wanted.One thing that got my attention was that it's clearly designed to be a throwback to the equally campy old B-horror movies of the 30s-50s, a genre I love. This is best showcased in the black and white prologue. And let's face it, those films aren't revered for their realism.The action was unlikely, to say the least, and to say the most, awesome! The dialogue was cheesy, but funny and enjoyable, and occasionally quite witty. The plot was suitably far- fetched. Overall the effects were breathtaking - seems to me that if someone hates a film they will automatically trash on the effects regardless of their quality. And the casting, regardless of what you thought of the performances, was next to perfect.So, if you want to see something that's going to make you think, ponder the human condition, take a reflective walk round the block, this film isn't for you. But if you want to curl up on the couch with your girlfriend and just watch a fun movie together, I'd wholeheartedly recommend Van Helsing!My humble opinion is yours for the taking.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Go See!,"It's a shame that the first review shown on here seems to come from someone that just isn't happy with anything.  As to the acting in this movie, well, it is an action film, more action versus speech. But to insult Richard Roxburgh for a bad accent.  I grew up with a family and in a town with alot of Hungarians, Romanians, etc. and he does an excellent job.  Having to live up to the reputations of actors playing the Dracula part (Lugosi, Lee, Langella, Oldman) is a tuff job and Roxburgh, to me, has created the ultimate version, lethal, sexy, seductive and one to sympathize with.  I came away liking Dracula more than the Van Helsing character (the most hated hero in movies).",,Anonymous,Fantasy
equal parts exciting and absurd,"I love director Stephen Sommers because of his apparent love for 40s B-movie thrillers, and perhaps that's why other people don't like him. It seems that a bad action movie with a modern sensibility like Spider-Man is always better received than a fun, distinctly old-fashioned picture like The Mummy. I don't know what to make of it.Like The Mummy, Van Helsing got more bad reviews than it deserved, although admittedly it does have problems. The movie is best at the very beginning in a black and white sequence evoking the old Frankenstein/Dracula movies of the 40s while tossing in 21st century special effects. This is classic Sommers. It then changes to color, for no discernible reason except you can't make a whole movie in black and white in 2004.Action scenes are incredibly exciting. The movie is big and fast and monster transformations happen with a tremendous speed that makes them at times startling. Hugh Jackman is great and Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous.But while Van Helsing is exciting, it fails miserably at being scary. This is the movie's weak point. The vampire's hover between scary and camp, not quite landing at either point. So what should be eerie or terrifying just comes across as silly. It feels as though Sommers realized he couldn't get scary and so played some scenes for laughs, but he couldn't give up the idea of making things scary so he kept trying, basically fighting against himself.One also has pretty much no feeling for the characters. This is perhaps the main difference between Van Helsing and those old horror movies, which mixed a sense of tragedy and loss into the thrills. But for all its flaws, the movie has that roller-coaster thrill ride sensibility that keeps a smile on your face.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Igor, why do you torture that poor Creature?...It's what I do.""","The Artistic Design of this Movie is at times impressive. But it is so frantic and relentlessly on the move that it hardly registers. At times looking great but hardly time to enjoy. It is an overwhelming pace and nothing is on screen long enough to make itself welcome.The new Hollywood with its CG is a bittersweet affair. These Movie Makers are like Kids with a new toy. They play and play and just don't know when to stop. They are all guilty and are suffering an overdose of self-expression. They need an intervention and that could save a lot of Movies.There is so much energy and excitement here that the Audience is amped out after only a view scenes. There is no catching up. It leaves the good parts to move on so quickly to the next that in the end it is really, too much of a good thing. Overdone, underdeveloped, and ultimately a fantastic failure.

Ahead of it's time.,"Considering this came out in 2004, it's an incredible fantasy film and a beautiful take on the Dracula story. I think I saw it in theaters 10 times and bought it as soon as I could.This is the film that introduced me to Hugh Jackman, and I've been a huge fan ever since. He shines in this film - even if he is grimy for 90% of it. Kate Beckinsale will always be a top-tier fantasy queen. Between this and Underworld, she takes on vampires and werewolves in perfect, bad ass style.If you haven't watched this classic, you are seriously missing out.

One of the underrated gems,"I don't know why this film was doomed by critics and people. I am not talking about box office collection. This is one of the most underrated movies of its genre. I like this movie and I love huge jackman, plus supporting cast was good.I personally love this kind of tongue-in-cheek, change of the usual film.Maybe movies timing was bad, because pf spider man.If people looked at them more as just visually entertaining with a bunch of sharp one-liners, and tried to stop making them the next big action movie, or trying to read a life change message somewhere in there, they'd have more fun! I loved the real mix of actors appearing in this movie - I was straight to IMDb after watching it to see if I was right or wrong about who played who. I especially liked the straight-in beginning - no credit break to kill the run of the film. The black-and-white beginning, going to color soon after, was not new, but echoed nicely with the old Hollywood movies that the start was echoing. Altogether, a great fun watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Action Packed Movie,"Hugh Jackman trades his razor sharp claws for razor sharp blades to play the monster-hunter, Gabriel Van Helsing, hired by the church to go to Transylvania to take on Count Dracula {Richard Roxburgh}, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster.The premise sounds very interesting and this film had potential to be a good summer blockbuster. Unfortunately, the film is very uneven. The CGI is great and the movie gets an ""A"" on that part but the rest of the film was handled very poorly. Apparently, Stephen Sommers took some lessons from George Lucas and decided to fill his movie with just CGI. This isn't a bad thing since it is a summer movie. However, the film becomes very dull and the story is kind of weak. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept but the execution just wasn't very good. Sure, the monsters looked great but I was expecting a little more than that.The acting was okay, nothing special. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing well and he does make for a good hero. Kate Beckinsale was weak and very cheesy as Anna. I know the movie is supposed to be cheesy but she was a little too much. Her chemistry with Jackman was also non existent and this hurt the film. Richard Roxburgh gives the best performance out of everyone. He plays Dracula and he is very effective as the villain.A big problem with Van Helsing is the length of the movie. 132 minutes is just too long and it made the film very dull to sit through. The film was also too cheesy for me. Some of it was just so stupid and the story grew more and more ridiculous as the film continued. The first hour is actually pretty good and entertaining. The second hour is dull and not as creative as the first part. The ending was alright, nothing really special. Honestly, the main reason to watch this film is because of the combination of Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein in one movie. The story is weak, the acting is nothing special and the direction is poor. The film is very stylish though so the 160 million went to good use. Besides for these flaws, Van Helsing was still a decent summer blockbuster with some fun moments. In the end, now that it's out on video, Van Helsing is worth a look just don't expect too much from it. Rating 6/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very flawed it is $1.00 rental for fans of the genre,"Wow, what can I say? Let's start with for me a 6 is a very mediocre rating.It has a great look and it was a great idea and that is where great and this film part company.Hugh Jackman is fine as the title character as is most of the cast the notable exception being Richard Roxburgh as Dracula who brings back memories (okay nightmares) of Jeremy Irons in Dungeons and Dragons. He takes overact in places to an extreme level and never strikes you as anything other than a caricature.The effects are over done and in some cases really really bad. Apparently, nobody associated with this picture has any idea of the capabilities or limits of the human body. People are thrown through walls, bounce off trees, and undergo huge falls all seemingly with little or no ill effects. I have no problem suspending disbelief to an extent, but man you can only disobey the laws of physics so many times without me losing interest.The story carries itself for awhile, but falls apart about half way through and the movie ends up being a series special effects.The abilities of the vampires seems to vary from moving at nearly the speed of thought to merely near human speed when it comes time to kill them. The Frankenstein monster has a great look, there is also a neat take on Mr. Hyde, the werewolves are fine (over done transformation scenes), and the vampires look cool (expectations being Dracula's fine battle visage and the unhinging 'Predator' jaws when they go to feed at times).I wasn't much of a fan of the ending either.My recommendation if you are a fan of the genre rent it for a $1.00 otherwise pass. It certainly is not the quality and doesn't have any of the mass appeal of ""The Mummy"" or ""The Mummy Returns"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comic Book Horror Lavishly Produced.,"Van Helsing's well-known to British audiences, at least audiences of a ""certain age"". The Vampire Slayer turns-up in many hammer horror productions. In the guise of Jackman he's re-modeled as swash-buckling superhero. Unfortunately, a hero of the most predictable Hollywood kind.I can't see serious horror fans giving this re-hash of well-known themes kudos. Still, for a mainstream film-goer like myself, I found enjoyment and relaxation in a well-paced adventure.A thoughtful screenplay keeps the action coming, while there's many an exciting aerial shot. Sumptuous costumes, props and locations complete a satisfying visual experience. Although CGI runs riot in this movie, at some points it works rather well. Dracula's flying brides, for example, look stunning, at least when airborne.The script, such that it is, veers between cheesy one liners and brisk conversation. Dialogue is mostly confined to moving action forward, so has a ""comic book"" feel. Inventive plot points get overshadowed due to this approach.Beckinsale and O' Connor (who played a similar entertaining villain in the Mummy films) do their best to entertain, while David Wenham and Shuler Hensley are pitch perfect and well-cast. Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran are memorable as Dracula's brides, sharing the limelight with Miss Beckinsale, rather than stealing it. Candidly, I could watch all four ladies all day long.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Okay summer movie,"Contrary to popular opinion, I think Sommers really did want to pay homage to pass horror movies more than make a movie to make money. However, this film is genre specific. If you don't like these kinds of movies and don't come to just have fun then you won't. This won't attract the Mean Girls crowd.  The problem is character development.  The characters like Van Helsing and Anna Valerious do not have time to just gestate and absorb their surrounds before being thrust into another situation. Therefore any display of emotion by these two main characters seems choppy and erratic. I think there is chemistry between Jackman and Beckinsale but it was not necessary to include that kissing scene. There was not enough character development to reach that point before the end of the movie. The one tender moment the two leads are allowed to have is when they are in the rain.However, summmer movie standards are lower standards and the movie and character development in my opinion is no better than that of The Day After Tomorrow and Troy which suffer from the same problems. If you like this genre and want to have fun then go see it.The basic story of trying to find a way for Dracula to bring his children to life is fine. The dracula character was decently well thought out and so was Frankenstein who was fabulously played by Hensley.  The friar was great! Igor was fine as well. I also enjoyed the brides.  I didn't have a problem with the accents like others. I appreciated that the actors were consistent in using their accents.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing monster shenanigans   .,"When I first heard about Van helsings plot , I was excited.

Unfortunately i was wrong.Van helsing is a mess. What should have been a blockbuster to remember ends up being a monotonous non interactive video game of a film. The character of van helsing is a mere shadow of the complete and utter badass he could have been  and Dracula is more camp and annoying  than scary.So the central hero and villain are both unappealing-but do the problems stop there ? NO ! Kate beckinsales character doesn't  really allow you to care for her , especially with her annoying fake accent and Frankenstein's monster..... what the hell did they do to Frankenstein's monster?The pace is relentless  and the action is non stop ,but since there is not much good story telling in addition to all the bangs and crashes on display , you wont really be that excited  when  van helsing starts blasting away monsters.The special effects are impressive and allan silvestris score works well but these are the only good factors  in an other wise poor film.It could have been so much better.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why bash this movie ?!?,"C'mon guys! This movie wasn't bad AT ALL. And believe me, I know bad movies - last week I had the unexplainable urge to go to the theater and I saw ""The Punisher"" (man was that awful) and later on, since VH was sold out, ""The Alamo"" (you wouldn't believe it, but it's actually worse than ""The Punisher"").Now, compared to these movies ""Van Helsing"" was a MASTERPIECE. I mean, come on, nobody expected a well-thought story! Yes, the story is stupid. Yes, there are more than a few plot holes. Yes, the romanian accents were awful. BUT that's not what this movie is about. This movie is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick, and honestly it is. The action sequences are more than just good, the CGI is unbelievable and there are more than a few breath-taking scenery shots(the mountains/the canyon/the river/dracula's castle etc.). Even and the music was ok!So why bash this movie ?!? If you expected more than it delivered, it's actually your fault, isn't it?

Not all movies suit all tastes, but for those who enjoy the Gothic genre, this movie is quite pleasing, and to some I have talked to, very exciting! I personally felt it was brilliant in many ways, and yes, I do feel it may have been a little too fast paced at times, it was still a great story and a very enjoyable film.Critical nitpicking be damned!

Everything that's wrong with Hollywood,"Yes, I know that's the kind of comment usually reserved for polo-necked film students when they're discussing anything that doesn't have subtitles. But I don't even own a polo-neck, and I think I can prove my point, that Van Helsing represents the reason that a lot of people don't bother with big-budget Hollywood movies any more. So, in no particular order:1. No plot. Now come on, writers are cheap, at least in Hollywood terms - even the legendary Joe Esterhasz only got about five million per movie back in the day. So couldn't someone have told Stephen Sommers that it was time to lay down the pen and let someone else write this? That way, we might have got a plot that made the slightest bit of sense. And don't tell me that doesn't matter - that might be true if your name is Monty Python, but this is trying to be a fairly serious movie, and half the time even God couldn't work out what was going on.2. Characters. Movies work better with characters that we care about, rather than boring, one-dimensional tortured heroes/heroines, cutesy sidekicks and cardboard villains. I've seen all these characters before, and I didn't care about them the last time, either.3. Dialogue. In seventy years, we've gone from 'Creatures of the night - what sweet music they make' to 'We are both part of the same great game, Gabriel! But we need not find ourselves on opposing sides of the board.' And that line was ripped off from The Man With The Golden Gun anyway, which brings me to....4. Recycling. For paper cups it's good, for movies less so. The movie starts with Frankenstein's monster, which is about right, since this whole film is about seven other films stitched together. There are bits of Bond movies, bits of vampire movies, bits of everything you've ever seen, just about. Original ideas? Nah, sorry, we're out of those. Have some leftovers from old Hammer Horror movies instead. Defenders of this movie will likely claim that this is Stephen Sommers paying a homage to movies of the past. It isn't. It's him grabbing great big handfuls of past movies and stuffing them into this unholy mish-mash.5. Pointless CGI. Lots and lots and lots of CGI. And then some more. Even in scenes that don't need it at all - for example, Mr Hyde didn't need to be a ropey-looking CGI giant, he could have been just Robbie Coltrane, only made a bit larger. You know, like the Harry Potter movies did it. Instead we had one of the most unconvincing fight scenes ever. CGI only works if it's used in the service of a good story, or if it's genuinely jaw-dropping stuff. Neither is the case here, and that's true of way too many recent movies.6. Cracked actors. Good lord, but there are some bad actors around these days. The two leads here are as good as they can be with this kind of material, but the support are often dire. Special mention goes to David Wenham, as the cute joke character who made me want to kill him after about seven seconds, and particularly Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. You have to see Roxburgh's performance to believe it. There simply aren't words in the English language to describe how shatteringly bad it is.7. All action. You are allowed to have scenes between action sequences to do stuff like characterisation, scene-setting, that sort of thing. Van Helsing just goes from one action sequence to the next, with maybe a few minutes of Basil Exposition-like waffle in between, and then.... hey, werewolves! I'm sure 12 year old boys everywhere loved this movie, and since Hollywood seems to believe that everyone in the world is a twelve-year-old boy, they'll keep making crap like this. You could have had ten Brokeback Mountains for the price of one Van Helsing, but as long as people keep coming to junk like this, Hollywood will keep making it. In the end, the market works, and audiences get the movies they deserve. Unfortunately.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I quite liked it,"As a kid I used to stay up late and watch the old horror movies with my Dad , they starred such classic horror actors such as Boris Karloff,Christopher Lee,Peter Cushing and Vincent Price, and yes , to my eyes they were cheesy and so is Van Helsing , but they were also ENTERTAINING. I loved the special effects , Dracula and his brides and the Werewolves . The black and white beginning ( with the torch bearing villagers , Frankensteins monster and the windmill) was a nice touch that reminded me of those classic horror movies . This movie had almost non-stop action , and if the acting is'nt Oscar winning - WHO CARES !!! it's not meant to be .Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing is eye candy for the girls , Kate Beckensale is no wimpy woman(and there's not too much romance to get in the way of the story) Anyway don't listen to all the negative comments , go see it and judge for yourselves.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Veritable Monster-Mash,"Judging this movie for what it is, a fantasy film, it delivers well with reasonable acting (Kate Beckinsale's accent is even credible), good effects and a story-line writhes around enough to remain sufficiently unpredictable and suspenseful. With its veritable monster-mash of Dracula, his heinous brides, Dwerger minions and deranged servant Igor, as well as Frankenstein's monster and werewolves, all boxes are ticked and the character variety helps the plot from running dry at any point. Obviously there are moments of incredulity (such as constant falls from great heights), but what else would you expect from a fantasy fable and since the film doesn't take itself too seriously neither should you and just enjoy the fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

For fans of the classics!,"For anybody who is familiar with the old Universal monster movies Van Helsing is a total roller-coaster, taking all of the aspects that made the vintage films great, and injecting them with LSD, speed and pyro.The CGI, firstly, is at least complete this time, unlike the decidedly PS2 graphics like SCorpion King from the Mummy sequel. Particularly impressive are the werewolf transformations and the vampiric healing abilities.Jackman carries his charisma well across the film, but unfortunately Beckinsale has none of the English charm that Sommers saw in Rachel Weisz - if only she would have done this one for him.The design and shooting of the action sequences is absolutely perfect -everything can be seen in it's full glory - it's all physically plausible (within the context of action/adventure!) and it never fails to surprise.David Wenham's character has a couple of good lines but he's generally pointless but fun (a bit like the film I suppose).A great ride with a few surprises, the film can't really be called frightening, but it's definitely worth a look for action fans and lovers of the brilliant 'The Mummy'.6/7-10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A disturbingly bad idea...,"The idea for a sequel to the woefully miscast 1990s production of Dracula had been floating around for some years when the decision was made to make Van Helsing younger and turn him into a mercenary. Anyone who is aware of how religious fanaticism and science were virtually at war in the nineteenth century can see how inane this idea is. Hollywood makes its Christian ownership all the more obvious, however, by failing to recognise this basic fact.That aside, the story started out well, with a raid upon the Frankenstein manor culminating with Dracula and the monster taking off to parts unknown. The problem is, once the titular hero is introduced, it is all downhill. The most profound example of the film's lack of respect for the audience's intelligence lies in the scene when Van Helsing meets Whatshername. As the harpies come out of the woodwork to assault the town, Van Helsing sets about taking them down with an automatic crossbow. So far, so good, but the way in which Van Helsing fires, one would be hard pressed to credit him with being able to hit the sidewalk using a can of paint. Naturally, no villagers are killed by friendly fire despite the fact that hundreds of crossbow bolts are fired in every direction.It gets worse from there. Much, much worse. One of my favourite scenes is the vampire egg-hatching sequence. Seriously, our heroes just wander through this area with no regard for what might happen if they are discovered. The usage the villains get is incredibly uneven, too. The Frankenstein monster is little more than a plot device, and the Werewolf is only there to facilitate how Dracula is brought down. Making this all about Dracula might have worked if Dracula had not been so incredibly non-charismatic.After Underworld, Kate Beckinsale needed to appear in something decent fast before she killed her career. Van Helsing is therefore the definition of a bad career move. If Beckinsale is capable of defining her characters through anything other than costume changes, she'd best prove it in her next appearance. Van Helsing sure hasn't done David Wenham any favours, either. The goofy sidekick routine is now so old and tired that he starts being annoying as soon as his character is introduced, and never really stops.I won't get into the use of special effects here, as while they were quite obviously the focus of the film, they aren't the real problem. Nor is the acting as such, although obviously it didn't work against the limitations of the material. The problem here is that the story was given about as much thought as a pop song, if that. Even after watching the film for a second or third time, one is hard pressed to remember the precise details of the story. The words ""tacked on"" can be used a lot to describe some plot elements, with the final fight between Van Helsing's group and Dracula being convoluted beyond belief. It's almost like time slows down during this part of the film.I gave Van Helsing a one out of ten. After such fun pieces as The Mummy, one would have expected something better out of Stephen Sommers. With this film, he gets dangerously close to the status of one-trick pony. It defies belief that Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are not rising to meet production budgets when they are spending said budgets on dreck like this.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"In pursuit of Dracula, Van Helsing must battle werewolves, vampire brides, and most of all, his sidekicks.","This is a delightful, edge-of-the-seat movie with delicious humor. David Wenham delivers a great performance as Carl. I loved seeing all the traditional monsters together in one movie. Everything ties together nicely. The technology in the movie was tastefully used. There was a lot of action, and the story never slows down. It's very upbeat. When it's not thrilling, it's hilarious. This movie was amazing.

"A fun movie, but not a timeless classic.","A fun movie, good special effects and fair to good acting, but no big surprises in the plot. A good way to spend a rainy afternoon if your not looking for a ""gone with the wind"" classic. Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing worked well, he seemed to enjoy the part and made the character fun to watch, His sidekick, Friar Carl, played by David Wenham, in a role touching on ""Q"" from the James Bond series of movies, fell a little short in the comic relief department but worked in the role none the less. The lead female role ""love interest"" Ann Valerious, played by Kate Beckinsale, a good actress, she managed to pull it off with a role that was somewhat less then believable. Count Dracula, played by Richard Roxburgh, was somewhat wooden in his performance, but considering the part he had to work with he did well. I liked Frankinstein's monster, played by Shuler Hensley, the role was played in the style of Boris Karloff's classic Frankenstein, and the makeup and special effects were excellent in all roles! Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, This is a good action-adventure film even if the plot is somewhat worn from use.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Appallingly Awful!!!,"Let's face it... here on IMDb people only enter reviews for films they truly love or truly hate. I can't see many people logging in to write a review of a film they found mildly entertaining. Well there may be some but they probably should get out a bit more.In the case of Van Helsing I think I can honestly say that it's the film I love to hate. I feel it's so bad that it belongs up there with Batman & Robin as a possible contender for the worst film of all time.Where to begin....Almost the entire failure of this mess can be attributed to Stephen Sommer the director. When he directed the Mummy he was relatively unknown so the studio kept him on a tight leash and as a result we got a well balanced kind of Indianna Jones film with horror homages. It worked well and I thought it lots of fun.Then I saw what Stephen was capable of when you take the leash off in The Mummy Returns. Dear god what a mess. Plot goes out the window, tonnes of cheap, lazy and pointless CGI comes in and characterisation is completely ignored. Sommer had become the king of CGI for the sake of it...The film begins in black and white as an obvious homage to the classic horror films of Dracula and Frankenstein but it quickly becomes apparent that the huge CGI budget won't be used to any decent effect when you realise that the only alteration to the actual picture is that the colour has been removed. No CGI is used to give the black and white section a grainy or authentic look. You could get the same effect just turning down the colour on your TV.Then we meet Dracula. He's awful. A caricature of the classic horror villain rather than an actual depiction. There's no threat to him, at all. He looks like he's just turned up at your parents Halloween party in a slightly expensive outfit.Van Helsing himself is just Hugh Jackman playing Hugh Jackman in a Van Helsing costume.David Whenham's sidekick is rather embarrassing to watch as the Aussie actor does his best to take on a comic English accent and has a go at slapstick (which he fails at miserably by the way).Kate Beckensale is always easy on the eyes but aside from being a woman with a need for vengeance there's very little for her to do.After a slightly odd battle between our hero's and a bunch of flying chicks in the local village things descend into the incomprehensible.The story jerks along between one CGI set piece and the next and takes so many ridiculous turns that you give up trying to follow it after a while. Instead you sit back and let the CGI awfulness wash over you until you decide to turn it off.The problem is that because no time is spent on any of the characters or the story, you just don't give a toss about what's happening on screen no matter how mind-boggling a stunt the CGI is trying its best to suggest.Bottom line this film should have been a wonderful homage to the age of the classic horror movie. Each character, good and bad, should have been lovingly represented with the care and attention they deserved.Instead each character is shoehorned in as an excuse to show more badly rendered CGI.There's no love here, at all. It's just vacuous action with no point to it other than to make you say ""wow look at all that CGI"".If you're the sort of person who complains about a film because there's too much talking in it then this may be for you.The rest of us need to be aware that drivel like this actually exists and needs to be avoided at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
If you go in expecting Shakespeare...,"you will leave disappointed, BUT, this is a good, fun movie.The Special Effects are great, as is the action.  The plot is a little thin, but I rank it as good as Frank Langella having a mid-air love scene in his 70's version of the Dracula tale.  How much plot do you REALLY expect in a movie with Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's Monster?  Please!  And, it was pretty obvious that much like the ""mummy"" movies, that this one did not take it self too seriously (which doomed ""the matrix"" sequels).  Would everyone have felt better if Dracula and Van Helsing had a round table discussion on the Vatican Holy Knights?The bottom line is that if you want some fun, go see this movie.

Critics hated it; I LOVED it!!!,"Mix together familiar characters Van Helsing, Jekyll and Hyde, Dracula, Victor Frankenstein and his monster, Igor, and werewolves, add plenty of CGI, the charm of Hugh Jackman, the agility of Kate Beckinsale, plenty of humor and horror, and voila! You have 'Van Helsing'.The Van Helsing character has been around for a very long time, first created by Bram Stoker in 1897. 'Van Helsing' gets a new look thanks to visionary director Stephen Sommers. Although the film received mostly negative reviews from critics (but turned out to be a box office success!), I really enjoyed it.'Van Helsing' is fast-paced, and despite the long running time, there is never a dull moment. It is action and excitement from beginning to end. And Alan Silvestri's dramatic score complements every scene. This is an energetic film with incredible action sequences and stunts, amazing sets, and great visual effects. There's lots of action and adventure, and I enjoyed the blend of humor, suspense and horror. The character transformations were seamless.'Van Helsing' is a high octane action adventure fantasy horror I'm bound to watch again and again, even if only to marvel at what they've accomplished here. But apart from that, I enjoyed the story and the energy of the film. I loved it!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dracula Meets the Wolverine,"Despite being thinly scripted in parts, overly plotted in others, and CGI bloated, ""Van Helsing"" might be the best monster-rally movie since the original Universal series, from its initial crossover feature, ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1943), to its turn into self-parody beginning with ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948)--although my favorite may be Columbia's ""The Return of the Vampire (1943), which, akin to ""Van Helsing,"" is a Dracula Meets Wolf Man monster rally in all but name. Albeit, being the best monster-rally fare since the 1940s or so, which has included the kiddie ""The Monster Squad"" (1987), the prior-year's summer blockbuster, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003), and a host of B-to-Z-grade pictures, is not a high bar to surpass. In retrospect, ""Van Helsing"" also plays a bit like a warm up to Universal's subsequent attempts to launch a new Dark Universe, that being ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) and ""The Mummy"" (2017), except that the warm up is actually better than the latter results.À la ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" Dracula has an evil plan for Frankenstein's monster, but, once again, werewolves (and, it could be argued, some other dimwits) are trying to thwart him. In an homage to the classic Universal horror films, the opening sequence of ""Van Helsing"" is in black and white and rehashes Dr. Frankenstein's creation of the monster, complete with a pitchfork mob chasing them to a fiery climax in a windmill. For a while, ""Van Helsing"" seems rather haphazard in its touching upon other classic monsters, including scenes of Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde (who is more like a mix of The Hunchback of Notre Dame--literally that's his location--and, as in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" a weak version of Marvel's the Hulk rather than the character from Stevenson's novella), of some werewolf hunters and of a small village being terrorized by vampires. There's also some stuff with Igor, a gravedigger, vampire brides and baby vampire bats. Probably the biggest problem with the movie is that it spends time with too much clutter while not delving too deep into the characters and storylines that really count.Van Helsing merely retains the name of Stoker's character. Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing is no Dutch doctor, but rather an 1880s James Bond type working for Vatican as a hitman of monsters. The friar Carl stands in for the ""Q"" character from the Bond films, as he shows Van Helsing the latest in fictional-Victorian-era weapons technology. Strangely, Carl is also more like Stoker's Van Helsing than the actual character by that name in this movie, as he's the one with all of the answers and knowledge related to vampire hunting. Jackman's Van Helsing, on the other hand, at first, wonders why he can't just shoot the Count with his guns. Like Jackman's Wolverine from the X-Men movie series, his Van Helsing is a semi-immortal with memory loss who recklessly rushes into a fight, relies upon the intelligence of others, whether it be a Carl or Charles Xavier, struggles with the risks between heroism and evil capable from his rage-infused superpowers and with the tragic possibilities of his romantic relationship with a female sidekick, whether it be Anna Valerious or Jean Grey.As for this movie's Dracula, I'm fairly satisfied with it. I've been watching a bunch of Dracula-related films since reading the novel, and I'm tired of all of the weak or otherwise lovesick bastardizations of Stoker's titular villain. Stoker's Dracula was pure evil. In the 1931 Universal version, Bela Lugosi added camp to the role. At least, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula evokes some of Stoker and Lugosi's traditions, and he's an especially strong vampire. Whereas Van Helsing is a rehash of Wolverine, I can see a bit of the absurdity of Roxburgh's Duke from ""Moulin Rouge!""--which along with the absinthe in the windmill and the visual excess, ""Moulin Rouge!"" seems to have especially influenced this movie. Mixed with the goofiness throughout from director Stephen Sommers, who had already done likewise in rebooting ""The Mummy"" series, this one can be fun. The Frankenstein monster, on the other hand, was somewhat of a sympathetic character even in Shelley's book, but he's overly such here. No explanation is given for his eloquent speech, either; even the classic Universal movies, for as much as they departed from the source material, addressed his acquisition of language.The visual effects are well integrated with the the framing and its movement--what is traditionally done with the camera, but which is increasingly being done by computers. Only a few years later than ""Van Helsing,"" five movies that relied heavily upon computers for their imagery, ""camera"" movement and lighting were seemingly-oxymoronically awarded Oscars for Best Cinematography: ""Avatar"" (2009), ""Inception"" (2010), ""Hugo"" (2011), ""Life of Pi"" (2012) and ""Gravity"" (2013). ""Van Helsing"" is part of a prior generation of combining live action and CGI and camera and digital photography, but at least the ""camera"" moves some, including following Dracula as he walks up walls (much more casually than the wall crawler of Stoker, by the way) or keeping abreast of the vampires flying in their humanoid-bat forms. Such a sense of the role of the camera in the mix of live action and CGI was lacking from the prior year's monster rally, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" so ""Van Helsing"" was certainly an improvement upon that, delivering an action movie that's actually visually enthralling.(Mirror Note: Dracula displays his and other vampires' lack of reflections to Anna as he dances with her before a mirror in a vampire ball sequence that somewhat recalls a similar scene in Roman Polanski's ""Dance of the Vampires,"" a.k.a. ""The Fearless Vampire Hunters"" (1967). A mirror is also used in another scene as a gateway.)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie smells like a wet dog,"I rarely rate movies as low as 1 but Van Helsing while theoretically deserving a 4 for craftsmanship in cutting, costumes and sf/x, I cannot rate it higher than 1 due to its utmost abhorrent script - plot? what plot? - performance and feeble attempts to be funny. What happened? I did enjoy ""The Mummy"" tremendously, I even liked the ""Mummy Returns"" but this is an outrage and Kate Beckinsale - already proven to be worst actress of the year in ""Underworld"" - seems to have a fable for showing off her body instead of her acting talents, which might prove difficult as these are seemingly nonexistent.There are indeed many viewers who enjoyed this shallow pop corn flick and it's their good right to do so, but as fan of the genre I could merely wince in my chair seeing how such a potential character as Van Helsing goes to waste in yet another instalment of ""all show and no brains"".Yet it began really promising with the hunt for Mr. Hyde (very nice CGI there) but sadly these first 15 minutes are the only highlight of this movie and Richard Roxburgh seems to be only actor worth his grain of salt.Go see The Mummy again instead. 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Better world building than any Disney Star Wars,"Sure, not a masterpiece. But it's better than it has any right to be. It begins with a black and white homage to old Universal monster movies, introducing a pretty awesome Dracula performance from Richard Roxburgh. Then you meet Van Helsing, a monster hunter who is almost superhuman. Then the main conflict: who is Van Helsing (he has amnesia, which is, sure, a little lazy) and how can he stop Dracula before he is able to procreate? For 2004, if the CGI isn't amazing, the action is definitely exciting. Wagon chase sequences, near-miss falls, and showdowns with Mr. Hyde, wolf men, Frankenstein's Monster, and four stubborn vampires, including Dracula himself. For mindless entertainment, it can be pretty thoughtful. And, again, the Dracula performance alone is worth watching this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Comedy ?,"I watched Van Helsing after hearing a lot of critics about it. And I was really surprised ! Was the movie misunderstood ? I find it quite funny actually (the situation with Hyde/Jekyll is hilarious).I think most people thought it was going to be an adventure story, and that happens quite often. When you think a movie has a precise genre (adventure) and it turns out being more funny, you're disappointed. I had that with From Dusk Till Down, at first I thought it was going to be a kill, kill, kill movie and when those vampires arrived I just couldn't watch it anymore ! But after a year I ""tried"" to watch it again, knowing it had some fantastic spirit in it, and I really liked it.

"Yes, Fun For An Hour, But Then Overkill","This may be the classic case of overkill, literally and on the subject of violence being the appeal of the movie. It's the old, if 10 killings were successful before in a film, lets try 100!This is movie almost literally non-stop action for just over two hours. Oddly enough I liked this movie the first time I saw it. Maybe that was so because my expectations were very low. All I had read what criticism of this film, so I expected an awful film. About a year later, on my second look, now with raised expectations, I found it so ludicrous I canned it halfway through and this time agreed with the critics.After one hour of the movie, your senses have been so bombarded with action that you are almost numb. The longest lull in the movie was probably two minutes. It's ridiculous. Plus, the dialog is incredibly stupid.I wish Kate Bekinsale would can these tough-girl roles. They don't suit her.

You just go for the ride. Van Helsing is just that. Too bad it didn't have a good plot, but for what its worth, it was an overload on the senses. I gave the movie a 7/10. But that is misleading.

Very dark and comical,"I noticed that a lot of people don't like this film because of all of the special effects. Although I agree that they should stop making Hyde as a CGI creature (he was equally naff in LXG) I don't mind the effects. In fact, I didn't mind the film.Anyone going to this film and expecting anything other than complete mind candy should be slapped repeatedly. If you don't want to switch off your brain and enjoy some dark - but cool images - then find another film. Remember this comes to you from the guy who did the Mummy. He's obviously a classic film buff, because he doesn't come up with an original idea. Which I think is OK. Indiana Jones comes straight out of classic Hollywood and no one beats up Lucas and Spielberg over that. Not that I'm comparing this film to Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's nowhere in that league.My biggest complaint about this film is that it makes the villain too attractive. I like Hugh Jackman, but Richard Roxburgh makes Dracula so enticing that I was hoping he and his awesome flying brides would triumph. The casting of this show seems to be a bit of an in joke. Kate Beckinsale's last film, Underworld, had her as a vampire fighting werewolves and that's kind of important to this film.Hugh Jackman has played Wolverine, a man in search of his ""lost past"" and here he does a similar turn. (There's another similarity that I won't spoil.)The best in this film, though, is David Wexham, who played Faromir in LOTR. He's almost unrecognizable as the friar sidekick and he gets the best lines.

"An Updated ""Fearless Vampire Killers""","Of great entertainment value are the ""Van Helsing"" comments and message board postings from people who apparently just don't get it. Parody/satire of horror films has a long tradition and ranges from the obvious (see Abbott & Costello, Mel Brooks, and ""Redneck Zombies"") to the subtle (see ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and ""Evil Dead""). Before reading many of the comments I would have grouped ""Van Helsing"" closer to the obvious, after all the film depicts a Vatican Department modeled on James Bond's Special Weapons ""Q"" Section. But apparently even something so obvious is not registering with many people, if the true measure of a 'subtle' satire is how many people just don't get it, then ""Van Helsing"" certainly qualifies.They went into this project saying something like: ""let's use digital effects and a large budget to create the most interesting sets in horror movie history, and then use these as a backdrop for a parody of the ""horror genre"". When concerns were raised about the expense for just a comedy, they pitched it as a sophisticated parody that would not get in the way of the average viewer's desire to see a traditional vampire movie. Such a dichotomy allows the movie to generate big bucks at the box office while still providing its makers with an outlet for their creativity. But such a dichotomy means there will be a third group of viewers who cannot suspend belief enough to enjoy it as a horror film and yet will totally miss the parody angle (the only question is whether they too humorless to find enjoyment in such frivolity or are just a little too dim to appreciate it). We see a lot of negative comments from this third group but 'f them if they can take a joke'-or don't get a joke.The movie opens with a visually awesome scene of the villagers storming a huge castle and burning a windmill; the sets and the music are great. Except for the overacting and the presence of an assistant named 'Egor' or ""Igor"" (see Mel Brooks reference), you would not suspect that this is anything but a serious horror film. Actually at first I thought it might be a high budget commercial and kept thinking Dracula would say he had gotten a great deal on his car insurance. Although this was the best scene in the movie there were several almost as good and each one had a similar restrained level of satire.The film plays homage to the Karloff/Chaney films, to Abbott and Costello, Mel Brooks, James Bond and The Wild, Wild West. There is a little Phantom of the Opera and even Eli Wallach's best line from 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' (if you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk). In fact they even lift the vampire ballroom scene from ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"".The individual performances are from the William Shatner School of Over-Acting with Dracula's brides totally stealing each scene in which they are featured. I particularly liked Josie Maran (who had that great scene as the cigarette girl in ""The Aviator"") as Marishka. The costumes are almost as good as the sets. The computer-generated action sequences illustrate all the problems with digital effects, but work fine as satirical devices.So if you want to see a fun film with unparalleled visuals this is the one. Others who can suspend belief and ignore a few campy elements will enjoy it as a straight vampire picture. But if you are can't suspend belief, are humorless, or don't know the horror genre you should stay away.Because there are really two movies here, the first viewing withholds most of the viewing pleasure; once you understand what is happening repeated viewings are even more fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pure Torture!,"I cannot believe people can actually defend this piece of garbage (unless they work for the stuidio). I actually love B-movies. I love sci-fi, horror and fantasy.

And so the nightmare began... First off, the script and acting are both terrible. This comes as no surprise, and I expected nothing more. Second-- the special effects were pathetic! I could create better CGI on my home computer! It was so poorly rendered I found it difficult to believe this was a professional production! (Except for some of the Mr. Hyde scene).

One of the best scary movies around,"I'll admit I'm not usually one for scary movies, and I'll also admit that the only reason I really went to see Van Helsing was for the eye-candy.

Even with his faults (and he had a few), I found myself liking his character. David Wenham provided comic relief and more than once me and my best friend were in violent fits of giggles from some of his lines (we're only fourteen ... you do that at our age).The special effects were amazing, my favourite being the werewolf transformation.

AGH,"Van Helsing collects the worst aspects of summer movies into one giant, two -hour mess. Special effects take precedence over any kind of script or acting, and the movie is so ham-fisted and cliched in its dialogue that a better part of the movie is laughable. Dracula's performance borders on parody in the earlier parts of the film, and new characters and plot twists are introduced without any sort of rhyme or reason - see if you can catch such oddities as vampires in the daytime or at least one character who keeps falling into the same cliffside river.

"Entertaining, a bit over-the-top with its graphic horror, but still fun...","My main reason for seeing this old-fashioned fright film done in high style with elaborate sets and excellent actors, was to see Hugh Jackman on the big screen after having watched him in OKLAHOMA! on PBS in a wonderful televised version of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical.He makes a convincing Van Helsing and dominates many of his scenes with authority and skill--but I think we have to wait for a better scripted part to really judge his screen acting. He and all the other cast members are entirely up to the proceedings and there can be no complaints about the casting.In addition to excitement, there is abundant humor (of the somewhat corny kind) to add some spice to the relentless scenes of Dracula's wives having a grand old time scaring the hell out of everyone in sight. Perhaps for this reason I found it uncomfortable to watch young parents sitting in the audience with toddlers on their laps, letting them absorb all of the graphic fright scenes with a casual air, as though the film was ideal entertainment for three year-olds. Whatever happened to Disney?Most impressive are the elaborate sets, all providing the chilling atmosphere needed to bring this sort of thing off. It's worth noting that the first fifteen minutes are done in B&W fashion, harking back to the days of the Universal horror flicks with Karloff and Lugosi. And for some reason, when the film is over, it's the opening B&W sequences that chill with the most power.Alan Silvestri's score is heavy on the orchestrations but quite stunning as an accompaniment, lending grandeur to the elaborately staged action scenes.

I would even swear I have heard the GVH heavenly chorus before. Can't put a name to it but it was from some old biblical epic or other.Hugh Jackman strutted his stuff as a Sergio Leonesque mystery man very well but I thought Richard Roxburgh was rather hammy, trying but never quite achieving the Gary Oldman menace.

Fun!!!,"I can't believe the people who took this movie too seriously.  This movie is a lot of fun.  Granted the movie runs too long and the ending is not really satisfactory.  The movie does move very fast and Hugh Jackman is great as the title role.  I also like Kate Beckinsale as a princess that helps him. The villains are also quite good.  However, if you have Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's monster in the same movie, what are you going to do for a sequel?  I suppose it doesn't matter.  I suggest you go see this movie and ignore what the critics are saying. I give it a 7/10 with a big grin on my face.  Just see this movie and decide for yourselves.   It won't redefine movie making, but it is a great start to the summer movie season.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
its better than 5.2,"I think if you like all out action and not a real deep storyline Van Helsing delivers with flying colors! It deserves better than a5.2 rating, guess not enough people have gone to watch it yet. It probably has 2004's best mind-blowing special-effects and whether he's hacking some system (Swordfish) or slicing and dicing(X2), Hugh Jackman is the epitome of cool in a movie.Yeah the movie is one explosion after the other but at least it is not just senseless violence, I've heard good comments from both 54 year old women and 13 year old kids. That's both ends of the spectrum which says something .In conclusion Van Helsing deserves a little more credit than it's been getting after how many other movies have the hero fighting a giant dog!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Exhilarating, Adventurous and Amazing.","I watched this film back when I was a kid, at age 9 to be exact (that's when it was released). I am 26 now and I still love this movie to this day, and still watch it over and over again. How some people can rate this film anything below 8 stars is beyond me! I believe perhaps it is simply not their style of film, but if you love mythological creatures, adventure, fantasy, action and a little bit of a thrill, then this is the film for you, and boy does it NOT disappoint!Each second of the film leaves you wanting to find out more and keeps you guessing. It is jam-packed with adventure and action that makes you feel exhilarated, and gives you an experience so mighty right from the comfort of your own living room!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great on effects, laughable at times though","Hello everyone,Just happened to get a chance yesterday to see this film and knowing this was a Stephen Sommers film, had a kind of movie on my mind.I wasn't far off. Van Helsing has quite some similarities with movies like The Mummy. A hero (Van Helsing), a heroine (Anna Valerious), a goofy fellow (Farmir...uhh...I mean Carl) one MAJOR badass (Count Vladislaus Dracula) who is helped even by the same goofball that also played in The Mummy (Igor, Beni in the Mummy)The movie had some great effects and you can laugh a lot during it. Because I had a feeling that I was to expect a movie like this, I was not dissappointed. I'm sure it will do quite well in Box Office.I have read some reviews that totally burned Van Helsing to the ground, but I cannot say I agree on that. It wasn't the best I've seen, but it was by FAR not the worst either.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overdoing it.,"This film is some mad cross between james bond, dracula, frankenstein, alien, tarzan and whatever. It's like the worst of Hollywood tackiness. Steal yourself blind taking plot elements from other films, but use them in the worst possible way. And then I have not mentioned the worst. There is simple too much special effects and action in this film, it never ever slows down. You need acting and character in a film. But special effects and action is no substitute for good acting, which we sadly see nothing off in this film. Mostly because the film doesn't pause enough to let there be acting. But also because every time someone says something, not only does that person have the most outrageous accent, but their speaking is so constructed that you wonder what kid wrote the script.Sometimes the film slows down, and you think, maybe there will be some good acting, maybe some plot, maybe this isn't a completely bad film. But no, the film soon races off, leaving unfinished plot elements and the audience behind. I wasn't the only one sighing in the theater. And there were instances of people giggling at the film, as opposed to giggling with the film.Now with a lot of work, this film could have been an amusing homage to horror films....or it could have been an amusing turkey. I wish they had cut, say 20 minutes of wire-swinging to do just that and changed the overall tone from...from..ludicrous to comedy. It wouldn't have made the film good, but it would have made it average, and possibly entertaining.There can only be one grade for this boring mess: a 1 (out of 5 or 10 either one).",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Let's Keep Things In Perspective...,"First off, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of the early Universal horror movies. These movies created the genre. My understanding was that Van Helsing was a modern, CGI-heavy homage to those early movies. The movie even begins where the Son Of Frankenstein left off. Except for the stellar perfomance of Karloff in The Mummy and the first 2 Frankenstein movies, almost all of the rest of the early Universal Dracula/Frankenstein/Wolfman movies were fun (and sometimes silly) popcorn movies. True, there was not a lot of room in this movie for deep acting and the story might even be considered campy, but that's ok. It was a fun addition to the Universal horror tradition.  I liked Jackman's Van Helsing character and David Wenham was great. There were a few questionable bits of dialog, a bad accent here and there, some borderline CG, etc, etc...but I enjoyed the movie a great deal.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This film is horrible!!!,"I didn't want to see Van Helsing in the first place, but my friends talked me into it.  I was not disappointed because I went into the film with low expectations.  My expectations proved valid.  What the makers of this film have done to the character of Van Helsing is a disgrace.  In the original Dracula novel, Professor Van Helsing is the scientist and scholar who uses his wisdom and knowledge to defeat the evil of Dracula.  Its sort of a metaphor of science's victory over superstition.The makers of the Van Helsing films have taken this character and turned him into a long haired, pretty boy vampire hunter more akin to Buffy the Vampire Slayer than the character for which he is named.  Doing this to Van Helsing would be like taking Sherlock Holmes and turning him into a Rambo like character that blasts Professor Moriarty with machine guns.  I am sick of modern movie makers taking gothic horror stories, situations, and characters, and turning them into amped-up action films.  Now, the one exception would be the Mummy, because they did do a good update to that character, a big improvement over the old bandage swathed skulking villain of yesteryear.That being said, they could have made an acceptable action based film of this sort, with the Van Helsing character.  You make Van Helsing true to what his character should be (the old, wise scientist), and team him up with a young Hugh Jackman character that is a vampire hunter.  Brains and brawn brought together to defeat the monsters.  But what they did with this film is absolutely disgraceful.The only good thing that has come out of Van Helsing's release is that Universal has re-released many of the classic horror films from the 30's and 40's to DVD as a marketing tool.  I will buy the old films on DVD.  When Van Helsing comes out on DVD, it will not be on my shopping list.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Boring, loud and obnoxious","Being a fan of the classic Universal horror pictures, I was both dreading and looking forward to, this movie.  I walked out after one hour.  Loud, no sense of direction, dark, horrible CGI and terrible acting.  Particularly on the part of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula.  The ""brides"" were laughable.  The Wolfman was a total waste.  Another example of too much CGI, not enough real makeup.  I'd rather watch The Howling.  Most of the CGI scenes were dark scenes, especially the Wolfman scenes....always a sign of trouble.I recommend avoiding this film and sticking with the classics.  Go get the Monster Collection DVD and see the difference between great cinema (The Bride Of Frankenstein) and this wretched waste of time (Van Helsing).",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The mad adrenaline and non-stop action makes  up for the at best  weak plot.,"I'm not certain why so many people hated this movie. I think it's because they expected something fantastic, Oscar-material, CGI laden action with deep philosophical ruminations, etc...No. Van Helsing isn't like that. The plot is at it's very best weak, there are obvious stupidities, and the acting, while not at all bad, is really unremarkable. But Van Helsing makes up for it by having boundless energy. The movie doesn't stop for one moment, piling acting upon action upon action sequences. All of that stuff about automatic crossbows, miniature bombs, and life-experiments... that's all bull. Of course it is. But it looks extremely good on screen, so just accept it and enjoy the fast-paced action.The acting... well, varied. Princess Anna was quite unconvincing to me. Too much pathos and drama, not enough regality (although again, that's just my opinion). Van Helsing, Carl, and Velkan were all on the level, convincing, and sometimes even very good (I particularly like that little line after Van Helsing shoots quite a few baby vampires. 'Now that I have your attention'.) Count Dracula was quite brilliant, and I believe that is the best role of vampire/scientist gone mad I have seen. His evil is believable, and his manner of speech is perfect for the role: a bit drawling, aloof, mocking. Best of all, he actually LOOKS the part. He is quite tall, equine, and there is the mark of those graced with aristocratic disregard for human life.Should you watch Van Helsing? Sure. But not if you need a quiet night in. Gather around with some friends, watch it on a big screen with good surround sound.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Special FX,"A fantastic film, see the special effects and drool, and the imagination and scope of the designers on this film. I enjoyed the film throughout, not sure what age rating it will receive as there are some scenes that are rather scary and I am a 25 year old bloke!Could have done without the James Bond style refs at the start of the film, and maybe its a tad too long, but the humour in the film balances out the scary parts of the flick. Put it this way it is a far superior film than the League of Gentlemen which is in the same genre, Coltrane's Mr Hyde is excellent compared to LoG! Jackman & Beckinsale are fine in this but don't expect any oscar nominations for either. The support Friar chap is funny, and helps tone down Van Helsings macho bravado.All in all its not going to move arthouse film lovers in the same way that it will move popcorn movie fans. You get exactly what you expect from the posters, big special fx amazing scenery and location work, a visual feast that takes the vampire hunter film genre up a big notch or three. Look forward to the TV spin off, hope its as good as the film was.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining,"I must admit that the lukewarm reviews here where rather discouraging to me, notwithstanding I watched it today (08 May 2004)and found it really entertaining.I believe it is somewhat underrated here so far. May be the expectations were too high. To me if we avoid comparisons to the Mummy or the Indiana Jones movies ""Van Helsing"" could be enjoyed on its own merit. It is, certainly, not a classic (some more humour would have done substantial impact in this regard) but still it worths watching. It is not overloaded with thought provoking sequences, while the action scenes are both dynamic and surprising. Altogether...enjoyable. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Horrible,"Yikes! What a bombastic, over-the-top, third rate CGI fantasy ride.I'm not sure what Jackman and Beckinsale thought they signed up for, but when they sat back and watched the film, after all the ""special defects"" were worked in during post-production, I'm sure they whimpered and felt as cheated as future audiences did.Besides a ho-hum storyline, the tale was plagued by clichés (including a cookie cutter sidekick that was intelligent, yet meek as well as goofy), and extraordinarily weak matte paintings and CGI. Heck, some of the CGI almost mirrored the claymation of old in its unrealistic stiffness.Most scenes, however, were drawn out to the point where they lost any hold on the viewer. Even worse, many of the human characters, no matter how much pain and suffering they endured at the hands of vampires, werewolves and such, brushed themselves off with barely a scratch and moved on. Please.Weak, trite, boring and not worth watching except for maybe a laugh.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great acting :),"The acting in the movie was great. :)  Not to mention I'm a big Hugh Jackman fan (grin)But seriously, I really did enjoy the Hugh's portrayal of Van Helsing, especially his sarcastic wit.However, I made the mistake of watching this from the front row right after getting new glasses.  For, as wonderful as I liked the acting, the humor (even a hint of a wolverine joke here and there) I felt the action was too ""busy"".  I'm not saying I don't like action, but it felt like there was just too much at once, so instead of concentrating and getting pumped up by the action, I tended to blank out a little from it.Personally, if it was up to me, there'd have been a little less action, and a little more about Van Helsing's past.There was however one part of the movie I felt was useless.  Do we really need to see a Friar having sex?  Sure, it was just hinted at (them waking up together, basically clothed) but enough already. GAK.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""A tremendous, entertaining spectacular!","This movie was awesome! Some of the most famous monsters in the history offiction are brought to life and must be defeated by one awesome hero!This movie is quite a dark and Gothic film with many terrifying monsters. The first monster that Van Helsing fights is Mr Hyde but the main monsters he fights in the film are werewolves and vampires, which include of course Count Dracula! Van Helsing is the most awesome action hero I've seen in years. He has manytricks up his sleeve and is able to put up with so much punishment. No wonder he is 'The one name they all fear'. Hugh Jackman was excellent in the role as this relentless monster hunter. Kate Blancett was excellent as Anna Valerious she was one extraordinary and tough female character. I also really likedDracula's wives they were both beautiful and very deadly!Just like 'The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen' this movie has helped re- create a group of nineteenth characters for a new generation, as well as create an action packed hero who is as brave and tough as Indiana Jones. I highlyrecommend this movie!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Defintely see it while it's in theaters,"Don't have a huge critique planned, but I think an opinion is in order. First, I really liked seeing this movie, Hugh Jackman is awesome and needs to do more action flicks. There was constant action and though predictable at times, it was funny at times, made you jump once or twice, and was kate beckinsale is a full blown bombshell. Second, the problem I can see that people would have with it is there are unnecessary scenes, like the ending, no spoiler here, but it was a little drawn out. However, to those people I ask what would you have done to make those spots better? I can't really think of much, and I was impressed enough by the rest of the movie to where the little sratches were barely noticable. A huge problem is people forget this is a movie, because I am so sick of hearing ""it's unrealistic"" or whatever. The point of a movie like this is you sorta check out at the door, and hold on for a ride. If you go see this movie you dont have to be a dummy while watching...but just go to be told a story and entertained, not taught a life lesson, or search for redeeming value. I hope you all love it as much as I did.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very Good Summer Fare,"Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"", like his two most previous efforts ""The Mummy"" and its sequel ""The Mummy Returns"", are very good summer fare. The kind of film you can go into with a big bucket of popcorn to enjoy some escapist fun for a few hours. But it is no more than that. Hugh Jackman is good as the title character as well as all the players, but if you're expecting something great, you're in for a very disappointing experience. The plot plays out very much like a Bond film with a loner hero, a beautiful woman ally, an evil megalomaniac intent on ruling the world, and even a lot of high-tech gadgets (which are EXTREMELY implausible for the time period but who cares?). This film has NOTHING to do with realism. This is, as I said, very good escapism. Sommers obviously has great love for the monster movie genre and it is very appropriate that Universal Studios is the studio it comes from since most of the great classic monster movies that this film pays homage to came from this studio seventy years ago. Ironically, however, those classics, who helped to save Universal from the verge of bankruptcy all those years ago, serves as the inspiration for this film whose budget will certainly never be made back from the domestic box-office grosses. But this is really beside the point. If you want to get out of the summer heat and be entertained for a f hours, check your critical brain at the door and have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad beyond belief,"I have never been a fan of big budget summer blockbusters, but at least a few of them were mindless, fun popcorn movies. I had a reasonable hope that Van Helsing would at least be watchable. After five minutes I knew that it would be a struggle to sit through. Where do I begin? The lousy looking CGI? The terrible plot? The lame script? How about the acting which could not have been worse had it been performed by sock puppets. The ""actor"" who played Dracula was less frightening than the Count on Sesame Street. Hugh Jackman simply looks like he lost a bet to appear in the film...and the eye candy vampire brides have all the talent of the cast of any Girls Gone Wild DVD you can find. Aren't monsters supposed to be scary? Then someone explain the stupid looking Mr. Hyde at the begining of the movie who looks like a Shrek wannabe...Shrek is more frightening.

Enjoyable.,"Most movies are made for people to let their imagination roam free, this is one of the movie where you can enjoy watching by doing just that ! I think the action is great and the special effects top notch, who cares if there are loop holes in the story or its not realistic , after all its not a drama or a true to life story. Van Helsing have all the action, adventure, horror, comedy and fun you can ask for in a movie. Hugh and Kate did a great job of bringing the story to life. So my advise to all is go see this movie , sit back and relax and let your imagination roam free for the 2 hours ! I would rate this movie 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining Horror film.,"The genre is horror. Its a vampire film. But the intention of the film is to deliver entertainment. The horrifying propaganda of the blood thirsty Dracula and the strategy of Van-Helsing to stop him forms the storyline. Some ideas are praiseworthy in the film like : Unifying different faiths to wage war upon Dracula, different scientific strategies in the Medieval Era despite it's well known for religiosity, Frankenstein as an optimist character etc. The gothic feel with all its VFX sorrounding the transylvanian scenario is captivating, spooky and worth watching. There are some moments where Van Helsing becomes irrational and funky, which will give you a laugh. But as a whole it is good to watch, and you will feel the positive ending right from start despite Dracula's presence.Performances are good and funny. Even Darcula's gothic flavoured deliveries seems entertaining rather than horrific. The narratives are less matured, a bit fast paced, well built action scenes set up amidst medieval tools and weaponry. The brightest points are the pieces of ideas viz myths, science actions that pushes the characters go forward. But the same cannot be said of the visuals, which is pretty aesthetic in depiction. The BGM too gives the positive vibes.I don't ignore the metaphorical side of such Fantasy based films. The same goes for Van Helsing too. Here Van Helsing is pointed out as the left hand of God. He is chosen to do the dirty but moral job, as per the theological doctrine. In real world, I feel this job is horrifying, breaks the heart of millions. But in the movie it is portrayed in the realm of fantasy, suitable for watching esp for kids. A simple film of good vs bad with amazing fantastical set ups, where bad having a dark agenda and good stops him with his friends. Its an entertainment film by all standards. On a scale of 100 it would be 68.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lot of money and a big hat,"This is simply the worst film I have ever seen. It is mind-rotting muck of the highest category, and is written and directed by a man who should at all costs be prevented from churning out any more of this dumb garbage (see also THE MUMMY, and that other polyp on the backside of film-making: THE MUMMY RETURNS).Hugh Jackman is a fine actor and given the right script and character he can be extremely watchable, ditto Kate Beckinsale, but both are wasted here, being given cruelly awful dialogue, and characters with all the depth and interest of an episode of SCOOBY DOO.Speaking of which I've read lots of reviews on-line by enthusiastic(presumably) 13 year olds who say how great the CGI effects in this film are. Cobblers. It just looks like a lot of money has been spent on creating a lot of very cartoon-like images designed to give the viewer sensory overload and prevent him/her from actually THINKING. Naturally this has much in common with video arcade games, and so those with a mental age of 12 or below are more likely to be impressed.The biggest offence that this film caused me is the fact that writer/director Stephen Sommers claimed to have been ""inspired"" by the classic Universal horror movies of the 1930's and '40's. Aaaaarrrghhh! This film has NOTHING but the names of the characters in common with masterpieces like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, WEREWOLF OF London etc. These films had atmosphere, great performances, characterization, a sense for romanticism and for the eeriness of the supernatural...all qualities that this excrescence of a film cries out to be blessed with. VAN HELSING has errr...a lot of money thrown at it and Hugh Jackman in a big hat.I cannot tell you how much I hated the performances - the guy who played Dracula was about as effective a replacement for Bela Lugosi as a pencil would have been. But worse...so much worse was the bloke who played the comic sidekick monk. His barely-disguised irritating Australasian accent didn't help matters, but he just came across as an unfunny moron one just ached to see impaled on one of those silly crossbow bolts that Jackman was firing hither and yon. What did they teach him at drama school?My abiding memory of watching this putrid rubbish,(and indeed the only happy one of the entire film-going experience)was the roar of laughter in the cinema when Kate Beckinsale's ludicrously accented gypsy got killed and Van Helsing in werewolf form let out an absurd howl of grief. It reminded me of Oscar Wilde's comment on the death of Little Nell in THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP - to paraphrase: it is impossible not to be overcome with mirth.Terrible, just terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good entertainment,"Although the script writer has taken unlimited liberties with the plots of both classic novels Dracula and Frankenstein, you cannot deny the blatant entertainment offered by this movie. The plot still works and the portrayal of the monsters and vampires, most notably Dracula's brides, is made superbly. Kate Beckinsale is very attractive as Anna Valerious and is the star of the show. Unfortunately, this is not matched by Hugh Jackman's performance as Van Helsing, but this does little to reduce the entertainment. Van Helsing has been unfairly over-criticised, but it never pretends to be anything other than a fun action/adventure movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So many monsters...,"I really did not know what to expect from Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" at least from the trailers. Was it going to be a light-hearted adventure, a classic tale of good versus evil, or just plain silly and entertaining? A key draw is Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, who is a great stage and screen actor, and this movie generation's classic leading man. Kate Beckinsale is a talented and versatile actress, who is stunningly beautiful. Well, ""Van Helsing"" is all of that, and possibly has the most monsters per capita, than any movie in recent memory. These are not exactly ""props"". Sommers' movie not only opens in black and white; it also dense packs Dr. Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster, and Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). And there are more monsters to come including, the Werewolf, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Fortunately, Director Sommers ends the movie well in the last 45 minutes or so, melding the story together after a very unfocused and chaotic start. Credit Jackman and Breckensale for keeping our attention amidst the chaos. They are very attractive actors, who also have a natural chemistry. ""Van Helsing"" ends up being a wild fun ride.Perhaps the best thing about Van Helsing is Hugh Jackman. He has a commanding presence, a great voice, and is totally charismatic. It also seems that this younger vampire hunter Van Helsing, the nemesis of Dracula, has been reinvented for Jackman. He is similar to X-Men's Logan, who has a mysterious past and no memory of it. Also it seems that this Van Helsing is much like a James Bond for the Vatican-- James Bond may be the next role in Jackman's near future. Anyway, Van Helsing is off to Transylvania with cool weapons invented by sidekick Carl (the Vatican's ""Q"") to vanquish the evil Count Dracula. There they join forces with the warrior Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). The Valerious family has sworn vengeance on Dracula over the centuries. In an intriguing twist, it turns out that Dracula holds the key to Van Helsing's past.Then the story becomes extremely convoluted. Jekyll and Hyde are thrown in for no reason. Dracula requires Frankenstein's monster to ensure his legacy. Van Helsing must stop Dracula before he himself is turned to a Werewolf. This really would give something away if the story were more coherent, but it is not. The special effects in Van Helsing are state-of-the-art; however, the writing is not. Sommers does recover at the end-- it ends satisfyingly. Apparently, Van Helsing has a presold sequel. Perhaps, that will be more story and character driven, and the role expanded deserving of Jackman's talents. Jackman is good here regardless. He plays Van Helsing as darkly heroic, romantic, and intense. He also displays a sense of humor. Kate Beckinsale is strong and charming as Van Helsing's partner and love interest. They are a great looking couple, and that does not hurt the movie.""Van Helsing"" is silly fun, though it is frustrating to watch at times. It has enough star power from Jackman and Beckinsale, to engage and entertain for a couple of hours. A few less monsters and a cohesive story may have made a big difference.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worse than I imagined  (1/2*),"""Van Helsing"" could very well be the funniest movie of 2004. The only problem is that the parts that are SUPPOSED to be funny aren't funny at all, and all the parts that AREN'T supposed to be funny are hysterical. This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and not in a good way.Hugh Jackman plays the famous titular character (who I don't believe was ever envisioned as a swarthy superhero, but oh well), who is sort of like the James Bond of whatever century this is set in (I didn't care enough to notice). He has gadgets, works for the Catholic church, and goes around killing monsters.While the original character of Van Helsing was only after Dracula, this Van Helsing also fights Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, and in the first horribly bad scene in the movie, Mr. Hyde (who is shown here as a sort of ultra fake-looking giant pudgy caveman).There are simply too many idiotic parts in this movie that I couldn't possibly recite them all. There's Kate Beckinsale's ludicrous ""gypsy"" accent (""Ze Frankenstein monsta!""), Richard Roxburgh (who was great in ""Moulin Rouge"") playing one of the worst Draculas in movie history, the terrible ""brides of Dracula"" (one of them taunts Van Helsing with the devastating grade school put-down ""Too bad. So sad!""), the dopey comic relief, the complete over-use of (badly done) CGI... I could go on and on. And I haven't even mentioned Jackman bounding around in a loincloth, or the ""funny sidekick"" played by David Wenham who I was dearly hoping would get killed.On the plus side, there are some pretty nice sights here and there, of mountains and castles and such. All completely fake of course.Some movies can be dumb in a smart way (like the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies), or at least dumb in an entertaining way. ""Van Helsing"", though it certainly has enough unintentional laugh-out-loud moments to make it slightly bearable, is so dumb and so long (almost 2 1/2 hours!) that it ends up draining the energy from you instead of giving you a surreal good time, like the best ""bad"" movies can do.Combining all the classic monsters into one film is a nice idea, but it was already done in 1987, in ""The Monster Squad"", one of my favorite horror movies as a kid. That movie was much scarier than this piece of crap, and was INTENTIONALLY funny. So rent that instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Fun,"If you go see Van Helsing as an adult you will not like this movie. You have to go in as a child. This is not a movie to make you think. It is simply grand entertainment. There are scary moments, but it is really bloodless movie making. No heads flying off, or blood squirting all over the place. The acting is as good as can be expected. The music by Alan Silvestri is superb. The effects are amazing. Van Helsing is meant to be pure entertainment. And on those terms it is great. I was really wondering how putting Dracula, Wolfman, and Frankenstein in the same picture was going to work out, but this mixture was great. Leave being an adult outside the theater. Go in as a kid and enjoy the ride.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Bad,"Some nice tributes to the old films. Thought Dracula was way too campy even for this.CGI intensive and a few spring out shocks. I liked movies when people did stunts. Although the CGI effects just keep getting better and better when you watch an older movie it was so much more tense when you knew it was an actual person doing the stunt. I'd like them to do a Wolfman movie with a more serious take on it as the opening Wolfman capture was quite exciting. I guess this was okay for todays 13 year-olds, probably even 10 year olds. By the end I was tired of so many fantastic jumping and flying tricks. Are there really that many people who get off on this phony looking stuff? But it was entertaining and I like Hugh Jackman and I just want Kate Beckinsale very badly. She has the power to cloud my mind and make me loose all reason.

Fun But Frustrating Adventure Film,"Van Helsing was made when director Stephen Sommers was at the height of his popularity after the success of the first two Mummy films. Starring Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and Richard Roxburgh Van Helsing is shot in the style of The Mummy films with the same sort of CGI used. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are great here both putting in strong performances, however Roxburgh's performance as Dracula is way too hammy at times. Van Helsing could have been great, there are some tremendous scenes including the Jekyll and Hyde scene at the beginning and the attack on the village scene where Jackman is defending it with his crossbow. However there are some really weak scenes, notably anything with Roxburgh in and this makes Van Helsing a frustrating watch as it feels uneven both in pacing and performance. The score by Alan Silversti is strong and this really drives the film in certain places. Van Helsing is a fun film and i always enjoy watching it as it provides action and adventure and i can recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it, it is just a shame it is so uneven as it had the potential to be one of the greats.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stop Sommers Before He Kills Again!,"As a fan of 1) good horror films, 2) Bram Stoker's novel, 3) Murnau, Browning, and Terence Fisher's 'Dracula' takes, 4) Peter Cushing; and having detested Stephen Sommers' 'Mummy' films, and having read all the reviews, I was not exactly in a great hurry to see this film. But I was willing put my purist's taste in the closet, along with my critical faculties, all my higher brain functions in fact, and just take this as zippy moving wallpaper, and finally renting it on the cheap on DVD, I found that even my spectacularly low expectations were not only stooped to but surpassed by this woefully empty exercise in CGI doodling off. The 3-page script I would reckon to have been packed together by a bunch of excitable pre-teens riffing on their favorite Horror and Adventure flicks, but I suspect such kids would have provided more solid characterization and plotting than this thing provides. Firstly Mr Sommers et al toss out everything that was interesting and meaningful about the Van Helsing character and the Dracula legend and fill in the gaps with a lot of agony aunt superhero stuff and a few good ideas (the secret Vatican anti-monster force, the warrior Gypsy clan) that are of no interest whatsoever to them, as they are only interested in layering on effects and stunts, the cumulative effect of which is incredibly boring. Making the heroes nearly as indestructible as the villains - as in the bit where Kate Beckinsale falls about four stories down through a tree's branches and lands with nary a scratch - really helps to make you care and believe in them.As with many modern movies, it is magnificently shot and dazzlingly designed, but provides no sensual pleasure whatsoever in its technical wizardry. Hugh Jackman does the intense superhero bit surprisingly well and all he requires is a script with lines of dialogue that make sense. Richard Roxburgh I wish would stop playing villains, for here as in 'Moulin Rouge' he goes right off the deep end with a stupidly campy performance. Beckinsale lacks steel, humor, and anything resembling sex appeal; I've followed her career since 'Cold Comfort Farm' and she gets duller by the passing year. David Wenham, the most talented of the three Aussies wasting themselves here, manages to make a couple of lines work with a good comic act. Compare this film to the genius of Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' (from which it steals a steroid-pumped version of the coach chase) which combined old and modern movie tropes so cleverly. At the point when I checked how much of it I had sat through - 81 minutes - and realized it still had something like 40-50 minutes to go, it was high time for the eject button.

One of my absolute favs!,"I have watched this movie so many times that I can practically quote it. If you like vampires and Hugh Jackman, this is right up your alley. Sure, this movie is never going to win an Oscar, but it's so fun. There are some parts that the cgi looks a little fakey. But if you don't heavily critique it and just take it for what it is, you'll love it. Hugh Jackman is great like always...and Kate Beckinsale is beautiful. Just watch it...at least once. It's directed by Stephen Sommers, who directed the Mummy with Brendan Fraser. If you liked that movie, you'll love this one. It's basically like the mummy, but it's vampires, werewolves and the Frankenstein monster.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

FUN MONSTERS MOVIE,"The famed monster hunter is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula, who is using searches of Dr. Frankestein and a werewolf for sinister intentions.

Better than the critics think,"Van Helsing/2004/***Main Stars:Hugh JackmanGood action! Good acting! Good story! The main point for this movie was to catch this creature named ""Dracula."" During this movie, Dracula develops baby vampires by electricity to conquer the whole town of Transylvania so he can rule it along with his other billion sons and daughters. Of course Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) will stop him! Many critics thought this movie was very quirky. Other critics did not, like me. Anyway, Van Helsing had to go through this huge adventure of trying to kill Dracula. There are many other details along with this movie but I want you to see it for yourself. This is a good movie please see it! Movie directed by Stephen Sommers",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugh Jackman call your agent,"I must admit, I wanted to like this film. I like Hugh Jackman, but Kate Beckinsale is absolutely wooden in this. The CGI made it more like a comic book than it probably needed to look. This film suffers primarily from its inability to decide whether or not it is self-aware (like the Mummy and the Phantom) with making jokes and asides, or with being dramatic (as in Coppola's version of Dracula). This Dracula seems too campy and not quite sinister. Switching back and forth was a huge mistake.The second problem with this movie is that too much is borrowed or sampled from other movies; too much Bond, too much imaging from the aforementioned Dracula. The high tech weaponry looks cool the first time out, but gets old quick. Much of the existing scenery is overblown as well, castles all out of whack with symetrical design and utility. They would have been better off sticking to formulaic horror movie. Someone call me when Anthony Hopkins plays van Helsing.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The first good film *about* postmodernism - funny as hell, and cleverer than 'Foucault's Pendulum'.","There are 2 kinds of people who'll understand this film.1-) Sane, unpretentious people with real lives who understand that most people go to the cinema *to be amused*. The kind of person who enjoys early Jackie Chan films.If you're one of these people you can stop reading now, just go and watch Van Helsing - it's like 2 hours of watching early bugs bunny cartoons, it's fun and it's a damn sight smarter than anything you can read in a college text book.2-) Really, really pretentious people like me who have seen all the old films this references, and have read the extraordinary league of gentlemen, and borges, and various bluffer's guides to beaudrillard (post matrix, obviously).The only people who *won't* like this film are wannabe-intellectuals who HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOUR.Attacking this film for its vacuity is exactly the same as attacking 'Airplane' for being unrealistic. It's a silly thing to say.Despite the fact that every second of this film involves a blatant pastiche, it is not simply some lame 'Scream' stylee postmodern film - *it is a postmodern film ABOUT postmodernism*. And a very, very witty and erudite one: frankenstein's creature QUOTES NIETZSCHE to the slayer-hero for heaven's sake {it should be obvious which famous quote he says... See? it's funny AND smart}The use of Mr Hyde, stolen straight from 'the league'?Well, that's not the real trope being referenced in that scene.The real reference is to Alan Moore's trope of overt misappropriation of tropes (in this case Hyde is the hunchback of notre dame, in the same way that in  extraordinary league volume 2 Dr Moreau kills the Martians).The whole film is a set of arch references to the very idea of arch referencing, which is, from a pretentious theory point of view, a lot more interesting than the usual arch references to other arch references.This film is a master piece. There's a conversation in it that goes something like this:""How did your father try to find Dracula's lair?""""He spent years staring and staring at the map...""That would be Borges' map they're talking about.If you do not like this film, you are wrong, and not as smart as you think you are.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much action - lack of story,"After being served for nearly two hours of constant action, I could finally relax and breath. ""Van Helsing"" is filled with constant action, wicked combats, endless effects loaded together with some quick comments. I do think the whole movie started up well, but the more it developed the bigger the lack of story got, and the more action I was fed with. I think they went to much ""Matrix"" here, and lost the very important balance between having a good (deep) story and having awesome scenes of combat. Anyways, I experienced this piece at the cinema and I think that is a big plus, at least that is my conclusion. With all those visual effects and the astonishing audio experience it must be experienced at the cinema (or perhaps at home with some awesome audio equipment).As my head still feels a little wicked and as I probably haven't really melted the piece yet, I still think that 6 out of 10 is a fair grade for ""Van Helsing"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a good movie.,"I'm surprised some people have complained about this movie. it seems people don't know what a good movie is anymore. Entertaining from start to finish, and looks spectacular. Amazingly beautiful effects and cinematography. Excellent camera work - I loved the way the camera is not silky smooth, but has very subtle imperfections and roughness which adds to the authenticity of the CGI.Some of the effects are not good, such as when the characters jump around unnaturally like cartoon characters. This is still a problem in 3d character effects - the movement looks too fake. But these are minor faults in an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable movie that never lets up the action and spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great on effects and photography, short on story","This is probably one of the most beautifully shot FX films in a long time, capturing the dark moody atmosphere of the early German impressionistic films, using some of the best background mattes seen in a long time. Unfortunately the skimpy story-line doesn't hold up for the long running time and audiences will start to get bored way before the end title. Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious are perfect in their roles. Richard Roxburgh has a wonderful time chewing-up all the scenery available as the campy Count Vladislaus Dracula and David Wenham brings comedy-relief to the side-kick part of Carl. Even though the ending will come as a surprise (and a disappointment) for most general audiences, anyhow this visually handsome film should do GREAT business in the boxoffice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waiting for my Money Back,"Ahh...I waited for months to see this movie, only to be truly disappointed with it in the end. The SFX were phenomenal, and Kate Beckinsale was, as always, truly a spectacle to behold, but the script was bland and boring. The werewolves were pretty cool, but Dracula was too flamboyant and Frankenstein's monster was just plain annoying. And it seemed like the movie would never end. It just kept going on and on -- desperately trying to revitalize itself, but to no avail. In the end, I was wishing Dracula would come suck my blood so that Van Helsing could hunt me down and kill me.

The one name they all fear...,"Van Helsing is a Universal Horror picture, made some fifty years after the Universal Horror era. It stars actors Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham, and it was directed by Stephen Sommers.The movie begins inside an original Universal Horror picture, Frankenstein. Shot in black white, and staring Sam West as Doctor Victor Frankenstein, who, when in costume, looks surprisingly alike Colin Clive, who played Doctor Frankenstein in the original Frankenstein movie. After having seen West yell ""It's Alive!"" several times, seen Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein Monster wake up, and seen the townsfolk charge up to Frankensteins laboratory with pitchforks, flames and battle rams, we are stunned by Richard Roxburgh's performance as Count Dracula, showing us an amazing, and very different interpretation on Dracula, than we have seen in the past. In the first scene, we see some great visual effects, (it appears to be the same Computer Generated Images as used for the cursed pirates in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".) Strangely enough, there are no credits, not even a title card, but we do get to see Van Helsings name on a wanted poster in this next scene of the movie. Van Helsing is in Paris, hunting 'Mr Edward Hyde', voiced by the fabulous, Robbie Coltraine, a cannibalistic, Computer Generated character who appears to be at least eight foot tall, separating itself from the Metro Goldwyn Mayer movies (Universal never made a Doctor Jeckyll and Mr Hyde movie as a part of their horror genre), in which Mr Hyde was a short, crippled man. When returning from an action packed fight with Mr Hyde, to a secret society consisting of all the known religions in the world, Van Helsing is given his next assignment, he must go to Transylvania, and kill Count Dracula, before Count Dracula kills the Valerious family, who, if are killed before Dracula is killed, will never enter the gates of heaven.Having established where we stand in this world, and that men can drink potions and become hideous beasts, men can create life via robbing body parts of others, and that vampires exist, we now get to see one of Universals most loved monsters... The Wolf Man. The wolf doesn't charge around on all fours all the time, as the Werewolf does in 'An American Werewolf in London', yet it doesn't always walk around on two legs like the wolf does in films such as 'The Wolf Man' and 'Werewolf of London'. It is a mixture of both. They run and charge at their prey on all fours, yet when they walk they walk around on their hind legs, like a human. The wolves seem to be huge in size, and the speed they run at suggests that no human can outrun them even with a head start.These are not the only characters included in this film from the classics, Igor from Frankenstein, makes a good B villain, and much more characters are included as the story progresses.Alan Slyvestri, the composer of the memorable and powerful music of the Back to the Future films, doesn't let us down, and provides a once-again powerful musical score, with a score you would expect to find in modern movies, and at the same time, gives us music you would find in the Universal Horror Classics.The film displays some excellent acting talents, especially those of Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxburgh. Also, I might add, the visual effects in the film are definitely Industrial Light and Magic, displaying 'their' true talents. They are undoubtedly, the best of the best, when it comes to CGI. Stephen Sommers also shows us some great writing talents and some fantastic shots.This is definitely one of my all time favorite films. Anyone who enjoys a good Universal Horror picture, should watch this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Mostly screaming, laughing and melodrama","While this movie is good fun for people looking for JUST fun, I personally can't get past the insane amount of screaming and melodrama.This movie reminds me of an amateur Shakespeare play; it's got the heart but they need time to tone down the theatrics. While watching I had a feeling that everyone was told to be as exaggerated as possible; from the accents to the words spoken and the actions of the characters, everything felt like someone parodying live plays.Dracula, The Brides and Frankenstein's Monster in particular are hard to watch in my opinion. They mostly scream and laugh and Frankenstein's actor gives off such an overly theatrical performance with his constant opera-style screaming and exaggerated movements. Dracula talks and looks like an edge lord, he often speaks in partial whispers and nasally and strange phonetics which makes his performance quite grating. The Brides are just bad, all around. Nothing against the actresses since I'm sure they are just doing what the director and writer gave them, but they are so damn cartoonishly dramatic that it's hard to take anything they do seriously.Kate Beckinsale is surprisingly bad, oh my god is she bad. Her accent makes my ears hurt and my stomach turn with how cringey it is. I get that Transylvanians are supposed to be somewhat dramatic but lord almighty. Hugh Jackman is charismatic as always but even his performance isn't much to write home about, even though he's clearly trying. David Wenham is also very enjoyable. He's funny, quirky and all around fun to watch, no real critiques.The effects, while probably good for the time, have not aged well. For a movie with a $160 million the effects should have been much better. On top of that, the overall aesthetic is far to dark and grimy, and not in a Tim Burton way, but a ""turn up the brightness and wipe off the monitor way""If fun is what you want, you could do far worse than this movie. It's silly, campy fun but most certainly has its many faults for film buffs and enthusiasts such as myself.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Yet whilst understanding those things, it does for a reason hold above average ratings on the big internet movie sites. It did find a market (and continues to do so), it's like one big long MTV video, a sort of chaotic monster fun frolic in rock opera style.It's effects laden, which is no great thing since they are shoddy, and the dialogue is often as cringe worthy as some of the accents are. Yet it's still a thrilling ride, a strap yourself in and run with it job, to be in the company of sexy lead actors in Gothic garb and devilish period surrounds.Loud and boisterous for sure, and tacky at times, but exhilarating all the same for those after some pure escapist carnage. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The visual effects are really great, and they blend in well. And the story ... well, it's not quite linear, but has appealing twists and turns.In summary, this movie is better than many others.

So bad it's good,"Pretty much what we were expecting from Sommers: cardboard characters, bad dialogue, bad script, great CGI action sequences.The first half of the film is great, especially the black and white Frankenstein scene, Dracula's eccentric speeches as he walks the castle, and Mr Hyde: the film's best CGI character.Jackman and Beckinsale look great but are given little to do but run and fight so their characters aren't as interesting and you don't care for them as much as you should.  And this is the film's biggest mistake.  If Sommers had cut an action scene or two and replaced them with smaller more intimate moments, this could have been something special.  As it is, it's just enjoyable trash with nice expensive CGI and great production values.I liked the ending but as I said, since the characters aren't rounded, we don't feel the strong emotions we should.  Van Helsing is so bad it's good.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Monstrosity,"With a plot that is pieced together much like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, this movie almost singlehandedly destroys the romance of the classic horror films which precede it. It's not the actors' fault. They can hardly be faulted for dialog that lacks the charm of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". On the contrary, Jackman, Beckinsale, Roxburgh, Wenham and Hensley give good performances within the limits of the material they are given to work with. The special effects are passable--at times even engaging; the direction and cinematography, tolerable if somewhat derivative.It is the script itself which is the problem. It fails as horror, a genre which requires at least some minimal degree of psychological involvement. It fails as thriller for, when Van Helsing finally confronts the moment of truth, this viewer simply did not care. It fails in clarity because it is not possible to parse whether our Van Helsing is a force for good or whether he is simply an amoral 007 on a mission from God. In his own words, he is something of a murderer and something of a destroyer of evil. However, the script never allows him to reveal any conflict between the two.In summary, this is an adventure without conflict, more monstrous than of monsters, more horrible than of horror.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"mindless, entertaining romp...","...those are the first words which spring automatically to mind when asked to review 'Van Helsing'. I had been anticipating this movie for little over two months, after I found out Sommers had casted Kate Beckinsale. Without her, I probably wouldn't have been so psyched up about it.I saw it last night on preview and lemme say first off, I don't give a toss what the critics think - or those who continue to diss the movie before even seeing it. I, personally, went for Kate and for what I got of her, it left me with a tingling, warm fuzzy sensation. I thought the whole movie, overall was fun. that's what I went for. Mindless fun. Some entertainment on a Thursday night. LXG this movie was not. And thank god.So basic overview of the plot - Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man set out to rid the world of evil do-ers. He becomes the most wanted man in Europe after killing Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde in his opening scenes in Paris. Then he is sent on a mission to Romania to help the Valerious family defeat the legendary count, Dracula (an unimpressive Richard Roxborough). All the Valerious clan has been killed and it's two remaining descendents are Velkan (Will Kemp) and his sister, Princess Anna (Kate Beckinsale). Working together, they set about to eliminate Dracula and his three vampire brides in a bid to help each desceased member of the Valerious family get into the gates of heaven.The sets and scenery were fantastic, really impressive. Likewise are the Wolfman transformations. Will Kemp is absolutely goregous; definately a rising star. The Friar character is essentially, the movie's only form of humor - which was lacking a bit. Even when Van Helsing tried to employ his own humor, it kinda backfired...quite a number of the audience laughed at the Friar's lines/un-intended puns and jokes - and we had a full audience.Casting wise; I don't think Roxbourgh cuts it as the legendary foe. I fear this man will become a typecast for bad guys; i) the duke in 'Moulin Rouge' and ii) the bad guy in last year's truely rotten 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'... Likewise with the three vampire brides - I found them to be irritiating. Whenever they laughed, it was like screeching. And that sound in the cinema is NOT a good thing. The bride effects, when they were in the air and flying around and whatnot were, for me, a real let down. Unlike the wolfman effects, they were unconvincing. I found that with Stephen Sommers' last movie, 'The Mummy Returns'. The brides are Van Helsing's equivalent of the Scorpion King beast. Sommers, at times, relies on too much CGI and it, suffice to say, kills his movies.I much preferred the aforementioned Wolfman scenes and the make up on Frankenstein's monster. One thing that really irked me - Kevin O'Conner, who plays the very hunchback-y Igor. You may remember him as Benny, the little weed in 'The Mummy' - he esentially has no part.As for Jackman - I love him, a lot, but I hope he sticks with Wolverine as his stand out performance. I didn't really form an opinion on him as the male lead, but he has so much charm and charisma - who cares how he acted on the screen?I loved Anna to bits. I think after the Friar, she was my favourite character. Simply because of who is playing her: Kate Beckinsale. First off, I loved the accent...some reviewer said she sounded too much like some character in the 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' cartoon - having never seen that, I can't compare. It was campy but I loved it. I found myself smiling at every scene she was in...chuckling to myself with the accent - she does it so well. Never falters once.In my opinion, the majority of thespians struggle with accents other than their own. Prime example being Colin Farrell in 'American Outlaws'...his Irish keeps drifting in when he talks and hey, wasn't Jesse James an american? Rachel Weisz has that similiar problem [though not quite as bad as Farrell's]. While I love Beckinsale's fellow English compatriot; she doesn't do so well with American...Beckinsale does the transylvanian/romanian accent very well. Likewise when she portrays an American in her other movies.In a nut shell - Beckinsale shimmers. She sizzles. She dazzles. She sparkles. She's glowing. All that good stuff. I found it quite entertaining that three or four guys, who were seated in front of me, kept going on about how hot she was. When she has her first scene in the movie, one of them turned to his friend and just uttered a single ""f*cking hell""...you can imagine what that was aimed at...For me, a defining scene is definately the masquerade ball - that's all I'm saying. Loved the close relationship Anna has with Velkan. I felt a little sorry for the character in some scenes - there are times where she really gets beaten about. Falling over things, falling through things - i felt Sommers was almost taking the mick out of a very intelligent Beckinsale; making the character seem clumsy. But hey, Beckinsale all sweaty and punched out is quite a turn on.Final thoughts; go see this movie if you want. Don't let the critics get you downhearted. Form your own opinion on it - I did.Rating: *** out of ***** (Maybe pushing it for four stars; solely on the grounds of a dazzling Beckinsale)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In your face Special Effects,"First let me give you a frame of reference as to some of the movies that I have liked in the past, ""Pitch Black"", ""Underworld"", ""The Matrix"", ""13 Going on 30"", ""Dracula"" (the original), ""Tombstone"", ""Cat People"", ""An American Werewolf in London"" and on and on.  Some of these movies had special effects, but the difference between these movies and ""Van Helsing"", is these movies had plot and acting.Too many movies rely on special effects and this one was definitely in that category.  Why does Hollywood think we want to watch a video game? Because that's what today's special effects are giving us in the movies.  Wouldn't Mr. Hyde have been more believable and frightening if they had chosen a massive actor with an evil demeanor instead of a video game looking character.  And an authentic fight scene is always more enjoyable without special effects (or at least a minimum).Within 30 minutes, I was tempted to leave and go into a different movie (wish I had!). Maybe this one did have plot, but it definetly had no depth. I didn't enjoy it and would not recommend the movie to anyone!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cheers for action and special effects; Jeers for character development - so what?,"True though it is that all of the characters in Van Helsing(including the title role by Mr. Jackman) have less substance than most poorly drawn Saturday Morning heroes, the movie offers one heck of a good time. Why? Because the movie's fresh take on the monsters of classic Hollywood horror are absolutely fantastic.Yes some people have complained about the lack of plot and character development, but let's not forget that the original film depictions of Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein from the 1930s and 1940s were no less superficial. Anyone who has seen The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, or The Scorpion King should know what they're getting in for when they go to a movie of the same genre by the same creative minds behind those three films.They're going to see a movie that's all about action and special effects with a campy brand of humor in the mix. If that's not your cup of tea, don't see the movie; and by heavens, don't complain about what you saw if you already saw the aforementioned flicks and didn't like them.I guess it's pretty plain then, that I thoroughly enjoyed The Mummy, its sequel, and its spin-off; I liked this movie even more. Now don't get me wrong, my favorite kinds of movies are the movies that stir your soul and make you think. The Mummy and its follow-ups certainly weren't in that category, and neither was Van Helsing. Val Helsing is the kind of movie you go see when you just want to have some fun. That's what it was, fun like a roller-coaster is fun. Why expect more - that's my question.Just one more thing about my favorite part of the movie then. The brides of Dracula are the most amazing CG effects of the film. We've never seen creatures like this in any movie. In the same spirit that I watched Disney's Dinosaur and loved it just for the visually stunning CG characters, I love Van Helsing. Going to see the Van Helsing matinee was worth my five bucks just for the artistry that went into bringing the brides of Dracula to life.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big Dumb Blockbuster Monster Fun,"Although writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's ""The Mummy,"" he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel ""The Mummy Returns,"" a prime example of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and ""exciting"" things going on, but somehow is strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's ""Van Helsing,"" although not as bad.THE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) in Transylvania to fight Dracula, his three lovely but vicious brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, vampire babies, etc.It won't take long for the viewer to perceive that ""Van Helsing"" shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a partial parody/homage of the classic Universal monster movies and part serious, just barely. Imagine ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) with the over-the-top thrills of Indiana Jones and the flair of classic monster parodies like ""The Vampire Happening"" (1971) or ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) and you'd have a good approximation.The film looks good, but there's too much CGI and some of the monsters look really cartoony, like Mr. Hyde and the werewolves. Others look quite good, like the flying vampire brides and Frankenstein's monster. As was the case with ""The Mummy Returns"" the film is strangely tedious despite all the manic happenings. Thankfully, there are worthy hints of depth, e.g. the Frankenstein monster and Anna. I wish there was more.Speaking of Anna, Kate Beckinsale is definitely one of the highlights here as she looks stunning throughout in an amazing form-fitting costume and thigh-high boots seemingly appropriate for the late 1800s (speaking as someone who's not even a Beckinsale fan). Josie Maran and Elena Anaya are also striking as two of Dracula's wives, Marishka and Aleera. Needless to say, excellent job on the female front. On the other side of the spectrum, Jackman is a great, masculine leading man, perfect for the role. Richard Roxburgh (Dracula), David Wenham (Carl), Kevin J. O'Connor (Igor) and Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein's monster) are all entertaining or effective.At the end of the day, though, ""Van Helsing"" barely rises above the limitations of what it is: a big, dumb modern blockbuster with all its over-the-top trappings. Considering the $160 million thrown into it, it shoulda/coulda been better. The story needed time to breathe and less constant mania. The movie's also over-long at 2 hours and 11 minutes. Still, it's better than ""The Mummy Returns"" and there's enough here to make it worthwhile, if you're in the mood for this type of fare.THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Czech Republic, Rome and Paris with studio work done in Southern Cal and Orlando, Florida.GRADE: B-/C+",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the disaster I heard it was--but not good at all,"In the 18th century, Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is working for the church (???) travels to Romania with a monk Carl (David Wenham) to battle Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), his three brides, the Wolf Man (Will Kemp) and the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley). He's helped by feisty Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale).This has been trashed by critics everywhere. No it isn't good at all...but I've seen worse. It starts off great with a black & white prologue dealing with Dr. Frankenstein creating the Monster for Dracula. The doctor is killed and so is his creation (supposedly). Then it cuts to a year later with Van Helsing being sent to battle Dracula and his three wives who are attacking a nearby village for blood. There he finds a werewolf roaming about also and the Monster is alive. But Dracula wants the monster to....FORGET IT! The plot just gets more vague and sillier as it goes on. Anyways plot is not the reason this movie exists--it's done to push CGI down our throats.There's LOTS of action in this film, incredible special effects (all are CGI) and tons of explosions and such---but I was bored. The plot is WAY too vague and the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book. There's no characterizations or depth to ANY of the characters--how was I supposed to care for these people when I didn't know who they were? Also this film has way too much going on it in--the opening has Van Helsing killing Mr. Hyde (and Dr. Jekyll too)! And pitting him against THREE monsters was just overkill.Jackman was very good (considering he had nothing to do). Beckinsale was terrible but it's not her fault. Wenham unfortunately plays the ""comic"" relief (and is hating every second of it). Kemp has little screen time but he is good (and VERY handsome). Hensley is good as Frankenstein's monster. The makeup on the vampires and werewolves was VERY impressive too. And there was a great fight between two monsters at the end. But it's all money and CGI and no plot or characters. It's also frustrating that the violence was really toned down for the PG-13--there's next to no blood or gore in this film. And it's TOO LONG--an elaborate masquerade party could have been left out completely (and is a total ripoff of Roman Polanski's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers""). This was a bomb at the box office so we're (thankfully) not going to get any sequels.I can't recommend it--but kids will like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
15 years and multiple views = cult classic,"Criminally underrated movie. Sure, the acting is cheesy and gives Hugh Jackman Another vehicle to chew out his hammy lines, but that fits nicely into this package of cgi and fast paced story telling. The plot is simple....stop Dracula from creating an army of undead using a mixture of old school characters mixed with more modern team approach. Obstacles along the way include a myriad of universal monster tropes. Beyond that I recommend viewing as i wont spoil the fun! The cgi may be over used to some but it is high quality and creates some truly amazing set pieces and monster transformations. Costumes are rich and quite frankly I'm surprised this hasn't garnered viewing parties a la harry potter or the Rocky Horror picture show. This movie truly feels like an adventure with fleshed out backstories before the main theme ensues. A perfect one and done!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bloody Brilliant,"I don't know why people hate it. I think it is one of the best films ever. It's blend of action, story, and characters is amazing. The special effects were incredible and so was the make-up. The best characters were none other than Frankenstein's Monster and Van Helsing. Their acting was wonderfully breathtaking. Kate Beckinsile was beautiful. The scenery such as the ballroom were fabulous. The best scene was the very first, ballroom scene, and all of Dracula's castle, and don't forget the chase scene with the Wolfman. I recommend it. Frankenstein's Monster though I must say was the most spectacular. This movie should please everyone because it has so many elements combined so wonderfully along with great music surprises, and more. Please watch this movie everyone. It is a triumph of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Why I like this movie as much as I do,". . . I just came back from the theater and have to say I really really enjoyed watching this film. How I judge whether or not a film is suitable to my taste is generally speaking, limited to subject matter and how I feel during the actual act of watching it. Obviously I am into monster stories/fantasies, so the reason I love it is because it moved me inside. The graphics were incredibly realistic, the scenery and characters (WOMEN) beautiful and horrible (the good kind) all at once, and the plot reasonably complex such that I was immersed into the whole world. My heart was racing.I honestly feel that this is a movie made by a man who is so passionate not only about movies, but beauty and horror. He was inspired by his father as a child to love the whole monster genre, but in the process to cultivate himself in the art of imagination. . . (he dedicated the movie to his father)I feel Roger Ebert describes the movie well when he refers to Van Helsing as having ""a world that is violent and hectic, bizarre and entertaining, and sometimes very beautiful.""I definitely want to hear Stephen Sommers explain why and how he created this world. Hopefully the DVD will supply some great commentary.sonb",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Frankenstein!? It's Dracula!!!,"Some people may say that this movie is bad, but I don't think so! I guess that's because I like vampire films. The thing I liked about the film was the details. Hugh Jackman had cool clothes with a mystic hat! The village looked like it WAS in the middle-age, and I guess that was the meaning of it! Sure, I got a bit disappointed when Frankenstein was the ""Problem of the world""! That Frankenstein was important. I have always seen him as just a monster. Dracula was a cool character in this film. He was almost as I could imagine him. Almost! The Wolfman was scary the first time I saw him. Well, how would you imagine of a dangerous row of teeth would come against you in a rush? Anyway! I liked this film a lot, but I never would have guessed that Universal was ""responsible"" for it. I have always seen Universal Studios as a ""Kid Film Makers"", but since this movie, I guess I need to change my meaning about them!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Guilty Pleasure,"This is not what I would call a good movie. It's characters are too thin, the romance too contrived, the structure too loose, and the theme too scattershot, but what it lacks in some of the basic building blocks of storytelling it partially makes up for in charm and a deep seeded desire to entertain no matter what. Those two aspects make Stephen Sommers' Van Helsing something of a guilty pleasure for me. No, it's not good, but I enjoy it every time I watch it.Delving into the story is an exercise not really worth the effort because it's too manically told with the passion of an adolescent hopped upon Red Bull and Mountain Dew, throwing his toys together with a shocking amount of energy at two in the morning. Essentially, Gabriel (not Abraham) Van Helsing is a monster hunter working for Rome, and he carries the burden of being called a murderer because everyone sees the results of his work but not the efforts. It's a question that the movie brings up from time to time but has little to not ability to expand upon beyond the initial ask. It's not concerned with Van Helsing as a man but as a vehicle through which to drive the audience through the plot and hang a couple of mysterious questions about his past that area supposed to add to the overall mystery.He gets sent to Transylvania along with Carl, a friar who ends up acting as Q to the James Bond that is Van Helsing, supplying him with weapons along the way. Carl is one of the biggest sources of fun in the film. He's the fish out of water, not a field man, and he's played really wittily by David Wenham. When he doesn't seem to be having a blast, he's amusingly out of his element with a creaky voice that barley conceals pure terror.In Transylvania, Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious, a Romanian princess descended from a long line of hunters out to kill Dracula. Her brother gets turned into a werewolf and she helps Van Helsing fight off an attack of three flying Brides of Dracula. The basic plot is that Dracula is trying to use the technology that brought Frankenstein's monster to life in order to bring his large cadre of dead-born children to life. There are chases, fights, explosions, and all manner of chaos.The movie's best sequence comes late at a masquerade ball where Dracula has captured Anna and is trying to trade her for Frankenstein's monster that Van Helsing has found. It's a visual delight with acrobatics, dancing, singing, and special effects. The movie's ultimate climax in Dracula's castle makes the mistake of having both the hero and the villain transform into CGI monsters, robbing the audience of investment in the conflict by hiding the faces of those we've spent time with, but since there's no real investment to be had, it's not as bad as it could have been.Really, it's not good. I went back and found Roger Ebert's three star review of the film, and I agree with everything he said. However, I just can't quite say that even though I have a good time with the film that it's actually good. That's all I need, right? To have a good time? Well, it's thin entertainment that doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, the sort of thing I couldn't watch too frequently because the sloppy construction would get to me.It's a guilty pleasure, and I have no real problem admitting that.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining piece of cinematic fluff,"My boyfriend and I walked into our local theater discussing what we expected from this movie. This list is as follows: Kate Beckinsale in a corset, Hugh Jackman in an awesome hat, vampireness and awesome weapons.As you can see, we were not asking much and therefore we were not disappointed. We weren't expecting this movie to win awards or have some deep, intellectual meaning. We came to see a movie that had some action and was just a decent film to watch and let your brain turn to mush over. The acting was no where near spectacular, everything was very cliche, but you know, I think that's what it was intended to be. Do not go into this movie expecting anything other than a good time.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A textbook guilty pleasure,"Many of us have, as children, engaged in the fascination of pitting various different fictional beloved characters against each other in a variety of scenarios. ""What if Superman fought Spider-Man?"" Van Helsing is the big-budget silver screen treatment of one of those scenarios, involving three of the biggest horror icons in film history, Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. These three legends have been tossed into the blender, along with a mix of special effects, elaborate production design and action, then writer-director Stephen Sommers hit puree resulting in something, which, while not a masterpiece, does have the capability to entertain.Although billed as a modern updating of the Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s, Van Helsing has very little in common with those films. They were low-budget mood pieces, cultivated by a studio which, as a ""major minor"" (i.e. a studio with no theater chain), couldn't afford to make the big event films that competitors such as MGM was churning out in those days. The horror film was also custom built for Universal's talent base, many of whom had a German film background and were steeped in German expressionism, featuring harsh shadows and dark subject matter. Van Helsing, on the other hand, while maintaining some of the look of those old films, is a hyped-up action film, lacking much in the way of any scares, no suspense to speak of, and enough money obviously being spent to fund a small country.The film opens with a sequence filmed in black and white, proving Sommers does have an understanding of where the roots of his film come from. The prologue features Dr. Frankenstein bringing his creature to life, under the watchful eye of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburg). When Dr. Frankenstein isn't happy with the plans Dracula has for his creation, Dracula kills him and the monster flees, only to be trapped in a nearby windmill which is burned to the ground by an angry mob of villagers. The film then introduces us to our hero, hunting down one Mr. Hyde in the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral, a double homage to both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. After dispatching Hyde, Van Helsing, working for a secret organization representing all religions of the world, is ordered to Transylvania to assist the dying Valerious clan, who has sworn a pact to never enter heaven until Dracula is destroyed, and of whom only two are left, sister and brother Anna (Kate Beckinsale) and Velkan. In Transylvania, Van Helsing, accompanied by a medieval version of Q, Friar Carl (David Wenham), discovers that Dracula is planning to use the research of Dr. Frankenstein to bring his undead children to life, not to mention that Velkan has been transformed into a werewolf by Dracula, and that Frankenstein's monster has survived and is being hunted by Dracula.As with The Mummy and The Mummy Returns before it, Van Helsing is a film that has it's tongue firmly planted in it's cheek. You can never really take anything too seriously at any point in the film, it all has a light air to it. Many have been turned off by this aspect of the film, but I didn't find it distracting. Sure, it's not Shakespeare, but it also isn't total camp either. It's absolutely ridiculous, yes, but Sommer's energy and desire to have a good time is infectious, and the film was just fun to watch.Van Helsing is wall-to-wall action from start to finish. Thre is little time to take a breath in between one major set-piece and the next, so those looking for a slow-paced film had best look elsewhere. Van Helsing is all chases, fights, shoot-outs and brawls, and yet, unlike films from uber-action director Michael Bay, the action sequences never really get boring. Perhaps it's because they are all unique in one sense or another, with Sommers never really repeating something after using it once. The action sequences are top notch also, well choreographed and exciting. If you are in search of a good action film, Van Helsing would fit the bill on this level.Van Helsing also features stunning production design. I have always been a fan of Gothic horror film imagery, and this film is bathed in it. From the castles, to the costumes, to the weaponry, it's a feast for the eyes and should be in contention for the art direction award come Oscar season.Acting wise, Van Helsing is a mixed bag. Hugh Jackman equits himself well enough, managing to stay believable while surrounded by strange sights and sounds. Kate Beckinsale, as Anna, doesn't fare quite as well. Her accent and sometimes overblown reactions to what's happening on screen help make her one of the less impressive performers in the film. Richard Roxburg is a bit over the top at times with his accent and mannerisms, but the material pretty much calls for it. The worst example of actors pushing the limits are Dracula's three brides (Elena Anaya, Sylvia Colloca and Josie Maran) who are constantly writhing, hissing, spitting and just generally making a nuisance of themselves. They could have been toned down considerably.Van Helsing is a film that would be filed in the area of ""guilty pleasure."" There is stuff here to criticize, but at the same time, I can't help but enjoy myself while watching it, and in the end, isn't that all that matters.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just Ok,"A bit too fantasy, but a few good tributes.  There is some homage to a couple of Frankenstien movies, and Christopher Lee vampier movies.  I did not mind some of this film, and some of the story, but this movie gets dorkey like Harry Ptter, The Matrix, and Lord of the Rings.  I like the pace of this film, very fast like the Dawn of the Dead remake. When I compare Van Helsing to the Dawn remake the story becomes fantasy/dork and lose a bit of the grit or realism that scares me from the Dawn of the Dead or Chainsaw remake.  This is a good rental, but a little too over explained story line. Should of keep one guessing, and a little more nastier, instead of shocking. Remind me of the Batman movie, I mean Batman one from 89.  The effects were ok.  Too many by the number type film out like this, but better than others 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Definitely not great, but surely not as bad as some claim","This is a movie about the well-known famed monsters of the 1800's, mainly Dracula, The Wolfman and The Frankenstein Monster. While the original movies, and pretty much every movie about one of these creatures is a horror movie; this is, however, just a comic book movie that features them, and Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing. It has no horror in it at all; several of the creatures in the film are ridiculed more than they're feared(well, mainly Igor, but at times Frankenstein's Monster too). The movie does do something to pay respect to the source material, but, alas, most of it is lost in special effects. Nearly every scene features some form of special effects; there are more effects in the film than there are action sequences. I don't know any other films by Stephen Sommers, but in this, the action consists of far too much CGI, thereby giving us something to look at, rather than something to be excited about; granted, the CGI does look pretty good, but some ""all-live action"" action sequences would really have helped. I also found the action scenes to be fairly repetitive. Half of them either start or end with someone being swung by a wire/rope/whatever. That's an OK idea for one or two action scenes, but in this movie, it happens no less than five times. Then it just gets tedious and bland. You start to wonder if the director has too few ideas for how to put together action scenes. It also made me wonder if he had seen too much Tarzan as a child, and wanted to copy him swinging from tree to tree. Most of the action scenes also involve far too much talking, and far too little action. There was a scene were the vampires kept talking on and on for five minutes or so, before finally attacking the victim, whom they had cornered from the beginning of the scene; of course, this only happens to the main characters, anyone else is killed instantly. Which just makes it all the more predictable; quite unfortunate, seeing as how it was seemingly made to create tension and intensity. The action scenes are fairly intense, but the director hardly ever gives us time to breath between them, thereby just annoying the viewer, rather than giving an intense feel to the film. The action, whilst being intense, fails to excite or entertain, which leaves the viewer feeling bored. The talking in the action scenes also usually kill any form of excitement, rather than intensify it. In fact, the film seems to prefer special effects over action; there were several scenes that could have become great action sequences, instead something ""unexpected"" happens, and we are ""treated"" with more CGI. They also seemed to love the things they could do with the special effects far too much, resulting in them overusing it to the extreme(main examples being Dracula's walking on walls and werewolves & Mr. Hyde jumping constantly from one place to another, which just annoys and distracts the viewer). The plot is OK, but very far-fetched and only barely makes sense. I got the feeling that the script was written more or less around which plot twists the director wanted(in fact, if I'm not mistaken, Sommers also wrote the script, as well as directing it), and which action/special effects sequences he wanted in the film. The acting is not particularly good, but not bad, either(well, some of it, but most of it is OK). The Monster has the delivery of an opera singer... I wasn't sure if I should laugh at the poor acting, or clap at the notes he hit. The characters seemed too much like clichés; the bad-ass hero who cracks jokes and saves the day, the strong female who can fight for herself, except for when she needs to be rescued by the hero, the slow, goofy sidekick who's only in the film(at all) to provide comic relief, etc. The humor in the film is decent, however there is a little too much of it for a dark film based on horror movies. A few of the jokes did make me laugh, however, the goofy nature of several scenes made me laugh harder. All in all, a decent comic book movie that lacks any of the serious nature of its source material. I recommend this movie to fans of comic book movies, but fans of any/all of the source material should be advised, that this does not pay very much respect to the original stories. Just remember; you were warned. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Glorious!,"It was glorious, it had all the elements it needed to be perfect! It had action, adventure, mystery, horror and the locations chosen for the filming were excellent. I've got a friend who has seen tens of films with me at the movies and always managed to have nerves of steel but when the first vampire spawn sprang out he jumped off his seat! He felt really ashamed because I keep refreshing his memory on the incident. He is my horror meter and he went off the top so Van Helsing certainly had it's great horror moments. It is much better than films like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer as thrillers are concerned which give you that one second fright which passes after you munch a bit of popcorn because you feel the atmosphere changing slowly when a scare is coming up (lowering background music and sounds, heavy breathing by a character(s),etc...) and the audience thinks ""Oh no, I forgot to empty my bladder before the film!"".

"VAN HELSING: Monsters, action, horrible script.","My Take: A dumb, but visually-stunning adventure with some neat action and some truly terrible dialog.If there's a weakness I have, it's how I keep changing my opinion on the movies I watch. I saw VAN HELSING back then, sort of liked it then forgot much about it. Since I have a vague memory of VAN HELSING since then, I just dismissed it as the CGI effects-laden mess that everyone else called. But upon seeing it again a few weeks ago, it fared much better than I expected. If I wrote about VAN HELSING back then, I would have given it the 3 stars I'm giving it now; It's enjoyable and occasionally exciting, but still pretty silly and quite forgettable.I didn't really grow up with the old Universal monster movies (these movie are even older than my parents are!), but their impact is undeniable. Whether or not you have seen all of those original B&W classics, you are maybe living under a rock or something if you don't even know who Dracula is. These guys are the big leagues! Our generation is grown up on movie serial killers and soulless slashers who have none of these immortals' depth or class; You can actually find something to identify with in these monsters. And here they are, all together in one movie, like a greatest hits collection strewn together like a Frankenstein's Monster. VAN HELSING's great B&W opening alone is a great homage to the classic monster movies and probably the best moment in the entire film.The rest is pretty much standard action-with-CGI fare. Van Helsing, an intelligent old hero in the old Dracula classics, is turned into a comic-book action hero here (played by Hugh Jackman) complete with gadgets, a comic-relief sidekick, a secret organization he works for (a secret Vatican organization with more James Bond 007 references you will ever need in a movie) and the girl. But regardless of his presence, Jackman could have done so much more to the role. The movie was pure intentional camp to be sure, the least Jackman should have done is to add more humor and edge to the character. Worse still is Kate Beckinsale (a fine actress, need I mention) who plays vampire hunter Anna Valerious. She shares very little chemistry with Jackman's Gabriel Van Helsing, while an adventure movie of this kind could have done so much more. Then there's the CGI, superior and all, is just a bit too overcrowded at times. Did the movie really need a CGI Dr Jekyll/Mr. Hyde? And don't get me started on Dracula's screeching overbearing wives who turn into flying bat-like creatures (which makes me wonder if the real actresses who played them weren't CGI characters themselves!).Director Stephen Sommers of THE MUMMY pictures could have made another purely enjoyable blockbuster, but this flawed, silly yet marginally entertaining one lacks the charm of his previous works. One thing I do remember enjoying in VAN HELSING is the action, and they're still pretty gripping this time around. Sometimes though, I wish that Sommers realize that CGI without a lot of fun in them are just lifeless. And that script, bleh!Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The special effects really good, and I loved they way the movie started out in black and white.  I hope to see Van Helsing nominated for special effects or for costumes this year.  They must truly deserve it.Oh, and if you also enjoy seeing Hugh Jackman run around in a loin cloth, this is a definite must see.  He's been working out, and it shows!!!

Don't take it seriously,"Pretty-looking movie EXTREMELY loosely based on someone's inaccurate conception of what Transylvania is like. This is one of those movies tailored to look good at the expense of the amount of realism that would be appropriate. But remember, Hungarians don't really sound like that, Dracula did not really live in the years given, and (believe it or not) Halloween is not and never was celebrated in Hungary, no matter how obligatory the holiday may seem in a ""scary"" movie.

Why is everyone so harsh,"I will never understand why everyone insists on judging every movie like it is shooting for the big awards......this movie was made for different reasons. One is that the makers have a love for the genre, obvious with the old school tributes, and two was to make an entertaining action movie. Which i would say that they succeeded in doing so, i enjoyed the fact that there was a lot of action, too many times people ruin the pace of movies by trying to balance out the action with love stories or some other garbage. Certain movies are not meant to be that way, and this is one of them, that is why i hate when people gauge it against other movies that are made with different intentions. And i am also a big Dracula fan and i realize that they fudged the Van Helsing legacy, but you couldn't have this movie with Anthony Hopkins running around fighting all of these creatures, even though he did an amazing job in bram stokers Dracula as the real VH, but this is a different movie, with a different story, and a very different purpose.....overall i enjoyed this film for what it was worth and i will be purchasing it when it comes out on Oct. 19",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you're a monster movie fan, or if you like action films Van Helsing is the movie for you. It's a monster lovers dream come true as it contains Dracula, The Wolf Man, Frankenstein, his monster, Igor, and even Mr. Hyde as a bonus and Stephen Sommers gets very creative in combining these classic characters. Take the production design of Allan Cameron who designed films like Stariship Troopers and The Mummy. Then you have the cinematography of Allan Daviau who received Oscar nominations for his cinematography on Avalon, Bugsy, E.T., The Color Purple, and Empire of the Sun. Take those two combined with the imagination of Stephen Sommers, and you get a spectacular visual fest. The film isn't perfect. There is quite a bit of dumb dislodge, with dull performances from the actresses that play Draculas brides. However, I think this is one of the best action movies of all time, and one of the five best action films of the new millennium.*** (7 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I have to say up front I'm not a particular fan of the horror film genre and Hugh was my only reason to watch this. Having said that, I think this movie didn't know whether to be funny or serious so it didn't make it as either. It probably would have worked better had it been camped up a lot more.The movie looks gorgeous and it certainly had some interesting things in it, but I was bored by it.

I enjoyed it,"Yes, I know it's not fantastic and could have been a hell of a lot better, but it's not a bad way to while away 2 hours at Christmas time.I did not go a see the film during it's theatrical release during early summer - Because the Critics were Scathing and I don't think it received more than one star in the National Press & My friends who had seen it told me it was utter rubbish.I won't go into the detail of the plot - why? because there pretty much isn't one, It's just Special effect and special effect after special effect and after a while it does get quite tiresome and much of the effects look really really fake.It's Directed and Written By Stephen Sommers who gave us 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy Returns' and I have to say I enjoyed those two much more than this, because it had sympathetic characters and a bit more of a plot. I think it's safe to say if you didn't like 'The Mummy' or it's Sequel you will HATE this film.Hugh Jackman looks lost under his big hat & plays wolverine all over again.The Beautiful Kate Beckinsale really deserves better than this.all in all - It has many Faults (too many to mention) but when all is said and done it's quite watchable if you like lots of noise, bangs and SFX a-plenty,mediocre acting,and terrible dialogue.My Rating ***1/2 out of *****",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ok, so call me cheesy!","But I liked the movie. Sommers returns after quite a long absence with a groundbreaking kind of a film. A perfect popcorn movie. A total 'you'll have fun seeing it!' flick. Of course not to forget that seeking any sense in this movie is totally useless, for you will not find it. What you will find though is a good shaken plot, with a wonderful WETA Digital special effects olive, in a perfectly clear Hollywood pre-summer blockbusters glass (still waiting for 'Troy' and 'The Day After Tomorrow'). So, what's it all about? Van Helsing, the man with a mission to kill the all existing evil, is sent to Romania to take on his greatest challenge ever - Count Dracula. What he doesn't know is that this task will be more than just challenging. I won't re-tell the story, though, you just got to see it for yourself.Having Hugh Jackman on board is a great plus to the movie. Despite the fact that he somehow reminds me of the good old Rick O'Connell of 'The Mummy'. But in a good way, not that he copies him, he feels like a relative. Jackman delivers his edgy side, familiar to the fans of X-Men (Wolverine is my favorite), but all the same with grace and razorblade sharp phrases along with the weapons. His assistant - the geeky-looking Carl, monch-to-be, played by David Wenham (LOTR fans - ye be warned, brace yourselves, no sign of noble Faramir there), is Van Helsing's sidekick, who's there to break the tension after every major action scene with a funny thing he says or does. Kate Beckinsale - the girl still has her rough skills from 'Underworld', where she also dealt with vampires, but was on their side.  Richard Roxburgh - the always pale, always hungry Count Dracula, who has an evil plan to destroy our world, which isn't news to any of the viewers.In short: the movie is packed with clichees, most of it is CGI, the story about the Dracula is nearly as old as the cinema itself and some moments are predictable for any fan of the genre. So why go and see it? Because the movie has its own charm, the typical Sommers touch. Because it made me feel like a child, such a fairytale-feeling it gave me. Because it fits action, romance and great plot twists along with the last battle, which I didn't see coming the way it did into the 2+ hours, which fly like the Brides of Dracula. So, relax, get yourself a bucket of popcorn, some Coke and let Van Helsing take you into his world of 1888, when good fought with evil in the name of God.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad and hilarious,"Van Helsing is a beautifully looking film, with great action sequences that certainly entertained me for a while. I can recommend it to anyone who wants a fun night at the movies. Whoever, it is not a good movie. The plot is illogical and full of twists to make the movie last a little longer. The dialoges are incredibly stupid and cheesy, and so is the acting. Especially Richard Roxburgh is hilariously overacting as Dracula. All the cliche characters are here. There's the James Bond like hero (Van Helsing), his sidekick that's supposed to bring the comic relief (ironically, he was the only character that wasn't funny in this entire movie), the sexy, bitchy heroin, the charismatic bad guy, the ugly, stupid bad guy-sidekick, the dumb locals, the scary monster that only means good...So, if you're in for a night of brainless fun with cheesy overacting by every single actor in the cast, spectaculair action and probably the stupidest dialogues of the year, Van Helsing is your flick.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Halloween Monsters, Wild Wild West and 007","clumzy's Take on ""Van Helsing"" - Rating - Maybe Worth a Free ViewingI like to think of myself as a manly guy. I lift weights, do the maintenance on my own car, I've built a deck, and most importantly I like guy movies. You know the ones I'm talking about: Terminator, Predator, The Matrix, and the original Star Wars Trilogy to name but a few. A good movie to me is a simple mix of interesting characters, a story that gets you caring about them and maybe a helicopter, a car chase and some wire-fu but whatever, I'm no screen writer. So you would think that taking the classic monsters of yore like the Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein and mixing in a hard-nosed ""James Bond""-ish monster hunter and a leggy corseted butt-kicking babe would make for a delightful recipe for a slob like me. Yup, unfortunately, not so much so.Set in the late 1800's the enigmatic Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a ""secret agent"" of sorts who's sole purpose is the hunting and killing of evil monsters. His exploits take him and his friar sidekick (David Wenham) to Transylvania to knock off the dreaded Count Dracula and save the sexy warrior princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) et al from eternal damnation. Van Helsing is armed to the teeth with an impressive array of medieval weaponry including a crossbow machine gun, some sort of spinny cutting disc saws and a couple of revolvers which make for some John Woo-ish slow-mo jumping shooting scenes. Oh ya and there's a bunch of CG Halloween monsters running and flying around in the dreary, dark, and gloomy Transylvania sets.Sounds pretty good so far doesn't it? Unfortunately this film has no magic, no charm, no style and wholly improbable action sequences. Jackman, although slightly more amiable than his role in Xmen plays his tough-guy shtick cardboard cutout of a character leaping, flipping, shooting but making no connection with the viewer. Beckinsale, the noble warrior, prances around using her pseudo-kung-fu in high-heels and too-tight corset, blandly making me yawn and say ""meh, whatever"". Wenhem, who was very promising in Lord of the Rings, is absolutely wasted here, playing that annoying British sidekick from Relic Hunter. Finally our villain Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) is straight out of Wild Wild West or Shanghai Knights 2, brilliantly laughable.The last nail in the coffin is exactly what this kind of film hinges on: Computer Graphics. Now we all know that computers have revolutionized film making, saving hack scripts from the recycling bin with the promise of ""realistic"" action that will blow our minds. Here's some news Hollywood, WE ARE NOT IMPRESSED. Your shiny flashy computer puppetry can't cover up those stinker stories and one dimensional characters. Like a good music score, CG should be used to augment the action and further the feel and style of the film, not take centre stage and scream ""Look at me, I'm not even real!"" Fine, we've been over this before, and clearly in Van Helsing, we see more than a plethora of CG baddies, flying thingies and gooy green globs floating around. In this case, it doesn't make for a pleasant experience. Top that off with sets and camera work from a bad Wil Smith movie, completely improbable action swinging, luckshots and gaps in logic and you've got few reasons to pay attention.Really, I wanted to like this movie because of the huge ""guy"" factor but there's just too many things to overlook. Here is a prime example of a decent premise that will fade quickly into the forgotten because of over Hollywooding. The only saving grace to Van Helsing is that there was no blatant setup for a sequel. We can only hope.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Decent, mindless entertainment","Decent, mindless entertainment. That's all I really need to describe Van Helsing, but since I must write ten lines or more I'll try to elaborate.This movie is, obviously, no masterpiece. But then again I don't thing it was meant to be one. Viewed as an action movie paying homage to old monster movies it provides enough entertainment, so that you don't feel sorry about wasting your money or your time.On the good side, Jackman and Beckinsale are good enough, there is enough action to keep the movie going, the effects are decent (not too bad not too good) and it's always good to see the classic monsters. On the bad side, this movie has the worst Count Dracula ever (which really hurts the film), the CGI effects are overused and the script is below average.To sum it up, it's probably worth a viewing, just don't expect too much. I give it 6 out of 10 (mostly because the main villain was laughable).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fangs,but no fangs","After watching ""Van Helsing"" I must totally agree with Quentin Tarantino, who recently railed against the ever increasing use of CGI. Stephen Sommers´film is one big CGI-orgy! Plot? Logic? Coherence? Characters? Forget it!!! From the very beginning this film tries to clobber its viewers senselessly with one ""highlight"" after the other. As the film isn´t actually about anything except endlessly repeated vampire attacks, incomprehensible fights and chases, you don´t care what happens to the ""characters"";you just sit and stare with growing disbelief at the shoddy effects that don´t fool a five-year old. What was going on in the minds of the people who are responsible for this sorry mess of a film?!Why could Stephen Sommers not make up his mind about the kind of film he wanted to make; a horror film? A comedy? A rousing adventure flick? A touching and tragic love story? It simply doesn´t work to throw in as many of these ingredients as possible into the pot and hope that they somehow melt. Why did nobody raise a hand and utter some kind of objection during the conception and preparation? Do the people who spend huge amounts of money on a project like this really believe this is what today´s cinema goers want? In the end credits Stephen Sommers dedicates the film ""in loving memory"" to his father. What a strange relationship these two men must have had!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ridiculous action, plot and dialog","I can only imagine that this is one of those movies where people stood around an espresso machine gushing about how ""outrageous"" they could make the various scenes/characters and that's what got into the movie. Throw plausibility, logic, consistency and everything else out the window. I can't get started on examples because there really aren't words to explain how ridiculous the action is and this review would get bigger than it deserves to be. There was a very definite Batman & Robin/Schumaker vibe to this for me.CGI characters duking it out for the last fight is always a bad thing (see Mortal Kombat II, also, or rather do not see that) unless it's a James Cameron movie.The cast was good but they had NOTHING to work with. There were a couple lines where I could see the actors deadpanning and almost subvocalizing ""this will be cut"" but the lines staid in amongst frenetic scene shifts to keep us from dwelling. I can only imagine what did get cut. If there's a bonus real with the cast cursing out the director or the writer (Sommers) I'd pay to see it.The F/X budget was there (I think). The setting and costumes all could have been interesting although I felt sorry for Beckinsale.This movie made all three Underworld movies look like understated masterworks.It's not even good for kids to see because they might get ideas about stupid things to try.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An underrated gem,"It was fantastic and immersive. A different take on the classic Dracula story. I remember going to the cinema to watch it and I was so happy I went to the cinema. I used to go for pure escapism from life. I loved the story and the actors were perfect in their roles. Richard Roxburgh was brilliant as Dracula and his performance does not get anywhere near enough praise and is very underrated. Hugh Jackman is just amazing in everything and even David Wenham was good being he just came off his role as Faramir. It may not be for everyone but I really enjoyed this movie. I liked how they linked Dracula, Frankenstein and the werewolf. Please watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just okay,"Van Helsing is okay, nothing special. Van Helsing has two main problems, the first of which concerns the cliché and vastly uninteresting characters. We have seem these types before - the strong, action orientated heroin who eventually gives into her femininity by falling in love with the hero, her equally boring male counterpart! Next time, take out a leaf from Pirates of the Caribbean's book - it was the brilliant Johnny Depp who made POC such a worldwide hit!! Why? Jack Sparrow is unique, hilarious and highly watchable.Also if you are going to stage elaborately expensive action scenes remember to turn on the lights, otherwise the audience will not be able to see what is going on and lose interest!! I hate watching poorly lit action scenes, you barely make out the shapes!!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
play castlevania instead,"The first scene is a campy black-and-white scene involving Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein. I was so confused by this scene; at first I thought it was going to be some kind of movie-within-movie or frame story or something. At the very least, I expected a reveal that would bring reason to the campy acting and unlikely character relationships. It HAD to be intentional. Didn't it?Apparently not. The next thing I saw was a dead-serious title card reading ""ONE YEAR LATER."" From that moment, I knew it was going to be a long couple of hours.Sure enough, this movie is packed shoulder to shoulder, start to finish with actors who, for whatever reason, aren't acting. You've got Hugh Jackman over here, making wry comments and being oh, so clever. You've got this horrendously unmenacing Dracula and his community theater reject wives (who spend more than fifty percent of their on screen time as computer-generated harpies without nipples). You've got dudes transforming from naked werewolves into humans with pants.The design Van Helsing's character is not bad, but it's a little too close to Vampire Hunter D. The film has but two saving graces, and those are Frankenstein's Monster and....hmmm. Sorry, the film has only one saving grace. And in this particular case, he failed to completely save the movie, so for all we know, the movie has NO saving graces. So reading this paragraph has just been a waste of your time.The idea of a story that binds Dracula, Igor, Frankenstein's Monster and werewolves is appealing, to be sure. That's why there have been so many video games made on that premise. But we shouldn't judge movies and games by the same standards, and anyone who does needs to be kicked in the face. If they were trying to make Castlevania into a movie, they should have just called it Castlevania: The Movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good Film, Worth a Watch.","I enjoyed this film, Fits nicely into the ""Blockbuster"" genre. The CGI is well done and the story moves along nicely, However look out for the ""Obvious"" steals from other movies, Like The League of Extra Ordinary Gentlemen, Q Branch in the Bond Movies and Star Wars. Other Directors have got away with it so why not sommers!. In the Uk it received a 12A rating which meant we could take our 10 year old daughter, its mild horror wasn't to graphic for her, and though at times was watching from behind her coat, thoroughly enjoyed the film. All in all I would recommend this film, as worth the price of a Ticket and bag of popcorn.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Third Time is a charm,"I have tried this 3 times and hated it it twice. In fact never finished it.This time I am enjoying it. It is, without doubt,total piffle , but if you do not take it seriously and treat it as a comedy then it is entertaining piffle. If it is possible in an action movie (because that is what this is) there is too much action-it is exhausting to watch. The physical feats that the main characters perform are impossible and inventive if a little ridiculous. David Wenham has fun with his part as does Jackman and Beckinsale but I bet they were glad when it was over-though Kate has done similar roles since. CGI is fine, if used economically, but it is all over this and detracts from the visual rather than enhancing it as it is easily spotted. Much more enjoyable, though , than I first thought.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most Monster Hunter Movie ever,"Ok, there IS technically a plot. But it's the special effects, character/set design, and adrenaline-fueled action scenes that really put this movie in my list of favorites. Not due to any high-class writing or a+ cinematography, because this movie is certainly not one to go see in theaters. But it's an incredibly camp, aesthetic powerhouse of an action-horror flick you can watch over and over on a rainy night with a big bowl of buttery popcorn in October. Cool gadgets that don't make sense for the era, shirtless Hugh Jackman (with the obligatory sideburns), and big cgi/costume monsters. Not sure what more you could want, really.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Satire,spoof or semi-serious?","Satire,spoof-or a semi-serious horror movie? Director/writer Stephen Sommers combines all three in this enjoyable flick which I dug up in my local library. Indicates it wasn't a howling box office or DVD success! Van Helsing is full of references to other past movies such as The legendary 1939 Hunchback of Notre Dame,starring Charles Laughton as the batty bell-ringer. I won't spoil your fun. See how many references you can spot yourselves. Then there are characters from other horror classic tales who make freaky ""guest appearances"" like Mr Hyde, played by marvellous British character actor Robbie Coltrane. Coltrane is equally adept at turning his hand to both comedy or serious drama such as the highly-acclaimed British crime series Cracker. So he's ideally cast in this deft mix of spoof and real blood-curdling horror. The plot - if you can call it one - revolves around the notorious monster hunter Van Helsing,played by rising Australian star Hugh Jackman. Being a Melbourne-based entertainment writer, I was familiar with Jackson's pre-Tinsel Town work. He first showed his star quality in an Australian TV prison drama Correlli where he played an inmate who had an affair with a female warder. It wasn't long before Hollywood beckoned the gifted young actor. I have a gut feeling that director Sommers told Jackman to adopt fellow Aussie actor Mel Gibson's transpacific accent. Because he sounds remarkably like Mel in places. The writer/director also has Van Helsing wear an Australian bush ranger's hat! A private joke between him and Jackman?! Another top down under thespian Richard Roxburgh co-stars as Count Vladislaus Dracula. What a superb performance,too. Roxburgh plays it dead straight - and there are some really spine-chilling moments. In fact,when the dark menace of Vlad appears, it's a scream a minute...as he stakes out his victims. He unleashes some truly horrible creatures-including the sexy lycra-clad Harpies,who are very lustful,vengeful ladies indeed (!) - and those terrifying teeth-baring,blood-drooling were-wolves. Stunning British actress Kate Beckinsale is the truculent Transylvanian Gypsy Princess Anna who attracts the attention of Van Helsing - and Dracula. Van Helsing's intentions towards the heroine are honorable - but the salacious Count only wants to sink his fangs into Anna's pristine white neck. The special effects creators have done a brilliant job on what I would think wasn't a massive budget. You can almost hear the studio props creak! Today's savvy film-goers want their special effects to surround-sound them out of their seats. But,nevertheless,director Sommers shows plenty of flair and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of his product-with bigger budgets-in the future. Meanwhile, it was great just to sit back and enjoy a cleverly-made movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Film With So Much Wasted Potential,"The concept of this movie has so much potential. The film follows Van Helsing tracking down and killing a number of monsters, including Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man. It's a shame, then, that what we get is such a poorly executed film.Hugh Jackman is good in the lead role of Van Helsing, as is his love interest, played by Kate Beckinsale. David Wenham also has a lot of fun as the film's comedic relief. Unfortunately, they can't do much with the weak script that has very little character work and is composed almost entirely of action sequences.Richard Roxburgh delivers the worst interpretation of Count Dracula I've seen to date. From his odd look, which includes a ponytail and earring, to his cringe-inducing, camp performance, it doesn't work at all. Frankenstein's Monster was also miscast. If ever there was a monster I should feel sympathy for, it is this one, yet I didn't care at all.But what drags the film down most of all is its action sequences. Like many early 2000s blockbusters, director Stephen Sommers and his crew don't understand how to integrate practical and digital effects. While there is some excellent set design in places, it gets overshadowed by the constant bombardment of dated CGI in every action sequence. Because these sequences were so effects-heavy, they had no weight to them, leaving me unengaged and bored.To give the film some credit, Alan Silvestri produces an exciting and rousing score. Unfortunately, it cannot carry this mess of a movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant - a different take on the world,"I saw this movie last night and I have to say it was not what I had expected it to be. The vampires in the movie, especially the females are all very annoying and I prefer my vampires to be more seductive and suave ( like Underworld ). This was the part that I did not expect. However, the movie itself was just brilliant. Van Helsing was well acted and a great caracter. The story unfolds with a twist I had not seen coming. The story is not easy to understand, so I can understand that some people might not get the hints in the movie. You actually need to pay attention to the details to get to know what is going on. That is what made the movie special. The universe created was just brilliant and well drawn and the special effects were superb. Of course, everyone would recognize the familiar caracters from LXG and The Mummy, but that should not be a bad thing. The movie is originial and has an interesting new take on the van Helsing caracter we all know from books and movies such as Dracula. I definitly prefer this version and I would recommend watching this movie to everyone who likes dark movies that are different ( see the not so happy ending ). I hope the make a sequel and tie up the still open story lines.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not so bad!,"Saw this in the cinema when it was released and thought it was pretty okey actually. Since then i've seen it a couple of times on TV. And i still feel that it's a pretty good movie. Sure you have the female hero with a cringe worthy accent and stuff like that, but who cares? It's a pretty solid action adventure fantasy movie with diffrent monsters from diffrent classics mixed. And the specialFX is pretty solid aswell as the scenery is breathtaking at times. With some small tweaks here and there this could aswell been a Castlevania movie. You find almost everything from the Castlevania games in it, and would it have gone this route i think people would have liked it even more.
Insert Simon Belmont with the vampyre killer and add some more fight scenes and uped the horror a small bit and it would have been Castlevania the movie.
Instead we have Van helsing with a forgotten past that works like a early James Bond agent for the Vatican church. Like James Bond he has his Q in the shape of a priest instead.
Some parts of this movie somehow makes me feel like im watching a movie from the past, when fantasy movies like Krull or even Conan the barbarien did their own thing. And it succeds to entertain eventho it isent a Classic like the ones i mention, and some parts are more dull then others after a viewing or two. So an interesting mix of monsters and a diffrent take on the Van Helsing/Dracula story that for sure isent as bad as the score here might give away.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a ride,"Just got back from seeing van helsing, it was awesome, I don't understand why some of the critics didn't like it. It had action and a lot of suspense. It was like the mummy but with twice the action.From the beginning I knew this was an action adventure movie and treated it as such. The action started from the beginning of the movie and just kept going, stopping just long enough for me to catch my breath. Don't expect a movie a deep movie with lots of dialogue and character development but rather expect rollercoaster fun with the movie.With the wolfman on his back and the brides of dracula attacking him from the air makes you wonder why is it so hard to kill him.Even a dracula that can't be killed by stakes through the heart, holy water or crosses is no match for Van Helsing.The special effects on this movie was better than movies in the same category just watch the final sequence as proof.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Where's the story?,"When every May comes, we all know that the Summer Blockbuster season starts. This year it begins with this latest action extravaganza. Unfortunately, this film embodies what the summer blockbuster has become. A soulless exercise in high budget frenziness. The movie looks great, the effects are mostly top of the line, but it lacks what I believe is essential to a good adventure movie, characters and a story that the audience cares about. This movie has some impressive action sequenses, but they are not as exhilerating as they should be. The pacing is breakneck, but the movie never stops to even give us 5 minutes to develop any semblance story or character. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, a monster killer, as we all know the arch nemesis of Dracula, in this movie we get wherwolves and Frankenstein's monster for good measure. The story is as cheesy as you get, Dracula wants to use Frankenstein to bring thousands of his offspring to life. Even a cheesy story can be involving;not this time.

If you liked the trailer I would say there is an 80% chance you will like the film.  If you didn't like the trailer, then the film will not change your opinion.For those who haven't seen the trailer think `The Mummy' (1999) meets `Young Frankenstein' with an order of `Raiders of the Lost Ark' on the side, and lightly flavoured with some 007.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The location photography is great. The integration of real and CGI shots is always convincing. The acting never falls below good, and sometimes is excellent.Most importantly, since it's promoted as an action film, it's stuffed full of action.

As for the acting,Kate Beckinsale has done much better films;Jakcman isn't that bad,but his character lacks something of what made Wolverine so loved by everyone;Roxburg's Dracula is amusing,although it seems he's parodying Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee.The only actors really worth watching between the endless CG battles are Hensley,Wenham and Kevin J.

"Van Helsing, CGI Hunter","""Van Helsing"" is an updated version of the Dracula fable. This version is a 19th century ""Lethal Weapon"" or just about any action movie from the 80's and 90's. There were explosions, gunfire, and even horse carriage chases in lieu of car chases. But the biggest problem was the heavy CGI.Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, the monster hunter. He works for an obscure order of the Catholic Church in charge of ridding the world of phantasmic evildoers. In its bowels there's an operation that rivals the gadget makers for 007. In this hidden lair you can see people busily working on new fangled doodads to help their field agents dispatch of the latest supernatural nuisance. Van Helsing's current mission is to go to Transylvania to kill Dracula before he eliminates the Valerious bloodline; a family who'd been hunting Dracula for centuries. By the time Van Helsing gets to Transylvania the only Valerious left is Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) as her brother had been converted to a werewolf.This movie goes for style over substance. It's clear they threw a lot of money into effects hoping they could dazzle enough moviegoers to make a killing. The CGI was good for '04, though it hasn't aged well.

The action was directed awfully and the story was told very poorly. The pacing of the film seems to try to intentionally swallow up the boring story that sets at the base of the film. Hugh Jackman (which i don't like that much anyway) is dreadful as van helsing. They've turned him into neo from the matrix. I mean 21st century weaponry in the 19th century, come on! Kate Beckinsale who was great in ""Underworld"" (even though that wasn't the best movie) was very stale in this role. She almost seems to be auditioning for the part of frankenstein in the film.The ultimate poor excuse for a performance in this film belongs to Richard Roxonbourgh who plays count Dracula. He plays Dracula with a coe sense of fun, but it's not fun. In fact it's the fartherest thing from fun. He parades around with no emotional control and delivers his ""Wonderful"" dialogue. He changes shapes and acts a little too femine at times as well. Enough said about the acting either that or my head will implode. Well at least the special effects were great, right? NNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEE!God these effects were freaking terrible. Why cgi everything? Why not go back to the great films of the 30's and 40's. Like ""Frankenstein vs The Wolf Man"", that was a classic piece of storytelling and the acting and special effects are great. Well oh well Hollywood has managed to squander another great idea.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Well he'd have to be totally awesome, but we have no cool name for him. Oh lets call him 'Van Helsing' just cause he relates to Dracula."" You understand?

A Different kind of Hell,"Although I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman, (and yes, I HAVE seen other films besides the X-Men movies) I was thoroughly disappointed in Van Helsing.

I was going to give this one the old college try. And, yes, by gum! I should have stuck to my guns, because this film is just plain awful. Oh sure, it's pretty to look at, and has a lot of neat special effects, but while it maybe dazzling to look at, they forgot to blue screen one important element and that's plausibility. Time after time, there are instances where I was like, how on earth did they know that was going to happen? Like when the Kate Beckensdale first meets Van Helsing, she has'nt a clue who he is, then after he's done his business, she all of a sudden knows who he is.

A treat for fans of the classic monsters...,"As a fan of the classic monsters from the old Universal Studios films, I was probably bound to enjoy this film no matter how bad it turned out. If you're a fan of the old films...Lugosi's 'Dracula', Karloff's 'Frankenstein', and Chaney Jr.'s 'The Wolf Man', and all the myriad sequels...you're apt to like this film, and see its flaws as forgivable. After all, the old films, particularly the ones from the 1940's, were far from perfect.And there are flaws. The plot is overwrought, the acting by many of the supporting roles is at times wooden, the Wolf Man (I refer to Velkan; there's more than one werewolf in this film) doesn't have enough screen time, and some of the fight scenes (especially near the end) go on way too long. And the second scene of the film (with Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde) is completely unnecessary.However, when this film is on, it's on in style. The opening scene is hard to top; the creation of the Monster, Dracula trying to take control of the Monster, an angry mob chasing the Monster to an old windmill, and the pathos of the Monster as the windmill burns, all in black and white as a beautiful tribute to the classic films. The portrayals of Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster would have made Lugosi and Karloff happy; their signature characters are handled as though they were directing Roxburgh and Hensley themselves.If you aren't a fan of the old classic monster movies, you probably won't be too impressed with 'Van Helsing'. However, as long as you go understanding that this is a popcorn film, a movie to enjoy with your higher brain taking a snooze, you'll like it. It's just as much fun as Sommers' Mummy films.And if you are a fan of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr., this film is an absolute blast. Do not miss it.8/10 stars if you like popcorn films, probably 5/10 otherwise.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great intro,"Wenham: Why is it so important to kill this Dracula? Jackman: Because he's the son of the Devil. Wenham: I mean, besides that... Methinks reports of this movie's lack of quality were overstated. Jackman is a monster-hunter hired in 1880 by the Catholic Church (!!) to travel to Transylvania and take out Count Dracula. Serendipity's Beckinsale is a very attractive and very feisty Transylvanite who's been trying the same on her own without success. Wexham (Lord of the Ring's Faramir) is Jackman's assistant along for some comic relief. If you imagine Jackman as a more talky, continental Clint Eastwood you're pretty close. They have the right concept, the right characters and the right effects (AND the right weapons for Jackman, including an automatic crossbow!), they just didn't seem to have much of a clue on what to do with them after the first 30 minutes. So they just sort of mindlessly recycle confrontations after that point. It's hard to even keep up with things except to become certain that more (often hokey) action isn't always better. You do wonder how many more times Beckinsale can bounce off the walls and still be fine. But I guess it could have been worse and I give them some credit for setting the table so nicely.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Van Helsing""","""Van Helsing"" is a movie that boasts some incredible special effects, but suffers a lot from awfully strenuous pacing that mars what is an otherwise fun experience.Out on home video just in time for the Halloween season, the famous (or should I say infamous?) vampire slayer Van Helsing (Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman) is the most wanted man in Europe, for accusations that he is a murderer rather than a hero. His quarry has expanded from vampires to any number of ghoulish nasties, including Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Aided by the bumbling friar Carl (David Wenham) and with the help of the Transylvanian beauty Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), he proceeds to track down his arch-nemesis Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), who has recruited the Wolf Man and seeks to use Frankenstein - both in some notorious plot.From the opening credits, which homages to the Universal monster classics of yore, ""Van Helsing"" sucks you in. Certainly more comic book than fright film, it's still impressive entertainment. It has a fairly slow build-up, but gets interesting once the special effects kick in.Unfortunately, while the special effects are the best part of ""Van Helsing,"" they quickly become ""Van Helsing,"" abandoning any plot elements and reducing the characters to special effects as well.Aside from that minor quibble, ""Van Helsing"" is still a fun and fast ride from Stephen Sommers, the director of the first two ""Mummy"" films and the 1998 horror movie ""Deep Rising.""7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A long and boring video clip,"Well, never mind that Van Helsing shamelessly copies elements of a couple of other movies (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Wild Wild West are just two examples which come to my mind) - a couple of movies did so.Never mind the fact that the plot contains dozens of holes large enough to drive a whole fleet of trucks through - the same applies to a lot of other movies.Also never mind that a lot of the action scenes are completely unbelievable and way over the top - there are some movies guilty of the same.The main issues with Van Helsing is that this movie is boooooooooring. There is no climax, the pace of the movie never changes, it just stays at the same level.Consider this: when watching the movie at home, I was so bored I stopped the film occasionally,I checked my mail, had a look at a couple of websites and so on. Only sheer willpower prevented me from giving up watching the film - well, I was really hoping that this mess would soon end.So, basically Van Helsing a long and overblown video clip - full of CGI, no real story, no real climax.

"Great action adventure sequences, Gothic good vs. evil","Though definitely not a horror movie fan, I liked Van Helsing because it had enough action and also had good characters and a basic theme of good vs. evil.

I enjoyed the Gothic settings as well, with the huge sets, cliffs, great halls, old castles, and grand cathedrals. It was a fun and exhilarating action-horror movie. The movie had great action adventure sequences and Gothic good vs. evil and maybe the critics ought to lighten up and realize that producers of action adventure and horror movies aren't all trying to bombard us with 100% emotionally wrenching movies like ""Terms of Endearment"".",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Campy, silly but fun.","OK, it's not Oscar material but this film as Stephen Sommers has said is a homage to 30's Horror films. It's supposed to be fun and campy. Did it hit the mark? I would say yes. Thanks to a lot of campy acting most of it from Richard Roxburgh as Dracula and a hilarious ""friar,"" Carl played by David Wenham you could either cringe at former or laugh at the latter. Still these two guys steal the film from both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Also a standout in my opinion is Elena Anaya's screechy vampire bride Aleera who just can't seem to shut up! Apart from that this movie is fast paced and a bit nerve wracking. The downside is too much CGI effects. It's like the special effects is the star of the movie.

Don't see this film for the plot, which is mediocre at best, just enough to carry the arrangement of specialFX. See it as a fun cartoon, only done with real-life actors instead (at least some, as at least 50% of the cast actually are CGI). One serious warning though: The film tries very hard to be cool, but often overdoes its own themes. Some scenes are just pure ridiculous and seem to be straight out of a spoof like Scary Movie, but generally the film is as much fun as a themepark ride capitalising on proven, non to surprising but well done shock and awe FX (I especially think that the Werewolfs were done very well, far better than in the horrendeous ""Underworld"").

For example, the sets, the costumes and especially the music, all these are exceptional. It is indeed a pot-mix of Dracula and Frankenstein(not the first one...)but, overall, is entertaining.

"Eye candy so sweet, it'll send you into the fantasy film buff's equivalent of a diabetic coma.","Eye candy so sweet, the sugar shock will send you into the fantasy film buff's equivalent of a diabetic coma. As a medically necessary antidote, follow this movie up with a chaser of ""Dancing at Lughnasa"" - or some other equally slow paced yawner - so that you can bear to make it through another unfantastical day of your normal, boring, real human life without unconsciously resorting to wrapping your teeth around some hapless unsuspecting co-worker's neck in search of a desperate shot of excitement - vampire style.No sh**, man! This single movie has enough computer generated graphics special effects to power a thousand pyrotechnical, body-morphing, fantasy world conjuring, beast-enabled fight scene plastered, adrenalin pumping, camera swishing, sorry-we-forgot-the-storyline action spectaculars. It's wall to wall on this one. Not content with a mere two hours of non-stop CG assault on your senses, they even found a way to squeeze entire full length computer generated action movie features between each frame. Try it. Slow down the movie enough on your player and you'll see what I'm talking about. It's insane! (OK, made you look. Nye, nye, nye-nye, nye) You need to watch this movie inside a hyperbaric chamber, being bathed in high pressure oxygen rich air osmotically carrying oxygen into your bloodstream, because there's just no good moment to take a breath. I'd like to see a version of this movie cut with 5 second pauses at 1 minute intervals. That way you could take a deep breath and hold it for every step of the way. Every minute there'd be a black screen with huge text saying ""Now breath in deep"". It would be released as ""Van Helsing: Survival Edition"", with the catchphrase ""Now You Can Breathe (TM)"".Alright, nuff said. Not suggesting that you avoid this movie. It was actually quite delicious to look at, and I had fun with it (I'm sure someone's going to ream me for admitting that, but WTF). By far the star of the show was Dr. Frankenstein's monster - the only real compelling emotional element in all of it. Van Helsing's sidekick also adds a bit of flavor, of the levity variety. Otherwise, it's just eye candy. But ever so schweet! It's kind of like in that episode of the Simpsons where Bart and Milhouse score a $20 bill and immediately proceed to the Kwik-e-mart to order a squishy from Apu that's made entirely from 100% syrup. Ingestion of said squishy sends Bart and Milhouse on a psychedelic sugar-induced trip and, next morning, Bart discovers he's joined the Boy Scouts. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I won't bother to go into the plot of this movie, since it's so minimal that even a mere sentence on the plot could be considered a spoiler. You have to see this movie to believe it. The visuals are just so unbelievably out of control. Who needs 'shrooms when you can trip out on this kind of stuff? Sure, the dialog is stooooooopid. Sure, the story is no more than a wee teeny tiny little idea adorned with a katrillion dollars' worth of effects magic.

This was Somers' fault,"It was obvious from the start that Van Helsing was never going to be Oscar material, but it was Stephen Somers' overconfidence in himself that caused it to tank.Let's face it: Somers is no writer. After the mummy series, he has proved himself to be an inadequate director, (although I was quite disappointed with his attempt at directing Van Helsing) and talented enough at dealing with CGI, but when he tries to put pen to paper he just ends up hurting himself, and all others concerned. The script for Van Helsing was abominable - there were only a few lines in the entire movie that I considered well written, and they were all given to Carl. I wish some directors would just stick to what they're good at, which is directing, as opposed to trying to write as well - there are many skilled screenwriters out there, why try to put them out of a job?Also, the editors seem to have fallen asleep at the wheel of this one, and the result is a head on collision. There is no sense of continuity at all in Van Helsing: it goes from having the mood of a tense action thriller to having the mood of a campy comedy. Nothing really seemed to fit together, as if they tore fragments from three different movies, mashed them together, stamped a title on it and shipped it to the theaters. I would love to know if production was rushed on this film, or if they had to move up the release date, because there are so many things that should have been changed that look like they were left in because there was no time to change them.For example, the character of Frankenstein's monster was ridiculously portrayed, with a leg squirting out steam, and the top half of his head falling off to expose his glowing, sparking blue brain. The creature is barely able to walk, and yet he swings crazily on a rope from building to building. He howls out his lines like an opera singer, which I found quite funny when I looked up Shuler Hensley who played him, and found out that he is, in fact, a singer. Was this an intentional joke? I also found it amusing that Van Helsing, a supposedly serious 'monster hunter' kept referring to Frankenstein's creation as 'Frankenstein'. This character belonged in a comedy, not a movie that was attempting to be a serious thriller.It's true that the plot is a ludicrous attempt to fit virtually every horror movie character into one story, but again, I believe that with a better director and a better script, it could have turned out passable. As it is, the movie is cringe worthy at parts, and unsatisfying for the rest. There's kind of a failed love plot between Valerious and Van Helsing, which is hinted at, but never really takes off, which gets really confusing.As well, the movie relied much too heavily on CGI, which was definitely a downside. I'm fine with characters like the werewolf or the vampires in monster form being computer generated, but it seems most Hollywood producers have forgotten the virtues of makeup. There was absolutely no need for the vampires to form those ridiculously enormous fanged mouths when they bit their victims - a vampire bite is supposed to leave two tiny holes in the neck, not tear someone's head off! And Mr Hyde, one of my favorite Horror characters, was not only completely computer generated, but also turned into a gibbering baboon! WHY CAN'T MODERN Hollywood PRODUCERS DO HYDE JUSTICE?! In League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, he was transformed into an absurdly muscled stupid guy, and in Van Helsing, they've turned him into an ape. What they should have done, is had Robbie Coltrane play the part himself with some makeup on, instead of just providing his voice, and kept Hyde more as a real person rather than a green baboon, jumping off the walls and ceiling. That would have done a lot to keep the film more grounded.The acting wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been in Van Helsing. It was David Wenham as the belligerent friar Carl who really saved the movie, taking every Lord of the Rings fan by surprise by playing a character the polar opposite of his valiant Prince Faramir. The funny voiced, bumbling and ultimately very funny Carl was definitely the highlight of the movie. Hugh Jackman did what he could with the title role, (despite his fluctuating accent: I caught some American, British, Australian, Italian and Transylvanian throughout the film. Where was Van Helsing supposed to be from, and why couldn't he keep his accent steady? This is another thing a good director would have caught) but his part was so badly written that he had to battle to make the character believable. Richard Roxburgh was campy and very over-the-top as Dracula, but good fun nonetheless. If he had toned his seemingly relentless energy down, (and with a competent director, he probably would have) and focused more on being sly and cunning, I think he could have made an excellent Dracula. Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious was all right, but she and Jackman shared very little chemistry, and she was stuck with some of the worst lines in the movie, so it was hard to properly rate her performance.Despite all my criticism, I actually enjoyed this movie. It accomplished what it wanted to be, which was an exciting action film where Van Helsing gets to go blow up a whole bunch of monsters. I just think it could have been done a whole lot better, if Somers had stayed far away from the project, which would have made it a lot more enjoyable. My rating of 6/10 isn't because the movie wasn't entertaining, but because I thought it was badly done, and could have been better.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly awful,"This came out here today and it was one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to walk out on.One of the worst aspects for me was the standard of the CGI stunts. Please please please, until the standard of CGI improves to the point where you can synthesize a realistic human being then either do the stunts with real people or drop them. I don't want to watch a cartoon figure leap about the screen.Aside from that, the plot jumped all over the place, the sets looked like sets rather than real places and there were several points that inspired unintentional laughter e.g. almost anything with ""the monster"" and Van Helsing howling at the moon. I really wanted to laugh.The director seems to think filming in low light and with very loud music creates atmosphere. Sorry but it takes a bit more than that.A truly appalling film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's great fun!,"No, it's not Oscar-worthy but it's a great nod to the old black and white horror movies of the 1930s and on. It even starts in B&W, which is also used a device to indicate a past event. Richard Roxburgh practically steals the movie with his hammed up performance, clearly relishing the role. Hugh Jackman makes a great Van Helsing, a cowboy sort of character that fits him like a glove. And Kate Beckinsale is hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!Seems to be made by the same people who made The Mummy movies, which is fun. Similar techniques are seen with the jaw opening of the vampires compared to the Mummy. I'll personally enjoy this for many more years.

Kind of reminded me of LXG.,"This film is huge on special effects and pretty cast members but very light on anything memorable. So much special effects that they became ordinary after a time, and a script that was pretty weak. The story was interesting, but it should have been given what they had to work with. At the end of the day, they managed to make a horror movie with vampires, werewolves, and the Frankenstein monster, and yet not have anything remotely scary in the film. More chills in Harry Potter. Some of the imagery was so spectacular, however, that I have to recommend it be seen in the theatre.

Like that you need silver against Vampires -> no you need wood, silver is against werewolves and Vampires can't transform into harpies or walk on walls or make children, this is just ridiculous to me... and that were just 3 examples out of maaaany...Also what I didn't like was the huge number of special effects... there weren't so much scenes without them ... and these effect weren't done really well ... not for a 2004 movie.The tension was almost on the same level for the whole movie.. lowand also Bram Stoker's idea of the character van Helsing gets completely ridiculed because in the original he was just an old Doctor who found out what Count Dracula was and how to kill him..... And now people will think of van Helsing as some kind of comic-style Vampire Hunter...What was good: Hugh Jackman, though for the first minutes I couldn't stop laughing over his hair.... They brought in a lot of known characters: Werewolves, Vampires, Mr Hyde, Frankenstein ""Igor"".... but this also might count as a minus point cause it's really too much....It could be a movie for children from 9-13... but all other people shouldn't watch this...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Vampires and melancholy,"I absolutely love this version of Van Helsing. The cinematography and costumes are truly impressive and the dialogue is superb. The acting of Dracula and his brides is something I have not yet seen in any other movie, and they truly define what and how vampires should be. It's not focused on only blood lust and killing. I understand why it may be silly for some, possibly for the clichés about holy water, crosses, and silver bullets. The ball scene with the mirror was definitely my favourite. The werewolves looked amazing, were true to the myth and transformed at full moon. It has its dark, mysterious, and melancholic side, but it still is suitable for all audiences with the action scenes. Harmless and a fun twist on Van Helsing.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Another Sommers Film,"Van Helsing is the latest installment of Steven Sommers. It is not about curses or mummies, but has the same general hokiness and camp that I expect from the movies he's directed so far. Partially the delivery and feeling is due to the actors. The movie wouldn't have worked if they'd taken it seriously. The whole point of movies such as this are the delivery of the lines, and how well it's written, if it doesn't make you giggle or at least smile, then the movie hasn't done it's job. Van Helsing is not the best Steven Sommers has done, but for the most part it delivers.Reviewers said there were too many special effects, too many sequences devoted to action. The answer is yes, there are too many. This movie tends to suffer from ""I have too much money to burn through let's use it all."" One of the charms of The Mummy was the fact that there was one threat and the good guys had to deal with it. Special effects were used only for when the mummy was rebuilding itself and the minions fighting Brendan Fraser's character. The rest of the movie properly had a love story with the action.Sommers should have left it at that with Van Helsing. The characters are interesting, he brings up good mystery with Van Helsing by giving him a past he doesn't know. But just as we might get too interested, the movie is over-run with too many plots. And, though I hate to say this, too much action.I enjoy action sequences as much as the next, but I like to see some better reason for them. The point of action is to be paced well, like all good things there must be some respite for the watcher as well as the character. Is there a reason why he does what he does? Or a love story in Van Helsing? Definitely there are hints of attraction, but that's pretty much as far as it goes for the guy. Why? because he can never catch a break when fighting bad guys.Overall the acting is well done, what there is of it, with overtones from the other films that each of the actors have been in. There are also the inevitable echoes of The Mummy, especially whenever Kevin J. O'Connor is on screen.So, should you see this movie? Yes it's a wonderful thing for an otherwise empty night, and if you're an old horror movie fan, or just love Young Frankenstein, then you'll love the opening sequence. Done in black and white it provides a tone, where, if you're not careful, you might reminisce about for the rest of the show.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing one.,"I was highly expected this first 2004 summer movie. Available in Thailand 5th May. No story, low quality screenplay but excellent CGI. Non-stop action had no fun coz it lacked story. I give it 6/10. Think THE MUMMY RETURNS was bad, this one is worse. And please, Mr. Sommers. No VAN HELSING RETURNS ! One time was enough, I didn't care about him at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't waste your time.,"Bad acting, bad story but at least the wolfman was hot!  If you really want to see this movie wait till it comes out on DVD.  Don't waste your time or your money.  I was really disappointed in this movie.  I kept expecting Hugh Jackman to turn into Wolverine, from the X-men series, a couple of times. The Brides of Dracula couldn't act their way out of a coffin. If only Frankenstein was given some acting ability when they were out collecting body parts. David Wenham who plays Carl provide a couple of funny moments but I couldn't get past his character Faramir in the Lord of the Ring series.  Kate Beckinsale is beautiful as always.  This movie reminded me too much of The Mummy, Stephen Sommers might have has success with the way he directed The Mummy but it didn't work with Van Helsing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
more than 2 hours non stop action,"First I want to say that it is rather unique that a movie is shown in the Netherlands before it is even released in the U.S. , even though it is just for 2 days. I just got out of the cinema and I am still feeling the adrenaline rush into my veins. There is not even a single moment of rest in this movie. Just when you think that Hugh (Jackman) and Kate (Beckinsale) can rest for a bit after being chased by some vampires, another monster appears before them. Don't go to this movie for the story, see it because of the awesome special effects. I just wish there was a little more gore in it. In such a movie as this a bit more gore would be appropriate. Unfortunately Sommers made this movie PG 13.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Totally ridiculous,"This is the most ridiculous and preposterous movie I have seen in a long time. The acting is awful, so over the top it is mostly laughable. The plot makes no sense (OK horror films tend not to but this one is under par). It's involuntarily funny up to a point but a deep sense of boredom settled in with me after half an hour or so and never left me until the end, which seemed very long to come. Some people go for special effects, which has never been sufficient for me to like a film, special effects without any other redeeming qualities is just total emptiness. Combining all the monsters that ever existed is pretty silly although it's been done before many times in equally forgettable old horror flicks. By the way, what is Dr. Jekill doing on the top of Notre-Dame de Paris since that's an English story? But why quibble with details in such a mess.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A contemporary classic?,"What an excellent matinee movie! Aside from a bit of weak dialogue and a question I have about one of the major action sequences this James Bond/Indiana Jones meets the monsters of Universal Studios really delivered the goods for me.  Pure escapism and mind-boggling special effects from start to finish.  I felt that the film remained true to the spirit and heritage of the great classic Universal flicks with a clever nod to the Hammer Studio vampire films of the 60's. Van Helsing is not a horror movie so much as it is a monster/action movie. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the Frankenstein monster character.  I also felt that the sensuality of vampirism was deftly handled considering the makers were going for a PG rating. I can't decide whether two of the very final scenes were an homage or just plain pop-corny but given the spirit of the film I guess they worked. Van Helsing far surpassed my expectations so much so that I plan to go back to the theatre and see it again...something I haven't done in a very, very long time. Try to catch the DLP version it is visually stunning. I hope for a sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Poor Effort,"When I first heard of this movie via a trailer I was quite intrigued by what it would offer. Hugh Jackman looked good in this role and Kate Beckinsale also looked good especially after the whole Underworld experience. But as I was looking at the credits I felt disappointed that this movie was actually written and directed by Stephen Sommers of `The Mummy' fame. Which goes without saying that I did not enjoy the last Mummy film.As expected the film was filled with action and CGI characters. The meshing of the characters was uncoordinated. The little comic relief from David Wenham was drab and unoriginal. The acting, dialogue and plot were absolutely substandard. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was probably Art Direction, and Costumes.If you are in for a mindless thrill ride then perhaps you might enjoy this movie. You might be able to enjoy the action and monster action, but nothing really in terms of substance.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I go to movies to enjoy them... and I did enjoy Van Helsing!,"I was prepared not to like this movie because of the hype. I'm married to a Vampire Move Lover. I like them too, but really like romance, if there is also something else going on. We both enjoyed this movie! Not only was the movie beautifully made as far as effects, but the people in the movie were also beautiful in their own right. I can't imagine anyone leaving in the middle of this movie, because if they did, they obviously did the movie a great disservice. The best of it was in the middle and toward the end. Of course, to each his own. If anyone is to give a summary of a movie, it stands to reason that they would at least give it a complete summary. Anything less is rather absurd, and gives the summary a condescending feeling... at least to me. My thoughts: Roxburgh was the most beguiling Dracula I have ever seen, from the way he pronounced his name to the way he obviously felt fear and pain when confronted with Van Helsing in the final moments. That was a surprise. Yes, I found it scary, but not in a terrifying way... in a ""this is a semi-serious horror movie with special effects and lots of little surprises"" way.Okay... my 12 year old daughter wasn't scared by the movie, but thrilled is a better word. She jumped, shrieked, and even laughed. Is that so bad? No, it's not the Exorcist of the Vampire world... it's a well done story of the timeless legends of Vampires and their brethren... in a fantasy world that I found captivating, and fun. There wasn't an overabundance of blood, though I found the scene in the vampire ""nursery"" a big icky... The little bit of romance there was tended to be more a thought than an action... and was a nice side trip to the fast paced action elsewhere.Overall - I loved it and really do believe it earned all 10 of the stars I gave it. I want to see it again already, and I just got home from the theater a little while ago.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst Film Ever,"One word: Horrible.One Piece of Advice: Don't waste 2 hours of your life.One Movie Buff's Request: Sommer's please don't make any more movies.One Last Time: Horrible.The movie itself has a story, somewhere, boring in the action. It had potential in an intriguing premise, but the execution was just not done well. The actors cannot be blamed, the set designers neither, in fact no artist working on this film can be blamed but the writer and director, which happens to be the same person. Hmmmmm. The Mummy was, I agree slightly better, and I can understand why some thought the Mummy was actually a good movie (I disliked the Mummy almost as much as this).The problem with Van Helsing, is that it drama's up when it is not needed, attempts humor that makes one groan, and tries to cover a poor story with bizarre, supernatural action, that ultimately flops. The CGI was second class, even WETA workshops (gorgous CGI on LOTR characters) could not have pulled this movie from the abysmal depths of failure that it is.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Leave Sommers Alone!,"Hey, I've been reading all the comments that people have been leaving about this movie and I just don't get it, why does everyone hate it so much?  What were you expecting?  Akira Kurosawa's ""Ran""? Stephen Sommers mashes together all sorts of different ideas from the Hollywood blockbusters, westerns, modern horror, classic horror and splashes it all into one mayhemic mix.  He's like the Hollywood Blockbuster version of Tarantino (also a genius). Yes a lot of the time it's mindless entertainment but it is intelligent and well controlled mindless entertainment (Yeah i know that doesn't really make sense but just here me out).The film was a lot of the time very silly and very contrived, I'll give you that, but that was half the point.  There were some really clever moments. Like the line from ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly"" about talking before killing someone, the lines from Frankenstein ""It's alive, throw the switches, yes master!"" and the bit from ""Speed"" except with a carriage instead of a bus.  Sommers has a real knack for smashing together contemporary action (explosions, electricity, chases) with 19th Century stylised vision.The production design was just marvelous; the creepy and elaborate sets, the over the top monsters and the wonderful blue hue that he'd given the whole film.  There were some very clever camera techniques as well i.e. in some cases rather than cutting from one area of the set to another, he just made the camera zoom across vast distances at an incredible rate, it's inventive you've got to at least give him that.To be honest I think you should all give Stepehn Sommers a break, what you should have expected was stylised spectacle, special effects laden mayhem, plenty of action sequences and lots of comic moments, which he delivered with gusto and panache.  I think hats off to Stephen Sommers for attacking this film with a no holes barred attitude and pulling it off.  This was stylish, silly but inventive and quit frankly insane artistic flare.  Sorry, I had to have that little rant there.(Also hats off to Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxbourgh for giving wonderfully over the top performances, hats also off to Alan Silvestri for the groovy score, Allan Cameron for the production design and also to Bob Duscay for producing it and doing some top notch editing [also, Kelly Matsumoto] especially during the fight sequences.  Oh and obviously once again a huge ten galleon hat off to Stephen Sommers for just being an all round visionary maniac.)",,Anonymous,Fantasy

I was laughing so much I was crying, but in a good way.If you go and see this film then don't expect anything thought provoking, scary or constructive in any way.

"Campy, vampy, and entertaining","""Van Helsing"" is a movie that's loud, flashy, shamelessly over-the-top, and frequently silly.  And so help me, I enjoyed it.Make no mistake, this isn't something I appreciated on the level of, say, ""Lost in Translation,"" or even ""Spider-Man,"" for that matter.  There's always a bit of guilt involved when I go along with this kind of material, born of the lingering knowledge that there are more intelligent and skillful movies out there.  And yet, when Steven Sommers' adrenaline-fueled monster mash threw caution (and logic) to the wind and took off like a vampire bat-woman out of hell, I was smiling faintly, content to accept the movie for the amusement-park ride it is.The Van Helsing of the title is not the scholarly Abraham of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" but adventuresome Gabriel, played by Hugh Jackman.  He's kind of a Victorian MiB agent, taking orders from a secret ecumenical order working underneath St. Peter's Basilica.  ""We have protected mankind since time immemorial,"" a cardinal intones, as he passes through a room where priests, rabbis, imams, Bhuddist monks, and assorted others work side-by-side.  Given the number of innocents who have died (and are still dying) because two or more of the represented faiths refused to get along with each other, one might suggest that they're not doing a very good job-but to borrow a phrase from Ebert, this is supplying logic where it is manifestly not wanted.  Van Helsing's mission, should he choose to accept it: go to Transylvania, hunt down Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and kill him.Riding on this is the salvation of nine generations' worth of souls from the Romany clan Valerious, who in accordance with an ancient pact cannot enter Heaven until Drac is vanquished.  The Valerious family is down to its last two scions: brother Velkan (Will Kemp), who's been bitten by a werewolf, and sister Anna (Kate Beckinsale), on whom the local vampires would like to visit a similar fate.  Dracula, meanwhile, has his own agenda, involving bringing life to his stillborn offspring via the experiments of a certain Dr. Frankenstein.  All this (and more) makes for a very crowded movie, and the story winds up not unlike Frankenstein's ultimate project: the parts don't fit together seamlessly, but as a whole it manages to work-most of the time.With decent F/X and excellent settings (which look like they sprung from the collective imaginations of Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, and Edgar Allan Poe), ""Van Helsing"" is a handsome film visually.  Speaking of handsome, Jackman cuts a fine figure in the lead role and, while the script doesn't always give him a whole lot to work with, he works well with what he's given.  His Van Helsing covers much of the same ground as Wolverine (both characters are lone warriors with large gaps in their memory) but does so with a soberer, more conscientious bent.  David Wenham has fun (and is fun to watch) in the sidekick role, a friar of strong intelligence and questionable spirituality. On the monster side of things, Shuler Hensley does the best work as Frankenstein's creation, a not-so-gentle giant who ends up being an unlikely ally for the heroes.  But while Roxburgh looks good as a seedily aristocratic Dracula, his performance could have done with a bit more menace and a lot less scenery-chewing.  I'm inclined to blame Sommers for this, since Roxburgh is somewhat effective in his more restrained moments-there's a nice bit where he attempts to seduce Anna at a masked ball-and in any case, it's still a step or two up from Gerard Butler's lifeless portrayal in `Dracula 2000.'`Van Helsing' starts off strong, with a gorgeous black-and-white prologue, and has enough good action sequences to keep things moving.  Only towards the end of its two-and-a-quarter hours running time does it begin to lose steam.  But well before then, most audience members will have decided to go along for the ride, or opt out altogether.  I chose the former, and had fun-but others may do as they see fit.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More Dopey Than Jessica Simpson,"Van Helsing. So Hugh Jackman tries to expand. With Van Helsing, don't push your luck Wolverine.Review: Van Helsing, despite the cool name is far from it. We have a hunter, Helsing, who kills vampires and other creatures of the night. Reasons why are unknown to us. The first thing you will notice is the look of Helsing. Jackman looks cool at least. We also get Kate Beckinsale, so why does this suck? Allow me to tell you. First, The dialog. This movie must have some of the dumbest dialog ever. It will leave you wondering ""What?"" Another is the bad directing. When Helsing is given his mission, they show a picture of two people, one being Beckinsale and after given his mission, the camera looks ONLY at Beckinsale's side of the photo, not the other individual that is just as important. Perhaps Helsing was thinking ""She's hot."" ""If I succeed, perhaps I'll get some."" That's the impression that I got. Another is too much action. Many would not complain about that. So Crass, you would ask, ""Why does that suck?"" Reason: Some of the action is sloppy and with too much action is another way to dodge CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Yes, the ultimate weakness is a tremendous lack of character development. We learn absolutely nothing about anyone. That's why Helsing's reasons to hunt down creatures of the night is unknown to us. He just does. How uninteresting. Also the one who played Faramir in the Lord of the Rings movies is here, However he is a totally annoying monk that sports a hairstyle that would be unappealing to a five year old. His dialog is the worst. Also the acting is quite wooden, with the exception of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. His performance is quite good. He seemed to be the only one here to try and save this movie, but it's a lost cause. What started out as a attempt at a new franchise is going to crash before takeoff.The Last Word: Disaster. Van Helsing is a poorly executed, inane mess that fails on so many levels. I cannot believe that I managed to stomach any of this mess. The ONLY reason that this gets a two is that I gave Helsing an extra point out of pity. Jackman, stick with Wolverine OK?",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"really funny, exiting, scary and special film, with mean producers","this film at the first sight as nothing special, but it is really kind of weird. the story lines is attractive and appropriate for the Count Dracula's fans. Is a truly awesome way to make an action-funny movie about such a legendary and told fight between Van Helsing and Dracula, and of course, the bound of the Frankenstein monster and the Wolfman to the story is a great contribution to the action, even if its not the best of the ideas, nor the most original idea, either. Thats for the Castlevania players, in which both of them, frank and wolf, make apparitions in various parts of the game. By the way, I was waiting for a mention about the Helsing-Belmont's clan relation, too. The most of the people that watched the movie with me didn't know about the long story between this two characters. And maybe thats why I fall in love with the big fight. I was waiting a lot of talking between them, and cross traps, and holly water spurts, like the Bram Stocker version (that is a great movie, too), but I had a truly good outcome, instead. Its a shame that the makers couldn't get more funds for best special effects, best costumes, best weapons and all that stuff. A project like that, must be very well done. But, otherwise, they got material for the next one, they got the mummy, the phantom of the opera, the hollow man,etc. they got the chance to make another good movie, and thats why I say YES TO VAN HELSING 2!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Frankenstein's brain was flown in from the set of the next sequel of Silence of the Lambs. A mirror acts like a Stargate, go through it and be somewhere completely different suddenly. Some castles are moved from New Zealand, and Saruman and Sauran sorely miss them. I've seen Jack Nicholson do a better werewolf. Van can surf like Legolas, but this looks even more unbelievable. Everybody is able to perform rope-slinging like Spidey, even the lady outdoes Indiana Jones.All humans have super strength and survive blows that would kill a rhino, survive 50 yard drops that would smash the sturdiest marble.Oooh, and of course we got Faramir from LOTR, behaving silly and cowardly. And Wolverine from X-Men, behaving heroic and gentlemen-like. Rubeus Hagrid from Harry Potter is killed way too soon. M of the League is way too human and friendly to convince as a vampire. Selene of Underworld though is a good and very strong vampire killer, and how tiny is her waist, it's stunning, but it being very unpractical does of course not stop her.Ah, all ends well that ends like Ghost. No Swayze though... But the end is an invitation for a sequel. I hope it won't be made.Of course it's dark, snowing and/or raining all the time. The acting is a bit thin, it's all a caricature. The plot, well, it makes hardly any sense. The story goes ways Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley have never thought of and would certainly not approve.It's all way too silly. I give it a 3. Not a 1. But that's just because of the special effects, the costumes and the new ways of extreme violence.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cinematic Breakthrough - True Heroes are not Gymnasts!,"What I like about this film is that the heroes perform their stunts...err...gracelessly.  Van Helsing attempts to overcome the flaw of many action films by adding an element of brute realism to the contemporary genre of unexplained superhuman gymnastics.  Heroes actually hit anything from trees, roof shingles, and cliffs during a fall - I think I would hit everything except air if I took a plunge!Faithfully, this visually-rich film pays homage to early century horror classics, casting an icy shadow over each frame.  You may recognize the opening dialogue as an allusion to an earlier film.  Many interesting overhead shots patrol the industrial-aged cities of Paris, Rome, and Transylvania.  Inventions, potions, art, and folklore embody an environment that embraces a story of passionate motives with bits of comic relief.A simple but interesting premise emerges from the opening sequences: a single-minded 19th century hitman is hired by the pope to purge the world of evil monsters.  Of course we know that from the previews.  However, Van Helsing is already subject to paradox in his mission to ""cleanse"" since the act of killing is unholy - and this throws the wrench in the whole gothic machine.Remember, take each film for what it has to offer.  Films entertain in different ways.  Don't watch Scarface expecting to be touched by a valuable family lesson.  Don't watch Star Wars expecting to explore interpersonal relationships in a contemporary world.  Don't watch the Wizard of Oz expecting handguns and grenade launchers.  Don't watch Bruce Almighty expecting to find God as an old beady-eyed squinty cigar-smoking man with thick glasses (that's a different movie).",,Anonymous,Fantasy
As a WereWolf and Vampire Freak  just what I needed,"Like the  Mummy and its follow on  its spectacular special effectscarry the movie , although  I would like to see some fight scenes in modern movies  slowed down  just to be able to appreciate the work they put into them , Over all  a good show , good  make up  and  excellent cast  . Lets hope the sequel  is as good , YES  I am available for a cameo role as a werewolf .  Just goes to show that the old is new again and what  interested movie goers  50 years ago still gets them into  the movies  now . I think Lon Chaney , Bela Lagosi and  Boris Kharlof would be happy with their progeny .

Van Helsing,"it would have been pretty good if the script was decent, but there you go. the only real reason 1 would watch it again is because Kate Beckinsale in that corset outfit looks SO DAM HOTT!!!! GAWD she also wears a red dress at some point so look out for it...DAM she looks fine in that....some of the vampire girls aren't bad either. Anyhow back to the film, set in Transylvania this dark looking film is about the time when Van Helsing (the vampire hunter) is a swarthy young guy instead of the stereotyped old doctor as seen in most Dracula films, basically he's been told by the church to hunt down Dracula and kill him once and for all, after meeting the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale (who plays Anna valerious)they go trampling around Transylvania trying to find Dracula and kill him, bumping into Frankenstein's monster and the wolf man on the way.....on the whole the film is OK, special effects are pretty cool but script sucked a bit hence only 6/10 from me!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A bad script and bad direction, a film that could have been better but that's not all bad.","This film portrays Van Helsing's efforts to fight Dracula, which is now trying to give life to his children through the research of the late Doctor Frankenstein. Directed and written by Stephen Sommers, this adventure film has the participation of Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh and Shuler Hensley in the lead roles.There are certain adventure films, inspired by horror movies, that makes a jumble of elements and characters that have nothing to do with each other. This is one of those films, mixing Dracula to Frankenstein's monster. Even Dr. Jekyll (and his alter-ego, Mr. Hyde) enters the movie! This is not new, has been done in other films and works well when it's done carefully, but definitely wasn't the case here. The script is confusing and makes an attempt to transform Van Helsing, originally a Dutch professor with taste for the occult, in a kind of good supernatural entity destined to hunt down and kill evil monsters. Sorry, but the way this character ended up being ""deconstructed"" was wrong. The director/writer could have made other more interesting options like keeping Van Helsing more faithful to Stoker's novel and try to frame him in a story in the current time, perhaps. The truth is that this film is a clear script error, resulting of flying imagination of its director/screenwriter.The actors were good in their roles, without surprises or special highlights, except perhaps Shuler Hensley, who played a character far from the usual monster, in constant psychological conflict because of his horrid appearance and inner humanity and goodness. The accent of some characters wasn't well done and if the idea was to make them closer to the Romanian universe (when is usually located Dracula's Castle), it failed and became them more humorous than they can be at certain supposedly dramatic moments. The setting, costumes, makeup and sound, visual and special effects are too imaginative, like coming out of a Marvell comic or a graphic novel. The soundtrack, despite the good performance, also didn't stand out particularly.This film is well seeing and entertaining, but doesn't bring big surprises or positively impresses the audience. Far from being a good movie, is ordinary and we see it without big pleasure or expectation.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty Good film.,"I actually enjoyed this movie. I could see why a lot of people don't like this. I knew I would like it. The action in this movie was non-stop. The villains that Van Helsing fights in this movie are, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Count Dracula, Frankenstein Monster, Dracula's Three Brides, and some Werewolves. So much action. Too they didn't make as much as they had anticipated. It had a huge budget of $160 million and it made domestically about $120 million. It was very entertaining. It had great action scenes. I especially loved the fight scene in the woods with Dracula's brides and the werewolf. I know I a one of the few. Of course, I am only 13. But I know I liked it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oh so bad!!!,"I have to admit I'm not the biggest action movie/monster movie fan, so my viewpoint is clearly jaded. We rented this movie and only made it through about half of it before we could take no more and turned it off. Come on, even in comic book movies you still need to have at least mediocre acting from the humans playing the roles! The lead woman role was simply atrocious. I found the action sequences to be run of the mill and ridiculous... it's hard to feel concern for a lead character when he appears to be invincible or unharmable from virtually the movie's start. I'm just glad we didn't pay movie theater prices for this work of garbage!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't play with your prey!,"""Van Helsing"" wants to have several well-known fictional characters from their own stories to be parts of one big story. And it wants to give that new story a cinematic shape so powerful few could possibly rival it.When introducing its characters, the movie does not have the luxury of a chain of separate ""origin"" story movies leading up to it. Therefore, it uses a lot of exposition. That exposition is character driven. Count Dracula tells Doctor Frankenstein about the grave robbery having ruined the poor scientist's reputation. That way, the audience gets to know how exactly the body parts were obtained. But Dracula does not say it for the audience to catch up on past events leading up to now, he says it to mock and humiliate his human servant. Plus, Dracula has his own plans for the creature, plans he has not made known until just now. And that is just one example of how this film deals with exposition. A lot has to be said, but none of it is said only for the audience, it does not break the fourth wall. More than that, the movie is self-aware and does not pretend to be something it isn't, even resorting to being cynical of itself at certain points. Like when somebody asks why Dracula is a creature that really needs to be destroyed, apart from the danger he poses. Or like when somebody tells a villain they should do things, not talking about doing them.A lot of action takes place with our heroes surviving regardless of how crazy it may look. That is a dangerous move to make because these individuals might just lose their humanity, and the audience will not take any of it seriously. But let's take just one example, the scene where Van Helsing first meets the three ""brides"". When the action is over, the heroes are shown to be exhausted. They have been fighting extremely hard and it shows. They are not invincible, they hurt and suffer. Yes, the movie does boast big action and stunts, but it does not turn the heroes immune to damage. And the sense of humor really comes in handy. But it is not misplaced, and the danger is serious, especially with how powerful the main villain is. The movie does an impressive job making him seemingly impossible to beat. But even so, he isn't just a big bad monster that wants to do bad things. He has a personality and a motivation. I have read ""Frankenstein"" and I have read ""Dracula"". I enjoyed them both. In this movie, they are not what they were in their novels, but the new takes are impressive both visually and in terms of the plot. Frankenstein's creature, Count Dracula and the werewolves are all interconnected.The easiest thing is praising the visuals and the music. Suffice it to say they are great. This is a worthy rival to Coppola's ""Dracula"" in that regard. Only this isn't a horror movie and it isn't romance based, even though it does have some. This is adventure, excitement and awe.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually Stimulating,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to see Van Helsing when it was in theaters. I really wish I had. The movie is extremely visually stimulating. If I were to base my grade of this movie soley on visual effects/set/direction I would give it a 10. Unfortunately, the acting was horrible. In general, I think Hugh Jackman is a decent actor, but I didn't find him convincing as Van Helsing. And Kate Beckingsale, while nice to look at, couldn't act her way out of a shoebox. The actor that played Dracula made me laugh more than convince me he was really evil. Overall, I'm not sorry I watched this movie. It is entertaining.

The film was 2.5 hours of a lot of comic book style action, which was great to watch.  The only character which had the most development was Frankenstein's monster.  He actually had dialogue.

Overrated,"This movie was ok, but very overated. I waited for about 6 months to see this movie and was very dissapointed. From the previews, reviews, and hype I thought this was going to be classic. 1st of all there were too many unecessary special effects. Dracula couldnt ever have a regular conversation without climbing up the wall or causing explosions with his power, this got really annoying quick. Another thing was the story was so predictable, a 5 year old could figure it out. As soom as they found Frankenstein you knew what was going to happen and after this you're just waiting for the movie to end. They had all the right tools to make this a great movie but blew it. All they had to do was spend a little more emphasis on the plot. Then they could have eased back on the special effects. You dont have to have a big special effects scene every 15 seconds. Dracula and his wives didnt have to show their vampire teeth in every conversation they had. The teeth they had werent even planted they were computer generated. These things are repetitive thoughout the movie and this is what hurt it. What a waste, could have been something special.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not bad, despite what's being said","The early reviews for this are all over the map, with lots of pans. I frankly don't get it. Let's face it, folks, the progenitors of this film were B movies long before they became ""classics"" of the horror genre. As such, they endured decades of critical scorn before being appreciated. Will this achieve the same fate? Probably not, but it's not the turkey everyone is saying!Disclaimer: I'm a boomer. I grew up with high-concept silly movies and learned how to adopt a mindset to appreciate them. Shoot, I was even able to find fun with ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (LXG) which was, by any measure, a much worse movie than this.The tactic here is relentless action which sweeps you along without giving you too much time to think of what's illogical (other than the mere existence of vampires, werewolves, et al). Is some of the action silly? Sure. But is it entertaining? It can be if you let it. Aside from the obvious derivations, there are, as others have noted, quotes and homages from a variety of other films. Those are fun. There is comic relief, mostly from David Wenham but also from Hugh Jackman himself. Is the heroine totally implausible? Duh, of course! But that's part of her job. Classic horror films have two types of women - crones and bimbos. Since there's no one comparable to Maria Ouspenskaya these days, we have to just settle for the babe.I rated this 8 out of 10. It's good mindless entertainment that pays due respect to its origins. Where it falls down is both at the very beginning and near the end. In the beginning, there's a sequence with Van Helsing and Mr Hyde/Dr. Jekyll where Mr. Hyde is every bit as overdone as in LXG. At the end, the temptation once again becomes too great and the climactic battle is between CGI creatures. Well done, but a bit disappointing. The very end of the movie is its Achilles heel - it's a real downer and probably hurts the word of mouth for the show.Should you see it? If you liked ""The Mummy"", you may well like this. Just don't be too swayed by the critics. Many of them were wrong about the original Universal horror films, as they have been later over other FX-laden films. Especially if you're of boomer age like me, you may find yourself having a pretty good time with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I wanted to like ""V.H."", I really did...","I like Hugh Jackman (""Van Helsing's"" Recalcitrant Hero); I like Kate Beckinsale (The Stunning Heroine); I like Richard Roxburgh (The Sexy Anti-Hero) and David Wenham (The Hero's Quirky Sidekick). And the first quarter-hour of ""Van Helsing"" (""V.H."") starts off promisingly, in Paris, with our hero battling Mr. Hyde (Dr. Jekyll's alter ego) in Notre Dame cathedral. Granted, some liberties have been taken with the Parisian geography and Notre Dame's architecture, but who cares? I wanted to see a big, over-the-top movie, and ""V.H."" is certainly that. But, like Count Dracula, it has no heartbeat, no real soul. (How's that for an analogy, eh?) It's one gravity-defying set piece after another. I found myself thinking about the last generation of movies and movie-goers: If you were in the ticket queue and you overheard someone coming out of the theater saying ""Weren't the locations in the film beautiful?"", you knew that the person was looking for something nice to say because film itself was a stinker. Instead we now say ""Weren't the effects fantastic?"" And indeed, the combination of motion capture and keyframe animation - especially when the brides of Dracula swoop in to terrify the poor Transylvanian villagers who must live with not only vampires but also werewolves and - for a time - Dr. Frankenstein (who leaves his misunderstood ""monster"" behind) as well. (Why don't these people move?) I felt particularly sorry for Jackman: It's one thing to play the strong, silent type, but it's quite another to not have enough material to really (pardon the pun) sink your teeth into. And I don't believe I'm spoiling the film by saying that in the climactic fight scene finale, he's hardly seen: His digital double does all the heavy lifting. But in a way this was the logical conclusion, since throughout the film almost all the other main characters appeared to enjoy themselves more than V.H.--even if they were often guilty of chewing the scenery (again, sorry about the pun). So my advice would be as follows: Want to see Hugh Jackman? Watch ""X-Men 2"". Kate Beckinsale? Go for a little film called ""Shooting Fish"". In the meantime, I've heard that there will probably be a ""V.H. 2"", and why not? When your enemy is the undead you can go on and on and on....",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
kind of a mess,"There are some interesting takes on the vampire legend in this movie, but unfortunately they are buried beneath confusing plot twists, problems with tone, and a script that is about 30 minutes too long. The movie features Hugh Jackman as the legendary vampire hunter Van Helsing, but a quasi-immortal version of Helsing that can't remember his past except in flashes of nightmares. Kate Beckinsale plays Anna Valerious, an action hero in her own right whose family has a history with Dracula.Also making appearances in the film are Dr. Jeckle/Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein and his creation, and the Wolf man. The plot revolves around a confusing scheme by Dracula to harvest the science of Frankenstein to become a baby daddy and Van Helsing attempting to release Anna's ancestors into heaven, and also werewolves for whatever reason. There's also a separate plot teased about how Van Helsing was somehow responsible for creating Dracula, although as far as I can tell a few allusions is all the movie delivers, perhaps because they expected to get sequels that never materialized.My biggest problem with the movie is tone. For the first 30 minutes I literally couldn't tell if the movie was supposed to be a horror thriller or a slapstick parody. Dramatic scenes will be suddenly put on hold while characters crack jokes with a wink to the audience before picking right back up with drama. I think this was a conscious choice, kind of like they want to say ""hey we get it, this is silly stuff."" But instead of coming off as hip, it mostly just serves to drain any dramatic tension they were building.The other issue is time. Good lord this is a long film for a horror movie. The extra length is used to add several additional meaningless battles in the middle of the movie that just go nowhere. They could have clipped Anna's brother out completely and just brought Van Helsing to his battle with Dracula sooner and the movie would have flowed so much better.In the end, I felt like there were some interesting moments here, but I was too frustrated waiting for them to get to the movie's climax to appreciate them. Instead I just felt like I must have missed a previous movie that explained all of the backstory the characters referenced in this film but never explained.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
it's thrilling and visually stunning adventure,"""Van Helsing"" (2004) is a thrilling and visually stunning adventure that reinvigorates classic monster lore with a modern twist. Directed by Stephen Sommers, the film stars Hugh Jackman as the legendary monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing, who embarks on a mission to defeat the infamous Count Dracula, played masterfully by Richard Roxburgh.One of the film's standout features is its breathtaking visual effects and imaginative action sequences. The cinematography beautifully captures the gothic atmosphere of 19th-century Europe, immersing viewers in a world filled with dark castles, foggy landscapes, and terrifying creatures. The special effects team has done an exceptional job bringing iconic monsters like Frankenstein's monster and the werewolves to life, making for some truly memorable moments.Hugh Jackman shines in the role of Van Helsing, bringing charisma and intensity to the character. His physicality in the action scenes is impressive, and he perfectly balances the darker aspects of Van Helsing's character with moments of humor and humanity. Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious adds depth to the story, portraying a strong and resourceful character who stands alongside Van Helsing in the fight against evil.The film's pacing keeps audiences engaged from start to finish, with a well-crafted blend of action, suspense, and supernatural elements. The storyline, while drawing on familiar tropes, offers enough twists and turns to keep viewers guessing. The film also pays homage to classic horror films while adding its own unique flair.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Typical summer blockbuster with colossal budget and numerous flaws,"I have seen Van Helsing today in premiere screening and I have found this movie just okay, but I never expect too much from most of summer blockbusters. If you really want to enjoy this summer flick you should leave your brains at home and don't think about acting, plot holes, logical mistakes and other such things. Visual and sound effects were very good, while fight scenes looked pretty dynamic and well made. Computer-generated creatures were exciting and looked almost real. But leave the technical part and computer-generated visuals alone and let's face the most problem parts: the script and acting. Sometimes I have a terrible feeling that something's going wrong with Hollywood screenwriters. Most of recent movies I have seen had so lame script and Van Helsing don't make an exception. You can find here all typical flaws: bad character development, very weak supporting characters, weak and silly dialogs as well as lack of ordinary logic. You know that acting is the weakest point of such high-budgeted summer movies, so don't expect anything great here. Hugh Jackman, who was very good in X-2, this time showed inability to carry movie alone. Cate Beckinsale was miserable as lead female character. Richard Roxburgh as a main villain was too wooden and unemotional. David Wenham (guy who played Faramir in LoTR) definitely deserved something better than such pitiful and mostly unfunny part of superhero's friend and assistant. It looks like they were trying to create character of some kind of cool but awkward guy (like Jonathan in Mummy and Mummy Returns) but they were also wrong here. But despite all numerous flaws nevertheless it's entertained and even enjoyable movie, mostly because it never pretended to be a serious movie. And because of that reason I think it don't worse than much more successful Spider-man 2 and I, Robot which pretended to be something more solid and easily failed there. Overall, Van Helsing is average summer blockbuster, that is worth for watching once but don't expect anything great and memorable here. For Stephen Sommers this movie is another step down after his much more entertained and pleasant Mummy movies.My grade 5.9 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Helsing,"With The Mummy (1999), Stephen Sommers showed us that he could make a film that had character, plenty of CGI, and was just plain fun. The sequel was not so good  less plot, worse CGI, and not so much fun. So a step down, then. The pitch for Van Helsing must have seemed brilliant to studio bosses: take the three biggest horror characters of the 1800's (namely Dracula, the Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's Monster) and shove them together with a hero who, whilst originally was just a mild-mannered doctor, is now a kick-ass monster hunter. What could possibly go wrong?I'll tell you. The problem is that Van Helsing seems like a continuation of the Mummy series just with a different story: virtually no character, massive amounts of (not that great) CGI, and little fun. It's yet another step down for the director who, although has proved he's up for plenty of action, cannot put any life into it. Hugh Jackman appears to be the perfect lead for the role of Gabriel Van Helsing, but he never gets the chance to give depth to his character  as soon as he kills one set of baddies, he's off to kill some more. He can handle the action well (but we already knew this from the X-Men films), and could probably handle any real drama that should have been inserted into the film, but the director just doesn't seem to want us to know anything about any of the characters, he just wants to see them fight, which is not enough. I couldn't help but think that if things had been taken a little slower, the film could have been made that much more interesting  less would have been more in this case. It's as if Sommers is afraid to take a breath lest the audience realise how hollow the film really is.The film was also pitched as a horror/action film, and yet there is not one moment that provides a genuine chill or cheap scare, although it is very dark (it's mostly set at night  I didn't mean atmospherically!) Admittedly some of the action scenes and sets are convincing, and the film does have good production values, but once again it seems the budget has gone towards all the CGI, and not on the script or story. With each film, Sommers seems to include more and more monsters, as if he is trying to outdo his last film in terms of effects. This is a prime example of the ""quality not quantity"" adage, as the more CGI there is, the less real it looks. The action scenes quickly become repetitive and although start off original and good, end up being a bit of a bore. And really, how many times to we have to see the lead characters swing on a rope in front of a castle? It's just not necessary.Overall, it's a real shame that the film turned out this way. It really needed to be either a slower horror film, or an action film which did not feel the need to rush through at such a pace that the audience are afraid to blink lest they miss something. Stephen Sommers must learn how to do character first, action second, if he's going to keep a fan base going; relying on visual effects alone just isn't enough for us anymore.Rated: 5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Van Helsing,"Sorry, but this is just all over the place. A potpourri of myths and legends loosely connected with the famous vampire hunter that just don't gel at all. Doctor Jekyll, Mr Hyde, Victor Frankenstein and his monster all vie with Count Dracula for the attention of a really rather lacklustre Hugh Jackman in the title role. Kate Beckinsale sort-of recreates her ""Underworld"" role as she becomes his kick-ass sidekick. It's fairly action-packed but the scenes go on for far too long, the script is cheesy, the CGI just isn't great and the attempts at humour don't work well either. It's a shame - a rich topic for a story that could have been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
this film wants to be a roller-coaster ride but isn't,"watching this flic I hardly ever found myself on the edge of my seat; it's never really funny or suspenseful or shocking or whatever. films of this kind simply steal from other movies and try to enhance the experience by giving ""more of the same"" plus pumping up the volume. Here you've got the Frankenstein monster, Dracula, and Mr. Hyde teaming up in a story that makes no sense at all. You wonder what this actually is all about. If you want to see a good horror spoof go way back to Roman Polansky's _The Fearless Vampire Killers_ - now taking the enormous production value that went into this movie it is really a shame how little comes back to the audience. But this movie has no point. It's loud, it's always in motion but it never gets off the ground.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Helsing: Is It All That?,"The quick answer is yes, it IS all that.I was so tired from work I nearly fell asleep, but not because it was boring... I was just tired.  Make no mistake, this is a 4 star classic as far as animated live-action movies go. They went for great screen classic. In fact... and I do not mean this sarcastically, one gets the feeling they wrote up their all-time list of favorite film scenes on 3x5 cards and then re-wrote these scenes and wove them into the story. Clicked on Final Draft's Vampire template and whacked their story into shape.While that aspect felt a little contrived, they pull it off, so if you like CG you're in for a great ride.Watch for the very well-executed homage to classic horror genre in the opening sequence, and then keep score of the nods to such films like as Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Ghost, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Fifth Element, LOTR, The Matrix, Aliens, James Bond, Alice in Wonderland, Batman, Spider-man, Crouching Tiger/Hidden Wires, the Hulk -- elements of all these films abound. Hulk because we think ILM used the same root level CG figures for some of the Van Helsing characters... that unmistakably squat froglike quality that digital Hulk had? No question, they used the same engine to drive Dr. Jeckyll and the Wolfman.There were also some wonderful drones that reminded me of steam age jawas. Or perhaps more like steam age ugnaughts. Kate B. kept making me think of a low-budget Catherine Zeta Jones, and Dracula's brides reminded me of Glinda the Good Witch's appearances also in Oz. Everything was like something, come to think of it... but it was vibrant and lush, only the cheezy end sequence was cheap. Some very good LITTLE touches.  The critics are probably going to be tough, but I bet it's gonna do boffo b.o. - I envision teenaged girls weeping at the sappy tacked on ending, and OMG the video game is gonna be very fun - especially from the dracula's bride character vantage - night vision mode where you can see the blood pumping in people's veins.

I Used The Fast Forward on My Remote A Lot,"In the 1940s Universal Studios attempted to re-energize horror films at the box office by churning out movies that crammed as many famous monsters into the plot line as possible. The result was usually more notable for being silly than effective, and in spite of its highly touted CGI effects VAN HELSING is sillier still.Suggested by the vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, the film presents a young and sexy Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is in the employ of a secret sect of the Roman Catholic Church run along James Bond lines. After a little run in with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvannia along with a trusty Friar as sidekick. There they promptly meet a sexy vampire hunting gypsy princess, and the three promptly encounter the Wolf Man, the Frankestein Monster, Dracula, Dracula's Brides, and even Dracula's Babies. Who would have thunk it? The CGI effects are impressive and the occasional homages to the original Universal Studio horror films of the 1930s and 1940s are occasionally amusing--but the whole thing very quickly collapses into a lot of visual and audio noise, and there isn't much to hold it together. After about half an hour I began to use the fast forward button on my remote a lot. It's a case of the director, actors, and special effects people having more fun than the audience.The film is presently available to the homemarket on DVD. The transfer is quite good, although to my eye CGI effects do not work as well on the home screen as they do on the big screen. There are also a handful of bonuses, none of which are greatly interesting or particularly well done. Final take: this a movie that seems to be made by and for a bunch of hyperactive fourteen year old boys without a whole lot of imagination.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Clever, funny and visually impressive","'Van Helsing' is currently playing in Russian theatres and I already saw it two times. Reason #1: it is very cleverly done - with lots of context from other movies and books of this sort - starting with 'Frankenstein' and all the 'Draculas' and ending with such recent things as 'James Bond' and 'X-Men' (natural, as it too has Hugh Jackman). Reason #: it is very funny - the dialogue and, again, the context in which protagonists find themselves. Special effects are impressive as well. Acting is not really in option in such films, but Hugh Jackman is good and sexy, and Roxbourgh makes for a very unusual Dracula. Camera work is good as well - moody and professional, a little bit like in 'Sleepy Hollow'. And the whole movie certainly leaves you romantically exited - all these jumps, fights and full-moon transformations make one think as one is a teenager again. Clever, funny and visually impressive film - at LEAST 7/10!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
George Lucas - Vampire Slayer?,"Well, this film really reminds me of the Star Wars movies. Why?The main theme is the fight between good and evil, but otherwise there is no real plot. You´ll see lots of fights, explosions and chase scenes, but not much else. The film anti-climaxes every ten minutes, usually because of uninspired (over)acting or extremely ridiculous dialogue. The CGI is flawless - it´s actually way too flawless - in this setting it should have been more organic.Oh, and the hero is totally unaware of his background, while the heroine is constantly dressed in sexy outfits, not particularly suited for fighting.Both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are talented actors, but unfortunately the chemistry between them is lacking. Richard Roxburgh is miscast as Count Dracula and fails completely to bring sinister qualities to his role. Fortunately, David ""Faramir"" Wenham as ´Q´ provides comic relief and something for the Lord of the Rings fans. And Dracula´s brides are rather fine eye candy.Maybe this is 2004´s first blockbuster, but it will not be the start of a new franchise. Too bad. But then again, at least that´s one thing it doesn´t have in common with Star Wars.-+ Asparges +-",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What you get depends on what you expect,"I'm going to warn you right now: what you get out of ""Van Helsing"" completely depends on what you're expecting. I enjoyed the movie, but I really wish it had been a little bit more serious than it was. I was hoping for something along the lines of ""Underworld"" with more special effects, but ""Van Helsing"" is somewhere between ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" and ""The Mummy Returns."" Let me clarify: it's better than LXG, but it has sort of the same cartoonish feel.But the movie has so much going for it that it's hard not to be entertained. You've got a good-looking cast, good-looking scenery, good-looking effects, and a GREAT atmosphere. Women will love Hugh Jackman (I know Stephanie did) and his shirtless self, and the guys (unless you're Richard Simmons) will love Kate Beckinsale (I know I did). Kate and her tight pants presence automatically add two ""targets"" to my rating.Keep in mind, there is definitely some cheesy and goofy stuff in the movie that'll make you shake your head. For example, the fake Transylvanian accents really don't help the movie. Why couldn't they have just let Kate talk in her cute little British accent? And Dracula sounds like a mix of Count Chocula and The Count from ""Sesame Street."" I kept expecting him to say, ""Ah-ah-ah. One vampire bride! Ah twoooo vampire brides! Threeeeee vampire brides! Ah-ah-ah."" Where were Booberry and Frankenberry??? Sadly, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula is what hurts the movie most. He isn't menacing at all. If I stumbled upon his lair my biggest danger would be dying from laughter after he started flipping his ponytail around and talking in his silly accent.Steph (my better half): Yeah, but the movie has Hugh Jackman, and you know, he's kind of hot.I'm sure many girls will agree with you, Stephanie, but some moviegoers are looking for more substance than how good someone in the cast looks.Mr. Shade (my friend): Well, Johnny, there's Kate Beckinsale, and you know, she's kind of hot.BOOOYEAH! You got that right, Mr. Shade! HIGH FIVE! *looks around* Oh yeah, I don't do high fives. Um, anyway...Some of the CGI is great. Mr. Hyde looks much better than LXG's version. He's the best bad guy in the movie, showing lots of personality. And I liked the werewolf transformations. But some of the CGI doesn't work so well. For example, there's one scene where a team of horses jumps a broken bridge ... ouch. The only way they could've made it look faker is if Joan Rivers was driving the team.But if you can laugh it off, make fun of it, and enjoy the next round of Van Helsing kicking Monster buttocks then you'll enjoy it. This movie is a loud, fast-paced, action-packed ball of cotton candy. We're talking all-out monster mayhem here. It's a non-stop bombardment of special effects and CGI, and Stephen Sommers' was obviously intent on overpowering us with imagery, so if that sort of thing bothers you then ""Van Helsing"" might not be the movie for you.There's also a little humor thrown into the proceedings, most of it coming from Friar Carl (David Wendham) and his less-than-courageous persona. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. Near the end of the movie Mr. Shade turned to me and said that he was hoping Van Helsing, who is fighting monsters in the name of God, would tell one of the baddies, ""I'm gonna hit you with so many left hands of God that you'll be begging for a right hand of God."" That little Chuck Norris tribute would've absolutely ruled. I'm pretty sure most of the audience would've groaned, but I would have laughed heartily.THE GIST""Van Helsing"" isn't all I was hoping it would be, but I quickly accepted that and enjoyed it for what it is - an adrenaline-fueled, CGI monster ride with lots and lots of eye candy. Critics will hate it, and if you're looking for a serious exposition regarding the complex vampire/werewolf world (ala ""Underworld"") then guess what, you ain't gettin' it. But if you like your summer blockbuster to be a roller coaster ride with lots of unbelievable, in-your-face action and you can laugh off the silly stuff, then you can have fun with ""Van Helsing."" I did.Steph: Yeah, plus there's Hugh Jackman, and you know, he's kind of hot.Mr. Shade: Kate Beckinsale too!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

a computer graphics Gothic film,"'Van Helsing' is a remarkable film from a technical point of view. Computer graphics in films became a major trend lately, and the borders between classic animation, computer animation and acting become more and more blurred. If you doubt, just see the four animation films in the US top ten this week, and computer effects playing a visible role in at least another two. As I said, I liked, actually was captivated by the endless imagination in the computer work in this film, and this kept me interested despite the length of the film.Sure, there is not too much originality in 'Van Helsing'. We get a very strong mix of many of the horror stories of the 19th century. The only original idea was re-defining the Vatican as the host of the bigger spy agency of the epoch. The film even has a Mister Q as an important supporting character. Acting is not too bad, but the quality of the film lies mostly in the Gothic atmosphere, the infinite number of monsters, and the landscape created by computer means. Certainly, it is just comics-level geography and history. Do not expect any historic or geographic truth here. Transylvania for example for whoever is interested is 500 kilometers away from any sea. But who cares.I enjoyed 'Van Helsing' more than I expected. However, I dislike the idea of a second film, and the producers would make a big mistake to try to create a sequel. It can't be better than the original in its genre. I am however sure that they did not wait for my advice, and are already doing it to capitalize on the momentum :-) 'Van Helsing' gets 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pathetic.,"This movie was actually so bad that I felt compelled to get an IMDb account just so that I could write a review for that pathetic piece of sh*t. This movie is an insult to any vampire movie that's ever been done (yes including the cheesy ones). Let's go step by step : The story : Totally incoherent. Vampires + Werewolves + Frankenstein + Dr Jekyll + James bond like stuff = One of the worst scenarios ever. Acting : Average at best. The characters : They're all so archetypal that I almost feel sorry for the guys who made that movie. The amnesiac anti hero, the adventurous hot chick, the evil vampire, the good doctor blinded by his ambition, ... They're all here. Dialogues : One cheesy line after another. I even wonder why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. Do yourself a favor and stay way from that thing. You can't even call that a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Switch off the movie snob within and enjoy,"Having read so many negative views it was with some trepidation that I took my nephew along to see the movie. I was however, pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained.  I don't know what some folks were expecting with this film, but I was only looking to be entertained, and entertained I certainly was.  This is escapist stuff not an art house movie.  Sure some of the dialogue could be better and a bit more could be done on character development.  The CGI could also have been improved, Mr Hyde anyone? But overall its fabulous fun. The action is pretty much non-stop and the film is visually stunning for the most part. Okay so there's no deep meaningful plot. So what? Can anyone tell me what the great plot was in ""Lost in Translation""?  I still enjoyed that film too, but it never got slaughtered like Van Helsing. If you're looking for some arty movie with depth and substance, save your money.  However, if you're simply looking to be entertained, go see the movie, switch off the movie snob within, sit back and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
could have been so much more,"I followed the hype for this movie pretty closely and I was excited that it was directed by Stephen Sommers who borough us the Mummy films and starred Hugh Jackman. But about 30 minutes in the movie goes on auto-pilot and the effects completely take over. It seems doubtful taht Hugh Jackman had to do much physically for this film as CG(computer generated) versions of him seem to be doing all the work. I enjoyed the campiness of this film, the supporting cast was great (Richard Roxburgh is great as an over the top Dracula and David Wenham as the bumbling side kick gets most of the laughs) but I felt like I was watching a cartoon. And maybe taht was the whole point, but I'm a little old fashioned and I don't mind some of that new fangled CG stuff to make way for some good IL' traditional stunt work. I think given a smaller budget this movie would have been more then just a 2 hour sense assault.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not to be taken too seriously,"Okay, most people are giving this movie a good floggin, and not with out some reason.  However, one thing to keep in mind before seeing this movie (which I recommend) is to get into it.  Yes, the storyline is scattered and yes the characters are lacking a little development (mainly Van Helsing)but there is a sense of fun that can be captured form a movie that has so many classic enemies. One thing many people don't  recognize is the spoofs throughout the film.  I believe they were put in on purpose, not to make the film ""cool"", but for the sake of fun and humour and to establish  the excitement that comes with an action film.  I found myself laughing quite a bit, that might just be me, but there is humour to be found.  I think that the film makers were trying a Pirates of the Caribbean type thing, only without as much success. Aside from that I failed to notice the terrible CGI's others have mentioned and I quite enjoyed Mr. Jackman...half naked. Ahem...enough said",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good silly fun,"I have to agree with the first poster here.. the film's beginning just caught me and reeled me in for the rest of the film.. I was really interested in seeing this film when it came out for many reasons.. 1)another spin on Dracula;2) Hugh Jackman and 3) I was just about to move to the Czech Republic, where most of the film was shot.I live there now and am watching the film on TV, dubbed, sadly but it's what lead to this comment.. the film does offer up some fun references to other films - and as mentioned gives us one of the best Frankenstein's monsters since Clancy Brown in the horrible ""The Bride"".I have to say the only thing I really didn't like about this film was the werewolves.. way to much CGI -- I really haven't seen a werewolf that I liked in recent films.Hugh's character looks like Vampire Hunter D, the really wonderful Anime vampire hunter, so that's a nice touch.For doubters of the quality of this film.. it's worth taking a look.

"Not much plot, good effects.","Another conversion of a comic book hero to a movie lead. Very little plot with multiple inconsistencies and confusing action interspersions. Frankenstein's monster becomes a good guy and Van Helsing wears Dracula's ring (no formal engagement, however). Holy water kills Dracula's brides but a werewolf has to bite Dracula to knock him off. Good acting by Hugh Jackman but Kate Beckinsale's acting was stilted and unconvincing. The special effects were reasonably good and the music was suitably creepy but much too loud. I had the foresight to bring ear plugs and wore them throughout the film. This film should appeal to the teen age crowd but won't play as well to adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The summer movie onslaught has begun.,"""Van Helsing"" tells the story of the titular character (Hugh Jackman), who serves the Vatican as a sort of black ops agent whose missions are to eradicate various unrepentant monsters. His primary task here is to destroy the horrific triumvirate of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster. With his own medieval Agent Q (LOTR's David Wenham), our hero ventures to Transylvania to team up with the stunning Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last survivor in a noble family that must kill Dracula or be condemned forever to purgatory.Although I think the makers of ""Van Helsing"" tried to inject a dose of heart their work, they still produced little more than a good summer popcorn movie, and I don't mean that as an insult. Director Stephen Sommers also helmed ""The Mummy"" and its sequels, and while I would rate Van Helsing ahead of those movies, it is cast from the same mold. If you go in with expectations of greatness, you'll no doubt hate it and be utterly disappointed. But if you settle in looking for nothing more than 2+ hours of fun, nearly campy entertainment, you'll be thoroughly satisfied.A large reason that it falls short of being even a good movie is the derivative nature of the entire flick. Although set in a dark neo-Victorian age (in which it always seems to be raining), ""Van Helsing"" contains countless scenes that bring to mind various classics. Whether it be Van Helsing's Batman-esque tools, his gadget room borrowed from James Bond, shots taken from Looney Tunes, or a scene straight out of ""Get Smart"" (yes, that's right), so much of the movie has been done before. More than any other, Van Helsing imitates The Indiana Jones Trilogy in ways ranging from the hero's attire to how certain characters die to the use of a map to display travel. Even Alan Silvestri's music recalls one of Indy's secondary themes. While this derivative nature prevents ""Van Helsing"" from being a truly good film, it does provide a alternative unique form of entertainment. Half the fun of the movie is pinpointing the pervasive cinematic references.The other half of the fun comes from the overall appearance and content. While these well-known characters have been portrayed on the screen hundreds of times through the years, rarely are they seen so vividly in an action movie such as this. Jackman possesses a perfect look for the swashbuckling protagonist; Roxburgh not only twirls his mustache well, but does add some humanity to the blood-sucking count. Beckinsale, in a role not all that different from her turn in Underworld, isn't asked to do much but look vengeful and beautiful, and does just that, managing to fight ferociously in tight clothes while still maintaining her gorgeous and pristine appearance. Wenham, in stark contrast to his noble Faramir, fills the thankless comic relief role, and does so rather well, considering what he is given to work with.The rest of the cast consists primarily of minor roles or special effects. Unfortunately while the physical appearance of the movie is excellent, the visual effects aren't always up to par. They're not bad, but also aren't quite seamless with the rest of the flick. Every once in a while something doesn't quite match or feels just a little too fake. With so many effects done by many different effects houses, perhaps this was inevitable, but the minor discrepancies are still occasionally distracting, which is the one thing that visual effects should not be.The effects are not helped by the fact that the movie, at nearly two and a half hours, is twenty minutes too long. As enjoyable as the various people and fights are, one can only take so much of horror characters scurrying around doing battle. Trimming a few minutes out of about every scene would have made the remaining excitement that much more enjoyable, resulting in a more streamlined and bearable picture. As it is, everything drags on too long, permitting what could have been a taut adventure film to unravel into a messier and less cohesive movie.As the movie that kick-starts the summer season, ""Van Helsing"" receives some leeway. Had it been released in August, it probably wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable, following a summer of similarly action-packed but largely forgettable fare. But with cinematic tastebuds longing for fresh popcorn after a stale spring, Van Helsing survives its shortcomings to provide a satisfying if short-lived treat.Bottom Line: Decent summertainment, at least as the first biggie of the season.  6/10, for fun as much as quality.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Acting was nothing special, plot sucked, and some moments that were suppose to scare people actually made me laugh... (like when Dracula screamed at his brides) Only decent part of the film was the special effects. Everything else was lacking. I left the theatre thinking that movie sucked.

One of the best comedies made this decade! (Everybody rope swings!),"What a hilarious movie!This version of Dracula was the most foppish, nonthreatening fancy boy ever to be on screen. Don't make him mad or he'll sneer and make a snide comment. Or worse yet, he'll get one of his undead midget zombies to... uh, I don't know, uppercut your knee cap and bite your ankle?Frankenstein's monster was not only loaded with hackneyed dialog but was a great addition to the absurdity. And his retarded gait is one of the funniest ways of walking since David Cross's impersonation of a strut in ""Pootie Tang."" Not to mention the funniest scene in the whole movie where we get to see Frankenstein's monster swing from a wire three times in a row in what looks like the same scene looped over and over and over. It made beer shoot out of my nose I was laughing so hard.The Wolfman was simply ridiculous. Werewolves are big, sure but when are they supposed to be twenty feet tall? Bigger than Frankenstein's monster? And am I supposed to believe this Saturday morning cartoon quality computer generated thing is actually interacting with the characters on screen? Please tell me this was supposed to be funny.The sexy heroin was also a laugh riot. The thought that anyone could fight anything supernatural or not while wearing a corset with stiletto boots is worth a few chuckles. Sexy? Sure, but so impractical. It's like fighting off zombie Nazis with Bettie Page and Dita von Teese or ghost hunting with the Playboy bunnies.And Van Helsing? Apparently the creators of this movie never bothered to read ""Dracula"" or even see all the ""Dracula"" movies. This is a cookie cut facsimile of exactly what American cinema does to characters from classic literature: Take a good character and make him a macho cowboy. This version of Van Helsing doesn't even know what a freakin' vampire is.And he works for the Vatican which apparently manufactures spy gear for supernatural slaying like the Q- branch in James Bond films. (Obviously, the director like James Bond movies so much he copied the Q- gadget scene with little to no scruples. Is the Pope M, then?)About the special CGI effects? The computer animation from ""The New Adventures of Johnny Quest"" was not only more convincing than ""Van Helsing's"" but was also a more noble effort. The battle between werewolf Helsing and Bat- form Dracula looks like two guys playing ""Soul Caliber"" except the graphics in the movie aren't as good as an Xbox or Playstation 2.As a horror/ action movie: this simply sucks. Oh, my god, I can't convey in words how much this sucks. Watching someone else play ""Castlevania"" is tenfold better than suffering through this tripe.But as a comedy? Absolutely hilarious.

Prior to 1999 the summer season kicked off around Memorial Day weekend as children began to slowly be released from schools across the country but that was before The Mummy opened to $43 million the weekend of May 7th, 1999, which, in effect, changed the way studios dealt with the summer heat. In the two years that followed, both Gladiator (2000) and The Mummy Returns (2001) opened on the first weekend of May to fantastic numbers but that never became the official kick-off point for the summer until Spider-Man sealed the deal in 2002, opening to $115 million its opening weekend. Universal studios doesn't expect that much with the opening of Van Helsing but they do expect a decent return as it is not often that they shell out $160 million (and then some) for one film especially in the current situation they are in with their new parent company. But considering Stephen Sommers, the same man who directed The Mummy and its sequel, is at that reins, there's a sure bet the cult followers will be out in droves once again.The story follows the adventures a man sent by a secret society to go out into the world to vanquish evil creatures such as the Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula and stop their reins of terror on humanity. Van Helsing is known throughout most of Europe, either as a holy man or as a murderer, but the man behind God's work has no memory of who he is or where he comes from. All he knows is that he is in the service of the Catholic Church sent to different parts of the world to stop evil in the form of monsters and demons. There's nothing in the job description about being well liked by the people he is trying to protect. His latest assignment is to travel to Transylvania to destroy the powerful Count Dracula while at the same time protect Anna Valerious, the last of her family's lineage who had sworn to do anything in their power to destroy Dracula and end his rein of terror. But Dracula has a plan of his own  he devises a course of action in using Frankenstein's monster as well as the Wolfman in his efforts to raise up a force of bat-like children to rule over humanity with fear and terror. There's only one man who stands in his way, who has the force of God on his side: Van Helsing. The story for Van Helsing is hard to really grasp but not in the sense you would think. The film isn't a real puzzler or anything of that nature (Good vs. Evil  not much to figure out here) but one does have to have a tolerance for campy action flicks or else this will be a complete waste of time. Though the film is clichéd at moments, surprisingly it wasn't so much as was to be expected, if that helps at all to those who disliked The Mummy films.No one may actually be going into this film for the sole purpose of seeing any particular star within it, which is probably the reason why there are only two (one if you want to get into specifics) big names in the cast, but none the less the cast of Van Helsing offers some decent performances, nothing Oscar caliber by any means, while at the same presenting several prominent disappointments. Hugh Jackman, who is best known for his performance of Wolverine in the X-Men film series, gives an engaging performance as Abraham Van Helsing, though no where near the one given by Sir Anthony Hopkins in Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was to be expected. The only problem lies with the character itself as the script starts off with many questions and yet answers very few of the them by the end, which could or could not point to a possible sequel in the works. Kate Beckinsale, who hasn't been able to make a name for her self in the sense of truly carrying a film on her name alone just yet, works with what is given to her as best she can but there really isn't much emotional attachment with the character to be really all that concerned for what happens to her within the course of the film. Though it was Sommer's intent on resurrecting (in a sense) interest in Dracula, the vision seems to be lost with Richard Roxburgh's go around as he is way too over-the-top in a way that's laughable at times and, at times, confusing. The same would have to go for Dracula's Brides played Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran, who become so irritating in their performances that the audience will be applauding at their demises, and not for the reasons they should be doing so.Overall, Van Helsing kicks off the 2004 summer box office with more of a whimper then a driving force and only shatters the hopes of those who were awaiting an enthusiastic kick-off as had always been accustomed in the past. As with Hellboy, Van Helsing falls into the category of films that doesn't leave you clamoring to see it again nor is it a feature that you would detest repeating, if it were presented to you again. The first third of the film (dividing the film into three parts) was quite exciting, mysterious, and filled with wall-to-wall action, which makes the other two thirds of the film all the more disappointing. There is nothing as bad as a film that sets you up for quality entertainment only to knock you down with a weak follow-through. The problem lies with the script itself which becomes too bogged down with numerous plot lines and character aspects and quickly deteriorates into a mundane and repetitive camp film. There's nothing wrong with camp films as long as they are done right, which isn't the case with Van Helsing. Another issue that was clearly prominent throughout the film was the blatant over-use of CGI effects, which often looked fake, no more so then in the scene where the Wolfman jumps across the fire on the wagon toward Van Helsing or the transformation of Dracula, which just looked ridiculous. And there was a small problem the musical score, which, every so often, sounded too familiar to the score for The Mummy, but nothing major to complain about. There are three types of people who will be disappointed by this film: fans of the classic novel (and film) Dracula, those who fell for the hype, and all others who aren't just entertained by a few mere explosions and boobs flashed on the screen. Van Helsing will surely go down as one of the bigger disappointments of the summer season.My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stop it! You're hurting my ears!,"As we might all have guessed before setting foot inside the cinema, Van Helsing very quickly and very loudly proclaims that it comes from the same director as the two recent Mummy films. Stephen Sommers appears to be entirely incapable of understanding tension, character development or indeed quiet moments of any sort, and succeeds in spending the entire film slapping on sound and visual effects in such thick layers that the audience becomes stupefied.Aside from a few original and interesting bits - the characterisation of Frankenstein's creature and Igor, the James Bond spoofery at the beginning, the exploding mini-vampires - it's also a film that relies almost entirely on cliche. Sommers just can't help himself using tired camera angles and hackneyed script, and seems to have asked his composer to add 'atmospheric' (lazy) string music to just about every scene. He's also not averse to constantly reusing ideas once he's had them: people screaming/shouting ""Van Helsing!"" and people being thrown into walls appear to be among his favourites, and there are so many instances of Van Helsing's sidekick doing/saying something reluctant/cowardly, that it just stops being funny.Sommers needs to learn a few lessons from Steven Spielberg - how to loosen up a little and let the audience become interested in the characters, and how bombarding us with surround-sound bangs and screams from beginning to end is not the best way to make an action film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A cheesy and campy Monster Movie,"""Van Helsing"", is a monster movie with Frankenstein's Monster, The Wolfman, and Dracula. It has a nice idea, but the execution is just awful.The only thing I liked was the idea of having Frankenstein's Monster, The Wolfman, and Dracula in one movie.The rest was just cheesy and campy. The CGI look's like it came out of a Video game and Dracula is just laughable. Also, Hugh Jackman dosen't even do a good job as the titular character and Kate Beckinsale's performance was boring and flat.Overall, ""Van Helsing"", is just a bad movie that dosen't try to be action-packed or scary. It's just cheesy and campy.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Funny, scary","Van Helsing was a man who couldn't recall his past. Working for the Vatican, he has to hunt down supernatural creatures and it is to Hugh Jackmans' credit that Van Helsings' reticence at killing these once human beings came across.The rest of the cast are good, particularly David Wenham as Karl, Gabriel Van Helsings' Friar sidekick. The banter between the two characters provides the many funny parts of the film. Karl is also the provider of the gadgetry and weaponry used by his friend Van Helsing.Richard Roxburgh surprised me. Before seeing the film I thought he was badly cast as Dracula, but his performance was a mixture of mad, aristocratic menace and camp egomaniac. The role actually seemed to suit him.Kate Beckinsale was the feisty heroine. As Anna Valerious her ancestry indicated a long-standing vendetta with Dracula. She thinks she can handle things on her own, but after seeing Van Helsing in action, she reluctantly agrees the Van Helsing can remain in her town and eventually, together, they set about ""vanquishing evil"".Will Kemp as the Wolf Man didn't really have much to do with the role, except writhe acrobatically about, which was a shame. I would've liked to have seen more screen time given to both the Wolf Man and Shuler Hensley as Frankensteins' Monster. Although Frankensteins' creation was supposed to be a ""monster"", he was in fact quite the opposite, an emotional and sympathetic character.The sets were very atmospheric, dark, gloomy and Gothic, perhaps a tribute by the Director Stephen Sommers to the old Hammer Horror films?The only thing I would've changed about the film? Well, at times, it felt like the film was trying to cram too much in. It would've been nice to have a plot that was less crowded and maybe that would've allowed for some interesting development of the characters.Yes, there are a lot of things that could've been done differently, but I enjoyed Van Helsing. It's a film that is funny, scary, action-packed thrilling and entertaining all rolled into one.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A solid and fun monster hunting movie to usher in the summer season,"I did myself a great disservice by reading many of the negative newspaper reviews of the movie Van Helsing, because I couldn't watch the first twenty minutes without noticing the supposed flaws of the flick. However, that passed and I was able to enjoy the 2 hour-10 minute film (2 hours and 23 minutes if you can't the end credits). Let me say that the critics are being unnecessarily harsh on Stephen Sommers and Van Helsing. It is not an Oscar-worthy that will be remembered by the AFI thirty years from now, but it is a film that will take you out mind.The plot is a very simple, but not so simple as to offend your intellect. Hugh Jackman (of the X-men movies and the Tony-nominated musical ""The Boy from Oz"") plays Gabriel Van Helsing, a monster hunter for a secret sect of the Catholic Church. From what we see of the sect's headquarters, it isn't only the Catholics who are employing Van Helsing to save the souls of those possessed by evil. It is in these secret headquarters hidden in the Vatican City that the audience learns that the Church rescued a broken and amnesiac Van Helsing several years ago, and it is through his monster hunting/soul saving that he will recall his forgotten past. (POSSIBLE SPOLIER HERE!) We also learn here that his past goes as far back as 800 years from the present 1888 of the movie.Van Helsing is then sent to Romania to help a gypsy princess, played with butt-kicking and back-flipping furor by Kate Beckinsale, defeat Count Dracula. Kate Beckinsale's Anna Valerious is the last one in the family who is cursed to eternal damnation unless Count Dracula is killed by them. Dracula and his three vampire brides have it out for the Valerious clan, and the reason why is a surprise. During their mission to find and destroy Dracula, as well as his undead children that he is trying to bring to life with the help of Dr. Frankenstein's technology, Anna and Van Helsing fight vampires, the werewolf, an angry crowd, and Frankenstein's monster before befriending him.Like ""The Mummy,"" director Stephen Sommers does not allow his heroes to have a healthy fear of their enemies. They have too much of a jaded, 21st Century attitude. If the characters aren't even a bit afraid, how is the audience supposed have a suspension of disbelief? Aside from this flaw and the obvious set up for sequel through several of Dracula's allusions to Van Helsing's past, this is a solid and fun summer movie. It is to his credit, that Sommers doesn't make the movie as serious or as dark as other vampire films of recent history (like ""Interview with the Vampire,"" ""Bram Stokers' Dracula,"" and ""Underworld""). Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale play the swashbuckling roles with the right balance, and Shuler Hensley's Frankenstein's monster gives the movie a soul. In helping to keep the film light, Richard Roxburgh does an excellent job of camping up Dracula but not to the point where he can't be perceived as a formidable foe. The movie is not as overblown, bloated, or as weighed down by special effects as the critics would have you believe. Aside from the CGI that makes the simplest human movement appear as supernatural and too perfect, the movie makes good use of its stunts and F/X budget. This movie is a way to usher in the lazy, hazy days of summer. Just pray they don't do a sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Had so Much More Potential,","Van Helsing is a mediocre movie with a decent storyline and a good cast.The movie is certainly a disappointed,a Van Helsing movie with Hugh Jackman in the title role immediately sounds like a great new franchise,but unfortunately so many aspects of this movie were done wrong.I felt like the writers just tried to throw in any famous horror characters they could think of,from Dracula,Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein,it would have been so much better if it just focused on Dracula,and certainly would have been better without that ridiculous werewolf side story.The CGI in this film is very unrealistic,you could tell these characters were animated and it didn't feel like they were communicating with the real actors at all.Also the humour isn't very subtle in this movie,I also appreciate a bit of comedy in an action movie but it was too common in this and was rarely genuinely funny,the character of Carl was definitely only there for comic relief,but I didn't laugh at a single thing he said.Van Helsing has its moments,but is overall not a very good movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.The Vatican's star monster hunter is sent to Transylvania to help a princess find and kill Dracula.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of time,"Too bad the writer/director didn't pay closer attention to the great movies he was homaging in this stinker. Way too much over the top action and NO legit storyline or character development left us not caring whether anybody lived or died. There were tiresome holes in the story you could drive a team of horses through - clearly Summer trying to shoehorn suspense into his story at the expense of continuity. Just another ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". Lots of special effects and good actors wasting their time with a lousy script. The fellow playing Dracula wasn't too great though - lots of hissing his lines venomously without any interesting inflection or nuance to make him more than a cardboard villain. But you really can't blame the actors here. I doubt they got much direction and just had to do the best they could.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Suspension of Disbelief,"The criticism that has been linked to ""Van Helsing"" has gotten to the unreasonable level.  There is a statement used when viewing science fiction / fantastic works: ""The suspension of Disbelief"".  Essentially there are some realities that need to be overlooked when viewing set work (Van Helsing).  The one that come foremost to mind is relation of time.1) The span of time between the full moons is not continuous chain, therefore the passing of even a month between Van Helsing's arrival to the town and his own turning can be ignored.  2) As for the chime of 1 through 12 of the clock, many large clock towers can take up 12 minutes to ring twelve times.  This is still a stretch to imagine this happening in only twelve minutes, but as a friend of mine would say ""There are werewolves fighting Vampires and friars having sex, but this is the part that you choose not to believe.""  Suspend your disbelief on the little stuff, and eventually you might go to a movie that you would enjoy.p.s.  A frier is a device in which food is cooked, and a friar is a studying catholic.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I liked this movie.,"Before I start I am going to state right now that I am biased towards the werewolf in this film. I love werewolves.I watched this movie in theater and I will buy the DVD because of one character. The werewolves. In my honest opinion, I believe that this movie has the best looking werewolves I have ever seen. They are very close to how I envision them. It just goes to show that CGI is the way to go. I just wish for one thing to make the werewolf 100% complete. NEXT TIME PLEASE GIVE THE WEREWOLF A FRIGGIN TAIL! It makes no sense why the werewolf does not have a tail. Besides, aren't tails supposed to help maintain balance when they decide to run on all fours? Besides, the werewolves ""DID"" have digitigrades legs for a reason you know!Oh BTW. For all of you CGI haters. I am sorry, but I am going to have to go pro CGI with this movie, for it is top-notch work. Can you imagine keeping the movie at the pace it was set at without the use of CGI?..... No. I didn't think so.I also heard that some of you hated the transformation sequences between the vampire and the werewolf. Well just what in the hell were you looking for exactly? Something where each character takes five minutes to slowly transform from human into beast? Sorry, that doesn't work well in a fast paced action movie like this, because it doesn't keep up with the fast pace of the movie. Besides; let's say if I was in the movie and they were going through their transformation sequences, I could have waltzed in with a sword, chopped both of their heads off and walked out before they could even finish. So that is why their Transformation sequences were quick.Please feel free to reply to this and challenge me if you want. I enjoy ranting about stuff like this. =)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Part horror, part hoot....stunning visual effects and a slyly comic performance by Jackman","Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a monster hunter who achieves results, through luck and weaponry. When he is sent to take down, once and for all, the evil Count Dracula, it is an all out war with the denizens of the count's castle, including Frankenstein, werewolves, and vampires by the dozens. Only Anna (Kate Beckingsale), a young noblewoman whose brother was changed into a vampire by Dracula, is on Helsing's side. How in the world will the two of the them win out? Part horror, part hoot, this movie is a fun watch for an evening. Jackman is just right as the monster hunter with the sardonic wit of a stand-up comic. Beckinsale is a more serious but worthy supporting cast member. The film is visually stunning, even in an age of computer generating effects. Just watch a lady vampire swoop down and scoop up prey or a werewolf change in the moonlight. Younger children should probably not watch the film, for it has scary images. But, teens and adults will hardly be afraid for long, as Jackman cuts everyone down to size with his words. Recommended for a something-out-of-the-norm movie for a night without a full moon.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The OD of CG soured my taste for this movie,"Don't get me wrong, I'm all for CGI but not when it completely dominates the movie. Van Helsing utilized it way too much, from the buildings, to the characters, to the stunts, the environment, etc. It looked as though 90% of the movie was done completely on a computer. If you're going to use CG use it when you really have to, if it costs way too much to do the real deal or the model costs too much or you can make the image look very realistic (I know, it can't be perfect, but damn close to it is possible these days). LXG had this problem as well and it seems like the makers of Van Helsing didn't learn from LXG's mistakes.The story, acting, cinematography were pretty good. Not amazing, but pretty good. Directing seemed kind of rushed to me as though Stephen Sommers just wanted to get to the next CGI scene or action scene.The Mummy was an awesome movie. Absolutely fantastic and used CG when they had to, but a lot of camera, makeup and other tricks were used to bring out the world of early-20th century Egypt. Van Helsing didn't, and that was its downfall.Final Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Almost painful to watch,"I don't know if Sommers is trying to be campy and retarded when he made this or if he really thinks he made a scary movie...either way this piece of junk was painful to sit through. The scariest thing throughout was THE DIALOGUE, it sounded as if Sommer's 12 yr old nephew wrote most of it. The acting was expectedly bad but Dracula was so over the top, that I found myself fast forwarding through his parts (yes I rented, no way in hell was I going to pay nine dollars to see this).The plot was completely predictable as most of Sommers films are, the special effects were outlandish - part of the reason of a no scare factor is that almost all the monsters were cgi'd in, looking more like cartoons, than anything else. The old horror films Sommers is trying to pay homage to had waaaayyyy more class this his modern day crapnanza.Save yourself the pain of this film, its not a good horror flick, its a lousy action flick, there's no real comedy, and drama...well you'd get more drama from watching cspan than this thing...surprisingly the DVD does make a good frisbee.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A pleasant surprise if your expectations weren't high,"I was looking forward to watch Van Helsing, probably because there was not much going on around or probably just to keep up to date. I had little expectations about it, the synopsis didn't attract me much, but I wanted something new, so I watched it.I was pleasantly surprised that the opening scene wasn't introducing the main character, and that the author managed to keep the intrigue during the next couple of scenes (c'mon, it isn't something written by the Cohen brothers or Kaufmann, so let's treat it in its weight category!). Of course, I had to filter a fair amount of BS, but that's normal for a heroic flick like that, so bring it on.The CGI was pretty good, sometimes very good, sometimes annoying - up to the standards in any case, though no matrixish bullet time or whatever. But what for? There's already lots of movies with splashing water circled all around by the virtual camera, just pick a title from the shelf.The plot, as I've already said, isn't worth mentioning. The salad the Mummy's daddy Stephen Sommers has done out of seemingly all the monster fiction and comic books found on his shelf looks like an unsuccessful marriage of Mary Shelley's mattress dwelling bedbug and Ian Flemming's bastard nephew's chihuahua's flee. And I could probably live much better without the hero/sidekick vs villain/sidekick cliché, but then it would take the author to actually think a lot, so hey, gimme the action, babe and nevermind the self-proclaimed intellectuals! If you have a weak stomach - try not to watch this movie after meal. Some parts are really gross stomach-wise, lots of viscous blob being splattered and lots of squishy looking things jumping around. Yuck.All in all, I enjoyed the movie, it made my evening, so if you don't get tired easily of meaningless plots, can filter BS at some fair ratio and like to watch an action-packed movie with a sometimes creative camera work - go for it. I'd give it a 6 out of 10, it's a solid entertainment flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Glad I didn't pay to see it!,"This movie was soooo hokey. The characters, the special effects, even the story line was hard to follow. It definitely didn't live up to the hype.

I would have hated to spend a nickel on this one.The ONLY good thing was that Hugh Jackman had a cool costume, and one of his weapons was pretty cool too.

Is this the film itself or the spoof?,"I wanted to like it so much, being a huge Dracula fan. And to be honest, it wasn't the 'interpretation' of Dracula and Van Helsing that got me.No - it was the God-awful excuse for a plot, terrible CGI, some hideous 'acting' from certain quarters.  Jackman appeared to be almost the only cast memberwho even attempted to act, while Beckinsale was apparently under theimpression that her job was to make fun of Romanians.  It was the blatantplagiarism from every other movie ever made, from Shrek to The Lion King toThe Matrix. Seriously. And I strongly believe that an actor of Hugh Jackman's calibre deserved a better film than this one to launch him as somebody capable of carrying a whole film on his shoulders.And yet, after all that, it never intended itself to be taken seriously. I suppose it is mildly entertaining, the ultimate B-movie, as it was put. If you go in with no expectations, you won't come out disappointed. Maybe I should go again,knowing what's coming, forgetting that I waited months for this and remembering that yes, some of the laughs in the cinema were unintentional and came out of such things as a kiss more wooden than the one in Attack of the Clones, butsome came out of genuine jokes in the film.

"""You Can Only Kill it with the Silver Bullet!""","--I love that line from the movie, said by Kate Beckinsale. Now back to the point: This movie is about a notorious monster hunter, Van Helsing, who is sent to Transylvania to protect the two siblings Anna and Velkan Valerious before Count Dracula kills them before they do. Why? If Count Dracula kills the both of them before they do, they will condemn the whole family to eternal damnation. Van Helsing is also sent there to stop Count Dracula who is using Dr. Frankenstein's research and a werewolf to make his and his wives children born.I wouldn't call this a CGI overload. I would call this a piece of entertainment! This is a great popcorn film with many great special effects with great action sequences! The movie is entertaining to the beginning through the end, although it's over two hours long. This movie takes all of the old monster movies into one whole movie. I would compare this movie to The Brothers Grimm, which takes all of the fairy tales into one movie.The beginning of the film might be off to a great start like any other Frakenstein movie when the famous line is called out: ""It's Alive!"" The beginning is black and white, like the old movies, for about 7 minutes and it's over from there. As you can see, the monsters being featured in this film are the Wolfman, Frakenstein, and Dracula and maybe including some other tid bits. The way a human who turns into a wolf is unique. The human actually tears its own skin off revealing fur and it does the same thin when they turn back into a human.One problem in the movie is that this movie is too long. It's over two hours long but I still enjoyed it like any other popcorn movie. This is a great action adventure that will be great for all ages and I highly recommend this film. This film will make you feel like a kid again! Actually, this is my first film comment that is this long!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The CGI is fine, seen better, but also seen way worse.To all those saying it is the worst movie ever, try watching Zombie 90:Extreme Pestilence, that is a prime example of a crap movie.Nowhere near a classic, but fun none the less.7 outta 10 from me.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not good enough,"I had great expectations of this film, and it delivered...to a degree.You will be shown fantastic looking creatures who make you wish you could play as in a game Van Helsing has a cool look with his full length leather coat and hat with an army of James Bond style weapons of an older age and references to classic horror fiends. And of course, shots of Kate Beckinsale's brilliantly formed ass in tights close up.However, the story does tend to bore after a while and you may find yourself fast forwarding to the fight scenes. And a lot of whining from Van Helsing's side kick who couldn't do a simple thing without first having a fit of fear before leaving it right to the last moment to do something.All in all, this was a good film but it could've been made a bit better in my opinion",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much!,"Man, this movie was way too intense. Normally I like fast paced Hollywood movies with lot's of action and special effects but this movie has just too much action. All of the things are happening too fast after another, the movie doesn't give you time to think or even breath! However does that mean it didn't liked this movie? No that was not the case, I thought the movie was very enjoyable and I find it still recommendable.Even though there is a special effects overkill, they are impressive to watch nevertheless and probably that alone makes this movie worth to watch. The movie doesn't really have more to offer than that, it feels like the story is just of minor importance and even though Hugh Jackman is good in his role, his character just doesn't really become interesting, which is not his fault. The makers should have probably spend more time on the story and character instead of just the special effects. Maybe if this was the case they also wouldn't had changed Van Helsing's name in Gabriel Van Helsing instead of Abraham which is the original name. Director Stephen Sommers however thought that the name Abraham was just too old fashioned and not cool enough, he didn't want to make a movie in which his main character is named Abraham or so he claimed in a TV interview I saw a long time ago before the movie release. From that moment on I feared the worst for this movie. Yes, a different director would have been more appropriate probably, someone who did had some more respect for all the old horror characters and their names. Van Helsing will always stay the old professor to me and not the action hero like he is portrayed in this movie.Poor Richard Roxburgh. It's not like his Dracula performance is bad but it's just that there have been so many better Dracula's like Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee and Gary Oldman, compared to them his performance turns pale which can also be blamed on the script.But like I said I still thought this movie was enjoyable. The movie is especially recommendable if you like old horror classics from Universal. The first few minutes are a great tribute to the classics however after that the classic horror characters are only used to impress the viewer with fancy special effects. There are some good action sequences but simply too much. After one hour I already had seen enough action and was surprised to see that I wasn't even halve way trough with watching the movie.Great special effects, great soundtrack and nice atmosphere but the story doesn't do much justice to the classic characters or the actors in this movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good be overall nothing special,"Again, a good movie. But are good movies special nowadays? The story is actually very skinny. Gathered and ripped characters, no connection between these and I think sometimes to sought off for the younger ones. Van Helsing seems suddenly to be the ""left hand""of god, Gabriel. Does everybody fully understand that this is the archangel? Why did the screenwriter decide this? And when he did, why didn't he use it more? Now it's a almost useless decision. The whole film is carried by the effects, and it's seems to me it's made on exactly the same computer as the extraordinary League Of Gentlemen. I did miss the Gothic aspects very much, for this being a side step of the fantastic and ever inspiring Dracula story. All together I had a good time, over two hours (!!) and a good laugh as well. Some parts were on the border of being romantic or cornball, I choose for the best intention. Storywise it definitly could have been made better, but then again, it could have been done worse as well. See it for yourself, as it is worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Someone needs a map!,"OK so, i can move past the borsh (meat soup) they did of many myth stories all in one, i can get past the confusion of it all, but what really bothers me (and most Romanians) is that Hollywood almost always gets the myth WRONG and all the simple details WRONG! Is it really THAT difficult to pick up a map, or google it? Budapest is the capital of Hungary, Transilvania is a region of Romania. WHY is is that difficult to get it straight? I've seen this mistake in SO many vampire adaptations. Besides the fact that the myth is messed around with in so many versions no one knows the original one anymore, they get simple geography wrong? that's not something you invent, it's on the world map! And if you DO chose to have your characters speak Romanian, ASK a Romanian guy to tell / teach you! Seriously, most of them sound horrible and make NO sense at all. I'll volunteer if that! I'll translate it for you for free. Just get ONE movie right.This movie made NO sense to me, and i probably seen them ALL.

"this is not an adventure, it's a ride !!","A rollercoaster of a movie, yes the CGI played to much of the movie but it works. Mr.Hyde puts the Mr.Hyde from the League of extraordinarily gentlemen to shame, the Wolfman looks stunning, Dracula and his brides... less so in they're a-sexual flying forms,Frankenstein's monster.. looks like a monster. I would have prefered Dracula to be more elegant, Sir Cristopher Lee was available and seeing as he wouldn't have to do any action (that was ALL CGI) It would have been a perfect fit. I enjoyed the movie it was full of action and had a story that I could suspend disbelief for, seeing as everybody already knows whom the Wolfman,Dracula,Fankenstein,Van Helsing are there was no need to tell their stories again so we could get right into the action.It was a good thing the Vatican send Van Helsing to Transylvania, because Kate alone wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes with those monsters. you would have thought fighting your WHOLE life against Dracula and his minions would give you some insight (daylight raid ?!), she could have been a strong woman character but wasn't. Dracula was nice in a campy sort of way though not really scary in any form. Van Helsing was good and looked great in the hat and played his role though it wasn't much different from Wolverine... Igor was good, come with Dracula because you're my Goon now. Frankenstein's monster was good and brought meaning to: never judge a book by it's collar. the Brides looked and acted great and where the real menace instead of Dracula IMHO. CGI yes it can work marvelous, great scenery,monsters only the story and acting make a movie what it is and Van Helsing had enough story to make it work the acting could have been better at parts. Music was great !!!!9 out of 10 for a not to serious though great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a shame that so few realize how terrible this film is,"Drawing on every cliché known to man, Van Helsing serves as a testament to a plot based less on intelligence than it is on testosterone. This has some of the most facets going against it of any movie I've seen. First of all, it's doomed right away when attempting not one- but several classic horror stories- all pieced together like a quilt made by a mentally challenged armless...well, Hollywood director. It attempts to use the melodramatic air as classic and endearing but instead ends up with Frankentstein's monster yelling the most stereotypical ""Why?!?!"" while holding a dead body, and such witty lines as ""Do you like to fly?"" (or something close) when Van Helsing is lifted in the air by she-vampires. Terrible, terribly done film- but the most disappointing part is that it wasn't acknowledged as being as terrible as it was.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lots of fun...,"Although there were a number of flaws, which I won't talk about, I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  First off, the special effects were great, the musical score was fantastic, and the acting was good.  The story was a little too much.  I think they should have saved some of those characters for other movies like they would with a superhero movie. For example, in Batman the only villain was the Joker.  Not most of the villains he faces.  I think they should have changed a few things about the actual character of Van Helsing, (his age, reputation, etc.), and perhaps the amount of time they would take between parts of the story.  I loved Kate Beckensale in this role, Hugh Jackman was a good choice for Van Helsing, and Richard Roxburg whom I haven't seen since Mission Impossible II was a good Dracula.  I give this movie a 7 out of 10.  Go see it at any price.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Action packed,"The time period of when the movie took place I thought was interesting. To be honest I didn't think that the acting was the best, but the action from the plot kind of made up for it. This is a movie I watched before when I was young and re-watching it now, the middle part of the movie is a little confusing. I liked how they added a little romance throughout all the action that was going. However, I feel like it started slowing down towards the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great show.  Not a Movie Experience.,"I fell in love with the premise of this movie. For all you fantasy fans out there, it was taking an old cleric/scholar and turning him into a kick-butt paladin/assassin. The more I read the promos, the more I loved the idea.Then I saw the movie.I still appreciated the premise. The scripting was pretty good, minus two or three scenes. Great action movie. The overall movie experience was lacking.Its special effects were its great strength and weakness. They spent so much money and time on getting the effects right, they seemed to skimp on the little things: choreography, accent coaches, wardrobe, music, lighting, set design. These are the things that make the movie an experience rather than just a show.VAN HELSING & ANNA (Lead characters) The two main characters were very well done. I can't really complain much about them. They were well written, well acted, well directed, well wardrobed. . . I do wish they had given some character development as to why Anna was able to fight so well. But it was a long enough movie as it was, maybe they cut it out for time.Dracula Richard Roxburgh did an excellent job in his execution of his script. But he could have made his speech about having no heart a little more than one-dimensional. Let's face it, in a movie like this, we appreciate a villain that has SOME redeeming quality. His interchange with Van Helsing was much more impressive. And he handled his death rather well. Excellent method of showing a vampire's healing abilities.THE VAMPIRESSES (Dracula's brides) The vampiresses should have just been extras. Their action sequences were great. But every time they opened their mouths, I rolled my eyes and was just waiting for the next scene. They didn't really add anything to the plot or the movie except for their fights. I didn't even think they were sexy. Especially not in those campy outfits they had on. They looked like they were trying out for some psychic hotline ad.CARL (""I'm not a monk. I'm just a friar"") This was a work of genius as far as character creation goes. They give you a great taste of what it would be like if James Bond had Q with him on his assignments as a sidekick. Although I feel it was a simple part for an actor, I have to give David Wendham credit for performing it well.IGOR His line,""It's what I do"" pretty much sums it up. You can't have a movie like this without Igor. And he was doing exactly what we expected him to do. But someone was going to ask ""why is he doing that?"" So, they had Dracula ask for us. It's just what he does. Don't question it.SET DESIGN Most of the scenes were very good. But I'd think the most important set would be inside Dracula's castle. And that is where the set designer really disappointed me. Maybe it was partially the lighting and camera work. Maybe other little factors. But the cobwebs were overdone and the entire set looked too plastic. The colors were just slightly off to make it look like it was faked. Again, if I'm there to just see an action movie, OK. But the promos made it seem like it was going to be a little deeper than that.WARDROBE Van Helsing was well outfitted. As was Dracula. I could even say that the friar was done OK, but how can you go wrong with a plain brown robe? Everyone else looked really campy. Anna's wardrobe: designed well, poorly excecuted. It needed slightly different fabrics or colors that would project differently on the big screen.SPECIAL EFFECTS The battle scenes with the vampiresses and even the baby vampires were good.I never felt like I was suspending any disbelief. I just looked and felt I'd been transported. The transformation sequences were good for both Dracula and the werewolves. But when they had their final battle, they fell victim to the same problem that all heavily CG characters have. The speed and balance of the characters is always slightly off from reality. The only way I could console myself was that these were superhuman creatures able to violate some laws of physics in a fantasy movie. Even then, it was an effort to suspend my disbelief. Van Helsing's weapons were very well designed. Obviously not realistic for the era. But it was not too big a stretch for this genre of movie.EXPERIENCE This is a quality of movies that I don't see much comment on. It takes into account things like flow of the movie, emotions not only portrayed by the actors, but absorbed by the audience, the feeling that you are actually in the scene.For this quality, I'll have to give an 8 for a few scenes, but a 2 or 3 for the rest of the movie.SUMMARY If you're looking for an action movie that has someone being the superhero and kicking butt (Swarzennegger's --Commando) it's a great movie. They made some effort at being an intelligent movie as well, but only had limited success at executing that goal.If you want a movie that made you feel like you want to hear more about these characters and this world you've just been introduced to (Lord of the Rings), this was OK, but not a great movie.Cloud Castle",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Abbot and Costello get a modern melodramatic makeover.,"What this movie lacked in originality was balanced quite equally with it's futile attempt to redefine the vampire genre.Color coded filters will hold your hand in an attempt to convey the mood of each scene while dragging you to the end of the movie, unless of course you are lucky enough to break free and run away.Like so many movies being mass produced, hyped up and pumped out, Van Helsing weaves an incongruent story around a painfully puerile script and ceaseless onslaught of special effects.The curse of Van Helsing is a strange combination Gothic science, metaphysical vapirism, and lycanthropy, a vision that goes not only unrealized, but becomes quite tedious early in the movie.I highly recommend warding off Van Helsing.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
true,one of the best films i've seen in years. I took my mum to see it in may for her birthday and she loved it. The effects were amazing and jackmans portrayal of Van Helsing was brilliant. The man is a natural. Some of his fight scenes reminded me of him as wolverine in x-men. The atmosphere in the cinema was amazing. Van Helsing has such a dry sense of humour. When Helsing turned into the werewolf then back again all the women in the cinema had to catch their breath as it's not every day you see jackman in shammy leather. Jackman even did the voice over the animated film. I hope there will be a sequel to this as i will be first in line to see it.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My eyes!   My eyes!,"I'll save you the trouble of watching this movie in two words: DORKULA LIVES!This is one of the worst things I've seen, EVER. It knocked John Carpenter's Vampires out of the #1 spot on my list of Worst Vampire Movies I've Ever Seen ...and I watched Dracula 3000! This movie has a good cast. I am amazed that there is so little good acting. It's been a long time since anything I saw in a film had me wanting to claw out my eyes. Half the reason I didn't was that doing so would require me to stop covering my ears. The dialogue was dreadful, but not nearly so dreadful as the cringingly stereotypical fake accents sported by half the cast.Kate Beckinsale's character is supposed to be a gypsy, but neither she nor her brother not her entourage dress, act or seem to think like Roma. The word is just tossed in there. It would have been much better, I think, to refer to them as Romanian nobles and leave it at that. It doesn't help that she looks like she's dressed up as a pirate for Halloween.Most of this movie had me wondering just how stupid the writers think their viewers are, but the ending topped it all. Since there are probably people out there who would enjoy this movie -- though I have little idea why -- I won't give details on it, but let's just say I was worried that the Care Bears were going to show up.Redeeming points: Frankenstein is done fairly well, as are the patterns of movement on the vampires as they fly. This movie has the best werewolf visuals I've ever seen. There are also hints of a good story going on in the background with the mystery of Van Helsing's unknown past, but instead of playing these up as a real subplot, this movie buries them under piles and piles of some of the stupidest writing I've ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Monster Movies; Gotta love 'em!,"A lot of people have criticised this film for being too cheesy and not loyal to the original characters, but I think it is one of the best films so far this year. I'm a big fan of classic monster movies, and director Steven Sommers has taken the best of the big bads and modernised them to make a great kick-ass actioner. The costumes are great (a certain Miss Beckinsale looked fabulous in those boots and corset), the sets were breathtaking (I won't spoil anything but those of you who have yet to see it, keep an eye out for Dracula's Masked Ball!) and the movie even succeeds in making the audience jump out of their seats several times. Well, it worked on me anyway!I only have one quibble and that is about the dialogue. Some of the lines are a little cringeworthy when heard, but there is always some great action sequence just round the corner to distract you. And though the characters don't exactly stay true to their legendary status (Sommers bent a few rules here and there) the movie still works well, and to be honest, I don't really care if it's not like the previous monster movies, and I'm sure many others won't either. Change is good, after all!In short, this is a great action adventure film that's fun and fast-paced, with added eye candy for both guys and girls! So damn the critics, go see Van Helsing, you'll love it! It's just pure entertainment!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"not amazing quality, but entertaining","most people that have left comments got it pretty accurate. it was not a great quality film, but films are not made for people to critique, they are made to entertain and in that sense, it gets an A+. the acting wasn't great and it was inaccurate from what it was based off of, but that is not always a bad thing. the new twists that they added to the van helsing storyline were interesting. there were some funny moments, especially with Carl. it will definitely not be an Oscar contender but i was entertained. the CGI, although some people may have thought cheesy, i think brought Dracula into the 21st century. this isn't the type of film to win awards and standing ovations, but is likely to get many oohs and aahs because of all the effects.

A movie...get it?,"Haven't you wannabe critics ever heard of suspension of disbelief?  This is a movie, not real life.  I've got the vague idea that this should have been a comic book, rather than a movie.  As a movie, it's not bad...just cartoonish.  Nothing wrong with that... .  I would like to have had a better explanation about Van Helsing's past (and since when is Van Helsing Gabriel? It's always and forever been Abraham, and he's always been a doctor.)  I got the feeling that someone had played the video game Gabriel Knight and liked the name.  There was lots of humour in this movie and it really made it lots better than it would have had it all been played straight.  A friend complained that Kate Beckinsdale's character was parading around in suede thigh high boots with knock-me-down heels.  Well shoot....look at the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen....sort of a Doc Savage feel about it....mixing 1800's, 1900's and the future.... It's just a movie...enjoy it.

Boring and Disappointing,"After viewing the trailer some months ago I thought this was going to be a good film.  I am completely aware of all the trash that the big studios produce nowadays... somehow I thought this would be different, but instead it turned into a boring film with obnoxious one-liners and too much CGI.Now, the actor that played Dracula just didn't fit.  Dracula is suppose to be a dark-powerful being and inspire fear and respect, as well as sex appeal.  Even with all the CGI this Dracula did none of the above.Dr. Jekill/Mr. Hyde also seemed to be extra, it could have been a deleted scene.CGI is another factor that bothered me.  It's good to have special effects in films, but when it's overdone it looses the effect.  Whatever happened to the make-up department?   In the old days there were films that portrayed vampires, zombies or other evil entities simply with make-up effects; some looked fake and stupid, but others were truly terrifying.I suggest to any serious film enthusiast to stay away from Van Helsing.  If you still want to watch it, do it only for fun.  Just don't expect too much.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Meets expectations for the Genre it is targeted at,"In my opinion, Van Helsing is targeted at the X-Men Genre (being teens). While many adults can see the flaws of this movie, I think that many teens are going to really enjoy this one.  The action is non-stop and the computer generated images are pretty solid.  Ok, I agree with some of the comments that the acting is poor, it isnt great, but it is entertaining.I was able to take my 21 year old girlfriend to this and she didnt complain one time during the movie.  This from a person who likes sappy movies from Legally Blonde to the Rugrats.  Although, not quite as good to me as Underworld, Van Helsing was able to deliver on the action goods as advertised in trailers on TV.  Jackman is decent as VanHelsing and Beckinsale is at least nice to look at.  The girl that play Mishkala ( I think her name is Josie something) was most impressive to me in her limited role- she reeked of evil and seduction.So why not take your teens to see something that will at least entertain them for 2 hours.  There are a lot worse things they could see or be doing. For my 28 yr old perspective, some of the scenes are a bit unrealistic (see the stage coach scene and some of the parts near the end with beckinsale) but all in all I have to give this one a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

After 14 years the movie still hold up,"Stephen Sommers is a guy know how to make movies with a silly premise very entertaining and with his run from The Mummy in 1999 to Van Helsing in 2004 he single handedly create his own cinematic universe of old Universal monsters dub as The Dark Universe today without knowing it.Van Helsing is a comic book style movie set in the Victorian age with a dash of Steampunk technology in to the mix where vampire,werewolf and the Frankenstein monster running amok and the onlyone who can stop them is Van Helsing the legendary monster hunter played by Hugh Jackman along with his sidekick Carl the Monk and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale who also a famous vampire/vampire killer in her Underworld franchise.I first time saw the movie when I was young and love it just like I did with The Mummy and now when I already got some knowledge about these kind of movies to my surprise director Stephen Sommers hasn't done anything since his last movie Odd Thomas in 2013 which is really weird cause although most of his movies never hold anything deep or thought provoking but they are all perfect popcorn entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst film I have seen.,"I thought Richard Gere's ""Dr.T and the Women"" was bad, but Van Helsing was unbearable. I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman but he was wrong to star in this movie. I am so glad I only wasted a couple of dollars renting it instead of buying the DVD or having seen it in the theater. One critic (that I read ""after"" watching) said ""This isn't a film, it's a cinematic headache..."", I wish I had taken the time to search out reviews before renting. The movie started with Dr Jeckyl, changed into his alter ego Mr. Hyde but inexplicably 3 times as large as a normal human and so obviously digitized it was laughable. The whole movie is supposed to be set in the 1800s yet they've got weapons right out from Bond movies and an underground, high tech lab made to look old in Rome run by the church. It's like they threw in every monster and grim looking Transylvanian they could find into this movie and still failed. As with all poor movies only the trailer scenes were engaging. I am so surprised to find any positive comments on this dreadful movie. Last two words of advice for those thinking to rent or buy: ""Don't bother.""",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The movie starts out with this black and white sequence that ends up in an old windmill which I couldn't help to remind me to the Sleepy Hollow windmill scene. However, from this point on the movie just didn't slow down actionwise. It was fast, kept on going, looked really great and sounded even greater. A really amazing soundtrack with some catchy tunes danced 'round and 'round in my ears wich made this movie into a fairly enjoyable piece of expensive FUN.As expensive as all of this might be I think they saved a lot plotwise.

"Good effects and action, unfortunately a bit at the expense of the believability of the story and characters","I am very fond of fantasy, mystery and thrillers, and this movie was entertaining and worthwhile seeing, but it was also disappointing as I had expected so much more from it.The movie had all the elements necessary to create a fantastic rather than an ordinary movie. The actors were, in my opinion, quite right for their respective roles, and the setting and background of the story could have made for a really nice thriller following up on the Dracula myth and tradition  it could have been taken to epic levels. It seems such a pity having all this at hand and then turning out only a slightly better than average movie  good on the action and spectacular effects, but little more.What went wrong was that the action and effects were prioritised over and above the believability of the characters and story. Too much had to happen too fast with one spectacular scene after another. Instead they should have allowed for some more acting, defining and building up the characters and story.In many scenes there is also an undertone of humour which I find quite annoying. When I watch a thriller I wish to be shocked, scared and thrilled, not having the suspense and atmosphere killed every other minute because the director, producers, finance men or whoever thinks it is oh so trendy for their movie to be like Buffy, Ally, etc. It's like having the dessert mixed into your nice steak dinner - I prefer to have them separately, thank you.I rated this one a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"many flaws, but ultimately fun","I took my kids (17 & 13) to see this on Friday.  While we all had fun, on the ride back, pointing out parts of the movie that were not done well, in the end we all enjoyed it.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsdale were solid, if unspectacular, in the leads.  The Friar was very good as comedy relief, Dracula's brides were alternately luscious and vicious, Frankenstein's monster was very well done, even with the steampunk edge to him.  This was more the monster from the book than from the old Universal films, but, for me, it worked.Dracula was a bit insipid and the CGI'd Mr. Hyde was almost cartoonish.  As another reviewer pointed out, there were no scary moments, but this was, to me, much more of a CGI action picture, with a horror motif, than a horror movie.  (Might as well complain about the lack of science in Star Wars, but then I have done that myself.)In the end, we had a good time, the movie wasn't great, but it was a fun kickoff to the summer.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So wishy-washy....,"From the previews, I expected this to be a ""serious"" monster movie, about a man who is called on by God to fight the forces of evil.  But, it was clear that after the first 10-15 minutes, that the movie was absolute camp.I was wrong though, but I wouldn't ask the filmmakers to classify this movie.  It's obvious that they didn't know what the movie was either, because at some points it's camp, trying-to-be-camp, kitschy monster movie, serious romantic drama and a few others.  It gets very annoying.And the only character I found to be likable, was Carl (David Wenham). He's the typical sidekick character whose job is to help the hero.  Oh, and he talks funny.All-in-all, I was disappointed.  *C-*",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Requires a high tolerance for stupidity,"The only reason I rated this film a four instead of a three is because it held my attention. I may not have been bored, but I was, however, extremely annoyed, almost to the point of being offended. It felt as if the filmmakers gave their their audience no credit for intelligence whatsoever, confident that if they give us enough big-name stars, splashy special effects, PG-13 sexiness, and fast food promo tie-ins that we will gladly shell out $8 bucks for admission and $5 for popcorn and go home happy, without offering us anything of actual quality.Essentially, Van Helsing is a cartoonish genre blend of sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, and comedy. Yet, the real comedy in the film is unintentional; some points in the film are just so dumb you can't help but laugh. Why is Kate Beckinsale dressed like a cross between a matador and a dominatrix? Why dose she go out to fight vampires wearing high heels and heavy jewelry? How is it that she gets thrown across the room several times over without ever messing up her hair? Why does the entire region of Transylvania appear to consist of a single village? How is it that Beckinsale and Jackman fall into a river, yet five minutes later are completely dry? Why is a woman is the most remote part part of Eastern Europe in the 1880's wearing a pair of crack-riding spandex pants? How is it that Jekyll/Hyde doesn't bleed when he gets an entire arm lopped off? It seems these are not considered important details by the film makers, who assume viewers are either not going to notice or not going to care. Well, I noticed, and I cared, but that's just me.On that note, they also take huge liberties with historical accuracy, right from the very beginning of the film. Van Helsing the creature- killer refers to Mr. Hyde as a ""deranged sociopath"", a term which had not yet been invented in the 1880's, before the practice of psychoanalysis was known. Not long afterward, another character refers to Istanbul, which back then was still called Constantinople. Throughout the film, Van Helsing liberally sips absinthe from a flask. Not many people have seen absinthe before, but it is a cloudy, key-lime green color. In the film, it is transparent and bright emerald green, like Nyquil. Furthermore, absinthe was served in an almost ritualistic manner that involves burning a sugar cube over the glass before imbibing; only a rube would go around sipping from a flask. It is also mildly hallucinogenic and even quite toxic in large amounts, which is why it's now illegal. Van Helsing would have been a complete idiot to go around swigging it like it's Red Bull.Although the film uses classic horror films as a point of reference, there's really nothing scary about it at all. Practically every classic horror story ever known is mishmashed into the plot, no matter how briefly; all that's missing is 'The Invisible Man' and 'The Mask of Fu Manchu', and that's probably just because the writers couldn't think of a way to fit them in. Some people may call this ambitious; I think it's just silly.If none of these issues bother you, go ahead, rent it; everyone is entitled to turn off their brain for a couple hours a day. But if you consider cogent plot lines, character development, intelligent writing and a cohesive narrative indispensable, you might want to skip this.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Action Please!,I don't care what the critics say I LOVE THE FILM! Van Helsing is a good fantasy horror film - an action-packed adventure! The action in the film is worth watching even if you are not keen on the plot of this movie. I for one thought the story was very nice and a great Gothic atmosphere!I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the vampire-hunter Van Helsing - he was cool. Hugh Jackman is well suited for this role! And he picked the perfect romantic interest Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale)! One of the highlights of the film is the romance between Anna and Van Helsing.This film is great to watch on an day when you are in the mood for the classic movie monsters and a lot of action!8.5/10,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Flawed, but entertaining","If you want to hate this film, it gives you plenty of ammo.  The pacing is abysmal, it's full of pointless sub-plots that don't go anywhere, including a horde of evil monsters whose sole purpose is to explode pointlessly (err, make that three hordes in fact), so many 'deus ex machina's it's surprising they didn't all fall over each other, dreadful dialog, and everyone's favourite annoyance: gratuitous use of CGI.So my advice would be: DON'T WATCH IT.  That is, unless you just want to sit back, switch off artistic judgement, suspend all belief, and just enjoy the show for what it is: a cheesy action flick with a few novel ideas.  See it with friends; laugh at how stupid it is; laugh at the cartoon laws of physics; laugh too at the witty one-liners, occasional comic timing, and joke references to other stories.It's a shame that with better script-writing and direction, this could have been an excellent film.  It certainly had some of the right ingredients.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very bad, yet very funny (in a bad way).","Being a big MST3K fan, I enjoyed ridiculing this movie for over 2 hours. The evil Dracula reminded me of Riverdance and his love nest of women obviously enjoyed ""acting"" to the 10th power. Van Helsing's side kick was dropping bad jokes left & right, but after 45 minutes you just wanted him to die. Van Helsing tried to be cool, and suave he is not! Just watch the scene when he plops his ten-gallon hat on Anna's head and you will know what I mean. The acting was horrible and the director is to blame because some of the cast has a descent track record. For those familiar with the Black Adder episode ""Sense & Senility"", well its like the cast of this movie had been coached by the Shakespearian actors Mr. Keanrich & Mr. Mossop :)Watching Van Helsing on DVD was also educational for me. I'm no audio guru, but I now know what bad audio production is! During the few scenes that didn't contain any CG monsters or action, the dialogue would literally fade out when certain sound effects took place (like the 'sheen' of a sword being drawn). I should also mention the horrible over dubs and lip syncs. They were so bad that I felt like I was watching MXC! Cool! :)The CG had potential in some areas. I enjoyed the 1st werewolf scene and a coupe of shots towards the end when Dracula's little demons were flying about the village, but over all I wasn't impressed considering the talent displayed on other films that required lots of CG. The compositing and camera tracking were weak.Finally, the music. Just plain awful considering the genre of this film. The score might have worked for a Summer Olympics broadcast back in the 80's, but... Ahhh, forget it.1 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loads of fun,"I can't stand when I read critics say the script was weak, the dialog empty and simple and the acting was shallow! This is a monster movie for goodness sake and if you don't like that genre, don't watch! However, if you DO watch these kinds of movies you shouldn't expect a masterpiece of cinema! It's simply just fun, an assault on your senses with non-stop action and all the Universal monsters we grew up with. I absolutely was glued to my seat and I enjoyed every second of it. If you want a roller coaster ride, you should expect some bumps. This movie is a roller coaster ride. You know before you start where you will end up - it's the ride that you will enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Van Helsing could be my favorite movie if made more carefully.,"Even though I enjoyed watching it, I was expecting much more from this movie because of its potential. As a huge fan of gothic culture, I love that era's environment and style. The top-level actors, especially Hugh and Kate, are one of my favorites. Also the plot I find very interesting! I watched it as a kid multiple times, but while watching it now, I feel like some parts just needed more time to develop. Humor is fine, but some moments and action parts are very cliche, which ruined my experience. I wish they were more careful and removed or changed these cliche parts with at least extra 20 minutes for quickly done scenes. Still, it's an excellent and easy movie; I wouldn't watch it six times for no reason.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I laughed... I cried... but I don't think I'm supposed to.,"Doctor Victor Frankenstein creates his monster. The village mob is at the gates. Count Dracula and his three brides arrive to take Frankenstein's scientific conquest over God. He kills Frankenstein and leaves the windmill in fiery ruins. Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan are hunting a werewolf when Velkan is thrown off a cliff. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) kills Mr. Hyde and has become the most wanted killer in Europe. His next assignment from a secret Catholic order is to hunt down Dracula. In a battle with Dracula's brides, he is joined by Anna.This is one of those movies that are SO over the top, that it is difficult to criticize. Although, I certainly will try. The action is non-stop, the acting is atrocious, and the story is completely convoluted. The accents by the actors are so bad that it was laughable. At times, I actually did laugh. The brides are wild. They seem to be channeling old style acting from the silent era horrors.I do have to give the movie credit. It doesn't care. As the movie gets more silly, the action piles on. It gets crazier and it's a mess. The CGI is non-stop. I watched this in the theater with a group of friends and nobody liked it. We were left shaking our heads in exasperation.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good ride. Enjoy it.,"Just got back from seeing it. What a ride!!!Like ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" before it, leave your critical thinking at the door. You aren't going to see this movie expecting it to have some deep insight into the human condition are you?Enjoy the ride. This is an excellent blending of rollercoaster live action with awesome special effects, and it's a rollicking good story.Hugh Jackman is good enough to please the ladies, and that hat is going to become as memorable as Indiana Jones' Fedora (the movie calls for a sequel of some sort). Kate Beckinsale is simply adorable and looks great in bitch boots and a leather corset. (She needs to be careful she doesn't get typecast, because her role kind of reminds me of her role in ""Underworld"" - she's NOT a vampire BTW)Speaking of Kate, like Rachel Weisz in both Mummy films, Stephen Sommers lets her be an action heroine, and not keep fainting when the monsters come, as films in the past used to.Kate is probably the best action heroine since Sigourney Weaver in the Alien films.The only bit that was a minor let down is that they hint on the origin of Van Helsing, but it's not completely explained. Maybe they are planning a sequel.I always judge a film on wether I would buy the DVD. I'll go out the day it's released, and buy myself a copy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Great visuals, if nothing else.","I went into this movie knowing nothing about it other than what I had seen in the TV trailers. It looked great, and, feeling I have to give credit where credit is due, I must say that it did not disappoint in that regard. The visuals and effects in this movie are, hands down, a 10 out of 10.It's a shame it has so little going for it otherwise.The plot, what little there is, takes forever to get going, and, once it does, sputters and dies shortly thereafter. From there on, it's your typical rescue-the-princess and kill-the-monsters romp that would be better suited to a late 80's video game than a blockbuster movie.The characters themselves aren't much better. David Wenham's Carl gets some good lines and comes across as likable, but the rest of the cast don't have much going for them, although I think that, perhaps given a script with a little more meat in it, the players could have sunk their teeth into the roles better.Another minus to the closing pyre scene, easily one of the cheesiest movie moments I can recall and really had no place in a movie such as this.So if you're the type that feels CGI and a bare-chested Hugh Jackman are the ingredients of a good movie, see it and you'll go home happy. But if you prefer fare such as plot development and three-dimensional characters, you would, in all honesty, be better off watching an episode of That 70's Show.Overall, a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More is not always better,"Steven Sommers seems to suffer from the delusion that more is always better. Special effects to enhance a scene?  Let's do CGI in every shot! Music to set a mood? Let's have a loud, thundering soundtrack that doesn't let up! Use action to create drama? Let's make a film that is nothing more than one long action sequence from start to finish!Unfortunately for Sommers, ""more"" comes at the expense of ""less""--almost no character development and a poor script with laughably bad dialog, so what we are left with is a crashing bore.  In a film, the audience must first care about the characters.  Everything else is developed around that--lighting, set design, special effects.  In Van Helsing the set design is beautiful, the action is thrilling, the CGI is dazzling, but who cares? This is a film for which you feel nothing, that is hollow inside.This movie is like a text where EVERYTHING IS TYPED IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS; WHEN EVERYTHING IS EMPHASIZED, THEN NOTHING IS EMPHASIZED. What you are left with is pointless, noisy, frenetic action. The worst film of 2004 without a doubt. I give it 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Universal Monster Flick,"I absolutely love this movie. Universal did a fantastic job at creating a movie that pays homage to the classic movie monsters of old for the modern day, and solidifies itself as a classic Halloween-time favorite.
The plot and story are evenly paced. Its an entertaining action movie with a healthy balance of its comic relief and lore/world building. Sets are incredibly crafted and built, stunts for the most part mostly complimented by practical effects, which in my opinion make a film better; even is CGI isn't terribly cumbersome. Sure it has a certain campiness that adds to its charm, and fortunately it doesn't take away from it.
I for one think this movie tends to be underrated, but should be considered in higher regard by the film fanatics.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies ever made,"This campy spoof of monster movies, James Bond movies and adventure films is probably destined to be a cult classic, it's so awful. By turns hilarious and excruciating, one watches in disbelief that the writer of some of the very best adventure movies of the modern age could have been involved in this mess. I'm not sure that the scenes that left me almost literally rolling on the floor in tears of hysterical laughter were actually meant to be funny at all. There are some familiar names involved in the supporting cast, who were all brilliant in other movies but fall far short in this one, and the cgi work is erratic at best. In fact, I can't imagine how a post-Gollum movie could turn out something as lousy as the disgustingly amateurish Mr.Hyde. The plot is ridiculous, the supposedly clever comments and catchphrase-wannabes are lame beyond description. There's nothing to recommend this to anyone, unless you like being tortured by a really bad movie. Avoid this one like you would a huge flock of winged demons! Actually, if I had a choice between being attacked by demons or watching this again, I'd take my chances with the demons.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
MUST have an imagination to watch this,"After seeing this film a few times years back before seeing the ratings here on it, I was not surprised to see that they're lower than they should be.

A production where you can just freely let your imagination run and enjoy the ride from start to finish. The concept of Dracula's brides here is one of the most captivating things, but particularly the character Aleera and her dialogue.

Van Helstink,"Let me start this review by saying that I was predisposed to like this movie right from the start. I like horror movies and the meeting of three great movie legends - Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's Monster - seemed to me to be an interesting and entertaining combination. Plus, the movie was by Stephen Sommers, director of The Mummy, which is one of my favourites. Then there was the cast - Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham. All these factors combined to bring a great sense of anticipation in me that this would be a great movie.Sadly, I was disappointed.It's not bad, by any means, but the things which make a movie great just aren't there. In trying to understand why this film didn't do anything for me, I can point to several factors, one of which, ironically, is one of the reasons I thought I would enjoy the film - the meeting of three screen legends. But let's go through it point by point.Firstly there's Richard Roxborough. Now, he looks like a good Dracula, I'll give him that, but unfortunately, from the moment he opened his mouth to deliver his characters first line, I found myself struggling not to laugh. His accent isn't terrible, but it's just the wrong side of a Realistic/Carry On movie accent to be anything but humorous. Any menace his character had was ruined by that.Secondly, there's altogether too much swinging from ropes, cables and chains in this film. It's entirely pointless, for the most part, and speaks of a lack of imagination when writing the scenes. The opening scene at Notre Dame cathedral, for instance, involves a scene with ropes. There's countless others throughout the film until you're left with the feeling that you're watching a Tarzan movie.Thirdly, and perhaps the most annoying. The CGI. It's just plain cack. None of the creatures look particularly realistic, in fact, they look like exactly what they are....CGI. Now, you'd think that a director whose movie The Mummy Returns was so slammed for the awful CGI Scorpion King at the end would have learnt from that mistake, but apparently not. Don't get me wrong, the CGI in VH is not anywhere near as bad as in TMR. But at no point in any of the scenes involving living (or unliving) entities do you not know that they are CGI. Although not awful, at some points it does begin to make you sigh sadly. Likewise the cuts between real actors and CGI are not done as well as might be expected. And what was the deal with the CGI Dracula? Talk about overweight! That just looked ridiculous.Fourthly, the combo of all the legendary monsters. I had thought this would be a good thing, but in fact none of the creatures got the development they deserved, instead being relegated to ""also-ran"" status. I think if they had picked one monster and written a story around that - a la The Mummy - it would have made a better film, and provided for sequels. As it is, Stephen Sommers has shot his load by using all three staples (and never mind Dr Jekyll at the start!) and hasn't anywhere to go after this. At least, nowhere that makes any sense, anyhow.Finally, the physics. No, I'm not going to go all ""undead-can't-exist-because..."" on ya. It's just that a lot of the CGI scenes involving falling, or swinging from ropes just don't look right. The eye perceives something that doesn't gel with your experiences of reality. And, as a result, the whole scene is ruined. It seemed to me that most of the swinging arcs in the film were actually parabolas, not arcs. In fact, the whole film has a ""watching someone else play a video game"" feel.There are some bright moments to the movie, though. Well...OK. One. David Wenham gives a truly hilarious performance as Van Helsing's side-kick. Along with Kevin O'Connors Igor, these two improve the film no end. I've noticed this before in some movies - when you care about minor characters more than the main ones - it's usually an indication that the film isn't that good.In summary then, the movie fails to deliver it's promise, though I doubt that'll stop it from becoming a hit this summer. At no point do you really feel either frightened or amazed. Nor does it really make you care about any of the characters. At no point do you feel that VH will fail in his mission to destroy the Count. In short, there are no surprises, except the execrable CGI.In other words, another movie that has failed to live up to the hype surrounding it, much like Kill Bill 2, although not that awful. I can only hope The Day After Tomorrow and Troy don't go the same way. Watch it once, then forget it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Weak,"Stupid plot, Bad script, Bad makeup, Bad acting, Bad accents and 2ndrate special effects. It is truly unclear as to what they were looking to do with this mishmash. why was it ever green lighted. I hope that Sommers goes back to writing and leaves the directing to grown-ups next time. He even managed to make the lovely and talented Kate Beckinsdale look like a low-rent B movie actress. I'm sure Jackman got big bucks for this, but his agent should be fired. Please stick to Wolverine. I hope the study exec who authorized this one is back fetching coffee for the suits. The money would have been better served going to charity.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun with a capital F,"I went into the cinema expecting a great deal of fun and that is exactly what I got. To expect anything else from this movie is just ludicrous and it delivers it's promise very well.I am not one of these people that thinks that a movie should stick to one genre the whole time and can appreciate and well enjoy a mix of genres as this movie offers. Action-adventure, campy-comic and, at times, a very touching monster-movie. If you like plain white milk or straight black coffee then this movie is not for you.While it would not be in the slightest bit scary for say, a 40 man or woman, there are a few jolts that really make you giggle at yourself and I expect the kiddies might get a few nightmares if they're young enough.Hugh Jackman shares the screen deftly with David Wenham and Kate Bekinsale in such a way that I would definitely call it an ensemble piece. While Hugh's character (Van Helsing) is the titular role, the meat of the show seems pretty evenly distributed so don't expect a Hugh Jackman showcase. Of course Richard Roxburgh is divinely camp as Dracula and it's great to see a different slant on the old story. While the purists will hate this I think it's heaps of fun (that 'f' word again!).The effects and cinematography are simply gorgeous, from a wolfman's eyes in the bushes to the flying bat-like creatures that are the ""brides"", there is nothing that will bore even the most jaded cinema-goers (yes even the spoiled 15yo's will like this one!). The scene with a wolfman howling at the moon as he changes back into a human is pure art. Gorgeous stuff ... pish-posh to all the ""no cg""-sayers. Having said that, there are some really fantastic scenery shots (shot in Prague I think) that will have any dreamer/traveler drooling. These do not seem to involve cg.As for the pacing, the movie grabs you immediately and never lets up ... not a roller coaster per sey, just a constant barrage that keeps you glued to the screen for it's entire run.Yes it has faults, yes it's cheesy, yes it's all been done before, but who cares?! It's great fun and I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and a love of monster movies.Bravo",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big dumb fun,"This is just a big rollercoaster ride of effects and fun rip-offs of classic movies. The plot hangs together OK, it's not just random events.

If you want a fun popcorn movie, this is the thing.Hm, IMDB wants 10 lines now. Grr. Like there's a point saying alot about this movie. Oh well.

"Could have been a great movie, but...","... they packed too much and spend a lot of money in a movie that is not quite as good as it sounds.The CGI leaves a lot to wish for, specially after watching The Lord of the Rings.

Is a pity that ILM animators didn't do a better job. I would like to know in which parts is Weta involved.The story sometimes packs too many ideas at the same time as to try to get the viewer confused or lost. A love action movies, but in this one, they overdid it.

"I've seen worse films, just not in a while","It's excruciating to watch three very talented actors (Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, and Richard Roxbury) perform in a film lacking such essential substance, character and plot development, and that has more special effects than acting in it. Basically, the movie is poorly plotted dross the like of which has not been seen since The League of Extraordinary Gentleman. Why did they bother hiring decent actors for this slop when they could have made the same film (with even more crap special effects) without wasting the talents of people who could (and yet didn't) act?So don't watch this for a plot or even just an adventure story. Watch it because you like the actors, though a couple of the performances are wince worthy, or because you like special effects.If I had paid for the movie ticket, I would want my money back.

A Real Treat - pay no attention to naysayers..!!,"Van Helsing is a wonderful popcorn movie, and you're bound to enjoy it if you're not going in looking to rip it to pieces. Like the previous Mummy movies, the plot is treacle...but with every corner there's a fantastic action sequence that goes on forever. The main thing with Van Helsing is that it makes no quips about what it is...and then the movie delivers in spades. A lot of spades. Saying that there is a tremendous action sequence every five minutes or so is not exaggerating..! There are plenty - plenty - of cool, elaborate battles, very well executed and shot beautifully. The film itself is absolutely gorgeous to look at - the scenery playing probably the most important role in the film. If you like Gothic, fog-enshrouded landscapes along the lines of Hammer films - then you're in for a treat. Van Helsing is set not only amongst a beautiful, beautiful backdrop of foggy landscapes...but also has a very nice nod to the old B&W Universal sets as well. The cinematography and scenery are worth the price of admission alone - for those with a classic eye. If you're trained in your classic horror films and literature, you're bound to appreciate the effort put into this piece a great deal more than someone who, say, was raised on Terminator and NFL. The negative word of mouth I've been hearing seems to be coming mainly from cultureless lunk-heads who haven't researched anything before 1977. Do not pay attention to them - Van Helsing is a real crowd pleaser, and an awful lot of work on every level went into this film. There's not only beautiful scenery and sets - the monsters are really gorgeous. The brides of Dracula are really something - and the battles with them are fantastic. The actors are all gorgeous, as well - but the director has a good eye for character...none of these people are good looking in your typical, bland, storefront means. They're lovely in the sense that they're people that you would genuinely be attracted and endeared to...rather than a flavorless sculpted Barbie or Ken. The writing allows for just a minimum of character development...but, honestly - it's just popcorn...and if you're looking for more than a great looking, high-flying action movie - then you're in the wrong seats. But - if you know what you're getting yourself into, and want to have an absolutely wild ride..! Van Helsing is a wonderful summer action movie...and good word should be spread about this baby, so we can at least get another one..! And by the way...the lusty soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is the very best movie music out there right now..! No kidding - the music is delectable. Most everything in Van Helsing works - just don't go in being a knob...or you're not gonna get it at all. It's a blast!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, fast, furious, full of holes...","Yes, this movie has tons of plotholes. Yes this movie has all sorts of small flaws. Do those things matter to this movie? No, they do not. And why don't they matter? Because this is a James bond meets medieval fantasy. I had fun watching this movie. The people that went to see this movie and claims here that they would've ""stormed the box office and demanded the money back for the entire audience"" and request that the director should apologize in public for this movie, are idiots. This is a movie you watch if you like gung-ho action, to be suspended in disbelief by something so outré that no way in hell could this ever be real. And none of it can of course. But that's the beauty of it. This movie takes something so far out, so outrageous as this is, and turns it believable.This is a great new action-movie. Action movies were best in the 80's and since then the genre has degenerated into horrible movies featuring The Rock or clever things with cool gimics, like The Matrix and Boondock Saints. This is more true to the action legacy of movies like Indiana Jones and James Bond than even the new James Bond movies.Fun movie, but not a great movie. And there's a difference there. You can hammer this movie all you want, but that won't change that fact that it's still fun and you can enjoy yourself with this piece of excellent escapism. Just don't for one second think that it will contain a hidden message that will cause every person in the world to realise the errors of their ways and love each other.8/10, judged like an actionmovie, not as a poetical masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
van smellsing,"yes... a childish jab to say the least, but thats all i can summon after seeing this piece of garbage.  from the opening sequence I was aware of what I was getting into.  i couldnt believe how exponentially more hilarious this movie became from one scene to the next.  not in a funny, entertaining way, mind you, i mean in the ashamed, embarrassed kind of way.i do not get the urge to walk out of movies very often, and yet after twenty minutes I contemplated that every 5 minutes for the rest of the film.  i stuck it out though, just because I was intrigued to see how bad it could really get.  what a waste of 2 hours of my life.  i considered after watching the film that it was an attempt to recreate the corny B-monster flicks of the 50's and 60's.  that's the only excuse I can make for it. the formulaic characters, the abysmal dialogue and acting, the over-the-top attempts at drama and suspense, the effects...  oh my lord the effects were just horrid!!  please save yourself from this experience.  wait for it on video, at least you have the opportunity to make it stop.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A complete fantasy action blockbuster,"The film starts with action , has action in the middle and finishes with action. It is also the loudest film I have ever seen. Hugh Jackman is a 19th century 007 complete with 19th century gadgets. Even some of the bond type humour is injected into the film. Overall his performance is completely shadowed by the special effects people. Kate Beckinsale is not a bond girl(she doesn't double cross him) but she is definitely there for her looks rather than her acting. The film starts in 19th century Paris and the set is amazing, even the Eiffel Tower is only half built. A pretty impressive Mr Hyde is then slayed by Jackman before the real adventure begins. After a brief stopover at headquarters Jackman heads to Transylvannia to take on the main man Dracula.From there the CGI just gets better and better. Every monster creation is magnificently detailed and truly terrifying. Don't wait for charactor development scenes, there aren't any. Truth is the film doesn't need them. The action speaks for itself. What surprises me most about this film is the 12A certificate. Sure there is no nudity, graphic violence or bad language but it can be pretty harrowing. It will scare the bejesus out of young children who will be able to legally see it. This is not a film for the lovers of quality drama but it does exactly what it says on the tin. It is an orgy of action and CGI.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
This could have been better.,Honestly. I really hated how this movie ended with Anna dying in the end. I wanted her to live as well.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't write the DVD version off!,"How the director / writer conceived Kate Beckinsale's character so badly is curious enough. How she could have read the part and agreed to do it that much worse. What stuns the viewer, however, is the fact the entire crew from costume designer to camera operator could have collaborated! This could have been a great campy fun horror movie along the lines of a classic Hammer film (but with really great sfx) instead we groan when Kate Beckinsale first walks into a shot, suede high heels and all. Not that I am against a sexy character or two. The brides (especially Elena Anaya) are fantastic! So much so you forgive the fact their outfits appear to somehow be as impervious as their vampiric selves.Despite a poor performance from Ms. Beckinsale I did enjoy this in an odd sort of way. The effects are so brilliant you wonder how movies like the Hulk still get made, the costumes (apart from the aforementioned Kate's) are cool in a ""I wanna be _____ for Halloween"" sorta way. The DVD extras are fun, particularly the bloopers real. The side characters all put in great performances, I want to say especially ... but they were ALL brilliant. Hugh Jackman IS a super hero, better cast here than as Wolverine though the comparisons were inevitable. Rent or buy the DVD and be happy you saved your $10 you would have spent seeing it in the cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"I still have no idea of why I went to see this movie. The screenplay was hideous, the visual effects were dumb, but what I hated the most were the accents! ""Van Helsing, yourrrrrrrr rrrrrreputationnnnn prrrrrresides yyyyyou"". Those guys (especially Kate Beckinsale) need acting lessons quickly.The plot was pointless. It didn't make sense at all! I still don't get why they found (Yes, they found them, not the other way around) the vampires somewhere else after they escaped from them and...is it me or the vampires were having a party? Van Helsing should be burnt, it is so bad that not even the music (which I actually liked) made it get a rank of 2/10 from me. If you are planning to see this movie...DON'T!!! I swear even Bandidas is better...",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You have to see it to believe it!,"I was skeptical about this movie from the very beginning. All of my fears and trepidation were soon allayed. This movie is great! It has action, special effects and it keeps you interested. Universal did a wonderful job bringing the gruesome threesome back for a modernized ""period"" piece. Hugh Jackman is great as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale is always a pleasure to behold. If you are a fan of the old Universal monster movies you should enjoy this one with out a doubt. I know I will be looking forward to the sequel! Another topic of interest is this movie was made by the same people that did the two recent Mummy movies....you will also note a couple of the supporting actors from those movies have roles in this movie. See if you can spot them.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
CGI-heavy exciting romp,"There's not really much to add to the comments that have gone before as this is one film that obviously splits opinion heavily.If you are looking for deep characterisation, subtle plotting and a seriously adult adventure you are obviously looking in the wrong place especially given its 12A rating obviously indicating that it was made for the whole family to enjoy ...If, however you're after a cracking adventure yarn with excellent (if overused IMO) SFX/CGI, a few good twists and some great one-liners then this is a movie for you! It is a shame there wasn't a significant spark between the leads (personally I didn't think this was a requirement though really) but the expected minor roles (Igor, the Friar sidekick, the Undertaker and especially the brilliantly CGI'd Dracula's Brides) more than made up for any minor let downs by the leads.Basically if you liked the Mummy (especially if you liked the Mummy Returns too ... ie you could ignore the rather bad CGI at the end!) then chances are very high you'll like this too.Oh, and to the person who said nobody with an IQ above 50 could enjoy this movie, the three of us in my party all thoroughly enjoyed it and all IQs were over 125 :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The ruining of a could be great story,"This movie has all except a good story. All fans of Dracula knows the magic of van Helsing. In Coppola's movie he is there when Dracula resents God, and becomes an undead. The doctor pursues Dracula for the 400 years until he has the final encounter in London when the count goes there looking for his life's,and death's, love. Taken from this scenario van Helsing could have been a very good movie about the hunt for the master vampire during those 400 years. But obviously they have saved the money from the story writing and chosen to go with special effects and half naked beautiful women. Mixing to much of modern action and modern weapons, looking rusty old fashioned,in to a medieval scene is in my opinion not helping this movie. Also it must be said that after Oldman as charismatic dangerous Dracula(In Coppola's movie) it just will not do with a plain nice looking ""James Bond"" type for a Dracula no matter how long his hair and bad his words. At best Dracula should be Oldman, but at least they should use an actor with a ""sting"" to do the role.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
