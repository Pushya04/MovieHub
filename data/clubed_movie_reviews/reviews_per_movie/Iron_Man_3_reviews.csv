"Hated it at first, I like it more each time I re-watch","The first time I saw this movie I really didn't like it, I had just come off the high of ""The Avengers"" and let me make it clear, this one isn't as good. That said it is significantly better than Iron Man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. There's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.One thing I like about this movie is that you get to learn more about Tony Stark, as much as I loved his arrogance in IM1, 2 at the end of Avengers he was humbled and that continues in this one. On the one hand I love the suits and the fancy technology but it's Robert Downey's sarcasm and wit that make him so great for this franchise.Yes there is a big plot twist but it by no means ruins the movie and while I was not a fan of the ending, you can see where things are going towards Avengers 2.It may not be for you, my only advice is to make sure you watch it again. I was angry the first time I did and thought the movie was a joke, each additional time I've watched it I take something more from it and enjoy it a little more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"An enjoyable film that in the end will leave you with a big: ""Thats it?""","Spoiler free review:Its not really worth going much into detail, after all this movie follows the classic RDJ - Stark formula. For me and the audience, it was just as good as it was first presented in Iron Man 1. It keeps you entertained along the movie, some good laughs here and there, cool tech, Decent action sequences, etc. You can't really hate the character, his quirks and gadgets regardless of the plot.The trailer and the first part of the movie sets you in a dark atmosphere not seen and experienced in the 2 previous installments. You know that very soon things will get serious and bad for our main characters, the downfall is imminent. But then as the movie progresses, one keeps expecting some real trouble; a ruthless, merciless and powerful villain to reign over the story...And it happens of course, (without revealing anything), it just that is really nothing special, really. The plot ends being flat and its just as rewarding as Iron Man 2 plot.Positive aspects: -New tech and gadgets: It is shown and comes across the story in unpredictable moments and ways. Really fun -I liked the soundtrack, it gave the movie more depth and feeling. I think it was better than previous installments, only it got repetitive at the end of the movie -A+ visuals and effects -Bad ass Suits and actionsNegative: -A lot of the plot aspects are left behind mid film. Some of them are poorly handled and explained and are just thrown or taken out of nowhere to keep up the pace of the film -villain does not delivers 100%: A superhero movie is not only about the main hero, the villain is just as important.Comic reader or not, it will be fun film. Just don't expect anything big that will leave you talking and thinking about the matter for a couple of weeks. When you walk out of theater you will be pleased for sure, the movie is worth it after all. It just that its not what many expected and it will just leave you with a big: ""Thats it?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mediocrity abounds.,"This movie has lots of special effects and lots of noise and lots of excellent actors, but it forgot to include one thing: a story. Well, actually, there is a story, of sorts, but it is so superficial as to render it moot. This movie is proof that special effects alone do not make for a good movie, or for even a fair movie. When Miss Penny has to bail out Iron Man, that's a sure sign that the script department is desperate. But that aside, the story is so shallow and the bad guys so predictable that the movie loses dramatic power, rendering it stale. Of course, this can happen when a comic book story is transposed onto the screen. If not portrayed correctly, the story will not be taken seriously, and the movie tanks. Iron Man 1 and 2 managed to avoid that problem; this movie does not. As a result, we have an Iron Man who offers nothing new and is dealing with bad guys who are laughable. Ben Kingsley's performance is a joke. Robert Downey Jr. is, as usual, excellent as Iron Man, but without a viable script, his presence cannot save this movie from its mediocrity, and who wants to watch mediocrity?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A risk-taking third solo outing for 'Iron Man' with plenty of payoff,"How will Marvel's universe ever be the same after ""The Avengers""? There's bound to be a vocal percentage of viewers who walk out of ""Iron Man 3"" thinking, ""why didn't he just call his superfriends in the end?"" It's a good question, one that Drew Pearce and Shane Black's script doesn't ignore, but never satisfyingly answers. Yet that doesn't seem to matter. The bigger question that Marvel has addressed is whether it could effectively narrow the scope of its universe again after ""The Avengers"" blew it open‚Äîand the answer is yes.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) hasn't been the same since his near-death experience in a intergalactic wormhole at the end of ""The Avengers."" In fact, the words ""New York"" have become a trigger for his newly discovered anxiety attacks. He has spent his funk by building an inordinate amount of Iron Man suits, and specifically a remotely operated suit that he can summon through a biological tracking system. When a terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) emerges, hacking U.S. airwaves to spread fear and causing thermal explosions, Tony calls him out on his cowardice, a move he immediately regrets.As the script continues to introduce all the players in this third iron-clad outing, from Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian‚Äîa think tank manager Tony spurned 13 years ago‚Äîto Don Cheadle's Col. Rhodes who has a new gig as the stars-and-stripes-studded presidential bodyguard Iron Patriot, the film appears as a sloppy mess likely to meet the same fate as ""Iron Man 2."" Only when Tony begins to pursue the mystery of the terrorist bombings do all these seemingly disparate pieces begin to come together into what's actually a rather clever story.Story structure aside, the script does boast plenty of Stark quips in case you worried the directorial turnover from Jon Favreau to Shane Black would alter the tone of the franchise. Not even close. If anything, the ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" director pushes the boundaries of political correctness with some of the dialogue, especially in the scenes in which Tony finds himself teamed up with a 12-year-old boy.""Iron Man 3"" digs deeper into the psychology of Tony Stark, at least more than you'd expect from a blockbuster. Rather than open with an action sequence to get the ball rolling, we get a flashback to when Stark met Pearce's Killian as well as a genetic engineer named Maya played by Rebecca Hall. Things don't really begin to pick up until Tony has his mansion blown into the ocean.Not unlike ""Iron Man 2,"" the film's action is largely reserved for the grand finale. Still, the amount of special effects shots is probably tripled, and the action sequences when they do come were written to be as unique and memorable as possible, with a skydiving sequence taking the cake. ""Iron Man 3"" hits big whenever it makes the effort to do so, proving again how Marvel Studios holds a quality entertainment standard rivaled by few.The ""Iron Man"" films (and this is partly fault of the comic) lack truly excellent villains. This film sets up Tony Stark's greatest nemesis in the Mandarin, but complicates it in a way you'll never see coming considering how studios and writers have flocked toward villains in the mold of Heath Ledger's Joker from ""The Dark Knight.""The movie gambles in that way and in other ways not all audiences will recognize. Take the boy for example. If the film failed on the whole, it would forever be remembered as ""the 'Iron Man' movie with Tony Stark and that kid."" That's dangerous territory. If ""Spider-Man 3"" had worked, everyone wouldn't refer to it as ""the one with emo Peter Parker.""Nothing gambles more than the script, which spends a lot of time setting up the premise for what it hopes will be an effective payoff. So much of the film seems anecdotal until you see how the pieces fit. Even then, there's no guarantee the audiences will be compelled by the completed puzzle, but ""Iron Man 3"" goes bold enough to surprise in a good way.The humor definitely misfires at times and the sense of danger doesn't pervade the film from start to finish, but considering how must third installments have sputtered (""Spider-Man 3,"" ""X-Men: The Last Stand""), it's testament to a number of quality components at work behind the scenes, not excluding ""The Avengers,"" which clearly reenergized Iron Man as a solo character. Without it, no way ""Iron Man 3"" opens with nearly $175 million after the critical disappointment toward the second.Few actors have truly created and owned a character like Downey Jr. and Tony Stark. Without him, Iron Man is just a second-class superhero in Marvel's canon. He single-handedly launched Phase One of Marvel Studios' plan and gave audiences a multi-dimensional hero with both despicable and lovable qualities. If he powers down the suit after ""The Avengers 2,"" it'll be the end of an era.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Unbelievable""... but not in a good way.","This was a Disney/Marvel collaboration. Perhaps one problem was that it was too much Disney and insufficient Marvel.The thing I was conscious of at many points throughout the movie, was that in ridiculously violent fights between unarmored and unprotected simple flesh and blood humans... no one gets hurt. In Road Runner cartoons, when the anvil flattens the Coyote, it's quite funny due to its ludicrous overstatement. But the real parts of a movie involving humans -- which are intended to be believable -- really need to remain believable... or it's asking too much from a mature audience.As a Science Fiction lover, I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of immersion into a new idea. I loved the first IronMan, and have watched it many times. So I will gleefully imbue a robotic suit with any levels of strength and power the story may require. That's fine. Bring it on. Thrill me. But I know the limitations of an unaided human body. We all have one. And what I saw far too much of, against human flesh, was a level of coyote-flattening violence that was utter nonsense.Despite the fact that I have no doubt IronMan will break US domestic box office records, as it already has overseas, I think that ""Oblivion"" was the far better movie so far this summer./Steve.

A new type of Iron Man movie,"The third instalment of the highly-successful Iron Man franchise goes off in a different direction to its predecessors. I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great direction for the MCU after Avengers,"There is a moment in Iron Man 3 which will be a big influence on whether you enjoyed the movie or not. At the time of its release, this midway twist proved to be quite polarising, with many critics and fans revelling in the clever direction of the story, whilst others despaired at a Hollywood mishandling of an iconic character. Either way, Iron Man 3 will have you talking about it by the end.And so you should; because, even setting aside the divisive twist, this is a hugely entertaining comic book movie infused with a wonderful sense of humour, a breakneck pace and some truly spectacular action sequences.The story revolves around Tony Stark/Iron Man facing a new threat known as The Mandarin whilst juggling his relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and keeping Guy Pearce's creepy scientist at bay. It seems like there is a lot going on but by keeping the focus squarely on Tony, director Shane Black is able to keep the narrative from becoming incoherent, and more importantly, retain its sense of fun.Downey Jr. is completely at home in the role of Tony Stark. He throws out one liners and insults with such ease yet achieves a sense of vulnerability not yet seen in the character. It is his most assured performance as Tony and one can only hope that he doesn't stop here. But it is not just Downey Jr. on form here, as Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, and most notably Ben Kingsley deliver fantastic performancesWith the success of Avengers Assemble, and the decision to make this movie the first of Marvel's 'Phase Two', it would be understandable if Black was feeling any pressure, but it certainly doesn't come across on the screen. It may have been tempting to try and better Avengers Assemble by going bigger, flashier and louder; but wisely, Black chooses to rein in the more ridiculous aspects of comic book movies, and delivers a film which is more concerned about the man inside the suit, not just the suit itself. That is not to say there is not a lot of action; there is and it is eye popping, but in between the explosions and stunts, we get a chance to spend time with Tony and see what makes the snarky billionaire tick. The fact that it proves to be just as exciting and interesting as the segments with the suit is a testament to both Black's script and Downey Jr.'s performance.A bold and surprising take on one of the most popular movie characters since Jack Sparrow. Filled with exciting action, hilarious one liners and one or two unexpected plot turns, Iron Man 3 will have you grinning throughout its 2 hour runtime.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3: The Human Side Of Tony Stark,"After being totally thrilled by The Avengers, I didn't expect exactly the same amount of greatness in ""Iron Man 3"", yet I still needed a solid story to keep me interested. There were two things that I was certain were going to satisfy me: Robert Downey Jr. 's performance and the special effects. Granted they did not disappoint, however aside from that, I either accepted all other aspects or felt they were done in a messy fashion.The plot consists of a terrorist called the Mandarin threatening America's safety and teaching its president and people a lesson. After his friend Happy Hogan is put into a coma thanks to one of the Mandarin's attacks, Tony vows to strike back. But after an attack from his enemy leaves him homeless and weaponless, Tony must find a way to stop his foe's plans while reevaluating his troubled existence. Downey Jr. hits the ball park once again with his Stark character showing his usual playful charm, but also his vulnerability at times. The events that took place in The Avengers take a heavy toll on the character and RDJ plays it quite professionally. Other characters were sort of a bore to me with Pearce's Killian as an exception. The plot once again fails to make sense, making it more comparable with the second rather than the first. Overall the film entertains and the visuals combined with the leading man's appeal make for an enjoyable time, however when it comes to the story it doesn't come close to Marvel movies like the first Iron Man and The Avengers.Rating 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing Adventure,"In Malibu, California, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has insomnia and along 72 hours he develops the new prototype MK42 of the Iron Man armature. He also recalls events in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, when he had one night stand with the genetic scientist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) that was researching a regenerative process and made fun of his fan Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) on the New Year eve.There are explosions in Los Angeles and the terrorist Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) assumes the attempts broadcasting through television. When Tony's bodyguard and friend Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is seriously wounded in an explosion, Tony Stark challenges Mandarin and gives his address to him. However, three helicopters attack his mansion and he loses everything but his prototype, and he awakes in the Tennessee. Tony tries to make work the defective prototype and soon he discovers that the event from 1999 is connected to the present terrorist attacks.""Iron Man 3"" is a disappointing adventure with a silly and forgettable story.

Bigger and Badder,"There is a difference between Jon Favreau's Iron Man films and Shane Black's Iron Man 3. The last two Iron Man mostly studies the human complexity of Tony Stark which already makes a pretty compelling film even if it leaves the action as its extra pleasure. In this Iron Man, it is more into the large explosions which is totally right for its source material. In this film, you will find one of the best action sequences of the superhero movie milieu. The plot gets a little messy at times and the morality beneath it is quite obvious, but without a doubt, the film is excessively fun. It's not the best of the franchise but it's still one of its great films.It's bigger and louder compared to the last two. It tells a larger plot and deals with trickier villains for Tony Stark to play around. We can still root for their world's innovations and characters. The parts that are suppose to be deep are however sometimes contrived and obvious. But the film is thankful to have something to cover up some of its flaws, example is scattering the entire film with humor, and of course, explosions. It's all naturally fun mostly thanks to the cast. Robert Downey Jr. is still brilliant as Tony Stark and he explores more of the character. His backup are also as charming. For the villains, Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce take a little camp and they seem to enjoy it, but Pearce brings it to the table in the end.Shane Black takes the director's chair this time. He is known for Lethal Weapon and the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. He gives a brand new direction to the series. Unlike what the promotional posters and trailers have shown to us, the film is still not that dark toned but it has more serious threats. Black knows how to balance the serious and comedic moments. The first half though takes the roots of the original by showing Stark's imperfectness. The rest is simply an easy redemption. It's a clever move for a sequel that is suppose to be bigger than its predecessor. The action is thrilling as it is suppose to be. One of the film's memorable action is the scene(briefly shown in trailer) when Iron Man is trying to save a bunch of falling passengers from a plane. It is a sequence that is simply electrifying. This comment might sound like a hyperbole, but whatever, it is unobjectionably breathtaking. Then there's more at the climax where you'll get a taste of glorious explosions.Iron Man 3 tricks the audience for a deeper theme. That certain theme was solved way too easily in the end and the film rather focused on staying to the natural tone of the Avengers universe and that's fine. Besides, we're already done of seeing superheroes fall and being defeated throughout the film until the climax. The whole point is that great heroes become better heroes thanks to their weaknesses. The most noticeable thing you would spot here is when Iron Man's armor is keep crashing and falling apart and Tony's anxiety caused by what he did in The Avengers. It's comical but it's an interesting speculation. Many would still say the original is the best because it is indeed better in plot and character development, but for those who are seeking for better action will definitely love this as well. It is just way too fun. Iron Man 3 may not be the most compelling in subject but it's already a compelling experience you'll get in an action blockbuster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I do not understand how this script was OK'd by Marvel,"I would have gone into detail and actually clicked on spoiler but there is no need. Looks like at least 100 people did that already tonight. So I am just going to hit the high notes and the low notes and call it a night.The good It was an OK movie. Not great, not good. but I got to see explosions and hear one liners.Pretty good acting by the major players. Kingsly particularly was great with what they gave him.Stay for the ending credits for a small laughThe badThis script sucks They completely retcon'd a major villain and a major organization. Screwing them up for any future marvel movie. Seriously screwed the pooch on that.This was a Tony Stark story, not an Iron Man Story It appears that Tony must have got some shield training because now the rich guy that only knows how to blast people and tackle people acts more like a cross between Macguyver and Hawkeye then Iron Man.They screw up several major plot points from the first two movies such as why Tony has a superconductor in his chest to begin with and the weapon systems war-machine uses.Finally, Where the hell is Nick Fury. Iron man does not need to have Nick Fury in his movies. Except when that movie basically deals with domestic terrorism on a massive front. If you see this movie you will see a part specifically where iron man calls out a major bad guy in the press and says bring it on I will be here. In the marvel universe there is no way in hell something that public would not have shield all over it.

"Overall, Iron Man 3 will divide many avid comic book fans, but is still a fun, exciting, and damn entertaining conclusion to the trilogy.","Heres the story; playboy billionaire industrialist engineer Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is recovering from his battle in New York against aliens with the help of the Avengers, Marvels cannon of action-prone and muscle bound heroes. He's previously rebuilt his body after being held captive by Middle eastern extremists, in the process created a metal, enemy pulverizing suit, equipped with flying jets and energy blasters of course, defeated his crazy competitor, a vengeful, bird loving Russian, and now an alien race. Bottom line: the man's had his fair share of ass-kicking. This understandably, is beginning to effect him. He's having anxiety attacks and the fact that a supposed terrorist labeled the Mandarin is targeting civilians, and maybe even some friends of Mr. Stark, isn't helping. Sure enough as the story progresses, his pals, president, prodigy, love, and life are on the line. With out giving away many of the films twists and turns, Tony ends up somewhat back where he started and must find the tools to save his fate before time runs out and you know the story. Or do you...?The good: Iron Man 3's action sequences dazzle with ""Marvel-ous"" (sorry couldn't help myself) visual effects, but the real show stealer is the films extremely clever, frequently hilarious, and awesomely self aware humor. Shane Black peppers the script with so much chewable wit and varying, unexpected twists that you can't help yourself from having a great time amidst the violent chaos, even though some may find the jokes distracting. I beg to differ. RDJ owns the role and steals the show as Iron Man once more. Per usual, he adds in his perfect mixture of narcissistic snakiness with evolving dramatic struggles, but never takes it all to seriously. Not only does he do well, but the entire cast all are fairly strong and add their fair share of laughs, deliciously evil or humorously likable moments, and seem to be having a good time as well.The story is thick but presented in a well paced and orchestrated fashion and it strings together the explosions in a clean juxtaposition (oxymoron?) with it's reveals and character developments. The special effects are top notch and immerse the audience into the fast paced action sequences, and they also carry the torch on from The Amazing Spiderman in which the SFX are a slight notch more realistic and crisper than previous Marvel outings of the past 3 years. And now for the direction, while Shane Black doesn't completely steal the show visually, he sure as hell puts his personal stamp on the film, and I welcome it. He has taken the previous material and blended it with his different style and humor and created what I believe to be a more unique and quirkier superhero flick that delivers much of what it promises, but surprises as well in areas you wouldn't expect. Many die hard comic fans will be angered or even infuriated by the liberties Black takes with the source material, but again as a non-comic book reader, you won't hear any complaining from me. I love his ambition and some of the daring choices he makes along the journey. In conclusion I think that he has tied an equal parts goofy but still satisfying bow on the explosive trilogy, and has made me excited for more Marvel outings to come.As a side note, go into it with an open mind, stay after the credits, you won't be disappointed!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another Slap in the face for those who really care,"Movies: Some people love them and discuss them, some people just watch and care little about them. In the end this makes a huge difference to a movie review. Iron Man 3 is a movie for those who don't really care.If you love the character of Iron Man, other then being just something else to watch, there is little else to be found here. In many respects its like watching Star Wars: Episodes 1-3 or The Hobbit. It's dressed in a pretty package but there is no heart or longevity in the gift. The fact that the series may wrap up with this film leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, much like the disappointing The Dark Knight Rises. Also, a message for Disney: if you water down important adult story lines, in favor of the mass market, a little thing called originality and integrity is what will be lost in the long run.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An entertaining superhero film that surpassed its predecessors,"Iron Man 3 is a fast-paced, entertaining sci-fi action thriller that turned out better than its disappointing predecessor.This time around, there's no distracting Avengers subplot and the main focus goes to the main character instead. Once again, Robert Downey Jr. is at his best and fits his role perfectly as the arrogant, smart-ass Tony Stark by delivering sharp witty dialogue that make the film downright hilarious. Great round of applause for the people who's responsible for thinking up the various ways Tony can put on the suits in the film, well done!However, the film crossed the borderline of science fiction and science fantasy. There are things in the film that's simply could not happen in reality under any circumstances, which some movie-goers might find it hard to accept. As a person who knows the cartoon and comics, the direction the film took for the characters and the ""Extremis"" story arc is questionable. Some Marvel fans/purists will find it unacceptable, but for casual movie-goers, the plot is great and it's really a personal story about the titular hero.Iron Man 3 showed that it's not just a superhero film, but a smart comedy film as well. So, in the end, does the suit make the man or does the man make the suit? Well, you damn well know what the answer is after finish watching this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice movie. But could be better..,"In every movie, the Iron Man takes my breath away in his advancements of his suits, his weaponry, Jarvis (his A.I for his armour). But this movie makes all the others (yes.. including Avengers) look like a child's play. He upgrades the suit till Mark 42 which is like the coolest armour ever. His A.I, Jarvis also gets updated to a level that it can control the suits without any involvement of a man inside the armour. So, when it comes to the visual effects and action you get more than what you asked for.Now, coming to the story, it could have been better, especially with the Mandarin story. The twist was so lame. It seemed like they wrapped up the story too quickly and without any clear reason, tony stark simply throws his whole Iron Man life away. I know it has to end but it could have been handled better.Now, the cast. Robert Downey Jr is, as always charming and witty. His one liners have always impressed me and you could expect some of the best ones in this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce are okay. Ben Kingsley has a little role but he managed to throw a little humor in the story.Overall, this is a good movie and I will recommend this to every one.

Hopefully not Downey Jr's last.,"""Things are different now, I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you.""Since Shane Black has signed to do Iron Man 3 I have been so excited for this picture, and i was already excited enough for Marvel phase 2 after the Avengers. Teaming up once again in his second outing with his Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang lead, and it does not disappoint.A typical Super hero story, The international terrorist The Mandarin arrives on the scene and causes mayhem across the world, and may have help from some scientist acquaintances from Tony's past. For me Iron man's greatest strength is the casting of Robert Downey Jr. He encapsulates the character so well, the charisma,the humor, the ego so well. If this is to be his last appearance in a stand alone Iron Man. I for one can not think of anyone around at the moment who could take over the role,especially in the inevitable reboot of the franchise. Getting back to this film the cast of iron man has always been top notch with great support characters played by Don Cheadle, Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, and i could go on. This sequel hasn't gone down the usual route of recent sequels. Not going darker but keeping fun, not going bigger and louder (don't get me wrong there are some big action set pieces) but stripping Tony of the suit for large parts and focusing on the character. There is decent action to be seen, with the destruction of Tony Stark's home, for me being some of the best 5 minutes of intense action i have seen for quite some time. Also Iron man keeps it's good humor and puts in a decent amount of laughs.The ending of the movie is where i find some problems, as it quite predictable and never built any sense of dread, that the bad guys could win. The bad guys in this film The Mandarin, Aldrich Killian and there Extremis Super soldiers. Which are a major improvement on previous Iron man villains. Seem very intimidating and imposing, but the motivation for there crimes seems a little fuzzy.A good film by Shane Black in his first foray in to comic book/action, and if it is Downey Jr's last. It's not a bad way to bow out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tony Stark's beating heart is back,"The first Iron Man movie, five years ago, was an immediate blockbuster mainly due to the casting of Robert Downey Jr. The smooth-talking actor with all the irony he had to offer fitted the eccentric billionaire (and philanthropist) Tony Stark perfectly well. The sequel three years ago looked somewhat worse, but last summer in The Avengers, Downey Jr showed that he is still the most beloved superhero.In Iron Man 3, a well-aimed joke still manages to break the intense heat emitted from the various scenes. Thanks to director and screenwriter Shane Black, who has previously worked with Downey Jr in the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, there is a neat balance between action and humor, just like Iron Man from 2008. Although Black uses this technique way too often in the first half hour of the movie, making it look like the Lethal Weapon series, the sheer fun stays and more importantly it does not interfere with the primary plot.However, action is key throughout the movie. Now a topical issue, a series of bombings startle the American people (Boston is not one of the affected towns in the movie). The attacks are claimed by a terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Surprisingly enough, he has not been portrayed as a Chinese but rather a Bin Laden-type of guy naturally characterized by the beard.The Mandarin has been brought forward as a strong villain who simply wishes to teach the people of the United States a lesson. I am not really a fan of the comics, so purely looking at the Mandarin on the screen I can say that Ben Kingsley has done extremely well in his portrayal. After some tragic events (I don't want to spoil the entire movie for you), Iron Man literally invites the Mandarin to his residence in Malibu: the game is on.Noticeably, Gwyneth Paltrow who plays the lovely Pepper Potts has more action scenes than in the two previous movies together. I do like that. It brings more drama to the big screens and it also emphasizes the developing chemistry between Tony in person or suited-up and Pepper. Added to this triangle are new characters who make Iron Man 3 still original and suspenseful apart from the main storyline. This is not a dark brooding movie at all.In the end though, of course, everything and everyone is related in some way or another, but Iron Man 3 has got enough surprises and twists up its sleeve to make us forget about the classic Iron Man we once knew and the hero that he has become. The actors have performed beyond my expectations, especially the Mandarin who instantly gave me the creeps. The movie regularly refers to The Avengers, but even if you haven't seen that one you won't miss out on anything.Iron Man 3 is up until now the best movie from Marvel Studios. Surprising twists, humorous sneers and bombastic action scenes: Tony Stark's beating heart is back.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An amazing experience.,"I had the pleasure of watching the film premiere last night and it blew me away. The film delivers in both storyline, and visual effects. From start to finish you are thrown in to lots of action, twists and turns. This film will not disappoint all you hardcore Marvel/iron man fans.There are some big twists, which really make this film that bit more exciting. For me the most impressive part of the movie were the visual effects, which you would expect from such a film as this. They really push the boat out with huge explosions, gun fights and all the usual extras. I do believe this will be one of the biggest films to date. Definitely worth an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3 is not the best in the trilogy but is still an entertaining movie,"Iron Man 3 is, for me at least, one big letdown. It is not a bad movie but it certainly is not what you'd expect after The Avengers.Robert Downey's charismatic take on the character was the big reason of the success of the previous movies in the franchise and he still hasn't lost his charm. He delivers his lines as witty as he can but at one moment the jokes become one too many. The movie derails from what it should be and becomes a comedy. And not in the good way. Most of the jokes are out of place in moments which should be dramatic and thus the scenes cannot be taken seriously.Ben Kingsley is great but the weak script doesn't do any good to the main villain. And a superhero movie needs a good villain which Iron Man 3 hasn't.Don Cheadle's character is mismanaged and doesn't contribute to the plot or the movie in any way.One of the good things in Iron Man 3 is Tony and Pepper's relationship which is handled really well and the chemistry between the actors reflects on the screen.The ending is forced in a way but after all the film ends on a high note.It certainly could have been better but given as it is Iron Man 3 is a good continuation to the story of Tony Stark that leaves you with wanting more and we all know at some point Robert Downey we put on the suit again and maybe we'll get a movie on the level of the original.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful! They absolutely played this one just right.,"I love the fact that Marvel knew ""we can't go bigger than we've just gone."" Meaning that to try and follow Avengers with bigger wild action would have been futile. So, they went in a unique, deeper and more powerful direction. Sure there are stunning action sequences but everything is in context of a greater theme and the entire story. They absolutely played this one just right. They let The Avengers sit on its own and didn't do anything but feed off the momentum and actions of that film.Everything here is focused on Tony Stark and his immediate universe. Avengers 2 is the last thing on anyone's mind watching this and, as much as I loved Avengers, that's a good thing. Everything needs to kind of re-set and take a breath. This movie is NOT concerned with being connected to anything larger or having Nick Fury come in and solve or oversee anything. The events in The Avengers are addressed but only felt as to their effect on Tony's psyche. This movie is about Tony Stark's journey after we've seen him last. It really does perfectly explore his character and develops him deeper than we have seen since the first act of the very first film. It really is the perfect way to go and everything is exceptionally well done.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Decent, but it ain't no ""Iron Man"".","I am sure that ""Iron Man 3"" will make a ton of money and satisfy audiences. But, at the same time, it delivers something that is not the original ""Iron Man""‚Äîit's got more than the original and so much less. First the more‚Äîthe film has more stunts, more CGI, more action and more explosions than ever before in the series. If that is what you're looking for, then you'll no doubt be satisfied. As far as less goes, the film has much less in the way of plot, characters and, especially, fun. Now I am not saying it's a bad film‚Äîbut by this third film in the series (and the fourth appearance by Robert Downey Jr. as the lead) the formula is a bit faded. Good¬Ö.but faded.By this installment, like his comic book character, Tony is a serious screwball. He rarely sleeps and has significant problems with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. And, at times, he seems more machine than man. Not surprisingly, his personal life is a mess. At the same time, two threats are looming‚Äîone by a brilliant but morally suspect inventor (Guy Pearce) and another from a lunatic seemingly modeled after Osama Bin-Laden (Ben Kingsley). While the Pearce plot is much more important to the film, I really liked what they did with Kingsley, as this was an injection of humor‚Äîand the film needed all it could get. In fact, Kingsley's character and performance is my favorite thing about the movie. Now the cute is isn't bad, either, but he did seem a bit like a clich√©. The bottom line is that Tony needs to come, once again, to the aid of the world and in the process there are fifty bazillion stunts, explosions, MANY situations in which he could not possibly survive (yet he does¬Öwhich makes little sense) and a lot of 3-D. Now the 3-D portion bothered me, as it really wasn't necessary for the film and didn't enhance or detract from my viewing at all. If I had the choice, I'd probably see the normal version simply because it's cheaper.Oh, and by the way, where are the great AC/DC tunes? Instead, the soundtrack is okay but features songs by Dwight Yoakim. I am sure Yoakim is a nice guy¬Öbut he's not AC/DC. So, in summary, I wanted more humor, less explosions, more plot and more AC/DC. If we can't have that, perhaps this should be the last film in the series‚Äîand the end does hint that that COULD be the case¬Ö.maybe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stripped Down to His Core,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Iron man 3. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired April 14, 2013. It has a runtime of 2 hours 10 minutes. Iron man 3 was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed and created by Shane Black it was also created by Drew Pearce and was loosely based on the comic books by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby and the ""Extremis"" mini-series written by Warren Ellis and illustrated by Adi Granov.Summary: Tony Stark, faces a new threat in the form of a terrorist known as the Mandarin. Following the traumatic events of the alien invasion in New York, Stark is plagued by insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create numerous prototypes of his Iron Man suit.Review: -While watching, I was so captivated that I jumped in my seat during a couple of scenes. I appreciated the holiday themes woven throughout the movie, and I'm definitely planning to rewatch it around Christmas to get into the festive spirit next year. I feel like I timed my viewing perfectly for this movie, as it being just one month left until December. I found the humour to be a delightful counterbalance to the darker themes woven throughout the story. The clever dialogue and comedic moments inject a sense of levity into intense situations, making the narrative accessible and enjoyable for a wide audience. This combination of action and comedy is particularly commendable, as it maintains an engaging tone without diminishing the gravity of serious subjects. I was also captivated by the unexpected plot twists, which I believe will resonate with readers familiar with the comics, offering them a refreshing and innovative experience. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic, while others were less convincing. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue.I appreciated the film's cinematography effectively utilized various shot types to enhance storytelling. Wide shots established the scale of environments during action scenes, while close-ups captured characters' emotions, fostering audience connection. Medium shots balanced intimacy and context in dialogue, and tracking shots heightened urgency in fast-paced sequences. Aerial shots showcased Iron Man's flight abilities and provided broader battle perspectives. Over-the-Shoulder shots revealed character interactions, and Point-of-View (POV) shots immersed viewers in Tony Stark's experiences through his helmet interface. Finally, cutaway shots highlighted off-screen details relevant to the narrative. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.The seamless integration of CGI with live-action footage significantly enhanced the viewing experience, creating a more immersive environment. This technology enabled the creation of realistic and dynamic visuals that enriched the storytelling. The CGI effectively illustrated the advanced technology associated with Iron Man's character, making his suits appear both functional and visually striking. I admired the creativity involved in designing new Iron Man suits and the diverse ways they were employed throughout the film. The climactic battle scenes stood out as highlights, showcasing the cutting-edge CGI techniques. I feel that the film skilfully combined practical effects with digital enhancements to deliver a believable representation of Iron Man's capabilities. The use of motion capture technology contributed to more lifelike movements during action sequences, further increasing viewer engagement.-I was delighted to see the characters again, and it was refreshing to encounter some new faces as well. A scene featuring Harley in this movie reminded me of the Doctor Who episode from season five and The Adam Project, both of which I enjoyed. I appreciated Tony's character development in this film; it thoughtfully explored his psychological struggles following the events of ""The Avengers,"" particularly his anxiety and PTSD. This added a layer of realism to the superhero genre, illustrating that even heroes can confront personal challenges. The movie also examines themes of identity, focusing on how Tony defines himself beyond his Iron Man persona. It highlights vulnerability, demonstrating that true strength comes from within rather than relying solely on technology and his armor. I appreciated the portrayal of Pepper in this film, particularly her enhanced role in the storyline compared to previous instalments. Throughout the movie, her character experiences significant growth, showcasing her independence and skills beyond simply being Stark's love interest. It was refreshing to see women represented as multifaceted individuals with their own compelling story's.-I thought it was a wonderful touch to have a voiceover at the beginning of the movie and again at the very end. It created a cohesive narrative that beautifully tied everything together. The ending credits were particularly well done, and I appreciated the extra scene that followed them.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7.2 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Kicks Off With a Suitable Entry.,"In 2008, Iron Man ushered in a new era of superhero movies that would push the genre to unbelievable success over the next 5 years. Iron Man 2, although not as strong as the first, proved itself a worthy sequel on the road to The Avengers. Now with The Avengers all assembled, Iron Man 3 kicks off Marvel's second stage of their cinematic universe with a solid, but not amazing film, much like Iron Man 2 was to Iron Man 1.The first thing you notice in this movie is that it's moving in a different direction than the previous Iron Man films, and this is largely due to a new director at the helm. While Jon Favreau was in the chair for the first two movies, and continues is role as Happy Hogan, Shane Black was chosen to direct the third entry in the beloved Iron Man series. The movie takes a less grounded tone, and while many viewers will enjoy the direction that Black as taken the series, it's safe to say that a majority of the hardcore comic book reading audience will fail to enjoy the movie in the same way.Let's get the negatives out of the way. The number one problem with this movie, and the reason it could turn hardcore fans off, is the plot, or more specifically, the number of plot holes. There are a few of them, and they hit the film pretty hard. First off, while this is a stand alone Iron Man movie, the cloud of the Avengers was hanging over the movie's head the entire film. The main villain, The Mandarin (who I'll talk more about shortly), is a terrorist who is severely threatening America's national security. You'd think that maybe Captain America might be able to help out with this crisis because, I don't know, he has America in his name! And we know he exists in the same world as Iron Man, and his job is to protect the stars and stripes right? My point is that although this is an Iron Man movie, now that the Avengers has been released, I fear that all of the stand alone movies could suffer from the same question that this movie presents; where are the rest of the guys?Second, is the villain. When Ben Kingsley was announced to play Iron Man's greatest foe, I was pumped. The trailers looked awesome and in the first half of the movie, The Mandarin is a scary and fun antagonist. But this all changes with a plot twist that completely leaves your face buried in your hands. Following this twist, the movie just isn't the same, and it's hard to take seriously. There are other minor issues such as pacing inconsistencies, but nothing else deprives the film like the aforementioned twist. Besides the plot, the only other complaints I have is that there simply was not enough action from Iron Man himself and when there was, it was fast and minimal. Iron Man never gave that super bad ass vibe that he did in the first movie, but luckily was entertaining enough to prevent the entire film from nosediving.With that all being said, the movie had many positives going for it. The action was exciting and fun and the CG effects added to the action very nicely. Tony Stark deals with his inner demons following the events of The Avengers, and this is an interesting part of the film, one that forces Tony to change his character and have you rooting for him to ovecome. The comedy in Iron Man 3 is plentiful, almost too plentiful, but between the high-octane action and the comedic relief, there is never a dull moment (excluding the horrible twist).While the action is without a doubt the finest parts of the movie, it would be nothing without the actors behind those sequences. Robert Downey Jr. once again shows us that he is arguably the most entertaining actor to ever play a superhero on the big screen. Simply put, he steals the show once again. Whether he's cracking a joke, kicking major butt, or battling with his inner demons, Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. And surrounding him is a wonderful cast of supporting characters such as Iron Patriot (Don Cheadle), Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) to name a few. The acting is one of the best parts of the movie.To conclude, Iron Man 3 might not live up to Iron Man 1, but how many sequels do? Yes there are some huge plot holes but the seamless blend of entertaining action and comedy plus the fantastic acting save the movie from being a train wreck. Iron Man 3 is a solid and respectable entry in the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe and it is currently the 4th highest grossing movie of ALL-TIME. Casual superhero movie fans will probably enjoy more than others, but even for the hardcore, Iron Man 3 delivers an entertaining movie that I wouldn't skip out on.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3 is smart movie,"Warning: spoiler alerts:It was have been few months after The Avengers. New York City is once again saved. The hero himself has experience a lot hard times in his mind. He can't just quit and suddenly there is new terror. The mysteries leader named the Mandarin came to the town with his terrorist. The city needs once again Iron Man. But this even him can't to do nothing and he have to leave New York to create the plan to stop the MandarinRobert Downey Jr is always fantastic and Iron Man 3 offered more than action scenes. The script is not just full of the effects and the fighting. Like the first film, the hero is vulnerable and that is good thing.""Some call me a terrorist. I consider myself a teacher. America. Ready for another lesson?"" ‚Äì the MandarinBen Kingsley is bullseye for the movie. His performance was good and memorable. His voice created ""Darth Vader vibes"". Ben's performance radiate such a power that hopefully the audience remember his role. Even that the twist got ""huh?"" feelings but it definitely not made the role worse. Its just tell how smart the story is. I like that the villains are not one-dimensional the characters.Overall the cast is perfect as usually in Iron Man movies. Gwyneth Paltrow showed more than the skin. She did good job and the script offered more than scream and the hero saves in every scenes. She actually acted and was equal with Downey Jr and others. Example The Amazing Spider-Man crew should take advice that how can write good role for female. Don Cheadle's performance was smooth and perfect partner to Tony Stark. I would see him War Machine solo film.The special effects looked cool, realistic and the crew doesn't went to over-the-top. Only the final battle needed more imagination. But still the movie is smart and effects are better than in Man of Steel movie. Marvel Studio films are like one big movie. That' why we have to look these movies with a bigger scales. The first Iron Man saved Downey Jr career and he has taken recently many different roles. I think that this was his final Iron Man solo movie to him.Iron Man 3 is the perfect ending to the Iron Man trilogy. One of the best Marvel movies so far. Hollywood bosses should think more than twice that do they want continue with the character or bring new the characters to the big screens. I feel that Downey Jr will look another projects after The Avenger 3.

"Better than I expected, but worse than I'd hoped.","The first Iron Man movie changed the way comic book adaptions were made. It (for better or worse) began the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" that climaxed with The Avengers. This is the first marvel movie to be released after The Avengers, and in many ways it proves that the series is still going strong, however, it is far from perfect.ACTING: 8/10The acting from the main cast members is great. Robert Downey Jr. continues to be the perfect Iron Man, I just can't imagine a better suited actor. His comedic timing is perfect, and he allows Tony Stark to be lovable while being a total jerk. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle don't get a ton of screen time, however, they are wonderful when they do. Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, and Rebecca Hall are all fantastic and underused. The rest of the cast is perfectly adequate, however, there seems to be a theme of casting great talents and completely under using them.WRITING: 3/10This is the biggest failure of the movie. The comedy works well (partially thanks to Robert Downey Jr.) and the action scenes are good, however the plot hidden behind the popcorn fun is plain awful. I have never really liked movies that deal with ""super soldiers"" and ""protecting the president,"" and this movie deals with both badly. The technology written into the series continues to become more and more ridiculous. And the twist is both easy to predict and manages to reduce the main villains role to nothing. Finally, the scene after the credits is a bit of a let down as it gives no hint towards the direction of the series.DESIGN: 6/10The design is just as good as previous films in the series, which is to say that it fits somewhere between satisfactory and slightly above average. The tech looks great despite its lack of plausibility, and the wardrobe and sets fit the overall tone of the movie.EFFECTS: 10/10The CGI is near perfect in this film, and there is a ton of it. There are scenes where Iron Man's suit magnetically attaches to Tony in separate pieces and it looks totally convincing. The explosions and impossible technology looks great too.MUSIC: 4/10The soundtrack in this movie is awful. Hans Zimmer has inspired many with his booming and electronic score for Inception and the Batman franchise. This concept has been replicated a hundred times since those movies, and in lesser hands it is nothing but a loud mess. This is the case with Iron Man 3. The score is loud and booming, and completely forgettable, dull and repetitive.VERDICT:This movie is mindless, unimpressive, forgettable, action packed... and thoroughly enjoyable. It is a great summer blockbuster popcorn movie that will leave your mind as soon as you leave the theater. That being said, if you liked The Avengers and Iron Man 2, you will likely enjoy this movie as well. Overall, I give it a 6.2/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What did you expect?,"Brilliant special effects and action sequences.Robert DJ did his usual Tony Stark act of ego and arrogance and had enough one liners to make the audience chuckle enough Sir Ben should have had a bigger part but probably wasn't allowed as he'd have stolen Robby DJ's thunder and the movie is called Iron Man...Weak on plot but then so were Iron Man's 1 & 2.Highly entertaining, but if you want a deep and introspective look at modern day society or something vaguely realistic then probably not your cup of tea.

Not half as good as the last two.,"Just went to watch Iron Man 3...I gotta say, I am rather disappointed.I won't give away any of the plot (there isn't much of one), but overall, you're only likely to be satisfied if you're expecting mindless action and admittedly superb, stunning visual effects throughout. The 3- D is OK, but it's the type where not much seems to change (except you only seeing 40% of the usual photons you would). The score is typical of such films; as for the acting, Ben Kingsley is a great actor (as far as his role allows him to be), and the rest just about manage to keep up. I was mentally comparing Mandarin to Bane in that I expected him to be a great presence on screen, and a menacing, worthy opponent to Tony Stark. However, I was sorely disappointed. The main villain in the film has such a typical, immature backstory that I could have written a better one in my sleep. Literally. I can type with my eyes shut.RDJ does not disappoint, but once again, his full talent feels restrained in this one. The storyline is rambling and incoherent, and ultimately dissatisfactory.The movie itself is full of tropes and typical scenarios; the humour is not as genuine or natural as in the previous installments. I sincerely hope they do a better job on The Avengers 2.All in all, you're only likely to enjoy this motion picture if you thought The Avengers was a good movie. And if you're the type that can say ""The Avengers (the Marvel one) was a good movie!"" without being sarcastic, well, you'll like Iron Man 3 just fine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of Marvel's best SEQUELS! IGNORE the haters!,"I'm gonna be honest; I'm not a big fan of Marvel. I thought this was gonna be another action-devoured, hero-glorifying crap that Marvel usually does with many of their hero characters in movie sequels.However, when I found out Shane Black was directing this one, who by the way is a veteran filmmaker in the action genre (known for screen writing Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, etc.), I decided to give this one a chance.I must say that I was SO not disappointed! This movie beginning to end was exciting and engaging, with great pacing and everything a decent superhero story needs to keep smart audiences interested. Allow me to elaborate:Without any real spoilers, in this story, the machine-industrial billionaire Tony Stark is constantly faced with anxiety and mental distress as the result of his relentless work and constant political/terrorism-based issues that pose a threat to him and his girl (who we all know by now is who he cherishes the most). You can see the great character development as the plot continues to unfold how his arrogance and childish attitude in the past has affected others. Now, those sins have come back to haunt him, and he must deal with more than just The Mandarin. Away from home, with a nearly shattered Iron Man suit, and no signs of his wife, Tony must struggle against his own fears, uncover the mistakes of his past, and redeem his actions in order to be at rest again.A lot of times, directors of sequels face the issue of either copying the same style from the previous installment or trying something new. People would complain either way, but hear me out, do NOT listen to all these haters. Personally, I LOVED this new style of Iron Man. I totally digged the intense atmosphere and the beautifully epic music score by Brian Tyler, who is always one of my all-time favorite soundtrack composers.Acting is more or less the same level from the previous two. Robert Downey Jr. nails his role as the infamous Tony Stark. Ben Kingsley made a very dark, menacing Mandarin. Even Guy Pearce does a great job, as I could not recognize him at first glance.Cinematography and CG animations are on point, though some may argue it gets weak sometimes when it comes to the bad guys. Being an amateur filmmaker and editor myself, I can only imagine how many hours it must have taken to render scene where all the Iron Men arrive (no, if you saw the trailer already, that wasn't a REAL spoiler).So why are people hating this movie? It's simply different. We live in a world where the type of entertain Hollywood markets is not the same as the substance the original comics or works of literature may illustrate. However, even among those who haven't read the comics, the top two complaints I hear are: 1. There's too much action and nothing really new about the story. 2. Iron Man is not wearing the Iron Man suit enough.Are you kidding? The amount of action for this ACTION film was rational, and it kept the pacing better than the previous installments, not leaving much time in between for audiences to breath (which I guess can be considered a good or bad thing). Sure, it's not completely original story-wise, but since when has any superhero movie aside from Nolan's Dark Knight demand for ingeniously creative depth? And why would you want to see Stark constantly rely on the suit!? That would make him like every other of the crap movies Marvel came out with - superheroes that are perfect and always rely on their powers/abilities to solve everything.There's even a moral theme to this movie on how even the smallest mistakes/wrongdoings can create the biggest impact on one's life. In fact, as a human race, we naturally ""create our own monsters."" The very first scene of this movie established this theme and it was well-played out in supporting the villain's intentions and background.Movies that give me the worst impressions on Marvel include Captain America, Spider Man, Fantastic Four, etc. In those movies, the hero(es) always seem so perfect and good at heart, being misunderstood and mistreated but eventually recognized thanks to their new superpowers. Hollywood has murdered that clich√© concept. I'm sick of it.But thanks to this movie, Iron Man has shown that there's more to him than just being a hotshot billionaire who wears an powerful robot suit to battle. With a variety of creative action and intense scenes, he utilizes his mind, his integrity, and his struggles against internal anxiety. A man that makes mistakes, takes the pain he feels from the results of those mistakes and uses them to strengthen himself and defeat adversity. A character that shows vulnerability and relatable weaknesses in spite of their powers, how much wealth they possess, or how talented they are. A character that changes himself not to just ""save the world"" but to save the things in life that are truly important - love, happiness, people, moral wisdom, etc. THAT is what I call a true hero.Just avoid the haters and avoid having too much hype. As long as you don't go in with super high Oscar-winning expectations and treat it as a typical family movie, you will definitely enjoy it as a thrilling ride with a brilliant, yet simple plot. Till this day, Iron Man is still my favorite Marvel hero.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Huge improvement from the second film!,"For starters, tony starks character just keeps getting better. They really dive into his mental health in this movie, especially after the events of the first avengers. IT makes the situation more believable as there are real life repercussions of these incredibly epic wars that they have. It also makes him relatable to the viewers as we watch him change from being an egotistical idiot into someone that can easily be pointed out as good, although he does still make some major mistakes in the movie. The plot is great as well, with plenty of great turns and individual character arcs here and there. Its fast paced without disrupting the flow of the movie or being confusing. The villain was probably the weakest point in the film for me. To start he is very intimidating then a big twist happens and the character turns comedic, which works and did get a few laughs from me but felt...idk...a bit silly. Once the real villain is shown, a physical challenge is revealed for tony. His motivations area bit foggy, but I let it slide, he wants power, that's pretty much it.

...i choose to see this movie as being misunderstood by fans of the comic...,"i see all the fans of the iron-man comics are all heated up and gave this movie very lukewarm reviews and meanwhile most critics liked it. i think i know why...you see...once upon a time i was a huge fan of comic books and iron-man was one of my favorites. as i recall the main gripe i have and every comic fan out there is that they really did injustice to the main villain, if you've read the comic then you'll understand.even though i use to be a comic book fan, i am also a movie fan too! i see this movie in the same light that the critics do and i would actually give this movie an 8. you see, if you just ignore the huge change they made to the main villain compared to the comic, then the movie stands up very well on its own.come on people, how can you not like a movie with a cast including : will sadler, miguel ferrer, rebecca hall, guy pearce, robert downey jr,don cheadle and more and everybody looked like they were having fun doing this movie. besides that you also have a very strong message about private corporation sponsored custom made terrorists. that is a very real and scary threat, all you need is one big nut-job in a high position to do so.the special effects are worth a mention, they were spectacular and for people that said it was slow and not enough action, i say phooey, it had as much as the previous two and the pacing i felt was better also.the movie had a nice intelligent script and very competent actors and if you are a fan of twists in movies, this one has a few.so...all you iron-man comic book fans have to try to cool off and watch this movie and see and relate to it as a movie and then give your opinion. for me personally, this is the 4th time i've watched the movie and unlike the other comic book movies this one seems to get better with every viewing.if you were to leave the comic book fans out of the voting( there is a lot of them it seems ) and just leave it to the critics and fans of movies then this movie would at least be an 8 on IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Underrated,"After much thought, I think I love the Mandarin twist. Okay, maybe ""love"" is too strong a word, but I definitely respect it a lot. The execution could've been a lot better, but Ben Kingsley kills it as Trevor Slattery.Guy Pearce? Not so much. He's a pretty basic villain. I do however love his henchman, Savin.I like seeing Tony out of his armor for most of the movie and I also love how useless the Mark 42 is.

"From ""Rock Star"" to ""Rock Bottom""","Iron Man. The name itself evokes power, strength, patriarchal dominance and confidence. So why do the events of Iron Man 3 lack so much of the prowess and subtlety of its predecessors? Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) journey throughout the Iron Man franchise has taken its ups and downs, but none worse than the final chapter in this twisted metal of a franchise.Set after the events of the critically acclaimed blockbuster ""The Avengers"", Iron Man 3 takes the audience on a journey of pseudo redemption and self discovery. Take away everything that was given to you in Iron Man 1 and 2: all of the sleek sexy locations, the gadgets and tech of Stark Industries and what you have left is a bleak, boring Marvel wasteland.The performances by Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) are to be expected and their chemistry works well, what remains are characters that drop off into the background and annoying scenes of awkward dialogue forced with a strange undertone of the Christmas Season. Yes Christmas. I am not sure why the theme of Christmas was so prevalent throughout the film, even to a point where Stark uses Christmas decorations as grenades!Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) plays a stock standard, rich evil genius convincingly and Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the super villain The Mandarin ends up to be disappointing. Most deflating are the characters played by Don Cheadel (War Machine/James Rhodes) and Rebecca Hall (Maya Hansen), serving only to push the movie forward into obscurity.The redeeming features of this film lie in brief moments of comedic relief and some scenes of impressive computer generated imagery. Incorporated into the story is Stark's post New York stress, a direct result of the events that transpired in The Avengers film. This motif of acceptance and how Stark dealt with these events was very interesting, but were ultimately forgotten by the end credits.Skimming over hot topics of suicide bombings and the American involvement in the Middle East, Stark's humour and wit diffuse any chance of a meaningful message. With a rather annoying twist near the last act, the film shows its true colours. Suffering from the same writing woes as Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith, all the plot holes and character arch's are tied up in the closing minutes of the film. Directed by renowned screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) Iron Man 3 finishes this lackluster trilogy with a Stark attempt at trying something new.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just A Great Movie! Delivers Depth Of Emotion  And Tremendous Fun,"Yeah, he can still fly!!!!!! There's no doubt, IM3 is one of the better action/adventure movies in recent memory and certainly one of the better number three films in a franchise. This movie picks up from Avengers and shifts gears in such a great way. Its depth of emotion and character combined with tremendous fun means this could very well be the best solo character comic book movie ever produced. Yes, I know that's saying a lot these days in an era where hero films are all over the place and especially when multiple sequels often struggle. That's exactly why it's worth the effort to write this review. People need to know that they need not be afraid of the number three because this movie is superb in every way and tops even the original Iron Man. The finale here may be the best action scene of the year and the story points that lead to it are handled exquisitely. I'm so glad Marvel learned from the last two films in that regard. The ending battles in both Iron Man movies should have been longer. Here, the whole third act is intense and completely compelling without crossing in to video game action type territory.Overall, I simply adored everything about this movie. I did enjoy the original Iron Man a ton because it was refreshing and new. What's amazing is that they managed to almost re-invent the character here and deliver something fresh again. I honestly wasn't expecting that to be the case. I would have been happy with more of the same but this is actually better. Kudos to everyone who made this film for pulling that off.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It grew on me,"I was a little worried when going into this movie, as the third movie is rarely the best of a trilogy. And sure enough, I felt a little disappointed when I was done. And then I sat down to think about it. And the more I thought, the more I realized what a good movie I had just watched. I think what put me of at first was the lack of Iron Man, as in the suit. This movie is more about the character of Tony Stark dealing with his personal issues, and I think that was the right call. His character and his relationsship with Pepper is expanded on in a natural way, and his struggles feel realistic and like a logical progression for him as a character. The movie suffers a bit from a few unnecessary characters and scenes in the middle of the movie, and there are some other pacing issues, but for the most part, the movie is well-structured. It also has a villain with a pretty cool design, even if he is rather bland and boring as a character. The action is well made and has a decent amount of tension as well. This is definietly a step-up from Iron Man 2, and while it's not as good as Iron Man 1, it's definietly a fun time that I don't regret watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

And I can happily report that the Star Cineplex Hall No. 4 3D facility is just getting better and better (I guess they are bringing better tapes these days), speecially the sound effects from the ground demands a happy hi5.

If you love the comic books you'll probably hate this movie.,"Me, not a fan or follower of the comics, love the MCU. You may have seen reviews negatively discarding this movie. It's one of those movies where you either love it or hate it.Showing from my score I loved it, it takes more of a different turn than the first two with the story which is about Tony and developing him as a character.First of all, the writing great (what do expect from Shane Black). The witty dialogue and one liners had me gut busting with laughter. Even the twist that I'd hate to spoil is pretty funny to even be considered a comedy. Most of this is due to Robert Downey Jr. turning in another performance as Tony Stark, the likable a**hole. The supporting cast of Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, who is a good villain but just no Loki or Joker level.The action is well directed too, showing Tony can kick a** with or without a suit. There small shootouts and fistfights along with your big budget stuff you expect from Marvel include a very tense attack on Air Force One. The CGI is great too.People have been constantly been nitpicking at this movie, relax, it's not every movie where it is required to analyze every part of the plot and story. It's just a bit popcorn munching, summer blockbuster fun. Not f****ing Citizen Kane.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Most underrated MCU film?,"SYNOPSIS:
After the incident at New York, Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) I struggling with extreme anxiety. While trying to cope with that, there's been a string of random and strange explosions going on around America and so he sets out to discover the source.REVIEW:
This film is so underrated among the the MCU films. I know a lot of people who actually dislike this film a lot. I like this film a lot due to us seeing a very human side of Tony Stark that you can really sympathize with. I know that sounds strange being that he is one of the actual humans of The Avengers, but he has a much larger than life persona. We do have Elon Musk, but Stark seems even crazier than that. Where before he would act out of selfishness due to wanting the spotlight on him, you see him act out of selfishness due to mental stress and because he's tired. I see this as a point to sympathize cause we know what he went through in The Avengers and the anxiety attacks he has at the beginning of the film. At that point we go, ""oh so we can relate with him in some way."" Many of us could even empathize with certain things. Shane Black did a really good job with spreading the conflict all the way through the film and giving it more of an investigative feel.THE TWIST:
If you know my reviews, you know there are certain times where I have to dedicate one section to something specific in a film. I think the twist in the film is incredibly important, because I believe this is ultimately what makes or breaks the film for a lot of people. I thought it was great. Ben Kingsley was phenomenal and with this twist threw me for a loop. I understood certain people who were bad, but when that twist happened, it flipped everything and to me it excelled the film to a level it might not have gone to if they didn't have this twist.In the end, I can understand certain comic book heads who might've disliked the twist so I understand that. However, with the emotional aspect this film had, what it did for the Tony Stark character, how we got a bit more of Happy (Jon Favreau) and you can never have too much Favreau, then Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian with a fantastic performance, this film had so much going for it and for me that makes this the most underrated film of the MCU. 7.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Action, humor, stakes, flaws, and a whole lotta Downey & Kingsley & Pearce","Iron Man 'Three'. I want to write about this before the general thoughts: by now you may know the ""twist"", but why even say that? The entertainment comes from going in cold, after all, and it's the kind of thing that has drawn audiences down in a polar sort of way. You find out what is really going on with a character, and it... is hilarious. For me. It does something different, it alters the expectations that come with such a blockbuster that delivers the same-old same-old, and most of all, the filmmakers understand that they can make a point here too, as Iron Man did in 2008: a little statement about the world we're living in, in that case it was the militarization of the third world, and here it's media manipulation. It doesn't over-do it; and the actor's revelation is just splendid. I can see why it'd p-off some folks though, especially if you really really really wanted to see this particular character.This would be higher up on the list of Marvel movies in general, except for one really irksome character flaw at the end. What is an otherwise highly entertaining and smashingly-though-darkly absurd climactic battle on a bunch of naval ships, which is that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) decides to blow up his remaining suits. It seemed like such a needless act, even for the likes of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), especially as we in the audience know how many more times Stark will return in the suit in future films (whether it's *only* Avengers 2 or other films, it's not a question of if but how much).And yet, aside from this, it's a fun summer movie that takes some real chances ‚Äì Ben Kingsley, nuff said ‚Äì and always keeps its heart in the right place as Stark, who faces some big risks with the likes of the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian, doesn't stop for a sarcastic barb, a moment of self-conscious knowing, and Black as writer/director keeps the action, humor, thrills, and spectacle moving at an intelligent, coherent clip, not to mention Downey, who fills the role and conflicts of Stark with bravura as always. It was the only summer blockbuster I could stand seeing more than once (though I really tried for another HUGE spectacle, which we'll get to in a moment).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

""" Open the Closet and examine one of Twenty-five suits ""","The director of this film called: "" Iron Man 3 "" is Shane Black. Together with screen writer and Marvel comic Creator Stan Lee they surpass themselves. The movie proves to be an exciting, sky jaunting, world traveling explosion for the mind. The story continues the saga of handsome Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), who is a Billionaire and inventive genius. From the creative mind of Marvel comics, writer Stan Lee, comes this third segment of the Iron Man. In this chapter, we find Stark in a fitful state while his active mind is unable to allow his body to rest or sleep. As such he is ripe for an attack from his newest enemy called Mandarin ( Ben Kingsley) who promises to destroy Iron Man. The first attack is to Starks' Malibu home which Mandarin destroys with three guided missiles. Among all the things which Tony loses is his beautiful beach-side home, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his wealth which leaves him destitute and homeless. Crashing on the ground in the state of Tennesse, Stark realizes he must start again. He does this with the help of Jarvis, (Paul Bettany) his Robotic aid, Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) an orphan boy who inspires Tony to rebuild himself and James Rhodes (Dom Cheadle) who reprises his role as his Military friend. Together they take on the International criminal called Manderin (Ben Kingsley) and his major henchman called Aldrich Killian. (Guy Pearce). The movie is filled with high drama, Damsel rescues, Presidential protection, high flying chills and thrills and explosive combat displays. The reckless pursuit of action scenes is what drives this movie. The cast which included Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez is exceptional and lends itself to the complete foundation for a real exciting Classic. I fully recommend this movie to all movie fans and friends of Stan Lee. ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just what it has to be!,"The film has a perfect emotional balance, it never gets too sad or too comic. It keeps you on edge the whole time. Nevertheless, it has some deep insights and is concentrated more on the people and relationships than the others. It relies on epic fighting scenes that will keep your heart bumping and you will get goose bumps. More importantly, it is not the massiveness of the scenes themselves that makes them epic, but it is the choreography of the fighting.On the other hand, it deepens on the relationship of Tony and Pepper, which has escalated steadily throughout the series + the Avengers. Here it is elaborated on and expanded. Great!I gave it a 10/10 because it has everything a superhero movie has to have. Also, Tony finally meets an opponent that is very very strong.

"Not as good as the original, but close","Five years ago, Tony Stark hit the big screen in style. Smart, action packed, and brilliantly acted, Iron Man was the best Marvel Comics movie yet. But the follow up two years later was something of a disappointment. Iron Man 2 was by no means a bad movie, and it certainly had its moments, but it simply didn't capture the awesomeness of its predecessor. Now the third installment has remedied most of its flaws, delivering summer entertainment that's fully satisfying, if not quite equal to the first film.Iron Man 3 is not the kind of movie to waste much time on set up. From the get go it's clear that all is not well for Tony. He's got his suits and the woman he loves, his company is on stable footing, but there's a shadow looming over him. Because there's a new enemy striking at America from the shadows. A terrorist mastermind who can attack anywhere, anytime leaving no trace but broken bodies and smoldering wreckage. When challenged, he will stretch Tony to his very limits, taking everything that Iron Man can throw at him. And his name is Mandarin.This is what every fanboy has been waiting for. As great a villain as Obadiah Stane was, the first movie still left one question in the back of my mind; what about the Mandarin? Where is Iron Man's oldest and deadliest foe? This question became more pressing as Tony battled B-list villains like Whiplash and Justin Hammer during the second film. Well now the arch nemesis is here, along with AIM founder Aldrich Killian and a small army of super powered enforcers. And when we finally meet him, he's the absolute last thing you would expect. Purists will no doubt complain about how far the Mandarin has been taken from his source material, but I've got to say that the version they've come up with here is simply brilliant.The rest of the plot line is also excellent by summer blockbuster standards. Though it draws on key points from the recent Extremis, Haunted, and World's Most Wanted story arcs, the story here is completely new and rarely predicable, even to those who are well read in the comics. The villains' scheme is truly masterful, and there are some excellent twists and suitably shocking revelations towards the end.And of course there's plenty of action, and it rocks. By now we've seen that Tony can take on nearly anything in his armor, which is why the movie does the smart thing and forces him to go without for an extended period of time. With only bits and pieces of his tech to help him, the tension is greater and Tony has to rely more on his wit and skill than massive firepower. Of course there are some awesome action scenes when he is suited up, particularly the mid air rescue sequence. And the best has been saved for last in a massive free-for-all involving Tony, Rhodes, Pepper, and more than a dozen sets of armor against the Mandarin's forces.This is a very fun movie. Robert Downy junior is as awesome as ever, and he's been given a lot to work with. That's not to say that Iron Man 3 is perfect. I never really bought the whole panic attack thing, and I'm not sure the movie needed a pint sized sidekick, though I admit he did produce some good comic relief. And it just didn't feel quite as slick or as evenly paced as the original. But it comes very close, and it's definitely one of the better movies you'll see this summer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not up to the expectations,"I was waiting for this movie for a long time and also could not wait for the first day first show. Watched, enjoyed but not fully satisfied. Well, I must say I was expecting more. Though the first two movies were awesome, this one could not compete with the former. But if we are not going to compare this one with the other two parts (obviously our expectations are sky-high), it is quite a good movie, where I might have changed my rating from 7 to 8.

So, guys I suggest you to go for this movie, but try not to compare with the other two parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not good enough.","This threequel is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated cinematic events of 2013, what with The Avengers blowing everyone's mind last year. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that it doesn't live up to those lofty expectations, but it doesn't make it any less disappointing. Let me clarify straight away, IM3 is not a bad movie, it's still enjoyable and has patches of genuine awesomeness, but when judged within the recent Marvel canon, it sadly sits at the lower end of the scale.On board for the first time is writer-director Shane Black, and although he largely fails to improve on the last Iron Man outing, he certainly makes some daring choices. For starters the story goes much, much darker. This franchise has never shied away from tackling tough content - alcoholism, manufacturing weapons for war, daddy issues - but the PTSD-centric plot here is the most serious yet, occasionally to its own detriment. There's plenty of well-timed (and at times hilariously inappropriate) humour sprinkled throughout, but there's still a feeling that Marvel's trademark light touch is completely missing from Black's effort. He doesn't go full Nolan, but the tone is definitely in a different, and for me unwanted, ballpark to the original Iron Man.Being a superhero flick there are of course many action sequences and swathes of CGI coolness, both largely pulled off with aplomb despite a flawed employment of 3D. An opening scene featuring Tony fiddling around with a new suit has some startling subpar visual effects, however this is thankfully a standalone mistake in the CGI department with the remainder of the film boasting top notch computer trickery. The picture's first real set piece, the destruction of Tony's Malibu pad, is decent without being great, but by the time we've had a vertiginous attack on Air Force One and reached the climactic showdown boasting dozens of varying Iron Man suits, Black finally nails it.Also nailing it, Robert Downey Jr embodies the conflicted, haunted genius with such confident and charismatic ease he has now reached a point where he simply is Tony Stark. Alongside him in what is her biggest role in the series, Gwyenth Paltrow clearly relishes the opportunity to not only sink her teeth into a meatier Pepper arc, but to also get among the action - stealing the single most awesome moment in the movie in the process. Don Cheadle is solid as Stark's besty Col Rhodes, aka Iron Patriot, in an underwritten part, whilst Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce are on usual fine form as, respectively, the mysterious terrorist Mandarin and the megalomaniac scientist Aldrich Killian. Although it must be said that I found the Mandarin's character twist utterly stupid.This trilogy closer is a good movie, but by Marvel's standards, also not good enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron man 3,"In 2008, Iron Man ushered in a new era of superhero movies that would push the genre to unbelievable success over the next 5 years. Iron Man 2, although not as strong as the first, proved itself a worthy sequel on the road to The Avengers. Now with The Avengers all assembled, Iron Man 3 kicks off Marvel's second stage of their cinematic universe with a solid, but not amazing film, much like Iron Man 2 was to Iron Man 1. Let's get the negatives out of the way. The number one problem with this movie, and the reason it could turn hardcore fans off, is the plot, or more specifically, the number of plot holes. There are a few of them, and I'll skim through them quickly. First off, while this is a stand alone Iron Man movie, the cloud of the Avengers was hanging over the movies head the entire film. The main villain, The Mandarin (who I'll talk more about shortly) is a terrorist who is severely threatening America's national security. You'd think that maybe Captain America might be able to help out with this crisis because, I don't know, he has America in his name! And we know he exists in the same world as Iron Man,and his job is to protect the stars and stripes right? My point is that although this is an Iron Man movie, now that the Avengers has been released I fear that all of the stand alone movies could suffer from the same question that this movie has; where are the rest of the guys? Second, is the villain. When Ben Kingsley was announced to play Iron Man's greatest foe, I was pumped. The trailers looked awesome and in the first half of the movie, The Mandarin is a scary and fun bad guy. But this all changes with a plot twist that totally makes you do a face palm. Following this twist, the movie just isn't the same, and is hard to take seriously. There are other plot holes that I'll avoid talking about due to spoilers and length, but there are a few more. Besides the plot, the only other complaints I have is that there simply was not enough action from Iron Man himself and when there was, it was fast and minimal. Iron Man never gave off that super bad ass vibe that he did in the first movie, but still was awesome in his own way.Now, with that all being said the movie had many positives going for it. The action was exciting and fun and the CG effects added to the action very nicely. The comedy in Iron Man 3 is plentiful, and between the high-octane action and the comedic relief, there is never a dull moment (excluding the face palm moment). While the action makes up for possibly the best parts of the movie, it would be nothing without the actors behind those sequences. Robert Downey Jr. once again shows us that he is arguably the most entertaining actor to ever play a superhero on the big screen. Simply put, he steals the show once again. Whether he's cracking a joke, kicking major butt, or battling with his inner demons, Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. And surrounding him is a wonderful cast of supporting characters such as Iron Patriot (Don Cheadle), Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) to name a few. The acting is one of the best parts of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Non-stop action from start to end... And it was just brilliant...,"As I am not overly much fan of superheroes, then the ""Iron Man"" movies so far have been quite entertaining as it is not really a superhero as per se.This third installment of the ""Iron Man"" movies is fast paced and action packed right from the very beginning, and the movie just grips your with an iron fist, pardon the pun, and just never lets go. The movie explodes in a fast pace of action and adrenaline, and there never really is a dull moment throughout the entire movie.It was really nice to see the Tony Stark character evolving away from the stereotypical cocky playboy type that he was in the first two movies. Sure, that trait is still there, but it is more toned down now and giving way for a whole new aspect of the character. And Robert Downey Jr. does embrace this change quite well and bring is nicely to life on the screen. And these panic attacks that Stark were having were really a great touch to the character, given the aftermath of what happened in ""The Avengers"". Thumbs up for this path of developing the Stark character.The story in ""Iron Man 3"" is about a terrorist known only as The Mandarin who has an agenda against the Unites States of America, and when Stark openly challenges the terrorist before all the media, Stark finds himself in over his head as his world is literally brought down. Past opportunities have come back and are more potent and dangerous now, threatening to obliterate Stark and Iron Man all together.Storywise, the ""Iron Man 3"" is just as exciting as the first two movies. And the effects were off the charts, as they were in the previous movies as well. Everything here is really done so nicely, and I personally loved the variation of details and design we got to see on all the various versions of the Iron Man suits.The cast, as usual, did a great job, and Robert Downey Jr. did carry the movie once again.However, I didn't really care much for the villain and the powers that he had. I just had a hard time wrapping my head around how one would be able to superheat one's body to melt metal and cause no harm to the flesh of their own body. By altering the DNA codes apparently, as it was put in the movie. Sure, it looked cool and had some nice effects, but it was just a little bit too far fetched to buy into. And honestly, when Aldrich Killian (played by Guy Pearce) breathed fire, I was ready to get up and turn off the movie - it was just too much. Luckily I didn't, otherwise I would have missed out on one amazing action movie.""Iron Man 3"" is well worth a watch if you enjoy action and/or superhero movies. Lots of actions, great acting, good character development, cool special effects and witty humor from Stark.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated!,"I am a huge fan of the original Iron Man, and was extremely excited about going to see this film! But alas, I was also extremely let down when I did. And while Iron Man 3 was not all the way terrible, mostly due to Robert Downey Jr.'s usual stellar performance, it certainly wasn't good by any stretch of the imagination!This installment tries to match the humor and heart that made the original such a standout success, but fails miserably with lame jokes (that come way to frequently), and ""touching"" moments that just come off as halfhearted and insincere a midst the never ending barrage of pointless, over the top action scenes (yes, even for the genre).The antagonist(s) of the film were a major disappointment. Trying not to ruin anything, it seems as though the films creators tried to invent a ""new"" superpower for audiences that are becoming more and more inundated with superhero mythology, and while their goal was a commendable one, their execution was sorely lacking. These ""new"" powers, which served as more eye candy than anything, just make absolutely no rational sense whatsoever(again, yes, even for the genre), and in the end, destroyed the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" which keeps us engaged in a story.But, in my opinion, the ultimate failure of the film was the ""plot"", which comes completely unraveled, and devolves into an utter mess by the end of the film. While I have to begrudgingly admit that I did enjoy one of the more original aspects of the story, which again, I won't go into detail about as to not spoil anything for those still wanting to see it, in the end it just wasn't near enough to save what promised to be such a great film.The trailer for Iron Man 3 did indeed seem to promise a rise from the ashes which was the franchise's disappointing second installment, but once again it just served as yet another example of a Hollywood that's become more obsessed with marketing than making quality films. And while it's not at all surprising, I for one loath the fact that this, at best, mediocre film made the money that it did, as it will only serve to reaffirm the consensus in Hollywood that things like storytelling don't hold a candle next the sheer visceral experience of huge explosions and corny ""one liners"", especially when they're filmed in 3D!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
love this movie highly recommend,"It's always hard to see a movie with Robert Downey, Jr. and not find his sarcasm and personality incredibly charming. He really shows why he is one of the best on-screen superheroes today by showing that he can have good chemistry with everyone ... even a young child. This is a huge step-up from ""Iron Man 2,"" which failed in many different ways. It features a very promising villain that could also be the setup for future installments of - not only the ""Iron Man"" movies, but the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Made me want to watch Magnum P.I.,"I saw Iron Man 3 as part of the Iron Man Marathon. I have never been to a preview of this type of film where it got no applause at the end. The Star Trek preview did, The Thor preview did. The 1st 2 Iron Man movies did, as well as the Avengers movie...just not IM3. The was a bit of applause about 3 minutes before the end on behalf of a minor but beloved character...and the after-credit tag got some laughter.RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle & Paul Bettany were, as always, deft with the material given to them. The guest actors were fine. Major KUDOS to young Ty Simpkins...I know they can't really bring his character back, but I loved him and Stark together. (This is the edit: I think the kid and RDJ had a real chemistry together. This does not mean I necessarily approved of some of the ""just to prove a plot point"" aspects of the dialog or some of the illogics of the plot that happened during their scenes together.)I think Shane Black was a poor choice for director (and writer). I never got the feeling that he embraced that he was directing (and writing) Iron Man. It felt (ESPECIALLY the end credits) that he wanted to be directing his favorite cop show & this is what he could get. Some changes to the characters were made at the end which were both awful & rushed through.Am I glad I saw it on the big screen...sure. Am I glad I saw it as part of the marathon (and, btw, bravo to AMC Theatres for the way they organized and handled the marathon)...absolutely. But, if it were to be included in an upcoming marathon, I would probably go out to dinner during it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Here Begins The Post-Avengers!,"Iron Man 3 is the first Marvel film to be released since 2012's mega-hit, The Avengers. If this movie is any indication, I think we are off to a very good start. All things considered, this may be the best film in the Iron Man franchise to date. The story arc keeps getting better, especially when Tony Stark takes off with Nolan-esque emotions and of course, with the rather infamous twist that I happened to like. The CGI is the best of the series and that is evident in the action-packed scenes involving all the suits. I guess it's true that better technology means better effects.Shane Black, known for his extraordinary writing skills, directs the third installment in the Iron Man franchise. Several months after the events of The Avengers, Stark has not been himself as he suffers from post traumatic disorder. But he must get into gear quick as a terrorist organization known as 'The Mandarin"" begins to create havoc in the world.As always with the Iron Man films, the acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on as Tony Stark. Despite his depression at times, he manages to keep the clever wit that we all love. Gwyneth Paltrow has some shining moments as Pepper. Ben Kingsley makes a very fine addition to the cast as the Mandarin, and of course having talents like Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall helps as well. We also might have to keep an eye out on Ty Simpkins, the young boy that Stark grows pretty close to. He may be a star one day.Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed, character-driven film and it continues the success of above-average superhero films. Scores of people bash on the twist, but I think it was excellent and it added some light-heartiness to the movie. I liked the addition of a voice-over because it seems to have added more feeling to the movie. The CGI is excellent and those flying suits were a great achievement. Now with Iron Man 3 behind us, I'm eagerly awaiting the next Marvel installment. I rate this movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great fun and a compelling Tony Stark,"Back in 1999, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meets up with Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) who is working on her bio project. It would simply be an one night stand and he would also blow off Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). The two of them would come back to cause trouble in the present. In the present, Stark is haunted by the battle of NY and is suffering sleepless nights and panic attacks. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is now CEO. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle)'s suit has been renamed Iron Patriot. And there is a new terror menace named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley).I love the fact that Stark is suffering from the battle of NY. The sarcastic humor is funnier than ever. In this one, Stark even picks up a funny boy sidekick. His character is deeper than ever. If there is one problem with the movie, Stark is too often without his suits. It makes the ending less reasonable. But the ending is chalk full of explosive fun, and I'm willing to ignore any minor problems.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Despite following the super-hero formula, this was a great movie.","I can't say I am a huge fan of super hero movies and I watched Iron Man 3 thinking it might be a waste of time. In my opinion the Marvel movies are predictable, lean too heavy on special effects and are not relevant to everyday people. Despite all this, I completely enjoyed the film. Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect Iron Man and I hope Marvel never does a reboot with a different actor. I liked his weakness in the movie. I don't think people understand how difficult living with anxiety attacks is. I think Robert Downey Jr. portrayed that well in the film. Also, I loved the villains. The twist with The Mandarin character was quite amusing. Guy Pearce's Killian characters was also well done. I am happy Guy Pearce had the chance to showcase his talents in a major film. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This film's success made it one of the finest trilogy among the others.,"It's weird, the movie starts without the opening credits. Soon it begins you will forget everything but the only focus on the movie and the story. Like other two 'Iron Man' I liked this third movie as well but this movie was a little lacked in high-octane action stunts. But still no short for an entertainment.'Iron Man 3' one of a most anticipated movie of the year. I still don't understand this movie and 'Avenvegers' are connected or separate stream stories because Tony behaves like there's one like he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. Anyway this movie was a bit more dramatised than stunts, it tells his earlier time mistake which creates a deadly enemy for the present. I always wondered such a good actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, appearances in earlier two movies were so wasted. At least she gets some improvise role here, maybe we can expect more from her in the next movie in the series I guess.I totally loved the Ben Kingley's cameo though I easily guessed the twist on his role. More or less this movie's success made 'Iron Man' trilogy to one of a fine trilogy ever. A good movie to watch once, especially if you ever liked 'Iron Man' duology or any other sci-fi- action movies.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most underrated Iron Man movie,"It's an Iron Man different from other marvel movies, but it's more like Nolan Dark Night Batman",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Improvement Over the Previous Entry,"Film-wise, 2008 will be remembered as the year of The Dark Knight. The movie that made critics and audiences alike go wild. But about two months before the Caped Crusader swept the Box Office, came the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Iron Man. A movie that also got good reaction from critics and made over 500 million at the Box Office. The movie had humor, a good villain and a charismatic lead in Robert Downey Jr. who was great at being a less than heroic super hero.The movie also planted the seed for the Avengers and Tony Stark had a cameo in Hulk just a month later. But then the sequel. That was a really big miss. Trying too hard with the humor and failing while also spending too much time trying to set up the Avengers. It was a big disappointment after an enjoyable first movie. However this was all forgiven and forgotten after 2012 saw a very entertaining Avengers adaptation.Now comes Iron Man 3. While 2008 was the year that Downey Jr. became mainstream again with Tropic Thunder and Iron Man, he had been lead in some good smaller films like Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang directed by Shane Black whom he is now reunited with as Black takers over directing duties from Jon Favreau. The former director is Executive Producer this time but stays on camera as Happy Hogan.The movie tries to do more with the character. Something that had not been done in the previous two. This time we see Stark struggling with anxiety which was a great touch. The talent of Downey Jr. is remarkable as he goes from light-hearted wit-master to serious in a matter of seconds and it does not come off as one bit phony. Quite the contrary it seems very genuine. Below all the humor is a real person with real problems.While that was a nice exploration of the character, other things in the movie were not as well done. There was waste of talented actors, the action scenes while providing us with some good visuals, were not as good as the first Iron Man, the plot was not as compelling outside of Tony Stark and there were some shocking deviations from the source material. Not just artistic license but major deviations.The pacing of the movie was also shockingly slow considering that something was always happening. Every scene had something and still, the two hours felt like two hours.All in all, this was a great improvement over the previous entry but that is not saying much. The exploring of the character was nice and this is an Iron Man movie. Not a set up, but an Iron Man movie. My disappointment is with the waste of other actors, the action and some script decisions but it's an inoffensive movie. The audience seems to be liking it but if you are expecting to go to the theater and cheer, clap and laugh hysterically like last year with the Avengers, you will be surprised. Perhaps pleasantly if you like characterization, perhaps unpleasantly if you don't like change.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Inside of the Man in the Metal Suit,"Cast: Robert Downey Jr. , Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, Don CheadleDirector: Shane BlackSynopsis: Robert Downey Jr reprises his role as the ""Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist"" industrialist Tony Stark in this third installment of Marvel's Iron Man films, the seventh movie set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After the ""Battle of New York"" in The Avengers(2012), Tony finds himself experiencing the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, while a new villain, the Mandarin (played by Sir Ben Kingsley) terrorizes the entire United States with mysterious explosions. Tony gets pulled into all this as his own life is threatened by the Mandarin, and embarks upon a journey that makes him realize his true priorities.Review: Marvel Studios brings to us another humour-packed, superhero action movie, this time directed by Shane Black, where the audiences get to experience another adventure of inarguably the most admired hero in the MCU.The movie is set 6 months after the battle of New York in The Avengers, and Tony has pretty much adapted to the changes that have taken place in his life, or at least he thinks he has. He has been affected by the events of The Avengers much more than he has realized. He has taken to his ""hobby"" of designing and building his Iron Man suits of armour pretty seriously, so much so that his relationship with his love interest Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is strained by the amount of time he spends in his workshop tinkering with his machines. To add to his troubles, a terrorist who calls himself the Mandarin has scared the entire US by mysterious explosions all across the nation, leaving no traces or clues behind for the intelligence agencies. Tony gets unwillingly pulled into this series of events full of twists and turns as things get ""personal"" between the Mandarin and himself. During his pursuit of the Mandarin, Tony realizes what his heart actually holds dearest and what his priorities are.Robert Downey Jr proves yet again why he is regarded as the ""face"" of Marvel's Cinematic Universe franchise. With his witty one-liners, his sarcasm and his fluency with even some of the very technical terminology, it's almost impossible to find any flaws in his portrayal of the egoistic yet likable industrialist-cum-inventor. His timing and dialogue-delivery have been excellent as always.Gwyneth Paltrow plays the beautiful Pepper Potts for the fourth time and she gives us no reason whatsoever to question the choice of the studios in casting her for the role five years ago. From managing the Stark Industries to standing by Tony's side as he struggles with the changes taking place around him and villains that threaten their lives, she is a complete package.Don Cheadle plays Col. James Rhodes/Iron Patriot (the re-branding of the previously called War Machine), while Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan. Both these actors have done justice to their respective roles by supporting the storyline.We also see a few new characters like Maya Hansen (Tony's ex-girlfriend) played by Rebecca Hall, Aldrich Killian ‚Äì a forgotten face from Tony's past played by Guy Pearce, and the new villain - the Mandarin played by the brilliant Sir Ben Kingsley. While they all have been great in their respective roles, we would have liked to see a talented actor like Rebecca Hall as a more significant character in the movie.The storyline has been a tad different from the earlier Iron Man movies, with lots of twists and turns, and much more emphasis on Tony Stark's out-of-the-armour character. The movie has just a bit too much humour in it which at some points takes the mood of an action movie away, but it is more than made up for by the exciting climax of the movie. A refreshing change was to see Tony team up with the kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), an innovative move by the writers and the director which certainly paid off by keeping the audiences engaged when the movie would have strayed off from its theme uninterestingly.The background score is one of the best aspects as it remains in your mind hours after you have left the cinema. There are no complaints with the special effects department, which you would expect from a Marvel movie.The movie opens with Tony voicing the words ""We create our own demons..."" and the story progresses as not just another superhero adventure, but with the larger theme ‚Äì how each one of us can fight the demons that reside within ourselves and become what we really want to be.In a nutshell, a great watch for superhero-movie fans and a treat for the followers of the MCU.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Great technology imagination, awesome special effects and cool acting","Human beings have always tried to see beyond the future. We extend our imagination beyond our limits. And when any movie offers a visual treat showing some of the best science fiction stuff, we just love to enjoy watching it. Isn't it? Iron Man 3 offers just the same. After Avengers thrilled our eyes, Iron Man 3 gives us a fabulous treat by taking the Iron man technology to the next level. Frankly, Iron man 2 didn't offer much of the variety in terms of entertainment. It felt like just continuation of Iron Man 1. But Iron Man 3 takes the suit to the next level and gives a completely different entertainment factor. Movie starts with glimpses of Stark's past that would establish its connection with the main story. Main story starts with the terror threats and series of bomb explosions executed by a terrorist named 'Mandarin'. Story also introduces in parallel a scientist working on human DNA upgrading. Tony is developing new versions of his Iron Man suit. Soon circumstances project Stark as a rival of Mandarin. Movie offers many unexpected turn of events and some eye-catching visual effects as it progresses. Some of the scenes like demolition of Stark's home, Stark rescuing people from plane crash and fight of Iron men army are unforgettable. RDJ is awesome as usual. It feels like he is not acting but he is Iron man himself. Among others, Sir Ben Kingsley gives a fantastic appearance. Though the role is short, it offers lots of shades in his characters. In all I would say, this is a must watch movie for fabulous special effects, awesomely eccentric RDJ, good story and a nice climax. Don't miss this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The worst and least faithful in the saga! 7,25","I am a great fan of comics, specially of those about superheroes. Ironman is not my favourite because my favourite are Spider-Man, Batman, Superman and Daredevil, but I love Ironman and its comics anyway. He is one of my favorite in the Avengers. I read lots of comics from Ironman series. Both ""Ironman"" and ""Ironman 2"" are fantastic, like the comic-books, but this one is a bit disappointing. It is not bad at all, but not at the height of the original comicbooks. I think it is the worst in the Avengers whole saga and the least faithful. The other movies from the Avengers are, more or less, of the same quality of their respectiveI comics. The pace is excellent. I was not bored at all. The lenght is almost perfect. The director did a very good job in directing the movie. He combined good action with lots of humour and good locations, like Miami and L.A. He has known how to deal with Hollywood's stars such as Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, etc.The action scenes are great. It uses a lot of CGI but in a justified way (many shoots, explosions, punches and so on). The scenes in which Stark's house is destroyed is spectacular.The cast is amazing and the performances, too. I love how Robert Downey Jr.portrays Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow is very good as Pepper Potts or Stark's girlfriend. Guy Pearce (another fantastic actor with an excellent career) plays the part of the main villain in a very good way. Ben Kingsley is very good as the Mandarin (the problem is that this Mandarin has different roles and personalities than in the comicbooks, which is the most disappointing thing in the whole Avengers' saga). Rebecca Hall does a decent job, as well. I must not forget Don Cheadle as James Rhodes and War Machine (Stark's best friend and another superhero). The main error in this movie is a twist in which we Ironman's fans find out that the Mandarin has different roles and personality than in the comic-books. I will not explain here what I exactly mean. I understand that one or more comics of Ironman have been published since the sixties and to addapt all that into several movies is not easy and makes us modify things, but not the essence.Another important defect is that Ironman appears for just a little time as Ironman itself. I like Tony a lot, but I like Ironman in his armor even more... Some jokes may be a little repetitive, but they are nearly all very funny. Also, I missed some darkness. We cannot say that this movie is similar to ""Batman: the dark knight rises"". This is nor good neither bad, it is just that they are two different superheroes (personally, I prefer Batman, its comics and its trilogy, but love both of them). The best things in the movie are the things already explained: length, pace, the visual part, scenography, performances, cast, Guy Pearce, Roberto Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, the pace, the armors, the characters, etc. In conclusion, the real fans of Ironman will be a little disappointed, specially for what they did with the Mandarin, but I cannot say the movie is bad, simply it is not a that good adaptation. 7,25.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"While the deeper dive into Tony Stark and his past is welcomed, the execution came up a little short compared to Iron Man's MCU entries.","Iron Man 3 might be my least favorite of the Iron Man franchise, but it's still a great movie. Iron Man 3 focuses much more on Tony Stark and his trauma following The Avengers rather than on Iron Man and the suit. A large portion of the film and even some action scenes explore who Stark is without the high-tech suit or fancy technology in general. Stark grapples with the fallout of past decisions and has to decide who he is at his core without the money or Iron Man. As expected the entire cast dazzles in their performances from Robert Downey Jr. To Don Cheadle to Gwyneth Paltrow, but the true standout is Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. Iron Man 3 is all about Stark's growth and development, and while that's a great idea, its poor villain and lack of actual Iron Man leave the film feeling a little hollow.

Comic-book cinema how it should be: fun!,"So often, the third movie in a blockbuster series such as this proves to be a disappointment, but I found Iron Man 3 to be just as entertaining as the previous two films, if not more so. It's full on entertainment, pure and simple, packed with stunning effects laden set-pieces, loaded with great performances from a cast who know not to take matters too seriously, and bristling with snappy dialogue.Most importantly, perhaps, it's laugh out loud funny, which, in turn, means it's a lot more fun overall than many a recent superhero movie. I came out of this one feeling like I had seen a real comic-book brought to life rather than something masquerading as meaningful and thought provoking (The Dark Knight trilogy, I'm talking about you!). The film's light-hearted moments also make it much easier to accept the more outlandish sequences, which is a good job because the mayhem here is turned up to eleven, with more crash, bang and wallop for your money than ever before.I do, however, have one gripe with part three: the ending suggests that they might not be making a part four. As far as I am concerned, they could keep on making Iron Man movies indefinitely just so long as they are as enjoyable as this one.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More Iron Man Please,"Most movie franchises are born from a great blockbuster of a first installment and then equally or more expensive sequels that draw people to the box office. It's upon the movie staff and execs to put together a cohesive story in order to ensure the survival of that franchise. Iron Man is no different.Marvel can practically mint money right now with their various exploits. That being said, Iron Man 3 did not wow me like I wanted. Iron Man 3 had the great fortune of following up a lackluster part 2 but the misfortune of following up the first Iron Man.The story was OK. It was actually too much to it. Sometimes, in an effort to break from the herd, many movies will convolute a plot to make it better when that only makes it worse. Many comic book nemeses are born from tragedy and pain that is universally understood and then others are born from simple slights (real or not). The nemesis in this movie was from the latter type. The contrived, shallow and very uninteresting latter type. That's not enough to ruin a movie, but it is certainly enough to hamper it.There was a lot I liked and yet a lot I didn't like, but in the end there wasn't enough Iron Man.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining blockbuster with good mix of dark edge, comedy and action","The superhero blockbuster is a very crowded field and generally one that I now avoid in the cinemas as too often they are not good enough to justify the effort; on DVD at home though, expectations are lower and perhaps they work better even though you lose something of the big screen experience. The Marvel films generally have been the better ones in terms of producing an engaging spectacle which thrills while it makes you laugh and generally encourages you to go along with the plot even though it is very much the stuff of fantasy. If it sounds and looks easy then one just needs to look at the many lesser films that are just a mess of CGI and emptiness.This film sees Stark shut off and struggling with the mental fall-out of The Avengers film and at the same time a terrorist known as The Mandarin is staging attacks globally, building his threats directly at the US President. The plot here is quite a balancing act but it is one that it mostly pulls off. It needs there to be darker moments but for the comedy to still work; it needs there to be a serious ""real world consequences"" plot but for it to still work within the world of fantasy characters. It gets this balance mostly right and I found the film to have a good dark edge to it while ultimately still being funny and having an entertaining flow to it. Some inclusions don't work and the villains do feel like a bit of X-files at work, but in terms of providing action, thrills and entertainment, it does a very good job.The cast do well but of course the film is Downey Jr's and he does it well despite having more to deliver. His conflicting comedy arrogance and haunted-psyche works pretty, mostly because of his presence and delivery. Paltrow is so-so and she doesn't have many times to mix chemistry with the star. Pearce is OK but not given enough time to justify his character but Kingsley is fun in all the different ways he is asked to deliver! Hall, Cheadle, Dale, Sadler and Favreau all give good support but the latter does feel a bit unnecessary.It is still a summer blockbuster, so your sights should be set accordingly, but it is a good one in that it delivers robust entertainment across the board with a nicely dark tone complimenting effects, action sequences and comedy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More like over the top!,"Or OTT as some like to say/write. And it definitely is. This is supposed to be a fun summer movie. That is a concept you have to get your head around. Another one is, that Shane Black is back. And I'm thankful for that. I was so excited after ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", but unfortunately it wasn't a commercial success. And though he has proved that he has talent (in writing and also in directing, see his biography), it seemed like Hollywood was done with him.Fortunately Robert Downey Jr. comes along and with the power he now has, can say: I want him as director. Not sure if it happened exactly like that, but whatever the circumstances, I'm glad he is able to do projects now with the Iron Man 3 success backing him up. As for Downey Jr. he seems to be bargaining for a new deal as Mr. Tony Stark. And he probably will get what he wants. Good for him.But what about the movie itself? The action is amazing (budget wise you couldn't expect anything less), but there is also a lot of wit in it. The script oozes with clever remarks and great quotes! Trademark Black! There is also clever hints and word plays (concerning the last events of the Avengers that is) and Tony Stark does have another evolution to go through. Great casting and especially great idea with Sir Ben Kingsley. Another ""Black-ish"" element that is added to the mix. Though I have to admit, I'm not familiar with the characters of the comic itself, I know this movie did what it was supposed to do ... and then some! Let it entertain you!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exceptionally well done and fun the entire time.,"I'll try to keep this brief because there are a lot of things I can say about the movie. First off, it's not like the comics. That's fine, it's not the comics. It takes ideas and themes from comics and makes it into something new. That's not a problem, it's just something new. If you had a problem with the spider in SpiderMan being genetically altered instead of radioactive, this is not the movie for you. The only complaint I can actually manage to form is that Tony Stark seems to have an issue with anxiety throughout most of the film and then it ends up going away because he begins tinkering around, even though he has been tinkering around the entire film. I'm not sure if it even goes away, because he seems to have no problem when faced with a real threat, only when he is out in public with no imminent danger.Graphics are amazing as always, I had some issues with the 3D being out of focus sometimes in the corner but I'm assuming it was a projector problem. Story line was easy to follow along with and I personally think well managed. It's very eventful and I can't really recall a moment that was boring. RDJ really does make the movie though and does an amazing job of keeping every scene lively and entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is an AMAZING MOVIE!,"Ironman 3 was a cinematic experience. So many people bash this movie because they didn't accurately represent the Mandarin character like in the comics! The hate is absolutely ridiculous! This movie has a great script, witty dialog, breathtaking action, an amazing story and dives deep into the Tony Stark character. Ironman 3 is a very Tony Stark driven movie. It brings back some of the magic from Ironman 1. The movie shows Tony's intellect and how smart he really is. It shows that he's not just a man in the suit, but a great intelligent person. The movie still has all the great action that you come to expect in an Ironman movie, but still takes time to develop a great story and characters. The twist with the mandarin was brilliant and I didn't see it coming. Many people hate on the movie for this, but I found it very funny and clever. It was a very ballsy move by marvel, but paid off in the end. The movie also does an okay Job of blending dark themes and the humor together. I will admit not all the humor land with you, but works for 90% of the time. In the end had so much fun with iron man 3, it wasn't as good as the first, but was still a worthy sequel",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Oye!  What happened?,"Just saw Iron Man 3 . . . what a snore fest . . . Iron Man 2 and even 1 is better. From the director the brought us 'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang!' - what you have never heard of it? No worries hardly no one has. While 'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang!' is in itself a great art-house movie, why in the world would they give such an important franchise into the hands of a novice in the action/adventure flick? Oye! Would have rather have the John Favalora directing rather than Shane Black . . . he is a better writer than a director. And if it was not for the cinematography of John Toll the movie would have been flat. If it was not for the saving grace of cinematography the movie would not have as successful. So why is the movie make insanely large amount of money at the box office, not to mention all of the DVD, Blu Ray, toys, Video Games and merchandising and licensing.

Prototype Failure: Iron Mark III,"There i am on the seat in positive mind ready for the iron man's ""toughest battle"". The movie starts,the plot is being arranged..the characters are being introduced, and i am totally in the mood. I have the entire cinematic history of Iron man in my mind ready for reference,in case some deep connection to previous movie is implied very subtly worrying i might miss it.The movie is on, the pace is slow, i am busy justifying myself, making plausible connections. An occasional eye catching action sequence makes my palms meet in a clap. But there's some humming noise of misconnection coming from my subconscious, its been past interval and i seem to spend more time shaking it off, as the quantum of solace starts to pile on. And just like some iron man prototype suit, the movie rises, exhausting too much in bursts in short time and makes that sad projectile dive, not so far from where it launched.The movie just did not feel to be happening in marvel's world whatsoever,its so disconnected. Marvel might just feel it a little harsh the way i am putting it,but they had it coming from a fan.They had made a perfect trailer, they had the success of avengers behind them, and of course, there was this new awesomeness in iron man since avengers,a little different that the first two episodes in the franchise. With expectations rocketing skywards, the movie looked deflected from the projected path. A very important part of making a sequel is you adhere to what you declare earlier. They seem to just have forgotten, the way they built iron man's world in avengers and taken a new route altogether. Whatever connections shown to the avengers seemed more like afterthoughts.Looked Like the makers were there with some action scenes in mind(they were very good, no doubt) and the producers pressurizing them to release the movie NOW, when the iron is hot. It comes out as a skeleton with very strong bones articulated by weak joints(""storyline""). Well needless to say, it succeeded in generating some joint pains in the pro movie-goers. The usual iron mannish comedy is good and equispaced but hurtfully misfit in the end sequence. I cant convey it without spoilers.So, i hope you feel it. Some mention-able aspects are 1.the array of new Iron Man Suits 2.Pepper pots in action mode and 3.As always, some new futuristic technology and devices...Acting wise, i don't find any flaws, the actors were up to the mark. What can i say about Robert Downey. I think Shane Black's role when Downey is giving the shot, is to yell action and stay put. The very little things he does puts immense personality to the character he plays. Man i would love to see him behind the camera someday. The outcome would be truly enjoyable. Ben Kingsley is a surprise package in tho movie and has exceeded high expectations in his role. Enough said, these two have left the rest of the cast at some far away milestone.In the making department,even though considering Shane Black is only one movie old, when at stake is iron man 3, he cannot be shown mercy.It seemed like he had his hands full, and the story unknowingly leaked from his fingers.The 3D was non mention-able, so much so, i would not have noticed save for one scene. You would know which one when u see it.All in all a good action movie. Fans, i know we cant just stay put when its out.

Iron Man 3,"I'm just going to go ahead and say it, Iron Man 3 really isn't a bad movie! Shane Black has a good reputation as an action director, that knows how to intercut action into a story, and stretch that PG-13 rating for good measures, so I was excited to see what he can do in the MCU. Having worked with Robert Downey Jr. before, they seemed to work together just as good, if not, better than RDJ & Jon Favreau. With such a great understanding of the MCU, and the help from a fantastic creative team, Shane Black and the crew lead this film to be one of the better films of the MCU.Iron Man 3 sets itself as a good stand-alone film, but doesn't really compliment the saga all that well, besides following the events of The Avengers, and the crisp character development we get from our three leads in RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Don Cheadle. Shane Black set up some nice tones throughout the film that worked well off eachother. On the down side, there was a little too much going on, and the way scenes were set, was a little strange, and underdeveloped.At this point, RDJ trademarked the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man. The best thing that Shane Black does with this film, is not so much make it an Iron Man film, but more of a Tony Stark film. The way his character is fleshed out, yet grounded, is just a breath of fresh air, giving Tony some vulnerabilities, while he still kept up with his wit, charm, humor, and swag. For someone who isn't huge on Pepper Potts, I really didn't mind her here. She gets a little more important with every appearance, which is something I'm not too fond of, but she served her purpose well this time around. Thank God, Don Cheadle is much more likable this time around! Although his character development was on the plus side, with some fun character moments, War Machine/Iron Patriot went just a little underdeveloped; I would've like just a touch more of him. I love Jon Favreau, everytime he strikes a scene, but he was sadly used soley was a plot device, not getting too much of his character, other than the first act of the film. Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener was just utterly annoying. Shane Black tried to utilize him as a good plot device to drive RDJ's character, but Simpkins came off as clueless, with a real mediocre performance. Guy Pearce tries his best here, and you can tell he was having fun, but due to his character being severely underdeveloped and unoriginal, he was just a corny villain, with okay abilities, and a breakaway crew. If Shane Black and Drew Pearce didn't spend so much time on his character doing pointless stuff, he could've been a decent villain that could pose a real threat. Now this guy named Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, was THE BIGGEST controversial aspect of the MCU, never mind of the film. I personally didn't mind the drastic change all that much, because it fit well with the narrative, but he was super corny and majorly underutilized.The screenplay by Shane Black and Drew Pearce struggled in some areas, and succeeded in others. The biggest problem they had was writting some of these characters. If they just put a little more in a few of them, this film would've been great, especially with the jokes being the most cohesive and funniest yet, thanks to Shane Black's style.I really enjoyed the action this time around, not only because of how well it was balanced, but because of the high stakes. All of the effects looked great, continuously taking a step up from film to film.Overall, I can totally understand why some people may not like this film, and that's perfectly fine, but due to the sharp character development, fun story, and great laughs, Iron Man 3 is definitely one to check out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Ten times better than Iron Man 2, not quite as good as Iron Man, a pretty solid flick by itself.","After seeing Iron Man 2 (which, not to sugarcoat, was a pile of garbage), I wasn't going to bother seeing Iron Man 3. I was dragged to see it, and I must say, I enjoyed it. Some are saying it's the best of the three, but it doesn't touch the first one. But it's also leagues better than the second.I'll make this review short and address my complaints and the complaints of others. This is a non-spoiler review, so I'll be as vague as possible. Many people complained about how the movie used the character of the Mandarin because it was so unlike the comics. I never read the comics so I personally don't give a damn. I liked what they did, and it was a cool plot twist.My own biggest complaint was...there was way too much comic relief. The writer(s) of this film thought of a joke for every line and just had to put it in. The amount of comic relief in the first two were perfect, they went overboard in this one. So many people die in this movie. I don't mean main characters. I mean nameless extras. So many die. It's not even funny how many people die in a PG-13 Marvel movie. In addition to one-liners every ten seconds. It was a strange, uncomfortable combination.I enjoyed the ending, not going to spoil anything, but I liked it a lot. I'd rather not add to spoilers to this review, but random extremely vague point: if you were thinking of the question ""why not sooner?"" at the very end, it's explained in the comics. Google it. The movie did a poor job of explaining it.Overall, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good, but not better than the first","When they made the first Iron Man, i was like ""Man! They have to make more."" Then they made Iron Man 2. It wasn't a bad movie it was just not up to (or close to) the first movie's standards. Well my friends, the third was not as good as Iron Man (1), but it was up there. I feel like Iron Man 3 is at least the second best in the trilogy. As far as making the film goes,(not gonna spoil anything) look out for all the foreshadowing. You will also be hit with a little comedy. Kind of like all the Iron Man movies. There isn't much I can say about Iron Man 3. I did like the action sense of the movie. I did contain a lot of action and it did live up to it's title of being an action movie. Also like the first one. Throughout all the Iron Man films, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark was always my favorite actor. I cannot say the same for 3. Gwendolyn Paltron's Pepper Pots was mine in this one. She acted very well. Overall, Iron Man 3 was a good movie that is most definitely a movie worth watching. However, it still can't beat the first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An electrifying but provocative comic-book film.,"Iron Man 3 is another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's somewhat different from the two Iron Man films before because Shane Black replaced Jon Favreau as director. Favreau's influence on the film is evident, and he appears in his role as Happy Hogan, now Stark Industries head of security. Iron Man 3 offers just as much popcorn entertainment as Favreau's efforts. It's a more interesting film than Iron Man 2 (2010) because Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has to rely on his smarts and innovation instead of his firepower as he faces forces beyond his control. Iron Man 2 is a solid, enjoyable sequel but it was a bit of a letdown after Iron Man (2008). In Iron Man 3 the screenplay by Shane Black and Drew Pearce takes unexpected turns for a superhero movie. Purists may be upset by the changes from the comic books, but the surprises are actually neat. The big reason why this works is because the new actors, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, James Badge Dale, Ty Simpkins and Stephanie Szostak, deliver memorable performances. Downey, Jr. is as good as ever, and he handles the humor just as well as in the terrific crime-comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005). But Shane Black didn't bring only his clever comedy to Iron Man 3. He maintained the series' playful tone without neglecting Stark's struggle. He also delivered spectacular action set pieces in which Iron Man gets to put his abilities to good use, like in the dizzying action sequence involving Air Force One. Iron Man 3 is definitely the funniest Marvel film yet, but the drama involving Extremis is no less effective. The visual effects for the film were handled by 17 companies, including Scanline VFX, Digital Domain, and Weta Digital. Thanks to the excellent CGI we get to see the good-looking suits that Tony Stark has been working on. After the events of The Avengers (2012) he didn't spend all his time brooding because of his posttraumatic stress disorder. Brian Tyler contributed a good, bombastic music score for Iron Man 3. It features a memorable theme, and works well with the drama of the film too. I've seen all the Marvel films in a theater and, just like all of them, Iron Man 3 wasn't a letdown. The action, the comedy, the drama, the acting, and simply the intelligence of these films always make them enjoyable. Producer Kevin Feige was influenced by RoboCop (1987), something that makes it clear what his formula is. I definitely recommend Iron Man 3. It's a strong finish to a good trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Happy viewing.,"Let's start off by saying that IRON MAN 3 ensures a future to this ever so entertaining franchise. The 2nd movie did seem to be on full throttle whilst the e-brakes were on creating some critical friction where as the latest addition which makes this trilogy potentially even more lucrative. However Robert Downey Jr did sign up for only 3 installments and this maybe the last time we do see Tony Stark rolling solo. This being said the 48 year old superstar has said that he is hoping to play more of Tony Stark in the future. It's just a matter of time until we figure out if it will only be with the Avengers or simply on his own!Two things about this motion picture is extremely are appealing to me.An entirely new breed of nemesis with the inclusion of the Mandarin (not the fruit) is the first. The second one is having Shane Black take over the director's chair from Jon Favreau.The MandarinA bit fruity isn't it? I feel The Mandarin is more villain than Vanko and Stane thanks be to his theatrics. He is more realistic and grittier than those before. The reference and the cut scene from the Middle East will connect you with the first movie making this explosion of action feel more IRON MAN. Sir Ben Kingsley is 100% the meanest nemesis in the Marvel universe. Loki to me feels smaller in my mind standing next to the fearful Mandarins persona. There is only so much that I can talk about the Mandarin without spoiling the entire movie for the reader. Once you watch it you will realize it and those who have watched it already will simply agree.Shane BlackWhen you talk about Shane Black taking over from Jon Favreau the first question is why? Monetary decision? Creative Decision? Bottom line the change worked for the trilogy. Blacks worked with RDJ before and it's even fair to say that RDJ got a push into the stardom following KISS KISS BANG BANG. Black accepts the facts and realizes that Iron Man certainly cannot go bigger than THE AVENGERS since it's the story of Tony Stark and this man's only super power is hi mind. Hence IRON MAN 3 becomes entirely about Stark following the entire New York City incident. Black focuses on the Man and not on the Suit. He exposes Stark and brings out the sharpest gifts to the test. He tests Tony Stark's gifted mind. Bravo!Expect a combination of continuous action a gradual yet intense climax and a world of 21st first century CGI at its best. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this in 3D. I will assure you that it will be more enjoyable in 2D at this point of time in technology.Happy viewing.TITLE: IRON MAN 3 DIRECTED BY: SHANE BLACK STARRING: ROBERT DOWNEY JR, SIR BEN KINGSLEY, GWENYTH PALTROW, JON FAVREAU, DON CHEADLE & GUY PEARCE RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 130 MINUTES",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
good,"This is a man with an action pedigree including the Lethal Weapon series, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Last Action Hero, and The Last Boyscout to name a few that he has been associated with. He still managed to create a film with too many action scenes that were often excessive. The result was a disconnection between non-action scenes, leaving plot and character development to be drowned out by fight sequences that became tedious and silly to watch. All of this could have been avoided via Shane Black exercising a lot more restraint which, coincidentally, may have given said action scenes greater impact without interrupting the rest of the film.Another major offender in Iron Man 3 were the convenient escapes. Multiple times we see Tony or loved ones in danger only to have his suit fly in to save them. While I get it is Iron Man and that the suit will at times save the day, the number of times this occurred sucked away a lot of the movies tension.Finally without putting too fine a point on it as I have no desires to spoil, there were a number of divergences from what was in the comic to how the story played out in the film. It is a Hollywood film and I understand this will happen, but usually they do it for the right reasons. Here what was changed seemed to be a lesser, more confusing version of what was originally an enjoyable, logical journey. Go figure.Anyhow,its how I felt walking out of the film and still feel days later. I'm not going to go on about what good points there were as this is more a review of grounding some peoples high expectations for this film, in the hopes it may better their film experience.

Pulp for Genre Purists,"Iron Man 3 is more of a moving comic than a motion picture. Even the cinematography is reminiscent of old-time comic book panels. The story is light years from any reality we participate in. Like the best comics, it alludes to various aspects of history and reality cleverly but without yielding to the oppression of the everyday. Iron Man 3 is not entirely consistent with the rest of the franchise, however. Iron Man's various armor configurations appear to be a lot less resilient and functional than in the previous films (a bit like the difference between the creature in Alien and those of Aliens).Tony Stark is experiencing a great deal of apparently justifiable paranoia. He is also suffering from crippling anxiety attacks and nightmares. At one point, he is diagnosed by the most likable, heroic, and memorable character in the film - pre-teen Harley Keener (played by Ty Simpkins) - as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.Stark is facing a shadowy, almost invisible, enemy, who is apparently hidden in plain sight. Having lost what would appear to be a decisive battle, Stark must rely on his wits, his own unreliable technology, and a series of unlikely heroes - a young boy (Simpkins), the alcoholic mother of a dead soldier, a media operator with a good internet connection - to prevail. Of course, Pepper (Paltrow), his AI Jarvis (Paul Bettany) and War Machine/Iron Patriot/Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) also come in handy.The plot is extremely predictable, but it moves along and successfully relies on escapism, awe-inspiring effects, and entertainment value.With their respective talents, Paltrow, Downey and Pearce didn't even need to try. Paltrow and Pearce do, however, and really make the film worth watching. Downey never seems as fully engaged with this script as he has in previous comic book films. All the same, Iron Man 3 is a lot of fun and will appeal to those in search of the insane action, dysfunctional myopia of the main character and the tongue-in-cheek, slightly smarter-than-average dialog that characterize this franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Film,"IRON MAN 3 is just plain awesomeness. I think Ben Kingsley did such a good job that I think I'm okay with the feel steering away slightly from the comics.I am excited about Robet Downey Jr coming back in an Avengers film and playing this character. He has done is so skillfully that quite frankly, I am not sure who they are thinking of to do it later. IRON MAN 3 features so many unique amazing costumes that I was just so pleased with the design aspects. a good movie all around. There are a plethora of suits that show up that fans will be pleased who can name them all.Pepper Potts, is probably the most dynamic character in the film, and I don't want to give anything away, but she challenges Iron Man in a way that reminds me of Superman/WonderWoman dynamics.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
No so great as it could have been,"I guess I just hate female characters in Marvel movies. They just constantly get in the way and never die even if they should. I know that Robert Downey Jr enjoys playing his quirky Tony Stark but this movie showcased that quirkiness way too much (i.e. the second, third and fourth Pirates make the same mistake for Johnny Depp). The story had a nice setup and the action was of course first rate, but it just to me falls flat because some of the story elements that didn't fit together. If you're going to have the main character have angst about something then at least explain more thoroughly what he has angst about and then allow him to work through that in the end. This movie introduces Tony's anxieties but really they don't make any sense and he doesn't really resolve them in the end. I also really didn't care for the great reveal of Ben Kingsley's character, why too cartoony and dumb. So all in all OK but not great. Hope they bring the avengers back soon and I'm personally waiting for Thor cause he and Loki are a much better team than Tony Stark and Rhodie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Notch Above the Preceding ""Iron Man"" Movies","""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) is having some severe traumatic difficulties stemming from his recent combat experience depicted in ""The Avengers"". Unfortunately, he doesn't have time to resolve these issues because a terrorist by the name of ""the Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) is targeting him, his wife ""Pepper Potts"" (Gwyneth Paltrow) and ""President Ellis"" (William Sadler). Not only that but he has also earned the enmity of a mad scientist by the name of ""Aldrich Killian"" (Guy Pearce). Now, not wanting to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that there are some twists involved which deviate from the original plot and serve this movie quite well. Having said that let me also state that I am not a big fan of action movies that consist of simply action and CGI. And while this film has plenty of both there is also some good acting on the part of Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce. Additionally, there is a good story to be had here too. Be that as it may, I would like to advise those who haven't seen this movie to see ""The Avengers"" or possibly one of the other two ""Iron Man"" films before watching this one if for no other reason than to have a little bit of continuity. That's not to say that this movie can't be enjoyed on its own because it certainly can. In any case, I believe this sequel was a notch above the preceding ""Iron Man"" movies and I have rated it accordingly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3 Review:  Is the 3rd time the charm?,"Any decent film franchise will try to recover from a failure if the potential upside outweighs the downfall. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Like most people, I wasn't a big fan of Iron Man 2. It had its moments and some great characters, most notably Scarlett Johansson in a skin tight suit kicking butt and taking names. Not to mention any movie that involves Samuel L. Jackson always gets a bump in credibility with me. That man can read the phone book and make it fascinating. Oh, and did I mention Scarlett Johansson in a skin tight suit? Even that can't save a badly told story from a weak script. As a friend recently told me, a good story can make people forgive bad production value but the reverse isn't necessarily true.Thankfully, Iron Man 3 has a good story and good production value. Whereas Iron Man 2 was more wrapped up in setting the scene for The Avengers and the preceding Captain America and Thor movies, this movie is about the aftermath. How does Tony Stark live with what he's seen and done? What does a scientist do when his perception of the world has been shattered and he realizes that the world is much bigger and more deadly then he could have imagined? Can a hero even operate under that kind of environment? That's the reality that Tony Stark is living with at the beginning of the film and the theme of the whole movie.It's a powerful theme and something that's pretty common in the superhero film genre, particularly in today's world. Doing it well and in a fresh way takes a lot of planning and a good foundation. The best part about adapting a comic book character with as many years behind it as Iron Man, you have a lot to draw from. Particularly when your audience may not be as familiar with the character's history as most hardcore fans. The first film raised the profile of the character but I'm guessing that the fans of the first two films didn't go out and read all the best comics of the character. I can count myself among such fans.Still, I know enough to know what makes a good superhero film for the bigger fans. This film has a lot of those elements but doesn't require you to go out and read through every comic book to understand the context. It also refocuses the story on the main character, something sorely lacking in a film that has such a self-centred hero. In the end though, I think most people will be very happy with the latest instalment of the Iron Man franchise. It's smart, funny and has a lot to say about the world we live in. The way a great movie of this type of film genre should do things. Even better is the fact that we know that this franchise is far from over. They have Thor and Captain America 2 coming out and while the film doesn't appear to set up anything for them, it does leave you with room to do another chapter if the folks at Marvel want to.And with the success they have been having lately they most certainly will. Unlike other film trilogies, the character's story isn't entirely wrapped up but many elements which have been carried over through the three films do get a resolution of sorts.Is the 3rd time the charm for Iron Man? I was definitely charmed by it and I look forward to seeing more from the character and the Marvel Universe.For more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
If it only had a heart ...,"This is an unexpected pooper from Marvel, who have been pretty solid with their releases until now.So what should we expect from an Iron Man movie? Tony Stark fighting bad guys in his hi-tech suit, right? Well IM3 has very, very little of that and plenty of super hero 'down-time', as can be expected in such genre pieces where the screenplay doesn't know how to deal with the fact that the central character can't be in hero mode throughout.From having recently dealt with an alien invasion in 'The Avengers', Tony Stark is in comparatively dreadful form as an Iron Man whose gadgets repeatedly malfunction, and are more like aluminum foil than iron, based on how easily some of the bad guys manage to damage and destroy them.IM3 is reasonably entertaining though, with some very enjoyable and witty lines delivered from time to time but unfortunately that's about its best feature. A convoluted plot with little to no true Iron Man action make it seem like a bad franchise offering, rather than a full- blown, in house Marvel monster.You'll find it easier following a John Le Carr√© story than this, probably.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"This is the best super hero movie I have ever seen. It was complete in every way, with the humor and plot and characters. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark perfectly, and the plot twist in the middle is great. I had no complaints about this movie. This film is the best movie, by far of the Iron Man series, and of every series of super hero movies. It has the action and sci-fi content, the dramatic content, as well as the humor to almost classify it as a comedy. This movie also proves that Tony Stark does not need the suit to be a successful hero, he can more than handle thing with only his wits and his knack of creating things. This was one of the best films I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Compare it to movies in it's group (3rd sequels),"I'm way behind on this I know guys. I just never was too interested in this. But all my friends saw it and half of them told me it sucked and it was terrible and then the other half told me it was great, that it was better than the first two.Well, neither of those statements are true.I don't understand all the hate. It was fine. Better than Spiderman 3. I don't know really how to review this other than just saying it's better than ""these movies"" and saying that it's really not that bad. The action was good. The story wasn't cheesy, which is always good in a super hero movie. And for anyone upset of the ending of the movie by Tony Starks decision, I'm sure that it'll all be resolved in ""The Avengers""It was not terrible. I'd say it's better than the second but not as good as the first. It's a decent super hero movie. Better than ""Wolverine"" just because the plot isn't stupid. I did however, think the president in danger was a little clich√©.

"It made sense, & I love it for that.","The movie relates deeply with the previous 3 (including the Avengers) and the psychological state of Tony Stark in the whole movie made sense and gave a fair share of events!

The humor was there, the love moments were there, the action was there and on top *spoiler* Bruce Banner was there :D Gotta love these two together, glad Marvel is feeling the same way.

It's an iron man movie,"OK I think this followed the Jurassic park thing where the first one was spectacular, the second one sucked and the third was better than the second, but not quite on par with the first.That is how I felt, I mean RDJ does great as the still ego filled millionaire who is iron man. He still plays it likabley. The other actors do good as well, and though I was angry at first that mandarine was not being played by a Chinese guy at first, the twist ending does make up for it. I actually thought the twist at the end was funny, and made sense honestly.The action was great it was nice to see more war machine having more chances to fight.

One of the Best Marvel Films and a Perfect Start to Phase II,"There was no movie in 2013 that brought down the wrath its rabid fan base worse than IRON MAN 3. This is because there is an outspoken demographic, albeit a seemingly small one, who are purists that can't abide changes to the source material and IRON MAN 3 takes some pretty drastic liberties with a classic comic villain. I am not one of these purists and I'm happy to say that IRON MAN 3 was both one of the best movies of the summer and one of the best Marvel Studios films so far. We've got a new director (Shane Black) and a different perspective on the popular character in which we examine Tony Stark and his personal demons as opposed to merely pitting him against another armored baddie. The movie is established after the events of THE AVENGERS with Stark suffering anxiety attacks and insomnia from the mental and emotional strain he suffered during the Chitauri invasion. He's been busy in his workshop to keep his mind off it, and his relationship with Pepper Potts has suffered. A ghost from Stark's past soon reemerges in the form of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a fellow scientist and the founder of A.I.M., who hopes to form a partnership with Stark Industries in his research into enhancement nanotechnology and, meanwhile, a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has started a campaign of terror against the United States that becomes personal when a close friend of Stark's is caught in the crossfire.The more complaints I read about this movie, the more I realize I enjoyed it for those very same reasons. Tony Stark spends a comparatively shorter amount of time in the Iron Man armor as opposed to the previous films in the franchise. You know what? Cool. I'm down with that. I don't want my comic films to be just people in costume punching other people in costume. Stark spent loads of time in the armor in IRON MAN 2 and it didn't save that movie from all its problems. IRON MAN 3 dives into the character of Tony Stark and the fact that he's having a difficult time adapting to all of these new revelations: the existence of aliens, the arrival of the Asgardians, and particularly the fact that he's a superhero. He's begun having doubts that, without his armor, he is nothing and incapable of protecting those he cares about from harm. He's forced to uses his wits and intelligence to defeat his enemies here (well, except the final battle) and it's cool to see him as more than a flying blaster cannon. In THE AVENGERS, Steve Rogers asks Stark what he'd be if you didn't have the suit and he proves in this film that, suit or no suit, he's still Iron Man. Just because he doesn't suit up as often doesn't mean we don't get the action. There are plenty of cool battle sequences, my favorite being an escape from a Miami estate where Stark's only got a gauntlet and boot from the armor. As a summer action movie, IRON MAN 3 delivers.Being a comic film, another important element is having a good villain. Here is where the purist rage reaches epic levels. There is a pretty major reveal midway through the movie that I won't detail here (although it's probably been spoiled in countless other places) but the Mandarin sees some major changes from his comic counterpart. Personally, I'm cool with it. There are two primary villains at play in this movie: Ben Kinsley's Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian. Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic. He's mostly shown in terrorist videos broadcast over hijacked airwaves and his performance is perfect. The same can be said for Killian. I love Guy Pearce as an actor and he's great as the film's madman mastermind. I can't go into too much detail without giving away important plot points but know that the villains in IRON MAN 3 are the best in the franchise. The third film of the series boasts a better cast that most other comic films and some talented new blood filling in for Jon Favreau as he steps down from the helm (though he returns as Happy Hogan). The movie's got an entirely new vibe that sets it apart from the previous movies and I can't stress how important it is to keep these series fresh. In a time when we're quickly becoming over-saturated in comic films and superheroes, it's an absolute necessity to give us fresh views and engaging new stories that won't rely on the same old tropes.As these Marvel movies continue, people need to remember that these films are set in an entirely different universe from the comics and they need to appeal to a broader audience. So things aren't always going to be the same and if characters or plot points need to be modified to fit the filmmakers' vision, you just need to learn to roll with it (as long as the final vision makes for great entertainment which, in my opinion, IRON MAN 3 absolutely is). This is an excellent action movie with the humor and fun we expect from the Iron Man series and a villain who amounts to more than another man in a powered suit. Shane Black's brought some fresh blood to a series I'd worried might be losing steam and he reinvigorated it, giving Marvel's Phase II a perfect start.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just Amazing...,"You can judge from my rating (9 out of 10!!) how much I loved this movie. Watched it yesterday and and found it simply awesome. I have seen earlier sequels of Iron Man too and I think this was pretty amazing it not the best and most importantly i found it an advancement over others. The movie has a WOW factor especially in some scenes including the one in which he saves people falling from the sky. I also liked the idea of controlling his machines (probably the right word for those suits) that too not just one but so many by his brain. One of the movies where you can see it is not just actors but overall crew, technical team, designers and directors are making the movie great. Cast wise everyone played a pretty good role but there were two who stood out - one of course Robert and another Ben. Overall Superb Job and hope we get to see some more action, better movie in Iron Man 4!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An old review from 2013 on one MCU movie I've never really loved,"I'm not a huge comic book kind of guy, yet I still love a well-made comic book movie as much as the next person. Nolan's Batman trilogy is a great one- his film's have a few minor flaws but ultimately all three of them are gripping and entertaining. The first Iron Man was surprisingly good. It's been a while since I watched the Spiderman movies, but I remember enjoying them for the most part. Seeing The Avengers last year was one of the most fun trips to the movies I've ever had.So it was disappointing for me to come out of Iron Man 3 feeling letdown. Had I hyped myself up for it too much? Yes and no- I thought the trailer was great, and it got me pretty excited. Early reviews were extremely positive, and my expectations were heightened further. Then the movie was released to the general public, and I noticed a number of negative to mediocre user reviews on IMDB. I didn't read any of them in detail, and for the most part just assumed that they were nit-picky reviews from die-hard fans of the comics disappointed about some minor detail that wasn't a concern to me- (""oh, his suit doesn't look quite right."" I myself couldn't care less.) And it really sucks, but I'm going to have to side with these less positive reviews because I felt incredibly underwhelmed by this film, and I'll try my best to explain why without revealing any major spoilers, as I'm aware this film is only just coming out now.Iron Man 3 is completely inconsistent in its tone and style. While this is probably the Iron Man film with the most attempts at humour, it is also the ""darkest"" Iron Man film yet (other people's words, not mine). I don't actually think the movie really succeeds in being darker and grittier but I can tell that the film-maker's probably wanted to make something a little edgier, but then kind of destroyed the chance of that happening by throwing in a near constant stream of goofy jokes. There's a few too many in this movie, and they don't all work.Mind you, there were some moments I laughed- but there were other times I sat there shaking my head because a number of the jokes felt so forced and out of place. There's no proper dramatic moments in the film because most of it's just too damn goofy. There's no tension, no nail-biting moments. Our main protagonist seems aware that he's in a goofy comedy action film, and therefore he knows that he's never in any real danger. I wasn't a fan of Iron Man 2, but at least he was vulnerable for a good portion of that movie, and in that case at least a little compelling. Here, he loses a lot- this was heavily implied, almost shown by the trailer- yet it never really seems to hurt his progress. He shrugs off devastating circumstances because he knows he's fine. He knows Disney and Marvel will never properly harm one of their biggest and most popular money-making characters.I get it. I understand nothing too tragic will ever affect Iron Man himself, but I wish the character didn't also know this. We need a believable character we can root for, who not only goes through tough times but is affected by them. And yes, the events of The Avengers are brought up, and Tony Stark keeps telling us that he's traumatised by what happened, but you never really FEEL his fear, you're just told about it. Ultimately he still has no qualms about using his suit, and his physical strength is never weakened. Hell, he's still real cocky too, telling The Mandarin his home address so the antagonist will bring the fight to Tony's doorstep- hardly the actions of a ""defeated"" and ""traumatised"" man.And yes, I know I'm complaining about the goofy tone in this movie, and yes, I know The Avengers, which I already mentioned I was a big fan of, was also quite goofy. But it was a consistent sort of goofiness- the humour was so purely ""Joss Whedon-ey"" and it just flowed and pretty much every joke worked. The humour in Iron Man 3 is, like a Will Ferrell comedy, quite hit and miss, and feels more out of place considering Iron Man 3 is ""supposed"" to be a grittier and more intense Iron Man film.I've always thought that one of the key factors in making a protagonist easy to root for (I accidentally nearly wrote ""root-worthy"" there) is by forcing them to face an absolutely despicable villain. You don't even need a particularly compelling protagonist if you have an absolutely vile antagonist- just look at the 2010 Japanese film 13 Assassins, a sort of modern re-telling of Seven Samurai, which shows the main villain using a captive family (children included) as target practice in order to improve his archery skills. He is a villain so unlikeable that the final showdown between him and his army vs the titular thirteen assassins becomes extremely compelling, as we as the audience want him dead- badly.The villain department in Iron Man 3 is very disappointing. Ben Kingsley is wasted as The Mandarin, a bizarre character who we never really get to see face Iron Man in the way we'd like to see- a character and an actor so under-utilised it hurts. Kingsley's voice is also absolutely absurd- was it meant to be menacing or something? It's even sillier than Bane's from The Dark Knight Rises.The main antagonist of the film really has no clear motive. Yes, he wants to rule the world and get rich and have power and stuff, but why does he have such a grudge against Iron Man? We are given a reason, but I thought it was a pretty weak one.Also: the already infamous twist is dumb. I didn't like it. That's all I'll say.Iron Man 3 has a great cast, but they're not very well utilised. Don Cheadle is in about one scene in the film's first hour, and after that becomes a boringly standard black sidekick for Tony Stark. Gwenyth Paltrow yells at Tony a lot and becomes a damsel in distress when the plot requires her to be. Guy Pearce is... okay. Nothing about his performance really stood out- Sorry Guy, this one's probably not gonna get you on the Hollywood A-list either. Keep trying.I'm a bit mixed on Robert Downey Jr. He's good, he's fairly entertaining, and even while not all his jokes work he delivers them to the best of his ability, and to his credit he makes most of them at least decent. But the man's been playing this character in all his movies lately, and it's kind of getting annoying. His acting range isn't really stretched too far in this film either, because Tony Stark really doesn't act like that much of a changed man, even if he keeps telling the film's other characters (and the audience) that he is. So Downey Jr's good, but I'd like to see the actor pick a few more diverse roles in his future (does anyone remember him in Natural Born Killers? He was amazing in that movie- my favourite aspect of that film by far).Then there's the minor plot holes and inconsistencies- every big budget Hollywood action film nowadays seems to have them- not even the very good The Dark Knight Rises and the excellent The Avengers from last year were free of them. Things like Tony putting an Iron Man suit on Pepper at one point to save her from danger, and then telling a disappointed Rhodes later in the film that he can't wear one because they're only modeled to fit Tony. Then there's the un-justified fact that Tony's armour is far weaker in this film than it was in the previous Iron Man films and The Avengers- it falls apart like rusted scrap metal on a number of locations. To mention too many more inconsistencies and questionable details would start to spoil things, but trust me, they're there, and they're bothersome.Then there's the stupid kid character who spends a few scenes with Tony Stark, played by a terrible child actor. If he becomes ""Iron Man Junior"" at some point in a future Marvel film I'll likely lose my cool or something. And there's the awful and unnecessary 3D I unfortunately saw the film in. No, you don't have to see the film 3D, and again no, you shouldn't. It makes a fairly dark and murky film even murkier and darker, and while some things ""pop"" out a little, ultimately it just makes most of the scenes look kind of fuzzy. Detail is largely lost, colours are made bland, and it makes it look like most of the scenes are poorly lit. 3D can work from time to time, but seriously, it has to stop being shoe-horned into movies where it's not needed. I saw Oblivion earlier this week- it wasn't in 3D and it was absolutely gorgeous, with a stunning colour palette, fantastic detail, and damn near breath taking scenery that still ""popped"" even without the 3D effect. Even if you disagree with my thoughts of this film, I'm sure you'll be able to at least understand my little rant on 3D there.Well, there's the negatives, at least most of them. This review's going to be rather unbalanced because I'm not about to spend another 1500 words talking about the good stuff, even though there was stuff that worked. The action was pretty good- unfortunately there wasn't much of it, and none of it was on the same scale that the final battle in The Avengers was, but the ""plane rescue"" sequence looked great, and the climax on the oil rig at night was quite good- or at least it would've been if lousy 3D effects hadn't been there to make the whole thing kind of hard to see. Robert Downey Jr was good, even if his acting is becoming a little stale, and a sizeable amount of the humour does work- it just doesn't quite always gel with the and a sizeable amount of the humour does work- it just doesn't quite always gel with the ""darker and edgier"" story this movie was supposed to be telling.Just go in with moderate expectations- this is probably not going to be your next favourite superhero film- but with the right mindset and controlled expectations, it could at least be an enjoyable trip to the movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3 is great conclusion to the trilogy,"In 2008 we were greeted with one of the best comic book movies which is Iron Man, then in 2010 a sequel happened and it kinda felt of a mixed bag. So is the latest installment in the Iron Man franchise able to live up to the awesomeness of the original or will it be the worst film among the three? Read on below.Story: The story is a continuation of 'Marvel's The Avengers' and I must say that the story for this movie is probably the smartest story that Marvel has ever told. The ideas and plot points were completely fleshed out and the story was told in a way that can get you entertained while thinking at the same time. This movie didn't have the need to add any more aspect to make the story better, the plot points was just perfect and was explained well, and also it also just stick in telling one story.Acting: The performances of the actors here is very authentic, it felt like you are just watching something that is in front of you. It was nice to see some more action from RDJ's Tony Stark without wearing the suit and the same thing goes with Don Cheadle's James Rhodes. I also liked the performance of James Badge Dale, Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley, Dale played a very menacing 'right hand' and both Pearce and Kingsley played their role excellently. Despite my praise for the performances of the actors, I also have my gripe with the development of the characters, some of them felt like they was just there for the sake of being present in the movie and I also think that some characters even got over-hyped. This is where this latest installment failed in, the development of characters because some of the characters felt really rushed and sometimes inappropriate. It was also nice seeing Jon Favreau back as Happy Hogan, good thing their is no bad ties in there and I felt really glad that I didn't get irritated by the kid (Ty Simpkins) in here, though his performance was not great, it wasn't bad either.Action/Violence: This is an action-packed film, plain and simple but even though it has straight action, I don't think it was all that violent. In my opinion this installment has more action scenes than its predecessors and also each action scene was executed well, it kept the film at brisk pace and more importantly it was an aspect in the film that made it a whole lot entertaining.Visual FX: Hands down, the best effects I've ever seen in an Iron Man film. It looks very natural and authentic and you can clearly see that a lot of work and effort has been put in this movie to be visually stunning. What I liked with the effects in this film is the usage of both CGI and practical effects, I mean practical effects is still the best way to go but when someone is falling you probably might want to add some CGI in it (I know senseless rant).Music: I didn't bother much with the music but all I can say is that it helped the scenes to be much more meaningful and it added some depth into it. I miss hearing AC/DC in this film though.Cinematography: This movie also delivers on being the best shot Iron Man movie (well, for me though) and with a little help from a CGI it was good overall.Direction: One of the best aspects in this film is having Shane Black working behind the camera. I am a huge fan of all his films and seeing him take on this character was very exciting. It is not hard to tell that this is indeed a Shane Black film because, one, despite the seriousness of it in every trailer, the humor is very present in this movie and is probably the funniest Marvel film to date. Two, the buddy-cop formula is also present, you can sense this chemistry within the partnership of Tony Stark and James Rhodes. And lastly, three, the dramatic depth, even though this was a humorous movie, there is some depth in the dramatic scenes as it felt very moving and you will cheer up for the leads.Overall: I will say that 'Iron Man 3' is not better than the original Iron Man but it is definitely on par with that and definitely surpassing its predecessor. To top it with great performances from the leads and villains, the amazing visual effects, and the very entertaining action scenes and smart lines, this movie makes it the perfect conclusion of the Iron Man trilogy. I am positive that this is surely one of Marvel's best efforts and I give this a 4/5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There's only one Tony Stark/Iron Man and that RDJr,"I am Iron man - Iron Man 1 I have successfully privatized world peace - Iron Man 2 And whats the iconic dialogue for iron man 3? Before the question is answered lets see whats THREE all about.Shane Black the screenwriter behind Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout and director for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang along with RDJ then, once again proves his mettle along with the actor for incorporating his antics allover in the film. RDJ excels himself in the role because there's no one else. Damn he has to renew his contract with Marvel.As we have seen until now it seems that MCU is going thru the Marvel Comics Civil War comic series but i have no interest in divulging the details as the plot for the Phase 2 seems to be going very well now as the first movie for this phase has been delivered in aces. It seems that marvel is choosing its directors for this phase cleverly.damn you warner/DC GL was not supposed to suck.The story as it has been doing rounds is yes very much listed from the EXTREMIS story line and adapted cleverly but not completely. For the cast part the one person we have to commend is Sir Ben Kingsley, but please don't compare his part with Heath ledger in dark knight. Sir Ben is definitely excellent with the way mandarin had to be projected and it was a very clever choice in casting.God knows whats with the negative hype surrounding Gwyneth Paltrow guess it has to be for the marketing of the movie. Any way the rest of the cast have done their parts well and Rebecca hall is the weak link though her Maya Hansen was the strong link character in comics line.As far as Guy Pearce is concerned, damn he will always be the gem in whatever role is given to him . Other than some few twists and bloopers the movie has been delivered in aces.PS: Don't watch the movie in 3D instead watch it on IMAX screens as i am typing this review with a head ache. any way its up to you.By the the question i asked in the beginning there's no iconic dialogue instead the statement from the second movie once gain lingers in this one.I have successfully privatized world peace. But did he make the statement including / excluding himself. we all thought IM 2 answered that but in fact its in this part we understand the statement.Anyway watch the movie on IMAX instead of 3D.

"Stepping up from 2, but not farther than the original","Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN 3Part 3 can be judged differently than the first two installments. There's a new director in town and Iron Man 3 being the first follow-up flick from Marvel after the substantial success of The Avengers. Iron Man 3 feels more like it tries sequel to The Avengers, rather than support the first two films. The tone and cinematography make you feel like you are playing a video game, not watching a movie. It's peculiar how dividing Iron Man 3 actually is. Foremost, the tone has a broad range of being the lightest film of the series to the darkest film of the series. Iron Man 3 takes some staggering risks that pay off, but could've had some more polishing to the script. It had some of the deepest emotional moments, but those are complimented by some of the fluffiest cheesy moments. Ben Kingsly is perfectly dynamic and frightening in his role, but the only thing Guy Pearce brings to his role is a pass card to get by the audience completely without them caring about his character one way or another. The film has the best action sequences and visual effects and strong character development for its hero. My favorite thing they maneuvered in Iron Man 3 is the message of the movie hitting the movie's opening and final scenes with and epic punch of Downey's narration. Rating: 5.5/10Grade: BMy next thoughts are dedicated to two men that are both geniuses gifted in their artistic expression. Joss Whedon could not receive any more respect from me for his masterwork on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. His show was humanity, love, and life conducted into 142 episodes of television. Unfortunately, my opinion of The Avengers isn't favorable to his film. The Avengers is geek-glorified trash that felt like an animated Saturday morning cartoon. All three Iron Man films far surpass The Avengers, for my money. I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast.Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. ""I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow"" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sometimes less is actually less,"For the last year I've felt that the massive success of The Avengers‚Äîand I mean its artistic success, not its box office‚Äîwas a double-edged sword for Marvel. After all, wouldn't the individual character films feel a bit... small after that? IM3 attempts to use that to its advantage by making it smaller on purpose. It's a character study with a bit of spectacle slapped on, and I do mean ""bit"". While the third act does follow the standard ""Stuff go boom!"" formula, the first two thirds of the film keeps the action rather conventional (with one notable exception). To make this work you need an actor who can hold the audience's attention. Thankfully IM3 has the ultimate ace in the hole in Robert Downey Jr. But even his unmatched charisma can merely Spackle over the film's many flaws. The story is weak, the stakes feel small and it just never builds any momentum. There are a lot of things to like here. The aforementioned RDJ, some sharp dialog, a scene stealing turn by Ben Kingsley and a jaw-dropping twist. Unfortunately the sum of IM3 is less than its parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best of the Iron Man,"Iron Man 3 is the best of the franchise. Despite the animosity of many fans, they overlook the gems that make this one really outshine the previous installments. Tony Stark must face himself, his fears, his doubts, and his own anxieties. Troubled with PTSD from the New York incident, he reminisces about duping a quiet, brilliant man and turning him into a desperate, psychotic killer. Stark must deal with this in his present state, which is straining his relationship with Pepper Potts. To deal with his problems, he tinkers with his suits, and hides from reality. Reality hits hard when the Mandarin strikes. A terrorist, the madman is responsible for various bombings in the world. He plays a cat-and-mouse game with the U.S. Rhodes, now the Iron Patriot, seeks the Mandarin while Tony Stark starts on his own trail that leads him to Killian - who has a unique tie to the Mandarin. This leads to a lot of adventure, excitement, and emotions. Many people have griped that this was the same plot as ""The Incredibles,"" but plot devices are often borrowed from other sources. What really makes the plot work, though, is that not everything appears to be what it seems. Another plot strength is we see a more human Tony Stark whose liabilities cause more problems than his strength. He does have to work through the problems of the unintended consequences of previous actions. The one plot weakness was the use of a boy, Harley. Ty Simpkins does play him well, but it seemed unnecessary and a device used to grab kids into the picture. There are a couple of other plot holes and devices that are hackneyed, but the movie still works for a couple of other reasons. One is Robert Downey, Jr. Face it, Tony Stark was the one he was meant to play. He does it well. In this one, he shows some true acting by taking it to another level where Tony Stark has to face himself and reconcile his narcissism and grandiose ego juxtaposed by his PTSD. We also have good performances from Gwenyth Paltrow, Jon Favareau and the villain. Another strength is the direction that takes the plot evenly, and producing a good story with real characters that are not overplayed by the special effects. Iron Man 3 is definitely a good movie, and a rare oddity where the third in a trilogy is the best of the bunch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3: Movie Review,"After marveling at the cinematic brilliance of The Avengers last year, this year's first Marvel release fell incredibly short of anything close to marvelous. Iron Man 3 like much of the glorified suit of armour in the movie is a clanking hollow shell lacking any real body or substance. It sorely suffers from the titanic box office juggernaut Marvel's The Avengers proved to be and evoked overwhelming feelings of underwhelming disappointment and disenchantment upon its culmination. Damaged by a nonsensical antagonist swerve and a superhero over-utilizing his new remote play feature amidst inexcusable plot holes, aimless disjointed sub-plots, far-fetched role reversals and a sense of going through the motions, this Iron Man installment is nothing short of filler, used as a catalyst to fuel the next phase in the ongoing Avengers (revenue) machine.Iron Man 3 is a superhero movie sequel co-wrote and directed by Shane Black centered on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man; the third installment in the Iron Man film series and the seventh in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Set some time after the events of The Avengers, Iron Man 3 picks up with the supercilious genius industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man who is reeling from the alien invasion of New York, which is causing him to suffer prolonged insomnia and anxiety/panic attacks. Unable to curb his restlessness and anxiety he has taken to his workshop where he has built a legion of Iron Man suits, at the same time detaching himself from the outside world consequently creating tension with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Concurrently, the Mandarin, a relentless and merciless terrorist orchestrates a string of bombings that leave behind no distinguishable evidence. Stark stirs from his seclusion and issues a televised threat directly to the Mandarin when his world begins to be torn apart at the seams and those closest to him become embroiled, ultimately leading to him going on a good old fashioned revenge mission with one objective in mind; to take down the Mandarin.Robert Downey Jr. reprising his role as the brash billionaire playboy industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man is at his sardonic best, however, much of the dialogue Downey Jr. professes throughout the film seems on the verge of stand-up comedy rather than the empowering words of a man-made superhero. Also reprising her role as Pepper Potts is Gwyneth Paltrow, her performance though solid is plagued with an implausible narrative for her character, and the camaraderie between her and Downey Jr. seems forced at times. Ben Kingsley's portrayal of credulous Tony Slattery otherwise known as the Mandarin is good for what it is, and Don Cheadle as the Iron Patriot formerly the War Machine got lost in the narrative somewhat but nevertheless provided a satisfactory performance for the parts and dialogue he was given. On a more positive note, Guy Pearce provided a stellar performance as the unstable scientist Aldrich Killian, a rivaling industrialist to Tony Stark with an underlying resentment for his fledging genius counterpart. Nonetheless, despite a couple of passable performances, notably those of Downey Jr. and Pearce, Iron Man 3 was sorely lacking character portrayals worthy of the audience's time investment.Shane Black takes over the helm of the Iron Man film series from Jon Favreau after his lackluster Iron Man 2 and teams up with Robert Downey Jr. who he last worked with on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. In hindsight perhaps Iron Man 3 could have been renamed to suit its premise more; Remote Control Iron Man, maybe Pepper Man, possibly even Avengers Hangover, these would all suffice, but How a Rich Man Copes with Seeing Aliens seems to fit best. Too much of Tony Stark's vulnerability was exposed in this movie which diminished the character we have all warmed to, the exuberant larger-than-life billionaire playboy/superhero. By divulging Stark's susceptibility to the strains of life to the extent it has in Iron Man 3 it makes it a lot easier to understand if he were to finally hang up his proverbial boots for good; not a good thing for a superhero film series with unfinished business. In addition to this, there is an underlying disconnect from the outset much like Stark with his beloved iron suit(s) in a significant proportion of this movie, by opting for the sympathy vote it is apparent Black has alienated viewers such as myself who want to see a superhero at the height of their powers overcome evil. By the end the very thing that ties Tony Stark to Iron Man is away with the wind, which is ironically where big-budget filmmaking intelligence went when this movie was produced. Here's hoping the remaining parts of the Avengers machine have not depreciated like its iron core has evidently done.Even the post-credits sequence connected to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe seemed needless and afforded nothing to entice in terms of reasons to be eager to want to watch the forthcoming Avengers movie or the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. However, ironically the ending cameo encapsulated the essence of the entire Iron Man 3 movie, a psychiatric evaluation of a perturbed superhero.On the contrary, Iron Man 3 is not a categorical disaster; it packed in enough explosive action and vivacious backdrops into a lengthy 2 hour 15 minute running time to at least be aesthetically pleasing to the viewer. Although when you look behind the niceties there is not much to write home about.Nevertheless, Iron Man 3 is a frantic overblown popcorn flick that lacks any real conviction and can be only described as a damp squib. Like all superhero movies, the superhero is only as good as it's adversary, and in this case the adversary was not worthy. As a stand-alone franchise it's clearly demonstrable that it is suffering, as part of an even bigger picture, Iron Man's appeal is draining with only 5% power and the odds of it reaching maximum altitude again are slim to none.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Do yourself a favor , watch Iron man 3 to feel the punch","""A hero must fall to rise up "" . Iron man 3 was entertaining with high- class 3D effects and stunning CGI along with riveting performance by Robert Downey Jr.Iron man 3 narrates the story of how Tony Stark( played by Robert Downey Jr)'s world is torn apart by dreaded terrorist, Mandarin( played by Ben Kinglsley). To make it worse , Mandarin is supported by Stark's fan- turned-foe,Aldrich Killian( played by Guy Pierce). Tony Stark fights back to rebuild and re tribute.Taking over the director's chair from Jon Favreau , Shane Black does a fantastic job in keeping Iron man 3 series alive with sheer hard work and dedicated direction. The movie is narrated in flashback mode depicting how Stark's friends and fans turns into arch-rival. It also reveals the changing personality of Stark from I-don't-care attitude to a responsible person. Enters Mandarin and Stark's world turns upside- down by Mandarin's brutal attack at his house. Stark is compelled to fight back and save the country from being destroyed by atrocious Mandarin. Story was good along with nice screenplay. Art direction was nice. Cinematography was excellent along with punching dialogues. Visual effects is the high-light of superhero flicks and Iron man 3 is no different. The 3D effects were astonishing. CGI was stunning and couple of scenes are enthralling and is sure to excite you with adrenalin- pumping action scenes. Robert Downey Jr is excellent. The way he suits up in Iron Man clad ,the same way he gets into character of Iron man as if it has been tailor-made for him. He is expressive and will leave you spellbinding with stupendous performance. Guy Pierce and Ben Kingsley were good as villain in the flick. Gwyneth Paltrow , Don Cheadle and Jon Farveau does fine job in the supporting role.Do yourself a favor , watch Iron man 3 to get feel the punch.

"good film, but not at cinema price","the main problem with the movie is the time it takes the film to build put to the end, don't get me wrong the end is good great action but its not put to the ¬£6 ticket price people. how ever the humor in the film is great but does take over the drama of the film in places.like in iron man 1 however you spend more time is tony himself out of the suit rather than ""iron man"", which does work for the film but you do miss the action of the suit any now and again specially when the film slow's down.last the end; if u are a iron man law fan then you will walk out done with the film, but with your not that u can take the ending and move on.ps wait for the end of the film :) ¬∑",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Shane Black hits the Mark,"Phase One of the Marvel Universe Cinematic was a massive success for Marvel Studios, leading to a Billion Dollar film, The Avengers. Now Marvel has a new test for Phase Two, starting with Iron Man 3, with new blood being brought in the form writer/director Shane Black, who manages to import his comedy style to the comic book genre.It has been months since the Chitauri invasion of New York and Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr.) is haunted by the experience, having nightmares, panic attacks and staying up all night tinkering with his inventions. The result is he makes a suit that he can control with his mind. As this is going on, America is suffering from a new wave of attacks from a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), using explosives that seemingly have no traceable parts, forcing the American government to rebrand War Machine to The Iron Patriot. Even worst Stark past comes back to haunt him as a man he stubbed in 1999, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) creates a revolutionary bio-tech technology that could be the next leap for humanity, healing people with ease. But a side effect is it turns people into living weapons. When The Mandarin forces attack Stark's home, Stark is only left with one damaged prototype suit with little power and he has to use all his knowledge and skill to find out what The Mandarin and Killian are up as they attack Stark's loved ones as well as face up to his past.Iron Man 3 does feel very much like a Shane Black film, having his trademark style of dialogue and humour and uses a Christmas setting. It is to the point that Iron Man 3 becomes more a Black film then a Marvel film and a little bit like the Batman Returns of Marvel film with its focus on Stark and his resourcefulness and the villains and less about Stark in his suits. Stark does keep his trademark wit and intelligence and Downey does make the role his own, like he's done in the previous films. But the other characters also get a fair share of the comedy.Iron Man 3 is Black's second film as director and he shows a great confidence behind the camera. He keeps the Marvel look and style, while still managing to make a film that is completely his own film and proves he can handle the special effects and action set pieces. Some of the fist fights and close quarter action were edited a too quickly, but that is made up for by the variety of action, particularly the final battle with the multiple Iron Man suits. Iron Man has very different threat to what he has had in the past, biologically altered super-heated people which have strength and the ability to melt metal: it is certainly different to men in iron suits and there are more menacing because of it. It also serves as a way to expand the type of sci-fi the Iron Man series can explore. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts also has a few moments where she gets to be a badass. On the action front, Iron Man 3 is the best in the series so far.The trailers for Iron Man 3 made it out to be a very serious, darker affair, to the point that I personally nicknamed it ""The Iron Man Rises"". But it was a bait and switch and Iron Man 3 is a very humorous film throughout, having plenty of witty lines and well timed visual jokes. Black does a fine job at balancing out the comedy with the darker and serious scenes and elements, skills that Black developed since his early writing days, which makes for a fun blockbuster experience.The biggest controversy that Iron Man 3 has to offer is the portrayal of Iron Man's arch nemesis The Mandarin. Of course he was not going to be the ""Fu Manchu"" stereotype that he was in the comics and international politics (as well as film markets) have changed, so changes had to be made: but Black's does take it to extremes as he puts his own spin on the character. Some may call it a clever postmodern twist, subverting conventions about villains and their portrayal in Hollywood film, others will call it a betrayal of one of Marvels most famous villains.Because of the change in world politics since Iron Man was first created and the theme about the War of Terror was used in the first film Iron Man. The War of Terror theme has been brought back, The Mandarin acting like an Osama bin Laden like figure but Black and Marvel look at the hypocrisy of terrorist leaders who hides behind their 'ideals' whilst living in comfort and how they would use anything to try to morally justify their actions.Iron Man 3 is a fine additional the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a solid follow up The Avengers. It is stronger then the previous entry in the Iron Man series which was too reliant on comedy and very character heavy. Shane Black does bring a fresh approach for the series and once again, Marvel Studios has begun the Summer blockbuster for 2013 on the right track.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good Superhero film, decent film","When I saw the first Iron Man, I loved it. The action was great, the back story was even better and it had a solid plot and story. It's great, it was great. Then Iron Man 2 came along, and all I could say about that was ""eh"". Everything that the first film did went above and beyond, unlike the second. This is a film in between. What it does well, it does really well, other things are merely passable. Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark. No contest, this man cannot do wrong with this role at all. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle did good for the roles that they had. Ben Kingsley is the highlight of the film, I won't tell you why, but when I think of Iron Man 3 I think of Ben Kingsley. Now, one of the biggest flaws of the film is that while it does have some huge plot twists, (These are really good ones too) one in particular, hilarious when it happened, crashed and burned, when you see it you will know why. It failed. However, it doesn't sacrifice the good in the film. If you saw the Avengers... you probably already saw this one, but if you're a skeptic when it comes to this series, give it a try, it will be worth your while.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Honest Review,"I just got home from seeing this film and I have to say while it is miles better then the second movie it really was not a great movie. I felt there were a lot of plot holes. Now I do think its worth stating that all super hero movies have plot holes but this one more than most. In this movie it seemed like they focused on one thing he can do with suit ( make it come to him) he did this about 10 times in the movie. This focus made the other ""powers"" of the suit fade into the back. Another point I feel the need to share is they didn't go into the antidote enough and all the sudden he breaths fire!!!??? Was just crazy and out of no where I think a lot of explaining is needed for the antidote. To sum up this movie had plenty of plot holes, too many bad guys to care, didn't make sense and didn't explain enough but was entertaining to watch I think a solid 6 is a generous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent comic action film; watch it!,"It took me ages to watch this because of all the conflicting reviews. I thought it was going to be as bad/boring as Terminator Salvation or The Dark Knight Rises.This film was fantastic! Easily the best of the Iron Mans (although the first will always be 'the best', this one is repeat-watch-worthy).Now that I know how awesome this film is, I think the negative reviews make more sense: they seem to focus on things like 'but the bad guy isn't the same as the comic' or 'that's not believable' etc. so let's ignore those because that's just irrelevant. The film can still be good without sticking 100% to the comics! I can't believe some people complain about the realism when we're dealing with magic and flying iron man suits but okay, let's mark the film down because the hero didn't break his back quite enough in that scene?! I've given this a ten because the story progresses brilliantly, there are so many extra scenes included that you would normally expect to be edited out to keep the running time down but the fact that they're left in means the film has a well-rounded feel to it. Contrary to some opinions, I like that the woman has the chance to save the day instead of 'just' being eye-candy (Gwyneth wears the most amazing white office power-suit ever; congrats to the designer), it is a bit patronising to just have one scene of saving the day but it's better than nothing. One of the bad guys (Guy Pearce) is building a great profile for himself as being someone to watch out for as he might just steal the show! This film had it all, yes there's a cute kid, but this is Iron Man so it never gets cheesy and actually there are some hilarious scenes between Robert Downey Jr and the kid. There's loads of humour and the action is great.Everyone gets just the right amount of screen time in my opinion and I'm actually going to watch this again which is rare for me.10/10 as it's an excellent film - not perfect but excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Interesting, but with many plot gaps and a bit overreacted","I'll try not to spoil it too much.So, it takes place after the Avengers movie. Sure, it had a lot more Sci-Fi stuff like aliens, hulks, etc, but Iron Man 3 just didn't have to take the same path.The enemy Stark faces is somewhat ""overpowered"" and have some super huge powers. I'd expect a more complex, secret, dark one instead. It went a bit off reality and it seemed weird, at least.It's a half action-packed movie. I was expecting more, as a follow up of the Iron Man 2 film. In the middle of the picture, it kind of slows down the beating.One other negative aspect was a half depressed Tony Stark for the first two thirds of the picture.The humorous scenes have increased in this movie, which to me is the single remarkable positive aspect of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An overall solid film with some unwelcome plot points,"There is no doubt that there was a lot of excitement leading up to Iron Man 3, but there were also a lot of skeptics due to the change in directors. Jon Favereau, who directed the last two films, has been replaced with Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon one and two, as well as director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Immediately the audience can identify this due to a darker tone and a different style of humor. The humor is very funny yet kind of seems out of place. It's like if there is a build up of exciting or dramatic moments, ending with surprisingly funny situation. One place I believe Iron Man 3 succeeds over the other two films is the supporting characters. To be honest, the supporting cast of the last two films never really had too much impact, it was mostly Tony Stark's show. In this movie I was able to see that Pepper was more influential than ever, being the cause of most of the actions Tony takes, Rodey now is much more of a help to Tony and has a completely different role to play. As this is a new chapter in the franchise expect to see to new characters either helping or hurting Tony Stark, most important, of course, is Guy Pierce's Aldrich Killian and Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. I don't want to tell of Killian's importance to the film, however Ben Kingsley in the film is a different story. Well let's just say based on the material he is given, Kingsley does a very good job.Now for the plot. Overall the plot is decent Tony Stark is dealing with post-dramatic stress due to the events from The Avengers, he discovers new technology such as the one seen in the trailer where he can manipulate different pieces of the suit individually and send them where he wants, he cannot stop dealing tweaking his suits due to paranoia. This creates a challenge for him along with his new threats. However the plots are also where most of the movie's problems exist. There are some directions they take that you will ignore, or will simply infuriate you. I, personally, was infuriated by some that I feel did not need to happen. The ending to the film is kind of strange, it kind of seemed like one of those endings that say ""we may or may not make another sequel"". However on the bright side, after two films of disappointing end fights, we finally have fight that is satisfying and doesn't last about five minutes (we're looking at you Iron Man 2).Overall, the movie has a lot of potential, solid performances, solid characters with a plot that sort of bogs the film down. The movie is very enjoyable yet not as good as it could have been. In my opinion, it was still not as good as Iron Man, yet better than Iron Man 2.My final score: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Could be worse,It's an okay movie and Iron Man will always be a good watch but it's not as good as the first or second but I think this is mainly down to the villain and the below average storyline. Robert does Robert and is still good.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron man 3,"I thought the film was really good but the only negative thing I have to say the actor who played the mandarin and the president was really Not good at acting apart from that the acting was brilliant especially the actor who played tony stark. I'd just like to say the mark 42 iron man suit was amazing !!!!! And the person who made the suit for the film has a an amazing, creative mind. PLEASE bring another film out just to make the iron man film come to an end for example making tony stark die. Or a bad guy detonating a nuclear bomb that is going to kill millions of people and tony and the bad guy have to fight to the death and tony has to stop the bomb detonating and ends up killing himself just to stop the bomb",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Whys it still so so-so?,"Personally I've found all of the ""Iron man"" movies to be a bit ""Meh!"" But I was looking more forward to this one (Maybe meaning I was more let down by it) after the pure awesomeness that was ""The Avengers.""All of the action aside, ""The Avengers"" really was Robert Downey Jnrs show. The jokiness he's brought to all of the ""Iron man"" movies so far is the reason so many love them. Although in number 2, the action seemed to take a back seat to make way for way to many gags. Far from what most in the audience wanted. This time around though they've got the balance right. There's plenty of action and the movies sense of humour is firmly intact. So whys it still so so-so?Here, I personally think the story is a bit of a mess. SPOILERS AHEAD!! (One's that you've probably already heard about) The way its rounding things off as if its the last movie make no sense. They've already set up the ""Marvel cinematic universe"" so that it can go on forever. Why pretend they're finishing up now? And from what I've heard, the way the chief villain has been handled, is a disaster. Even if your only going by what you expected from the trailer, and your not a comic book junky, I think most will be disappointed with the bizarre twist that works its way round the Mandarin character, and the other one played by Guy Pierce. Then there's that ""Iron Patriot"" thing. Wasn't he ""War machine"" in the last movie. Why change that? Characters in the movie even say ""War machine was cooler.""Despite promise, the whole thing has a ""rush job"" feel to it. Like they had to quickly make another ""Iron man"" movie before Downey Jnr's contract as the character ran out, and to quickly cash-in on ""The Avengers.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fine Ending to the Trilogy¬ÖCertainly Goes Out with a Bang,"The First Two Acts in the Third Instalment of Iron Man are an Excellent and Edgy Set-Up for the Final Act that Unleashes a Free-For-All, Slam-Bang, Action exercise that tries to Out Do all that has come before in Terms of such Things. It might have Succeeded.The Major Cast Members are back with Robert Downey Jr Lynch Pinning the Movie with more Angst about His New York Experience with The Avengers but still Manages to Wield the Wit.Don Cheadle has Grown Into the Role as Rhody/War Machine and has quite a bit of Screen Time and makes the most of it and Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper gets to Put On the Suit.Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley are Not Surprisingly Welcome as Bad Guys in a Contemporary Story of Terrorist Insanity. Some Marvel Maniacs have Wailed Wildly about the Mandarin Character and it is a matter of ""Each His Own"" whether You Accept the Change or Not. It Could be called a Cheat, but at the very Least it is Unexpected and Works in its Slight of Hand.Overall, it has enough of a Cerebral Script to Balance the Over the Top Action and Explosions. Some of the Battles have Flourishes that are Outstanding including a Skyjacking and Barrel of Monkeys Piece that is a Highlight.

The ship should be docked by its original captain,"Early on in Iron Man 3's lengthy, long-awaited production, director Shane Black stated he wanted to make a film that wasn't superficial or self-serious, but rather, more fun and lighthearted. I would've went with serious; Iron Man 3 is, to say the least, a disappointing conclusion to a franchise that showed amazingly potent promise with its awe-inspiring debut just five years ago. This is a been-there-done-that affair that does exactly what I praised its original film for not doing; serving as a special effects compilation and incorporating much more humor than necessary.Perhaps that was the foreseeable effect of having Black take the director's chair over Jon Favreau, who manned the ship on the first two productions. Black, whose fame stemmed from the 2005 cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, throws way too many cutesy witticisms in his writing, treating the third installment of the Iron Man franchise as the byproduct of a self-referential film treading the likes of Seven Psychopaths. Not only does putting this side-by-side with the original two films, which weren't as dark or as heavy as Nolan's Batman franchise but still rather serious, seem a tad out of place, but the series feels like it's more concerned with nudging and winking at the audience than wrapping things up cleanly.We are thrown back in the futuristic world of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), only this time, we start in 1999 at a New Year's Eve party where scientist Aldrich Killian tries to bring up thoughts and ideas about expanding his company to an cold, uninterested Stark. He is quickly-shifted out of Stark's mindset, never to be seen again any time soon.Fast-forward to the present and we see Stark's battle with the aliens in New York (events from The Avengers) have made him jittery and a frequent victim to panic attacks. Just in time, too, since the elusive terrorist Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is threatening America's safety and Killian (Guy Peace) returns to exact revenge on Stark for his narcissism and arrogance. On top of this, he must ensure the safety of his long-suffering Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and continue emphasizing that he will protect the citizens of the United States from uncertain danger.There is far less going on in the third installment of this series than there was in the second film; whether or this is good or bad, you can be the judge. Black doesn't play it safe, but he sometimes only slightly opens doors before closing them abruptly, a little bit like what Iron Man 2 did in the face of the government wanting Stark to hand over all his technology to the Defense Department. The ignored idea that we could've got a lot out of is when Stark's pal Rhodey (reprised by Don Cheadle) tries to convince him to refrain from instigating or provoking Mandarin in anyway and saying leave it to the government. That is when Iron Man's role in social order and political uprising should come into play but sadly never does.I, too, can't help but feel that if you were a fan at all of the original Iron Man comic books that if part two let you down part three will considerably let you down. Mandarin is drastically shortchanged as a villain, not given too much backstory and only given certain times to chime and spit villainous clich√©s. Killian, as well, although the film sort of explains why in a twist ending that I find a tad more disingenuous. Clearly, he is played as some sort of Osama Bin-Laden-esque terrorist, but we know far too little about his motivations and plans. He is evil and wants to take over, case closed.Another subplot features Ty Simpkins as a young boy named Harley, who connects with Stark on a personal level in certain points in the film. Harley is a well-meaning kid, kind of irritating, but genial and relatively harmless, and often the victim of Stark's narcissism as are many of his close friends. Harley isn't a bad character, but he's an unneeded addition to the story. His story offers little-to-no payoff and, in the end, plays as sort of a little piece that tries too hard to tug at the heartstrings.It's honest to say that the Iron Man series has gotten a tad bit worse since its start in 2008 with a very promising film that I consider one of Marvel's strongest films to date. Its sequel, while crowded with subplots and characters, still found a way to get its energy and heart in the right place and at least tie things up marginally well by the end of the film. The third film features yet another wonderful performance by Downey Jr., a briskly-paced narrative, and interesting little minor inclusions along the way, but gets too caught up in the sense of its own whimsy and personal delight with its humor. At this point, the fans deserve an ""Iron Man 4"" just for the sole-purpose of optimism that it will be better, more efficient than the two sequels we got.NOTE: My video review of Iron Man 3, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqz0INZADwwStarring: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, and Rebecca Hall.

Decent action movie with some good laughs,"Mixed feelings about this movie. The trailer does not match the movie hence I can understand why people are a bit upset, especially those who are into the tradition of marvel comics and want the characters and plot line to be congruent with what they have read.I was expecting an all out action movie, Iron Man bringing to the table a new collection of gadgets, epic scenes and heroics. There was all that but not to the degree some would have wanted.I do feel like the bad guys the Mandarin and Aldrich Killian just didn't seem like 'real bad guys' or guys that you would expect to stand toe to toe with Iron Man in the finale.Though what stands out is Robert Downey Jr's acting. I had quite a few laughs and the comedy played out brilliantly.Like I said fun movie but not one for the purist..",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finally A Good Third Movie,Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man is irreplaceable like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and once again Robert/Tony Stark shows off why we love him so much in these movies.Iron Man 3 is one of those hard to create movies when it comes to making a perfect trilogy but Shane Black managed to pull it off quite well i believe. The personalities he puts into his characters coupled with a heck of a lot of action is just top notch in my book.And Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin was something I have been waiting for in an Iron Man film and he does deliver a presence that dare I say is a successor to Heath Ledgers Joker,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3 is back in form..OK somewhat!,"Tony Stark is the kind of billionaire inventor playboy genius that must make Richard Branson and Larry Ellison feel like under achievers or worse-downright wimpish. ""I'm Tony Stark. I build neat stuff, got a great girl, and occasionally save the world,"" yeah, way cooler than Steve Jobs. The appearance of the Oracle brand in Iron Man 3 is perhaps Ellison making a donation to become part of the super alpha male club, because the guys who buy Oracle servers are not going to be swayed by this film.The story starts off in the post The Avengers world, with Tony Stark having retreated to his workshop to create a plethora of suits.But all is not well in the world, there have been mysterious explosions which have a unique signature to them.The back story belongs to a science conference in 1999 when Stark ignored the entreaties of a partially disabled scientist Aldrich Killian(Guy pierce) to work with him and ended up creating a monster.While he was at it he also had a one night stand with an ace scientist Maya Henson (Rebecca Hall) and left her in the lurch.His life with his girlfriend Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) is strained. He is going through a superhero midlife crisis, and a ""what else is there to achieve, now that I am the CEO of Starks Corp. and his permanent girlfriend"" emptiness in hers.Meanwhile the evil Aldrich meets Pepper and makes a presentation, taking her inside the hologram of human brain that will make the consultants at Bain and Co. sweat,trust me its sleek.But Pepper is not impressed, it sounds like evil science to her.With this final rebuff all bets are off and Peppers bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) gets hurt in another mysterious blast.This snaps Stark back to his superhero mode and he calls for war with the new threat to humankind, Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), an Asian looking anarchist, who by now is making global broadcasts about his intention to teach the world painful lessons. Aldrich has also harnessed a technology that can regenerate damaged human tissue and has cured himself.He is looking to commercialize his invention.The rest of the film continues to carry on the special effects feast with the Iron Man slugging it out with the evil Mandarin and Aldrich.Hell hath no fury like a scientist scorned.The director charms us in the middle act in a Spielberg kind of way by introducing the all American blond kid who helps Stark when he is down and out and gets a payback which will earn him a fortune on Ebay one day.After the definitive cinematic death of Bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty, Hollywood seems to be taking a break from terrorists with long beards, in the recent Olympus has Fallen, Hollywood looks to North Korea for pure evil.Tragically real life seems to follow suit in Boston where at least outwardly the killers were white Caucasian men.Maybe next time around we will have a secret society of Russian oligarchs facing off with the Marvel crew.While the novelty of the suit has worn off despite several reboots, Robert Downey Jr. is superb, this is still one of the most inspired casting calls in Hollywood Superhero history.Gwyneth Paltrow has just been named the most beautiful woman in the world by People magazine, much to the chagrin of feminists who hate her blond slender blue-eyed frame, delivers the goods as Iron Mans weak spot even though he neglects her for his workshop.She shakes off the damsel in distress image to emerge a worthy Mrs Iron Man. Guy Pierce is good as the evil Aldrich Killian but Ben Kingsley's Mandarin sets the screen on fire.His character neatly sidesteps the Fu Mancu stereotype and bears shades of Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, in his worldview.The first Iron Man film was supremely thrilling in combining special effects and a really original character brought to life by Downey.The second installment instead of building on the first went sideways, though not without its spectacular moments.The third installment which sees a change in the direction department with Shane Black replacing Jon Favreau, tries to go back to basics but the plot does not have the cohesion that the Iron Man 1 had.This is far from a perfect film with more plot holes than there are chinks in the Iron Man's steel suit but a very entertaining and polished product.Its major weaknesses is the length, a full 131 minutes may be bang for the buck or a slight drag depending on whether you are a Marvel comics fanboy or a regular moviegoer. Made on a jumbo budget of USD 200 million, IM3 is worth your time and money for all the fireworks on display, nearly eclipsed by Downey and Ben Kingsley, at their sparkling best.#Iron Man 3 seems to be a test case for Hollywood in China as it goes head to head with a small budget Chinese drama.The Chinese seem to be tired of the Hollywood pyrotechnics which is good news for all of us!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mix terminator 3 and IronMan 1 to get IronMan 3!,"Can you imagine mix of Iron Man and last Terminator movie? If you do - that's Iron Man 3! Downey Jr surely is a great actor and he's playing very well indeed. And the comeback of Gwyneth Paltrow to the widescreen is delicious. But the main opponent of Tony Stark played by Guy Pearce - that's the feature made this film worse watching. Surely the screenplay is still OK and there are some not-expecting moments in the movie. And finally the movie can't be bad having Paul Bettany just for voice-role! The actor's squad is cool in deed and they did a great job playing roles and mixing jokes with quality stunts.

Red is the new Black,"Oh man... this is so good in an unfamiliar way. It has rekindled the spark of a teenager trapped in the shell of a cynical adult movie goer.In a race that began in 2008 to be crowned Hollywood's Coolest and Most Awesome Superhero Movie, the score is now 3-1 with Iron Man on a two- point lead.The screenplay, co-written between Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) and Drew Pearce is cleverly penned and packs the right punch for an action movie. By drumming up the significance of Tony Stark's development from previous films (The Avengers, Iron Man 1 & 2) without losing grip of dramatic unity as a whole; Shane Black (also the film's director) conceptualized a heroically simple, winning formula.Another satisfying aspect of Iron Man 3 (and this converts to audience payoff at the end of 130 minutes), is the sweet simple fact that narrative does not detain viewers with unnecessary exposition and scenes. The big bad guys waste no time playing mind-games for the sake of delaying a final showdown, thus one-upping other blockbusters where it counts. Ergo, no shortchanging and an effortlessly fluid plot.Things kick off with a flashback to 1999 during pre-Iron Man days, establishing Tony Stark's first meeting with future adversary ‚Äî a then crippled scientist named Aldrich Killian. Desperate for resources from Stark Industries to develop experimental virus ""Extremis"" (yet turned away so unceremoniously), sets off rising malevolence from Killian (played by the unforgettable Guy Pearce, even more loathsome here than when he was hateful Charlie Rakes in Lawless). There's also brazen, immediate threat from a grim terrorist leader (Ben Kingsley's prowess and versatility in full glory here as both The Mandarin and Trevor Slattery) ‚Äî bent on blowing up America at whatever cost necessary. And for what it's worth, I like the spin on Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) damsel-in-distress anticipated ‚Äî compelling touch to an otherwise archetypal character.To further inject urgency in the conflict, Tony Stark wrestles with the aftermath of New York (from The Avengers) and taunts The Mandarin on national TV, further exacerbating his wrath. A strike against Stark's mansion hatches a loosely comedic, coming-of-age with 10 year old Harley ‚Äî it is here that leading man Robert Downey Jr. ingratiates himself as one of the best personality actors in Hollywood ‚Äî incensed with moral rage at the right moments, oozing unsentimental smooth in others.I had fun spotting flashes of nostalgia in favorite superhero moments (Spiderman, Superman, Batman and even Transformers) throughout the show as well, and still can't believe they destroyed a fine looking limited edition Dora the Explorer digital watch.

All's well except THE END!,"Well to start off, the movie had a great plot and amazing visual effects, would not even dare talk about RDJ, he is a class act and perhaps the most suited for the Tony stark role. The film almost rushes through as a joy ride, covering almost each and every aspect of Iron Man franchise- plot, emotions, brilliance in technical aspects, action, visual effects and most importantly the humorous Tony Stark.. The movie has its share of moments when you are just at the edge of street and are at times admiring the brilliance of a genius Stark possesses. What does come of as a surprise is that if you are aware of comic books, you would be knowing the looks of Mandarin, which might come out a little indigestible. Having said that it does not take away the credit that should be given to Shane Black for his effort. He has pulled off a great plot and would make you fall in love with RDJ all over again. The performances are great, Guy pearce is great in fact post Memento, to me he has looked pretty substantial NOW(That's a long time) Paltrow is impressive, whereas Sir kingsley seems a little too wasted for the movie, though he still creates an impact. It kills me to see such a class actor wasted. RDJ, let's not even discuss him, HE IS A CLASS APART. All in all a movie worth a watch and fun ride!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Solid Sequel,"When it was announced in 2009 that Disney had acquired Marvel for $4 billion
I thought ""Wow! Did they really need to, though?"" Well, when The Avengers came out as the first Marvel film distributed by Disney, I was blown away! I thought, ""Wow! I can't wait to see what they do with Iron Man 3 next year."" Fast forward to May 3, 2013. I'm in a sold out show of Iron Man 3, and I'm giddier than a nerd at Comic-con. (Compliment, because I consider myself a nerd too. So no offense meant fellow nerds.) What's the first thing I hear when the movie starts?A voice over narration by Tony Stark himself. Then something amazing happens. As the opening credits roll, I hear Eiffel 65's ""I'm Blue (Da Ba Dee).""
I have to cover my mouth to keep from cheering. Then it's awesome action scene after awesome action scene. I leave the theater so excited I can't sleep that night. And yes, I did see the scene after the credits, because, to misquote a famous Lord of the Rings character ""One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits."" (Tell that to half my theater though.) The basic plot of the film is this. Tony Stark needs to figure out how to balance out his life as Iron Man, and spending time with Pepper, while defeating the new menace called The Mandarin. I think Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely brilliant in this, but man that precocious ten year old kid whose name I forget, really stole the show. And now I hear he's signed on for 3 more Marvel movies, which he hasn't revealed yet. Awesome!

The inappropriate tone and motivation for a comic book movie make it the worst,"Unfortunately, Iron Man is the worst installment of the trilogy by far because it works more like a parody of Iron Man. I had expected something different, brilliant, genius etc. from Shane Black, ""a breath of fresh air"" but instead the movie was like an unlikeable parody as said with lots of further disappointing material! Despite I didn't find the first Iron Man film perfect, masterpiece etc. at least it was cool and solid. Yes, if I have to define the first Iron Man film with two words, that would be cool and solid! The second film was found mostly disappointing including me, because the main problem of the second movie was there was no ""spark"" in the movie (no pun indeed), it was lack of spark, suspense and excitement and it was more like a comedy drama than an action packed film. However, this is much worse. Most of the film consists of comedy, a little drama and Tony Stark without his Iron Man suit! In the first half, there is almost one big action sequence and that is the best sequence of the whole movie! The sudden attack part. Then, in the second half, there are a few action scenes more, but all of those are boring or unappealing. The main villain of the movie is like a joke, a result of a work of terrible writing, it wasn't genius, it was ridiculous. Probably the producers including Shane Black wanted the movie to be like The Dark Knight Rises. More realism less fantasy. More drama less action, but Iron Man 3 fails, because it doesn't work in this universe. There are more villains in the movie and mostly they looked ridiculous that somehow reminded me Superman 3. There is one more important villain in the movie and that is dated and clich√©. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you may think that if there are many villains in this movie, then the movie is going to be an action feast. No! Also, if you expect a bad-ass villain, I am sorry. In this movie, Tony Stark develops a new technology related to his armor and there are some twists about that. What a terrible, uninspiring idea! There are some moments that kill the spirit or the philosophy of Iron Man, there are some far fetched or exaggerating moments near the end related to Pepper Potts etc. etc. As for Mandarin, Kingsley's performance was amazing, what an actor! As for Jon Favreau, I think he is better as a director than ""funny moments"" tool as an actor. The movie is not funny, it tries to be funny in contrast with the first movie. The first movie was natural like spontaneous, the second and the third one just pushed too far. The first half of the film was pretty boring and uninspiring like the second half of Iron Man 2? Focusing on Bruce Wayne more rather than his alter ego Batman could work, I hate that either, but in this movie, it becomes the fatal mistake! Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie, it has not comic book feel at all, the cinematography is more like a flat comedy movie except for the visual effects and don't expect Tony Stark fighting as Iron Man throughout the movie! He rarely wears his costume, mostly he runs around as Tony Stark like a detective! The climax of the film was like The A-Team (2010) with some uninspiring action scenes. By the way, the misleading trailer is just another story! Ohh, Tony Stark in the hospital, Ohh, wait, lots of action, this time it looks like a darker film etc. etc. Also there is a big, real big plot hole near the end of the film (if you saw the movie, you know what I mean) In addition, the movie tries to be politic rather than entertaining or fanciful which is beyond terrible! And this is just a guess, the young boy could be The Iron Man of the future like ""Young Indiana Jones"" when Tony Stark gets old, ""quits the job"" or dies. It was just a sense from me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

My Review after the 2nd viewing,"I wanted to review this film, but I felt I needed to wait until I saw the film a second time to pass final judgment. My score of 7 stands, but for different reasons than the first time watching.Firstly, I was one of the people who were massively disappointed by the way Mandarin was handled. This was my main reason for waiting until a second viewing to review. But even before that letdown, I just felt like the film wasn't fitting in with the other Iron Man films.After my second viewing, I focused some of my points. When it comes to The Mandarin, I accept the value of a good surprise in a film, which that was. I also understand that many people didn't know what a main villain the Mandarin was in the comics, so I can see how many saw this as a cool twist.The second sitting also helped me articulate the main thing that makes this sequel not totally line up with the others for me. Basically, it's Shane Black. Shane Black is an awesome action writer, no doubt about it, and I love so many of the films he has written. That being said, so many of his themes from other movies are reused here and it makes it feel like more of a Shane Black action film than an Iron man film. Also, I kind of have a resentment toward having a little kid help the hero (it has been done way better in other movies, IMO). The young actor was good, I just feel that his part was a little...Shortround-y.The action in this movie is great, all the actors put in good performances (especially 2013's go-to summer movie supporting actor James Badge Dale, this guy needs a lead role!) The plot , like I said has a huge twist. However, the ""going back to where it all started"" plot device is a bit tired, especially in a third movie. The story veered awfully close to Spider-Man 3 territory here. If one or two more coincidences from the past had been shoved in, it would have been really hard to buy. While it was a stretch, I am able to buy it this case, but just barely. The problem with reaching back and altering the past in a film is that you risk tainting the original story. The core Iron Man story did not get tainted here, but I'd be lying if I said the ""revelations"" in this film didn't make the past mythology murky for me. Aldrich Killian, briefly, was not a fully satisfying villain for me. I thought that Guy Pearce was great but since I wasn't really on board with the ""enemy from the past"" plot, I found him the least entertaining villain so far. Ben Kingsley, like the Mandarin or not, is hilarious.The ending of Iron man 3 is very fitting, especially if it is the last time we see RDJ in a solo Iron man film. I think the 'arc' of Tony Stark's character is really dealt with well in the movie and the ending was very satisfying to me, even if the journey was a bit hard to swallow. Overall, I give it a c+. Easily my least favorite in the series and the only one that I feel I have any actual complaints about. Marvel's Track record is still pretty darn good in my book.

Good fun,"I'm not a big fan of Marvel movies, I often find that they lack depth and are too unrealistic (and not because of superhero stuff cause you would expect that to be that way). But I didn't have anything to watch and It was recomended to me by someone who also isn't too big of a Marvel fan, so I finally decided to watch it. I absolutely loved this movie, especially the first half. I think what really made me love this movie was the character of Tony Stark. We got to see him struggle in this movie a lot, and most of the movie he wasn't even in his suite so he was more relatable, at least to me.

Franchise still flying high,"A Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr, brilliant as always) who is having trouble sleeping, experiencing panic attacks, and in therapy? Clearly Ironman found the battle in ""Avengers Assemble"" a tough outing and we have here a more nuanced super-hero narrative. But he can't simply be left to finesse his collection of metallic outfits and enjoy his live-in partner 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow with an amazingly flat stomach for a mother of two) because there are new villains on the rampage. One is uber- terrorist The Mandarin (a wonderful performance from the British Ben Kingsley), another is science entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Australian Guy Pearce who, as in ""Lawless"", exhibits real callousness), while a third is one-time Stark girlfriend Maya Hansen (another Brit in the pleasing shape of Rebecca Hall).Third time round, Jon Favreau has handed over the directorial reins - but retained his cameo acting role - to Shane Black who is also co-writer (his original profession as in the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise). Also we have the fashionable use of 3D which does not always enhance the production (often the action is too fast to really appreciate the extra dimension). So this is an entertaining, if unoriginal, romp with the requisite action leavened by wry humour.As with the previous ""Iron Man"" movies, if you sit through endless technical credits, you'll be rewarded with a short extra clip but this time we are not set up for the next segment in the franchise but have an explanation of my therapy allusion. Many franchises sag at the third offering (think ""Alien"" or ""Superman"") but ""Ironman"" is holding up well and, after this extra clip. we are reassured that ""Tony Stark will return"" which is good news.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A little Rusty...,"Marvel has dug themselves in deep with Avengers. Woe to any other family friendly superhero blockbuster to ever come out as it will forever be held against the standard set by Avengers. Woe to Iron Man 3, which not only stacks up badly against Marvel's prior superhero film but falls victim to sequel degeneration.Our story takes place after the events of The Avengers and Tony Stark is having anxiety attacks after his near death experience in New York city fighting off an alien invasion. At the same time, he is trying to be a good boyfriend to Pepper Potts in order to ""protect the one he loves"". But in comes an old rival Alderich Killian who either wants to seduce Pepper with his snakelike suaveness or just loves acting like the bad guy he is. Meanwhile, the terrorist leader ""The Mandarin"" has launched a slew of attacks around the world in order to teach America ""a lesson"". Quite a heavy start to the movie. Until, that is, one particular Mandarin attack hits close to home, putting previous Iron Man director Jon Freveau into a coma (hence perhaps why Shane Black took his job). Tony is furious and in his ego fueled anger does the stupidest thing in all superhero history: he gives his address on public television! As expected, villains attack his house and kidnap his girlfriend. So much for wanting to ""protect the one he loves"". Tony is forced to go into hiding and fight back, without the help of his high tech armor, against genetically enhanced foes with melting magma powers.Here is the only genius move this film makes: letting Tony Stark kick ass without his high tech armor. The hero known as iron man is not bound by thus it of armor, but he is the man inside. Tony Stark is iron man and no one else can be him. With only his wits, ingenious mind and resourcefulness, Tony proves himself a true hero. However, these moments are handled less like character development and more like another ""tony is awesome""sequence. Stark still has the same jerk ass attitude from previous films, still has his planet sized ego; it seems that all that has happened to him since he first chose to become Iron Man had not changed him at all.What did change was all the elements taken from the original comic books. The human bombs from Matt Fraction's Invincible iron man series have been haphazardly combined with Warren Ellis' Extremis concept. The end result is not the ""next stage of augmented human evolution"" as per the comics but quite literally ""melter people"". Yes there is an iron man villain called The Melter whose powers is to melt things. Not sticking to the source material is fine, but blatantly poking fun and insulting the source material is a totally different matter. Case in point: the mandarin.Simply put, the mandarin is meant to be Iron Man's dark opposite: mysticism against might, Supernatural against science. If Tony Stark were Batman, the Mandarin is his Joker. But Shane Black and pals took that character to the crap pile. Instead of being the analogy for the nature of modern terrorism as promotional material for the film claimed, the Mandarin is revealed as a complete joke. First, they ripoff the ""big reveal"" from Batman Begin's Ras Al Ghul. Then, like some kid's lousy April Fools prank they spit on the very character of the Mandarin turning him from the Monarch of Mayhem into the dysfunctional love child of Austin Powers and Mr Bean.With all its special effects flair and big budget action pieces, Iron Man 3 cannot decide whether to take its subject matter seriously or not. Just as they are going into some good politics or philosophy, we cut to another comedy act for cheap laughs courtesy of Robert Downey jr. His acting is great, everyone's is. But the way it is handled breaks the tone of the movie. You have a film with unlimited potential for surfacing some serious political and philosophical subject matter. You have a film that could show a flawed character coming full circle with his heroes' journey. You have a film.......that does nothing of that sort and is perfectly content with being a comedy ridden summer blockbuster complete with an irritating kid sidekick for Iron Man.Lesson: If you want to tackle serious subject matter, make a serious film and take the villain seriously. Iron Man 3 reeks of unoriginality, drawing many elements from The Dark Knight trilogy: hero loses everything and goes into exile, hero faces an adversary who turns out to nothing but a ""front"" for a more sinister bad guy, hero is trying to be a good boyfriend but endangers his loved one, hero is forced to rely on his wits alone without fancy gadgets, hero wipes the slate clean in the end and starts anew. Familiar? Of course it is. No doubt the casual movie goer will be drawn in with spectacular fight sequences, big budget special effects and Robert Downey Jr's charisma. Oh and obviously by good ""word of mouth"" from the success of The Avengers. to No doubt Iron Man 3 will be a big hit by riding on the success of The Avengers. And at very least, it paints a successful trilogy whose first film gave birth to Marvel's cinematic universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow!  Was It Really That Bad?,"My goodness. I've just read a series of reviews of this film. I had no idea it was so bad. I guess I'll have to un-enjoy it. Is that a word? I'm just an old guy who likes to go to movies. While I read comic books as a child, I never really let them dictate my very existence. My pain has been watching the Minnesota Vikings for 50 years and having them never win a Super Bowl. The angst over this movie is nearly startling. To make the fact that the studio took liberties with the characters may be disappointing, but the sun will come up tomorrow. I taught literature for over 40 years and I never saw a movie that aligned well with a book. Granted, some movies were actually improvements. Most of the time they were not. Since I didn't know Manderin, I didn't go in thinking he was Iron Man's sworn enemy. The rules were changed and the villains altered. I thought it was a very exciting movie. It had all the cliffhanging events required of an adventure. Special effects allow us a range of spectacle we could not have imagined. Downey and his smug, aloof being are quite delightful. And I felt for the most part that things went as they should. I have seen the other two movies and thought they were also fun. Unlike the fanboys, I don't have the energy to figure out the rule being followed by the players. I need to know how to defeat this guy who has evolved to a horrible force. That is, if you hit him with an i-beam 600 times, which one kills him, or do they kill him? We aren't told. Or are we? Part of any plot or quest is that the hero must face his own shortcomings and rise to the task and (now get this) with knowledge of what it takes, defeat evil. Much like the mercury man in Terminator 3, I was not sure exactly what needed doing; do we melt him, crush him, dismember him, throw him in a pit of molten metal. I don't know. Kind of left me a little cold.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Becoming iron man fan,OMG!! How the marvel studios has managed to make their greatest star to a great movie I have to say this that there should be appreciation for marvel studios or such a great film.Basically I am both DC and marvel comics fan but I hope that the character ill be taken into another level in future films.In this film I like the action scenes as well as the graphics story and whatever and I have to say that they had made such a beautifully film and they had also make great use of their budget.Robert Downey Jr. His efforts has taken this franchise to an another level and I have to say that he is the real iron man he totally suits for this role he is born for this role.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man 3,"Arriving before its North American landing, IRON MAN 3 pulls off a momentous debuting in its international market, I saw it in a plain 2D version and, about this franchise, IRON MAN (2008, 8/10) is a left field coup, a middle-aged superhero to clinch the youth-dominated market, only Robert Downey Jr. could nail it with dapper openness and wisecracking debonair. So within six years span, a fourth cranked-out (if one counts THE AVENGERS 2012, 5/10) comes on strong this year to ignite the summer powder keg. Personally I skipped IRON MAN 2 (2010) though I still possess the DVD, and the only reason why IRON MAN 3 interests me is the Chinese element, reportedly three Chinese actors are on the slate of the cast, Xueqi Wang, Bingbing Fan and Jing Wu, but it turned out to be an utter scam, only Xueqi Wang appeared in about 3 seconds in 2 fleeting scenes with one line ""Nihao"" (""hello"" in Mandarin) and so is Ben Kingsley's ""The Mandarin"", the ostensible ringleader of the terrorists (more Al-Qaeda than mandarin).So what this new episode has offered to its devoted fanboys apart from the cookie-cutter template of the mega-Superhero action flicker? Since there are no succour from his fellow The Shields' teammates, Iron Man 3 perfunctorily opts to mass-produce the iron-clad robots to rescue the world (perish the undying human mutants), a lame and opportunist move to simplify the mess it creates and spurn any logistic plausibility (at least notify us how to kill mutants for good since they can regenerate themselves under any terms of damage), not to mention the cliffhanging twist of Pepper Potts, maybe it is all written in the next sequel.Fans will never get enough of raking and levelling, it is undeniable that the demolition of Stark's mansion is visually stunning and apocalyptic, and the esprit-de-corps of the plane-wrecking rescue is also worth the wait (thanks to the telltale trailer), but in the end, the inevitable face-off is a kill-joy, compared with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012, 8/10), IRON MAN 3 looks as feckless as a light-hearted comedy, and its success can mainly be indebted towards Mr. Downey's omnipotent appeal, a rakish fop who owns everything and is sternly faithful to his partner (although a certain degree of promiscuity is a requisite), and more alluring, he can create superheroes.Paltrow has more action sequences demanding out of her gaunt physique, and also shoulders a turnabout climax in the end, but still a trophy secretary-lover. Guy Pearce is a common-or- garden villain here (not as remotely interesting as in LAWLESS 2011, 8/10 last year), Ben Kinsley on the other hand, is the comic relief (besides Tony Stark) here, wackily inconsequential but a timely buffer from the intensified situation. Don Cheadle is ham-fisted as the other iron fighter and Rebecca Hall does evince cursory nuances for her expendable character. Among others, James Badge Dale (from SHAME 2011, 9/10 and FLIGHT 2012, 7/10) finally found his stepping- stone into mainstream showbiz, his indestructible henchman even makes his boss pale in comparison.A puff of fresher air comes from the interaction between Stark and a fatherless boy (Ty Simpkins) at a rustic Tennessee setting, with jocular ripostes and a paternal bond affectingly enriches Tony Stark's personality and one plainly wishes this part would be more to offer. However, as the turnover rate has been accelerated dramatically these years in the superhero assembly-line, IRON MAN 3 is a serviceable vehicle to appease its core audience's anticipation, and if put into a larger picture, it is not innovate enough to be a game-changer as its prototype, it is just another helluva sequel, trite but lucrative. But it will be a sad sack if Mr. Downey keeps churning out the persona into his fifties, it could be a grand farewell for the trilogy, and future cameos are warmly welcome.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Top 3 Reasons to see Iron Man 3,"Here we go, and don't worry...No spoilers here.1- Tony Stark has been one of the best developed characters on the big screen, comic book movie or not, it's hard to argue. In the Avenger's Captain America said to Tony ""Take away the suit of Armor and what are you?"" I think this movie was almost created to answer that question. This film does really show what drives Tony and how even without the suit, he IS Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, you will see how all the events of the first 2 IM films and the Avengers have shaped, molded, and changed Tony, for better or for worse. Like I said, one of the best developed Characters ever...hats off to the Marvel Gang and New-comer (To Marvel films) Director/Co-writer Shane Black.2- The Score, the original music composed for the Film, was mighty, pulse-pounding, and highly thematic. I'm one of those nuts who really pays attention to what the score does for a film. Most scores do well to just accompany the film, others take it to a new level. The IM1 score had a really energetic and modern beat to it, it suited it really well. The IM2 score, really fell flat for me, it did not hearken back to the score of IM1 and although it didn't take away from the film, it certainly didn't enhance it. The score for IM3 had some resonance from IM1 but brought a whole new flare, and a lot of heart. Well done composer, Brian Tyler.3- The Hardware, yes I did emphasize how well the movie does to show who Tony is without the suit, but it once again shows just how genius he is with his suit...errr...in this film's case, suits. The suits are big nod to some of the awesome suits that have been created over decades in the comics, and their purpose in the film is well played out. I was particularly impressed at how the Mark 42 (The mostly gold suit that he wears in the film) was utilized, so many different scenarios occurred with it. Once again, well done, IM3 Team.Now, these are by no means the only things I enjoyed, but my ""Top 3 for Iron Man 3"", there are plenty of other reasons to give love to this film, but much of those are too ""spoiler-y"". So, if you haven't already seen or made plans to see Iron Man 3, go do yourself a solid and make those plans to do so and enjoy another adventure with Tony Stark, The Armored Avenger.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Okay movie with an excellent cast,"This is a movie that falls under the category for me as needing 2 views to fully appreciate it. If your a devoted Iron Man fan familiar with the comics and the many cartoons he's been in you are likely to want to walk out halfway through. If your only experience with Iron man is the current Marvel movies you'll love it. The movie has excellent action, excellent special effects and Robert Downey jr is at the top of his game with his best performance yet. The advertising of this film is its main fault. The trailers promised a more serious movie and the arrival of the long anticipated nemesis of Iron Man, the Mandarin. Without giving much away it fails to meet both those things which is why I have to dock a star for the deception and for the lack of interest in pleasing the hardcore fans who after all is why these characters got popular enough to bring to the big screen. That being said this movie is a lot of fun and better than the second although still cant top the charm and perfect balance of humor and action the first movie had. There is a lot of fun to be had and aside from some small plot holes and one shockingly odd twist its one of the better marvel movies to date. Im not your movie goer whose is woed into loving a movie due to its action content or special effects as many people are, i look for character development and good story and this movie has all of that and some great action as well. I will say I felt Iron Patriot ( formerly War Machine) was yet again not given his due which is a bummer since this is the last solo Iron Man movie. Hopefully he turns up in the Avengers 2 and is given the role he deserves. Well worth the watch, skip the 3D though...not noticeable in the least bit and I have a 3D TV so I know good 3D versus bad and this qualifies as bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a JUN–ö!,"As you can tell by username, I'm a fan of a certain comic book character whom this (terrible) movie have ruined. However, I don't want to make it look as if the only thing that is wrong with this movie is how it mishandles that character - hell no. This movie is bad, no doubt. But the reason why it's bad has nothing to do with the way this movie mishandles that particular character. My main gripe about this movie is the script. The script is awful by all accounts. I understand that not every comic book movie can have a well-written script that is on the level of Nolan's Batman films, but I at least expect something tolerable. This? This is JUN–ö! A big, stinky, poorly put together JUN–ö. The characters are inept caricatures with no personalities. The story is basically Incredibles meets Lethal Weapon, but only it's not as fun or entertaining as those movies. It must really suck if you as a screenwriter can't make your own movie and you have to steal ideas from lame cartoon that was made decade ago. But besides terrible screenplay - make no mistake - the movie has the most incompetent direction imaginable. Even with a bad script you can make decent movie if you are capable filmmaker. Unfortunately, whatever credentials Shane Black had in the past, it doesn't matter here. Here, his awful direction is unbearable. The tone is flimsy, the character interaction is lame, the story structure is poorly connected. If you had told me that this movie was directed by a crippled dog with a brain tumor, I would believe you. But, what is also terrible, is that Robert Downey Jr. doesn't care anymore. His acting is mediocre at very best. There is no emotional impact from his acting. It feels very superficial and forced. And now, imagine, that besides all those glaring problems, you also have the twist with the main villain - The Mandarin. The Mandarin twist in this movie is the equivalent to this: imagine if you had big pile of cr–∞p, and then on top of that pile of cr–∞p someone would had poured a bucket of p—ñss. That's basically the definition of Mandarin's twist in this movie. All in all, if you want a good Iron Man vs. Mandarin story, that is fun, entertaining, smart, and action-packed, go get trade paperbacks of Enter The Mandarin, Dragon Seed Saga, Hands of the Mandarin, Revenge of the Mandarin, and The Future. Those stories are what this movie should've been.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man What!?,"Review on Iron Man 3: Last night I saw this movie and honestly it was not what I expected. Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, great way to start off the summer blockbusters but it was a bit off from the way the trailers and posters made the film to be out. I had high expectations for this film and I have to say they were somewhat met. Though certain scenes were funny I honestly could not believe where the film ended up at.Trust me if you go see this film it will throw you off at some point and the post credits scene funny but disappointed a lot of people so I let you be the judge of that. Overall great time seeing this film and if it is the last iron man 3 in this series, Perfect way to end an awesome trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extremely gratifying and superb in every way!,"They took what worked so well in Iron Man and even Iron Man 2 to a degree and ran with it in an extremely gratifying way with this third installment. The complexity, depth, heart and action were even more off the charts than the first film. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are raving about Iron Man 3. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one, developed in movie two and built upon it masterfully. We get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer mixed with an anxiety ridden celebrity who is having trouble living that celebrity life after the events of Iron Man 2 and Avengers. His playboy ways are over but everything else in his life makes little sense to him now. I love that they haven't forgotten where the character has been. It's what makes Marvel really sing and why they have an edge that most other movies don't have or care to cultivate. They also upped the action but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film than the last and I'm one that enjoyed Iron Man 2. Anyone wondering why Tony didn't just call his new Avenger/SHIELD buddies that's answered in the film. Also, there's going to be a LOT of talk about certain plot twists but I hope people see it before certain twists are on the Net. Anyway, everything fits together wonderfully and in a moving and exciting fashion.When I was done viewing this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great sequels. What I said about classics like Spider-Man 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back, and even Godfather 2 holds true for Iron Man 3. Notice anything about that last sentence? Not many films with the number three are called great. Iron Man 3 will certainly work towards changing that from here on out. It's a great film with or without a number.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much more realistic & darker then the others. To me that really helped the movie. Must see others before you see this. I say B+,"""Old days, never thought they'd come back to bit me. Why would they?"" After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) has changed. He has become more obsessed with his work and by throwing everything he has into it he thinks he won't have to deal with those events. After a terrorist attack effects one of his closest friends he goes one step further and tells the man behind the attacks to ""bring it on."" That off the cuff remark changes everything and effects everyone around him. I have never been a huge comic book movie fan. My main reason is because they are mainly nothing but how many explosions can we have. The Iron Man movies started a change where the acting and story become front and center. While the other Iron Man's were fun and comical this one was more dark and interesting. It is hard to make a movie like this realistic. The fact that they made this movie about terrorism really helped root the movie in reality even with all the comic book elements going on. There are a lot of little things in this I did have problems with but for the most part I was very entertained and that is what is important in a movie. Also just as a heads up you do need to watch both Iron Man and The Avengers movie in order to get everything that is going on. Overall, little things that bothered me didn't take away from the enjoyment. I give it a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"It was nice, full of comic and Iron Man suits","I have not been a huge fan of any movie that drags longer than just two parts, for that reason I delayed in watching this new Iron man, in fact the last one wasn't so great so I wasn't expecting much here, but boy was I impressed. When Disney took over Marvel this was one movie that I knew took in some cash to get done and I was skeptical, as to me cash is not what makes good movies, it is good stories, well Iron man 3 had a good story and the supporting cast were just off the hook. The movie had a nice comic feel, and the action scenes were relentless, the writers were always leaving me speechless by the turn of events making me eager to see where the movie was going.The writers decided to keep all things on the level of science, in the Iron Man comic book series the Mandarin is his archenemy and he is portrayed to be a genius scientist and an extremely skilled martial artist. The Mandarin showcases some powers which sources are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Here in this movie the Mandarin is just a face of the true villain and there is no evidence of him having a common sense, the move had a pure scientific genius hiding behind the face of Mandarin.The movie picks up with a flash back of when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) was having a New Year's Eve party, there he met scientist Maya Hansen. Maya was working on an invention called Extremis‚Äîan experimental regenerative treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries. Maya wanted to work with Stark to make this drug work, but Stark rejected the offer.Years later, Stark's experiences during the alien invasion of New York were making him restless. Out of that he built several dozen Iron Man suits, all tied to work with his subconscious, this act created friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). A terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has been the orchestrator of a string of bombings all done with no forensic evidence to trace the type of bomb used. When Stark Industries security chief Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is badly injured in one such attack, Stark overcomes his stupor and issues a televised threat to the Mandarin.That led to Mandarin retaliating bringing down Starks home and the world thought Stark died, so Stark used his now presume state to hunt down the Mandarin and discovered that the Mandarin is not who he thought he is.This movie is clearing cash in the box office, and I believe it will cross the 1 billion mark soon, so if you have not seen this movie, I wonder what you are waiting forwww.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good... but not as good as the rest.,"How can you not like any of the Iron Man movies? They are exciting, funny, clever, and original. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Tony Stark. Of the 4 movies (including Avengers) this was my least favorite however.Having said that, however, this is NOT an unfavorable review. I loved Iron Man III. I just don't think it was as strong as the previous 3 movies.My main issue with the movie was the lack of actual Iron Man in it. You rarely get to see Iron Man in all of his glory, and then when you finally do, he is easily ripped apart by the enemy. Other than that, Tony Stark is great as usual, and the movie has all of the great one-liners, funny moments, and action that you would expect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Start for the Post-Avengers Marvel Films!,"I personally loved this film. I can understand why some are outright calling this a disappointment and a failure. Big Iron Man fans will most likely hate the film for what it did to the Mandarin. I won't spoil what they did for anyone reading this who has not yet seen the film but just know that they do something with the Mandarin that will leave many Iron Man fans enraged. I get it and I'm not saying calm down. If they did something like that to Joker in 'The Dark Knight' I would hate that film. Though I did roll with the twist and still enjoyed the film immensely and in my opinion it only got better as the film continued. Iron Man 3 started off the summer movie season in the right way, just like 'The Avengers' did the year prior.I loved the first 'Iron Man' film and while I don't hate it, I thought 'Iron Man 2' was disappointing and unnecessary. As far as Iron Man himself goes he's not in the movie much except a few times in the beginning and the huge climax at the end. This film focuses more on developing Tony Stark and showing that in essence he is Iron Man, not the suit. The suit and him are one and I love that the film addresses that so thoroughly. I love that the film goes in a different direction than the other films, which is expected since Shane Black has now replaced Jon Favreau at the helm as the director. Iron Man 3 is the darkest of the Iron Man films while also have the most humor out of all of them. There was one scene with this kid that had me dying and marveling at how Tony actually said something like that. Like the first Iron Man film, Tony Stark is placed in a position where he doesn't have all his gadgets and he has to win using his intellect. Which demonstrates that the suit is not his greatest weapon, his mind is. Once again Robert Downey Junior is in the lead role and kills it as Tony Stark and I cannot imagine anyone else playing him at this point.Though some characters did not get as much development as they should have gotten, but Iron Man 3 did what it set out to do and it did it very well. Also I don't know get what some fans are saying by calling the story a mess. How is it a mess? Sure, a lot of things happen but everything plays out very well and comes to a fine conclusion, albeit the ending is rushed.I stand by that Iron Man 3 was a greatly enjoyable installment into the Post-Avengers Marvel Universe and left me very happy and satisfied. Though, my only fear is what Joss Whedon will do with 'Avengers 2' now which he himself has stated as well. Again I won't spoil what happens but know that it has to do with Tony Stark and if you've watched the film I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sharp and engaging!,"This is a great movie, if you don't hate the action movie genre you'll most likely really enjoy it. If you liked Iron Man 1 but 2 not so much, you'll love 3.Great acting by Downey Jr. as usual. He keeps true to the brilliant, egotistical but moral Tony Stark, now trying to cope without much success with all that happened during The Avengers (like the fact that there are aliens). Many more innovations to the Iron Man suits in this one since Stark uses that as a diversion from his troubles. Kingsley was probably underused but acted his part well, as did Paltrow and Guy Pearce. The action scenes were all non-routine, brilliant and well executed and were plenty. Jarvis kicks ass like always.The plot I felt was quite good and not run of the mill at least as far as action flicks go. There was a good amount of emotional depth to the characters and their motives as well as a nice banter between Stark and some random kid he meets and a nice bit of comedy throughout the movie along with a twist in the middle and a few nice surprises here and there.The 2 hrs just buzzed by and I would definitely end up watching this movie again.

This is amazingly an unique story, followed by the words and the acts which makes you go wow. I never felt taking a break in between and I was glued to my seat even after the movie ended.

Iron Man 3 is the Best Movie of the Year,"I love every Iron Man movie and I must say this one is the best of the trilogy. It surprised a lot, there is so many things that just surprise you in a way that I usually don't see in any movie. The action is spectacular in this one, and with the amazing soundtrack and new theme, you just love it. The special effects are just incredible, really incredible,it seems very real when you see it and it is a really good movie. The actors are INCREDIBLE as always. Robert Downey Jr. is just a really good actor, no one could ever replace him. Gwyneth Paltrow was astonishing, Don Cheadle just nailed it, Guy Pearce was extraordinary, Ben Kingsley is always a honor to have him aboard and everyone performed well on their roles.

"Not Great, But Not Bad","After having seen IM3 last weekend I thought it was at least as good as the first, but better than the second one. It was about the same as The Avengers. What some of the reviewers fail to remember is that the studios make movies to make money. Explosions, special effects and (or) stars sell tickets, therefore making money. Star Trek The Motion Picture is a perfect example. The trekkers, myself included, wanted the reunion of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest. The special effects and sets pushed Star Trek beyond the boundaries of TV. It wasn't a very good movie but people went to see it for the stars and special effects and it made MONEY!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just a Great Movie! The Best Solo Marvel Movie.,"I have to admit that I loved everything about this film but I did fall in love with the character the first time around. This movie is every bit as good as the first but even better in my opinion.They say luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. Well, Avengers gave this film the opportunity to move beyond what has come before and it appears there was a lot of hard work and thought that went in to making it because it's exceptional in every way. And, we are all lucky to get to see it. Iron Man 3 is exactly where and how the character should appear after the events of Avengers. I love the idea that after the Avengers Tony basically goes a bit crazy with paranoia and builds MANY new suits of armor just to be ready for anything. This really speaks to his mindset and where he is going from this point forth. It's true character development and advancement. Sometimes it's not all for the better but that's life and that's certainly what sets Marvel heroes apart from all others. The flaws and feet of clay are on display but the emotion and relatbilty are off the charts in this film. I can say the same thing about the action. There were some thrilling things that happened in the first two Iron Man films but NOTHING like we see in this movie.It's certainly on a par with Avengers. Iron Man 3 is the best solo film Marvel has made and that's high praise indeed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Vidiot Reviews,"Iron Man 3The benefit of a wealthy superhero is they can afford restitution for the public property they destroy.However, the hero's home in this action movie is what's being obliterated.Suffering PTSD from the Avengers Initiative, Iron Man inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) brazenly invites an attack from The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) that leaves his estate, and armour, in the ocean.Believed to have perished, Tony resurfaces in Tennessee - alive but armourless.With help from a kid (Ty Simpkins), Tony's forced to use his mettle - not his metal - to save his friends (Don Cheadle, Gwyneth Paltrow) and stop a virus created by Mandarin's weapons supplier, Advanced Idea Mechanics (Guy Pearce).The third, and arguably best, Iron Man, director/co-write Shane Black recaptures Tony's charm and humour amid amazing aerial battles against an unconventional villain.However, with that airtight armour, Iron Man missed his true calling as a beekeeper.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Is that all you've got? A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?,"That is what Stark's opponent shouts at him during one fight. Stark's response is ""Sweetheart, a cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner could be the name of my autobiography"". Audiences have already come to expect such witty and self-referential dialogue from the the great writer Shane Black. Who is Shane Black, you ask? Well, you may not know him but you have certainly seen a lot of his films. This man is responsible for the greatness and awesomeness of the Lethal Weapon franchise, the wise- cracking Bruce Willis in The Last Boy Scout or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( which also stars Robert Downey Jr.)Iron Man 3 was marketed as a story where Tony Stark would meet an opponent that would break him physically and mentally. It all looked very dark and gloomy. I'm glad to say that the end result is far from a dark and gritty movie. It is actually the exact opposite. This film is just as funny and action packed as the previous Iron Man films. The main difference is that this film has taken completely different approach than any other Marvel movie. This film isn't just your typical superhero has to fight a new enemy and in the end he wins story. This is a detective story, where our favorite billionaire, playboy philanthropist in his battle against The Mandarin is forced to go on a full-tilt investigation, revisiting crime scenes, digging through evidence and even interviewing witnesses. More than just being a detective story, what makes it a Shane Black detective story is the connections to the classic noir. Tony Stark is experiencing his darkest and toughest days due to post-traumatic stress from the Battle of New York (although in The Avengers he was fine, wise-cracking and joking around), he loses his home, his hunt for The Mandarin takes him through all kinds of crazy reveals and plot twists. There's even great voice-over narration just in the likes of Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. You get more Tony Stark than Iron Man. Which doesn't mean that there is less action. No, you get plenty of action scenes just most of them are Tony being out of the suit.Robert Downey Jr. has now become the living embodiment of Tony Stark. When you think of Downey, the first character you associate with him Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is just so believable in this role. I can't imagine any other actor in this role, it just wouldn't be such fun. Gwyneth Paltrow finally gets some action scenes. The banter between Downey's Stark and Paltrow's Pepper isn't that funny and light-hearted as in the previous films. Their conversations are now more serious since they are in relationship. Don Cheadle doesn't get much screen time as Col. Rhodes but this is the funnest his character has ever been. Shane Black establishes this Lethal-Waponesque relationship between him and Tony. Ben Kingsley, well, without spoiling anything you have never seen him like this. Few years ago Guy Pearce has started playing villains and bad guys. Well, I can't complain about him he is great as always but I would just want to see him once in a while as the good guy, that's all.Brian Tyler's score is much more darker but also much more melodic. Finally we get Iron Man's heroic theme which is truly kick-ass and great to listen to.Iron Man 3 is not the superhero film I was expecting but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I'm glad that all those trailers, clips and TV spots didn't ruin the film. I was a lot surprised at all the stuff happening in the film. This film is also great Christmas movie. Black explains why Iron Man 3 (just as lot of his other films are set at Christmas:""It's a time of reckoning for a lot of people, when you take stock of how you got to where you are now and lonely people are lonelier at Christmas and you tend to notice things more acutely. Well, that describes the character's story in this film quite a lot.P.S. The end-credits scene isn't a tease for the next Marvel film but it gives Iron Man 3 a nice narrative framework.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

better than Iron Man 2,"for me (a comic book reader) and all my friends (who are big fans of the marvel universe)we all really enjoyed it. Glad to see War Machine back, who I believe would of been great in the Avengers. Anyway, to the film. It was so so so funny, with the exact amount of action needed. The pace was like people said ""uneven"". But for me that only added to the twists and turns and unpredictability. It was also fab to see Stark without the suit (well for most of it)and I believe all the actors played there roles so very well. I was also surprised to see James Badge Dale perform such a harrowing role, so bloody well. Overall for me it is better than 2, maybe not as good as the original, but it has to be said they take on different routes and offer different experiences. 8.5/10 for me. Role on all the other steps of phase 2!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good comedy film... not the best for fans though.,"This film was a nice entry in the Ironman series, although probably not the film fans of the comics would of wanted. Being both, a fan of the films and comics I was perched on the fence with this one. First of all the cast were great Downey Jr is a brilliant Tony Stark and I thought the film was quite amusing in places, a great film for the casual fan. Although maybe fans of the comics should give this a wide berth. When I read that the Extremis storyline was going to be the basis of the film I was excited, but this film doesn't retain the dark brooding tone that I would come to expect from such a story arc. The mandarin character gets put through the ringer as well and could be seen as a bit of a middle finger to the fans (although Kingsley is pretty funny.) Anyway my least favorite film of the series but still a good, enjoyable film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A few electron volts above 1 and 2,"Filled past the brim with a tighter script with fewer quips and even more action than the previous two installments, Shane Black's take on the metal-man's saga is gripping, fantastic entertainment with a capital E. Guns, robots, robot suits, self-healing people who can regrow limbs, you know, the usual stuff.The new villain to enter the world of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is The Mandarin, a mysterious, disheveled terrorist who's supposed to bear quite the resemblance to Osama bin Laden (although bin Laden himself is referenced in the movie). The Mandarin orchestrates several attacks on the US, but, tellingly, the explosions leave no trace of actual bomb. The Mandarin terms these attacks as lessons for the American people, and as they escalate in stature a nation turns its lonely eyes to Mr. Tony Stark, who's still trying to mentally process the events of The Avengers.You might remember that in The Avengers, Iron Man temporarily sacrificed himself to save Earth by traveling through a worm hole and fighting off alien bad guys alongside Captain America, The Hulk, and Thor. For a man who up until that point was essentially a playboy who settled the occasional revenge/grievance, Stark has a lot to go through. Now he suffers from horrific insomnia (72 hours awake!) and night terrors. His place in the universe has been forever altered, and so has he psychologically. So he ensconces himself within his laboratory/basement and works on Iron Man suits to his heart's content, forty-something, actually, each one with different capabilities, each designed to defend the Earth against, well, anything.But this has made for a brooding superhero. He can't sleep, so he does what he does best - build - to the eternal chagrin of his love, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who's now head of Stark Industries (well, High Up, anyway). Tony's behavior both frightens and confuses her, and now this business with The Mandarin - will Iron Man get sucked into another adventure?Here's how this movie differs from its predecessors. We no longer see only the invulnerable, cocky, risk-taking Stark. This new Tony is much more like Batman, looking for a way to escape from his demons and not even knowing what those demons are. He suffers panic attacks and seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This makes for a much more evolved, shall we say, superhero. It ain't just about him anymore, or about Pepper. It's about the life, the universe, and everything. And his mortality shows, like the slip of a woman who's dressed hurriedly, and he doesn't like it one bit.I saw this movie in 3D. It's worth it, doesn't seem forced. I didn't bother with the IMAX, because I don't really need to be that immersed in a comic-book movie, but your mileage may vary. As far as I was concerned, the 3D was more than enough.Stark makes copious use of his technology, but there comes a time in the film when he has basically nothing with which to work. I'm talking no suit, no JARVIS, no Pepper, no lab, no nothing. He has to rely on his intelligence and creativity and resourcefulness - the very same traits that got him out of that cave in the first Iron Man movie. It's not an altogether pain-free experience.Don Cheadle returns as Rhodes, whom the government puts in the War Machine suit from Iron Man 2, repainted in red, white, and yes blue, sort of a nod to ol' Captain America, called Iron Patriot. Nifty, and it reminded me of the early part of the Captain America movie, in which Cap essentially has to sell out and perform as a sideshow act for the troops, to keep up morale. With a Good Guy robot on their side, the government is pleased - until...well, this is truly not a spoiler, but a resident baddie finds a way to control Rhodes' suit, and we next have a subplot regarding the abduction of the president and the true identity of The Mandarin (guess what - Stark's past is involved).Now, those who are avid followers of the comic books may well be unhappy with some changes. Deal with it. The movie is not in a different dimension from its cinematic ancestors, and that's really the correct comparison. Some minor characters may have changed a little from the comics. Does it mean the movie suffers? Of course not.There was a lot more humility than I'd come to expect from these movies, more humanity, more fear of mortality. That injection of reality, following so close behind the tragedies within The Avengers, makes this a very good genre movie. Yes, there are surprises, and yes, there are moments when your heart skips a beat, and yes, there are truly beautiful moments. But in all, this is a high-energy, hyperactive film that still manages to be philosophical and even regretful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not worth the wait,"I found this film to be very disappointing. I have been a huge Iron man fan since I was very young, so I have been looking forward to this film for about a year and a half. The main issue I had with this film, was It's misuse of key characters: like the Mandarin, James Rhodes, and Maya Hansen. The film instead focuses on a stupid kid sidekick, ""super pepper"" and a fire breathing Aldrich Killian. The lack of including S.H.I.E.L.D or the Avengers was also an ill advised decision made by the newly appointed director Shane Black who you may remember from predator or the end credits from the lethal weapon films. I would suggest seeing this movie if you have already seen: Place beyond the pines, 42, Oblivion, and Pain and gain. Which are all far better films, but If you must see Iron man 3 immediately, see it cheap. Because otherwise you will be upset for spending more then about 10 dollars on this film. Robert Downey jr. gives another strong performance as Tony Stark, and made me decide to give this movie a seven instead of five. Don't expect to see much of the main man in his metal suit though. Except during the last action scene which is very redeeming, and seems to have made most reviewers forget about the films flaws. Like I said this film is okay, but there are far better films out right now, and this one just isn't worth the ticket price.

Great finale for the Iron Man Trilogy,"It was overall a great movie to me.Lots of famous Marvel action scenes just like the Avengers, storyline continues from New York's alien attack.Kinda doesn't make sense to me though, how after an alien attack, why would there still be terrorists trying to kill each other as humans. But I guess it's how human natures are. Whenever there's nothing from out there, we kill each other...The ending, well, don't want to ruin y'all surprise, but it was definitely a bit sad to me.

"Brilliant: funny, deep and Downey Jr. at his best","I went into this feeling very excited and slightly nervous: excited because it's FRICKIN' IRON MAN, but nervous because, after the disappointing Iron Man 2 and then the triumphant comeback in the Avengers, I didn't really know how they were going to be able to come close to that level of fun and thrills in a stand alone film again. I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG TO EVEN DOUBT IT. It's everything Iron Man should be: Downey Jnr. IS Tony Stark , his lightning fast wit enhancing the cocky comic character. The action was intense and, surprisingly, not just confined to Stark's alter ego. There were genuinely hilarious moments when the theatre was in stitches, and Kingsley and Pearce were epic in their roles.....AND there were a number of twists and turns that kept the movie fresh. The most interesting aspect that sets it apart from the Iron Man we've seen previously, however, is the depth that we delve into Stark's psyche, reminiscent perhaps of Bond in Skyfall.But, even in the darkest moments, it's never too far away from a one-liner.And that's what makes it enjoyable: it balances the serious with the playful, never straying too much into Dark Knight or Batman Forever(I wouldn't even dare and try to mention 1997's Douche-Man and Slobbin) territory, respectively. Black's direction is great (Downey's wit harking back to the brilliant Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), and I would hope that, if there is to be another Downey Jnr. stand-alone, that he would get the nod to direct. So, overall: great villain(-s ????), great allies, great comedy, great action, great depth, great direction and, most importantly, PERFECT Downey Jnr............oh, and Gwyenth Paltrow really DOES have the ass of a 22 year old......and a set of abs Terry Crewes would shed a tear at.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Perfectly Serviceable Second Sequel,"I had to write, there are so many terrible reviews of this film - but most seem to be written by Marvel fans devoted to the character ""The Mandarin"".If you know who this character is going in, you may well be disappointed. I didn't. So I wasn't.Instead, what I got what a film that sees Tony Stark laid low and spending most of the film out of his iron suit and trying to rebuild from a tool shed with the help of a young boy. It's Tony Stark's ""Rocky 3"" if you like and for that reason, I enjoyed it.There are some plot holes but they are relatively minor ones. They could easily have been explained by a couple of clunky lines of exposition which the screenwriters wisely decided not to bother with - you can fill in the blanks yourself if you like. I think the real reason for the virulent backlash to this film are the fact that it doesn't fit with the characters as previously defined in the comics.But if you don't give a hoot about ""canon"" and ""mythos"" and the ""Marvel Universe"" and all that, then you'll be fine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man 3 (2013) Review - 7.3/10,"Although this film is an improvement over the last, it is still not that great. The Mandarin twist was actually pretty funny, I admit it, but he was shaping up to be a really good villain. Also, Aldrich Killian's backstory is something I just can't take seriously, which is another problem in this movie; it feels like a fan film. Not to discredit director, Shane Black, or any of the actors, I just wasn't feeling this movie. It wasn't that funny and it was a little too goofy at times. One good thing I will say about this flick is that the action (particularly the final fight) is probably the best in the Iron Man trilogy, to be honest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2nd viewing after 9 years,"When I watched it the first time it came to theaters I was bit disappointed, mainly because of the Mandarin.

So that was disappointing for many of us die hard fans. 9 years later, I am watching it again only for the 2nd time, and I have to say I loved every minute if it. Since I knew the Mandarin plot, there was no dissatisfaction this time and I could just soak in the movie. The action scenes are simply outstanding. This was an underated movie but it is just as entertaining, if not more than the 1st two installments.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst superhero movies ever! Succeeds in tarnishing the reputation of the first two films. A total decimation of the franchise.,"The Good - RDJ is great as usual and is well supported by the remarkable Guy Pearce. Some, and only some one-liners hit the mark. The action and visual effects are a dazzling treat to behold. And that's the end of it. There is nothing else in this movie that is truly good to write home about.The Bad - Where to even begin? This is one awful movie that shall take the studio a lot of soul-searching and fundamental reworking (irrespective of how much money this movie rakes in), in order to even attempt getting this great superhero franchise back on track. The direction is so shoddy that any recently passed out film school alumnus could have done a better job. The plot, characterization, story arc, and narration is simply all over the place and meanders along a confounding, restless, and disoriented path.Hardcore comic book fans and Iron Man aficionados like me will certainly spew vitriol at seeing Mandarin - one of the greatest comic book villains and one of the fiercest adversaries of Iron Man - being reduced to a mere gimmick. The character's gross misrepresentation simply cannot be overlooked. Add to this, the character of Aldrich Killian - who in reality is nothing more than a minion and a small-time foe of Iron Man - being given superiority and control over Mandarin, and any mildly interested follower of Iron Man will begin to wonder if it would have been more prudent to hire some avid comic book fans to harness this script.Even objective moviegoers without any predilections towards the comics, will be left largely dissatisfied at the total decimation of the narrative structure. This film is like a Hollywood 'Singham' or a 'Rowdy Rathore' in a superhero mold - that's how bad it is. Its nothing but a shrewd attempt to milk the cash cow and surreptitiously deliver insipid milk in a glossy packet to the unsuspecting audiences.Those who've been comparing this rancid somnolence to ""The Avenger"" and ""The Dark Knight"" - two of the greatest superhero movies ever - and those who claim that ""Iron Man 3"" amalgamates the tones of both the aforementioned films, have either been bribed handsomely by the producers or perhaps they have watched a completely different movie. This film is more analogous to such superhero stinkers like ""Batman & Robin"", ""Catwoman"", Spiderman 3"", ""Green Lantern"", and ""Superman Returns"".Quite simply, one of the worst superhero movies ever, and a real blemish on the reputation of the classic 1st installment and the vastly superior 2nd installment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Im not putting many details, but I will say I have always liked Shane Black and his signature is ALL OVER this movie. From the Christmas theme, to the plucky kid its all there.

"'Iron Man 3‚Ä≤ Creates a Better Hero, but Forgets About the Villains","Exactly one year after Joss Whedon's The Avengers, audiences every where have been anxiously awaiting Marvel Studios' Iron Man 3. You would think with how successful The Avengers has become, Iron Man 3 should have no problem coasting toward success. Financially, Iron Man 3 should do gangbusters ‚Äì it already has overseas ‚Äì but since Marvel has opened Pandora's box to a greater cinematic universe, the true victory will rely on whether this film can hold up on its own without the crutch of the other Avengers.The first of it's kind, no other film has ever taken on the burden of being the sequel to two separate stories. Although both Iron Man movies and The Avengers are part of the same universe, Iron Man 3 must be looked at from both angles differently. Marvel has now forced this upon all of its properties. This may work well in the comic book world, but can it feel right when it is on the big screen? With that said, director Shane Black had a huge weight on his shoulders to deliver not only a comprehensible Iron Man sequel, but also a continuation of where The Avengers left off.A lot happens in Iron Man 3, but luckily Shane Black never makes it difficult to follow. Black and co-writer Drew Pearce have developed a terrific screenplay for Tony Stark to grow as a character while also writing a shining example of how a superhero can stand up when the chips are down. For a good portion of the movie, Tony can be seen without his armor and how we see him deal with this situation makes for wonderful entry into the superhero genre. Robert Downey Jr. couldn't have been any better as Tony Stark ‚Äì it's almost as if he was born for this role. If this is the last time we see him portray this character, he certainly goes out with a bang.With a lot of the emphasis placed on Tony in this film, sadly we are not granted a lot of time with the villains to explore their motivations. Their intentions are clear to some extent, but not all their plans seem logical or thought out. Not completely understanding the villains' goals provides very little tension or immediacy for Tony to save the day. Extremis, especially, is also never explained into detail and the rules of how the treatment works on different people is vague. There is a very bizarre twist that goes off canon from the comics that will cause a huge divide among movie goers that I see as a huge downfall for potential Iron Man films. I didn't hate it, but it's not something I truly cared for.All of the performances are top notch, especially from Sir Ben Kingsley. He works The Mandarin like it was second nature. Gwyneth brings even more vivacity to Pepper that positions the character very well in the end. Rebecca Hall was unfortunately wasted as an actress and not given much to do, but Guy Pearce does a fine job bringing life to a character with little depth.The direction of the story was handled well, but one of the biggest problems I had was with the pacing. Certain moments are rushed without giving them time to marinate, especially the points where Tony's character arc changes and then again at the very end. This movie is filled to the brim with exposition and subplots, but if it had a little more time to expand certain areas while fine-tuning others Iron Man 3 could have been knocked it out of the park.Iron Man 3 is grittier and more raw on every level ‚Äì far more adult than any other Marvel Studios film to date. It could have easily obtained an R-rating if Shane Black had his way. Technically it is on par with what we have come to expect from a Marvel superhero movie. It is visually superior to a lot of the CGI creations we see today too, but the 3D is less to be desired. On many levels Iron Man 3 holds well to the Marvel cinematic style, but at the same time Black infuses his own flare which differs greatly from that of Jon Favreau in Iron Man and Iron Man 2.As a sequel to Iron Man 2, this film is solid. It vastly improves the scope of Tony Stark's impact on the world and is a great stand alone edition to the Iron Man franchise. But as a sequel to The Avengers this film fails on many levels. There are references to the team and what happened in New York, but nothing that could tie this film to the bigger picture. Not even S.H.I.E.LD. plays a role in this film and at no point are we told where anyone else is to get a sense of why they could not come to Tony's aide. You would think with all the terrorist threats, someone from The Avengers or S.H.I.E.L.D. would come into play if the life of the President is in danger. Nope.For anyone who loves what Marvel is doing and goes in expecting a great Iron Man film, you'll be treated to a fantastic ride. And those hoping for another movie on scale of The Avengers may leave a bit disappointed. Iron Man 3 is a decent stand alone Iron Man movie, but in no way does it succeed as a continuation of The Avengers.

entertaining Marvel franchise film,"Marvel films are not for everyone, I accept that. I am not an expert, and so cannot judge Iron Man on technical Marvel merit, but on the basis of a film about a likable character, by known brilliant actor (Downey Jr). Paltrow is watchable in this film and many people have commented that it's one of her best roles; I usually like her (especially Sliding Doors and Shakespeare in Love) and she was no less good in this than I expected. Downey Jr and his comedic timing and dry straight style - always incredible deep into character - weren't disappointing but the stars were Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley, particularly the latter. Don Cheadle also reassuringly good and the child actor Ty Simpkins was perfectly cast and not at all annoying (as many child actors are). I could listen to Paul Bettany all day so him as the voice of the suit/computer was very pleasant ;-)The CGI was obviously front and centre with all the SFX, which is expected, and for the most part it wasn't obvious (aside from where the laws of physics made it necessary) except for a few places where I got annoyed. Generally though it was seamless with real action, and some of the SFX were brilliant especially the 'running hot' bodies of the terrorist army - especially Pearce. The script was witty and clever for the most part, but a little staccato and without much depth but it did the job and for such a visual film it was sufficient. Without the SFX and the absorbing skill of the actors, this film would have faltered as it really was a visually attractive experience even on a small screen. I was gripped all the way through, which I didn't expect and was emotionally involved with some events in the film. Really did enjoy Ben Kingsley and the humour, for me, added a great deal to the film. Not much in the way of life changing or expanding experience in watching this film, but in terms of entertainment - even for a super-hero/comic book franchise - I enjoyed and gave it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What was that,"Wow. This movie really didn't capture anything that was special from the first iron man. The gritty-comedic tone set the bar pretty high from the get go, then iron man 2 was released and it was a disappointment.Iron Man 3 however, was even worse then the second one. 6 extremely bad issues with the film:1.) Comedy If i wanted to see a comedy, i would have seen a different movie. NOT IRON MAN 3! This movie is nothing more then snippy one liners and referrals to the avengers (which are funny at first granted, but get extremely repetitive?). 2.) The suit/s. This not a spoiler so yes. In the trailer you see Gwyneth Paltrow in the suit. Firstly, what is the point of Tony stark if his butler can use the suit, let alone Rhodey who pilots his own suit. Very silly. 3.) The portrayal of the Mandarin. If you've read the comics (like me) the mandarin uses rings to control three space alien dragons and has utmost powers. (In the film this unrealistic measure has been toned down a lot)Though to the point of where one of iron man's toughest villains has been disgraced. see the movie and you will understand where i'm coming from. 4.) Plot holes. To give nothing Away, the consistency of plot holes is unbearable, and so easily pick up!5.) That Disney feel to it. This movie is like a family comedy, if you want to take your kids to a family action movie (yet there is little action in this one) take them to this one. 6.) Unnecessary characters. In this movie there is a child, okay, BUT HE IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL CHARACTERS THAT THE MOVIE FOCUSES ON! Disney what have you done to iron man.So in reality don't see this movie unless you want to see what I'm talking about 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Sequel to the Franchisee,"Not caring about the review of other critics that the movie was average, In my view the movie was fantastic, from the viewpoint of all the movie- buffs and viewers out there who are seeking for some sneak peak into the softer side of Tony Strark viz the Iron man, playboy, tech geek, the movie does that remarkably well with the way he handles the anxiety in the aftermath of recent events and heightened concerns being faced on account of his deteriorating health which is elegantly balanced by humor, hats off to Robert Downey Jr for the excellent acting on that part. Viewers finally get to see more romance between tony and miss peppers.The script and storyline is fantastic and is full of a lot of surprises which will keep you hooked and guessing till the last moment. And with all the different elements combined, action, thriller, little bit of drama, the movie turns out to be a great view for all the Iron man fans out there.Verdict : Very Good, You'll have to see it to believe it",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man should remain a bachelor,"The reason Iron Man 3 is so bad is because Tony Stark has a girlfriend. This has really screwed the film up. What would have made the film better: - more showing of his Audi R8 (the white one, not red) - not pulling a trailer at the end of the film using his R8 - more pole dancing air stewardesses like in Iron Man 1 - a car chase - Iron Man not being so sympathetic and nice, dating and sleeping with multiple women and then dumping them the next morning, not having multiple iron mans suits which blow up easily, more building of gadgets and action in his garage, more fit women with skimpy clothes on, more showing of his luxury apartment, Pippa not getting into the Iron Man suit when the apartment blew up, having better baddies - not the guy that use to be in Neighbours - and to repeat again - NOT having a girlfriend!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
High-octane return to form for the Iron Man movie series,"Kudos to Iron Man 3 for avoiding the third-superhero-movie curse. Marvel's ""Phase 2"" is off to a great start, with a movie that feels perfectly stand-alone, and which delivers character-centric, lighthearted action.The script starts off a bit rambling and all over the place, but it doesn't take very long for big action set pieces to roll in and make us cheer for Tony Stark. Not that we need a lot to cheer him: Stark is as charming and funny as ever, and he steals the show every second he's on screen.The action is loud and imaginative; the character angst is amped up and the stakes are high. This is a cool summer action superhero flick, much better than Iron Man 2. My only disappointment is the Mandarin, who starts as a very strong visual presence, but turns into something less impressive than I hoped.I'm curious to see other Phase 2 movies, now. I may not collect Marvel superhero comics any longer, but I sure feel like I'm subscribed to Marvel movies. As long as they make them all like this--focused, lighthearted, fun, and character-driven--I'll keep on watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why does everyone hate this?,"I personally did see this as a bit of a let down, however the Marvel community has done the best they could on this. Tony Stark is back to his old talkative cheeky self and brings a lot of comedy to the film. Iron Man destroys his enemies the only way he knows how, leaves nothing left. So why is everyone moody with this film? Have all your periods synced up or something? Come on guys, although the film was a bit more comedy than usual, this was still awesome.Iron Man 3 was great in all sorts of different places; -The script was well written. -The plot was still great. -All suits were amazing! -Pepper Potts was great. -The special effects were great, with parts of Iron blasting onto Tony's Body. -The exploding enemies.The one problem I found was, they never explained why Aldridge wanted to blow stuff up? Was this Marvel's attempted at a Joker? The only one complaint I had!Robert Downing Jr. was great in this. He never disappoints when it comes to Iron Man. He was funny, clever and as per normal, great with his gadgets.This film was not as good as the first and second, and it was very hard to live up to them two, stop being picky, leave that to the critics, come on guys, this was an amazing film and we are all butchering it! If the first two Iron Man's didn't exist, I see this film getting at least a 8.5 out of 10 rather than 7.9!

Shane Black puts his stamp on it!,"Shane Black is going to be a very busy man once the box office draw comes in on Ironman 3. If you've seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from 2005 you'll know that Shane Black knows how to make a well balanced original movie. Ironman 3 continues that habit. Expect to see a lot more Shane Black directed movies. Downey Jr. seems to be enjoying himself more than ever as Tony Stark. Probably because he Tony Stark isn't slowly dying of blood poisoning like in the second film. All the supporting cast are great. Particularly Guy Pearse and Ben Kingsley.Best points of the film;1. Downey Jr. is at his very best.2. A very well written, witty script helps keep the humor flowing, and not just from Downey. Everybody gets to have fun, and be funny in this flick.3. Well paced and a great balance between plot, action, drama and humour.4. Surprising and original. (nothing goes the way you think it will)It's now my favourite Ironman movie.

Disappointing,"Overall, it was pretty terrible. They tried being too funny, the new suit was stupid, War Machine didn't do anything except kick doors down, and Tony Stark barely fought as Iron man.Most sequels are made to be better than the movie before it, but this one almost went a step backwards in comparison to the second film. Less action, villain was stupid with the whole paid actor bit. They keep trying to find more creative ways for the suit to be put on, but I thought they should have just left it like they put it on in the first Iron Man. My vote for biggest disappointment of the summer thus far. Especially after Marvel put out a great movie like the Avengers, I can't believe the first follow up to that was this poorly written and lack of action movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More CGI than quality movie...,"'Iron Man 3' is a classic example of what happens when you attempt to make lightning strike in the same place thrice: it doesn't quite work. There have been few casting decisions in the last 20 years of cinema as perfect as the pick of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark (a.k.a Iron Man). Iron Man 3 reminds us of this miracle every time RDJ is on-screen; the billion-dollar franchise depends on him and his great skill at playing this witty, ingenuous billionaire-turned-superhero. The original 'Iron Man' film benefited from a great script that chronicled Tony Stark's transformation into his Iron Man persona. That first film was a smash hit for those 2 reasons: Great script and great lead actor. Now we must subtract the great script for both 'Iron Man 2' and 'Iron Man 3' which leaves only the great actor as a character that we really enjoy. These are mediocre stories compared with the first film, however they are enjoyable due to the action and RDJ's performances. The anticipation for this movie was also amped way up after the incredible 'Avengers' movie, which also benefited from both Downey and an amazing script. That brings us to 'Iron Man 3' which has 'Corporate Meddling' written all over it. I'm not sure exactly why, but highly anticipated blockbusters always tend to be overworked, predictable and drenched in overdone, expensive CGI effects ( Think: Spiderman 3) . Iron Man 3 is such a film with a confused script and a lot of odd ideas for location shooting. By now, Tony Stark has developed his armor in striking ways and with amazing capabilities, so much so that we have little to look forward to in a 4th movie with so many great ideas for the armor crammed into this installment. RDJ keeps us glued to Tony Stark as he carries out an investigation into the terrorist bombings of the Osama Bin Laden-ish villain 'The Mandarin'. The always great Ben Kingsley has a great time with this character and creates a few laughs along the way. Another fine actor, Guy Pierce ( Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo) is completely wasted in his two-dimensional role as mad scientist Aldrich Killian. Many of the sacrifices made by the other actors are simply to make room for Robert Downey Jr. himself. Tony Stark needs a lot of screen time, but the crammed and forced script and plot twists need a lot of screen time also! Mix it all together and it will certainly not match nor suitably follow 'The Avengers' or the original 'Iron Man'. However, there is that cool actor Robert Downey Jr. who seems to miraculously keep us coming back to watch again and again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fine Superhero Movie,"'Iron Man 3' is a satisfying superhero movie with almost similar formula from other 'The Avengers' franchise. This movie is fit as an opening summer film: it's big blockbuster movie with massive action scenes and really fun to see. The studio has right decisions choosing Shane Black as director instead of maintaining Jon Favreau who had destroyed second installment. He knows how to handle this franchise well without adding unnecessary scene and silly jokes like the second one. And of course there's no complaint about Robert Downey's performance as Tony Stark, he's done great as usual.Still there are some weakness in 'Iron Man 3'. Unlike the first 'Iron Man' which had offered spectacular action scenes but still realistic in storyline, this film is too cartoonish and predictable, also nothing fresh in it. I think they don't want to take any risks and making it at the safe zone like most of 'The Avengers' franchise. They try to satisfy the fans without attracting new viewers. Also the villain is under- developed, there is similarity character between Mandarin and Syndrome in Disney's Pixar: 'The Incredibles'. I suggest not to see it in IMAX 3D, it's a waste. Although the 3D is not horrible but there is nothing special in it.Afterall, 'Iron Man 3' is an amazing, thrilling and entertaining summer blockbuster movie. Most people who see it would agree about how cool this movie is. The studio undeniable creating flawless visual effects that make the action scenes look real. Marvel 'The Avengers' fans, teenager and kids are gonna love it. I'm personally quite disappointed after watching it cause there is no improvement in this third installment that I'm waiting for. 'Iron Man 3' is below the first 'Iron Man' and also not as good as 'The Avengers' or even 'Captain America' but Shane Black success to lift up this franchise into a better future after a mess in 'Iron Man 2'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The movie had its funny moments here and there, and the action is great! Love the action in this movie, it is pretty intense, and had my hands covering my mouth on some parts. I think that the average person would be pretty entertained. But i would compare it to The Avengers, and the Avengers was pretty remarkable.

"""I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.""","Enjoyable third Iron Man film, far better than the second. It has a lot of detractors, and I can see some of their points, but ultimately I was never bored and had a good time watching it. One of the major complaints is about how they handled the character of the Mandarin, one of Iron Man's biggest villains from the comics. If I had read about it beforehand, I probably would have agreed. But watching it play out, I actually liked it and thought it was quite clever. My only real quibble is that the other villain of the movie (Guy Pearce) is underwhelming. The returning cast members Downey, Cheadle, Paltrow, Favreau are all great. This is probably the best movie in the series for Paltrow, in particular. It doesn't hurt that she's very hot in this. The best scenes involve Downey and a young boy (Ty Simpkins).

"So many bright points, but such a disappointment.","Casting: Great Editing: Glorious SFX: Consistently very good with a few small exceptions not worth mentioning. The rest...First, I am not a comic book fan in general, I prefer prose and rate the first Iron Man (2008) as well within my top10 films from the last decade and loved Iron Man 2. Having seen the trailers and felt the build-up for the last several months, I went to the cinema barely able to hold in my excitement. I was bitterly disappointed.This is a strange movie in that there are many excellent elements which are unfortunately lost in a morass of sluggish pacing - I actually said to myself ""I'm bored"" at one point. The pacing issue is mainly due to the entirely unnecessary second act which feels like it's there to give the character some space and realise his potential/clear his head. Unfortunately, it actually just wastes a massive amount of time not really doing anything to forward the plot.The character of Tony Stark, while obviously deeply affected by the events of The Avengers, is completely changed with almost no sign nor hint of the character in the first film. All I can say about this is thank the celluloid gods that we have RDJ at the helm to lend his incredible charisma to the lacklustre plot.Another good point deserving of a whole paragraph to itself: GUY PEARCE! He brilliantly delivers a phenomenal performance which again, helps carry the bloated, lukewarm story and lets the viewer ignore the almost total lack of real back-story for the character.The Mandarin is the biggest disappointment I've encountered since all of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Attempting to avoid spoilers, all I can say is that it's nothing to do with Sir Ben Kingsley whose performance is probably the best in the whole movie, but the way the character is used.The technology, obviously such an enormous aspect of the film, has its role massively changed from that of a tool to almost an annoying hindrance.I recall hearing somewhere a while ago that the new director, Mr Black would take us to a darker, more emotional place with this film. I hadn't expected that the darkness would be literally having many scenes at night and emotions would be people crying. I was expecting great things that would allow us to follow Tony Stark as his Iron Man armours improve and he sorts his head and priorities out. In the case of the former, things have become more flashy for sure, but apparently at the expense of reliability and durability. For the latter, remember the more mature, healthy Tony Stark at the end of The Avengers? Sorry...I would say ""Come back Mr Favreau, all is forgiven"", but he did an amazing job and there's really not much to forgive him for, so I'll just say ""BRING BACK FAVREAU!""Go in to this film with VERY low expectations and you'll be pleased. For those among you who don't care about plot and just want flashy action and SFX, you'll be happy. This is unfortunately not a people-film and there's scarcely enough depth to fill a saucer.Not without bright points, but ultimately such a crushing disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Finally, Iron Man versus the Mandarin","Iron Man Three has the unique distinction of being a part of not just the Iron Man Trilogy, but also of the Marvel Universe in general and has to fit in seamlessly there, while still holding its own as a stand-alone film.Does it perform under such pressures? To a very large degree, yes.The plot follows Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) facing the consequences of his own rash actions in the past, forcing him to take on his biggest enemy yet, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). In the process, Tony goes on a self-discovery journey, makes a few friends and rekindles his spark with Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow) Usually, in the third part of a trilogy, it is an obligation to break down the hero before he rises up to discover what he truly is. Keeping this in mind, the physical attacks on Tony Stark are absolutely mind-blowing but the psychological damage on him seems extremely forced and unimpressive.The Trailers showed a few scenes of the destruction of the Stark Mansion, but nothing can prepare you for the visuals that you will end up seeing. Director Shane Black manages to set up a mammoth canvas to paint a rich, vivid and absolutely smashing film.The film deftly switches between the various layers and story lines while being coherent. The action sequences are exemplary and the performances by Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) and Ty Simpkins (Harley the kid) are very good. Gweneth Paltrow has more to do in the movie as does Don Cheadle (Colonel Rhodes aka War Machine aka Iron Patriot). Jon Favreau (Happy Hogan) is also given decent screen space and performs admirably.But, while many factors have worked in its favor, the film suffers from a few flaws as well. The dialog is not as crisp or witty, the laugh out loud moments are few and far apart. Most importantly, the film creates a vicious set up that is let down by an elaborate but weak climax.Also, there remains a nagging thought that Ben Kingsley as Mandarin had the capacity to truly strike fear a la Heath Ledger as The Joker. Instead all he became was a victim of a script twist. Fans of the Comic books will know that Mandarin is the Arch-Nemesis for Iron Man and what becomes of him is extremely disappointing.Still, the film has managed to salvage itself from the debacle that was Iron Man 2 and hats off to Shane Black for creating something of such epic proportions.P.S. One would have wished that the end credits scene contained some reference to the Guardians of the Galaxy Movie or maybe even Ant Man. But its worth the wait, nonetheless.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The fallout from The Avengers lands squarely on Tony Stark.,"The interesting - Marvel kicked off Phase 2 with a decided switch in tone and character. Iron Man 3 is less of a superhero movie and more of a psychological detective thriller, and we will see this genre-bending throughout the movies of Phase 3. T he good - RDJ is still Tony Stark, and just watching him grow the character, dealing with the events of The Battle of New York, is worth the price of admission. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to be great as Pepper Potts, and (with very few exceptions) Pepper and Tony's relationship continues to be believable.The great - I loved seeing Pepper suit up in some armor, if only for a moment, and I also like the strong female characters in the film. I believe this might be the first MCU property that passes the Bechdel Test.The problems - I don't totally buy Pepper being so angry at Tony and this bugged me. The whole ""twist"" didn't really work for me. I missed Jon Favreau's lighter take on the Iron Man universe of Iron Man and Iron Man 2. This Tony is a much less fun Tony, and while I get why (Tony is realizing it is a much less fun world he lives in), I still miss fun Tony.Summary - I enjoyed this movie, but find it one of my least favorite of the MCU. It lacked much of the charm of the first two Iron Man movies. I don't mean to pan it in any way, but it will certainly be a while before I throw this one on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Something Explodes!!! (again),"I swear, the plots of these films get crazier and crazier. Who cares though, when you have Robert Downey Jnr's ability to diffuse every tense situation with an irrelevant one-liner. Does this guy EVER worry? As for Gwyneth Paltrow, life is good... she earns almost as much as the guy playing the title character... for a small fraction of the screen time. Reminds me of Judi Dench winning an Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth I in Shakespeare In Love... despite only gracing us with her presence for just eight minutes. Nice work if you can get it...BAM. SLAM. WHACK. SQUEAK. (Okay, I made that last one up). The movie is one big noise from beginning to end, with plenty of stuff getting blown up real good and a final battle with so many automated robot suits it resembles a cut scene from a Transformers film. This puts it above the rather dull part 2, but a shade below the more plot and character orientated numero uno.

Consistent with 1 & 2,"I enjoyed Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Despite the science fiction, cartoon hero nature of the movie, the plots were reasonably believable and not too ridiculous.

Performances were first-rate.Iron Man 3 is no exception. In fact, I enjoyed it slightly more than the previous two. Tony Stark showed a vulnerability that wasn't evident in the first two.

Iron Man Tri-umphant!,"In the interest of full disclosure, I'm more of a DC Comics fan than a Marvel one. That said, I haven't missed a single one of the films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, established with 2008's Iron Man. The time has sped by on rocket boots, and with the Phase I films all in the bag, Phase II begins where it all started, with Iron Man.Robert Downey Jr. (who else?) is back as Tony Stark, tinkering with new gadgets even as the events of The Avengers give him sleepless nights. His girl Friday Pepper Potts (Paltrow) has moved in with him, but Stark just won't give her the time of day even as the holidays approach. Enter the enigmatic terrorist mastermind The Mandarin (Kingsley), perpetrator of a series of vicious bomb attacks, one of which critically wounds Tony's ex-bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). Tony swears revenge, and his home is assaulted by the Mandarin's forces in return. Stranded in rural Tennessee, he enlists the help of a local kid (Ty Simpkins) to help patch his armour in anticipation of The Mandarin's next strike. Tony also discovers links to Dr Aldrich Killian and Dr Maya Hansen, developers of the Extremis virus ‚Äì a revolutionary piece of biotechnology that has turned dangerously unstable.Iron Man 3 is nothing short of a game-changer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the film, Happy Hogan doesn't work directly for Tony Stark anymore ‚Äì a bit of leaning-against-the-fourth-wall winking, seeing as how Jon Favreau has passed on the director's baton to Shane Black, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Drew Pearce. Once one of the most sought-after screenwriters in Hollywood, Black proves he's still got the mojo he displayed with his screenplays for Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout in spades. Iron Man 3 has got his stamp all over it (notice the Christmas-time setting) and yet also delivers everything we've come to expect of a big-budget superhero blockbuster at the same time.The film is tightly-plotted and expertly paced; audiences certainly won't be twiddling their thumbs waiting impatiently for the next action scene to roll around. Said action scenes are plenty inventive though ‚Äì a daring mid-air rescue which Stark compares to playing ""Barrel of Monkeys"" and a dazzlingly-choreographed finale involving Stark hopping in and out of an array of Iron Man suits mid- combat being the prime examples. Black shows that he understands how important such displays are to the type of film he's making, but never lets the story get drowned out by the din of high-octane bells and whistles.A section of viewers have taken Iron Man 2 to task for spending too much of its running time in setting up the big event, The Avengers. Iron Man 3 suffers no such problem. The focus is squarely back on Tony Stark, and by now it is impossible to imagine the character being played by anyone other than Robert Downey Jr. At this point in a franchise, the leading man is wont to display signs of weariness or that he's only doing it for the paycheck ‚Äì nope, not here. Downey Jr., armed with a new batch of one-liners and an even bigger new batch of armoured outfits, is having as much fun with the role as ever.He doesn't feel like he's hogging the spotlight though, because both Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow get more to do here in their supporting parts. Col. James Rhodes' ""War Machine"" has been given an image makeover and renamed ""Iron Patriot""; the film doing a good job of showing how Rhodey is at his best fighting alongside Iron Man instead of merely playing errand boy for the US military. Pepper Potts finally gets to step out of her ""beleaguered assistant"" corner and throw some punches of her own, playing a pivotal part in the film's climactic shipping dock battle. The subplot with Ty Simpkins' character serving as Stark's kid sidekick of sorts could have come off as twee, but it doesn't eat into the meat of the proceedings and Stark's interactions with the boy are amusing and heartfelt.Also new to the series are Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall. The Mandarin, the Fu-Manchu like archenemy of Iron Man in the comics, is reimagined as an unkempt, somewhat theatrical figure of the shadows ‚Äì though there is of course more to him than that. Stalwart comic book fans might not like the way the character is ultimately handled, but it is clever enough and didn't really bother me. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is a scientist who was ignored by Stark earlier in his career and doesn't take too kindly to this, re-entering the fray with slicked- back hair and a spray tan. Pearce plays the ""mousy to charismatic"" angle well, when it could well have been overly cartoonish √† la Jim Carrey's Riddler in Batman Forever. The beautiful Rebecca Hall doesn't get a lot of screen time, but is one of those actresses who plays ""hot scientist"" without a hitch.It would seem that doing anything new within the confines of the wham- bam comic book blockbuster genre would be difficult, since every new entry seems to be measured against The Avengers or The Dark Knight trilogy. It is to the credit of Shane Black and the team behind Iron Man 3 then that the film is effortlessly invigorating, assured in its tone with a good sprinkling of humour mixed in with awe-inspiring, effects- heavy action sequences and well-written character moments. There probably isn't a better way to kick off Phase II of Marvel's Cinematic Universe than with this flick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man 3: Shane Black's tribute to Lethal Weapon,"Just saw Iron Man 3 and the problem with the film isn't The Mandarin, which Stark himself calls ""Embarrassing.""The movie actually lacks continuity with the previous Marvel films featuring Robert Downey JR. as Tony Stark/Iron Man in some very big ways. Up until this film Tony has been brilliant and resourceful. And the Iron Man armor has been a powerful weapon. But in this film Tony is a guy with a big mouth who isn't all that great with the suit and his suits seem like they're made of aluminum scrap. And there are various times in the film where Tony's once amazing tech is reduced to malfunctioning junk just for cheap laughs.It also seems like the creators of Iron Man 3 forgot that Tony Stark's mini Arc Reactor powers his various Iron Man suits. The mini Arc Reactor was the driving plot point of Iron Man. It's what everyone was fighting about and it was ripped from Tony Stark's chest by Obadiah Stane and used to power Stane's Iron Monger weaponry. Later Stark recovers the mini Arc and places it back inside his chest. It's still there in Iron Man 3, yet Stark runs around looking for ways to jump start his Iron Man armor after it's damaged.There's also no explanation as to why Tony stays in Tennessee as if hes stranded and why Tony labors on repairs for his damaged armor when later we find Tony has had dozens of fully operational Iron Man suits hidden in California, that he could summon at any time. And why did Tony don his only non operational suit after daring terrorists to attack him at home in California, when he had many ready to go suits in his basement and bunker?We learned in Avengers that Tony's artificial intelligence design; 'Jarvis', also exists in the NYC Stark Tower and can manufacture suits without assistance. Yet in Iron Man 3 he only exists in the Iron Man armor after the Malibu home is destroyed. Another bit of Iron Man canon that is ignored to keep Tony stranded in Tennessee and stuck with a damaged Iron Man suit.Tony's Iron Man armor has survived direct hits from missiles, being run over by a car, SHIELD Heli-Carrier propellers, Thor's hammer and many violent crashes in previous films but in Iron Man 3 it is shattered by a collision with a semi truck and later in the climatic battle, multiple suits are ripped apart like wet tissue.Iron Man 3 was directed and co-written by Shane Black, the creator and writer of the Lethal Weapon series. And much of this movie breaks the cannon of 2 Iron Man films and Avengers, just to morph Iron Man into a retread of Shane Black's glory days writing scenes for Rigg's and Murtagh.Shane Black became friends with Downey JR. while they worked on Black's 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'. It was Downey JR. who pulled some strings within Marvel Films to get Black his Iron Man 3 gig. Marvel did itself and it's fans a great disservice handing such control of it's Iron Man franchise over to Black who in turn used it to pay homage to himself and to his Lethal Weapon series.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Interesting subtext and a rounded Iron outing,"Haunted by the events of Avengers Assemble, Iron Man has to get himself together to thwart terrorist The Mandarin who is aided by an old acquaintance.A faster paced instalment to the series, Shane Black effortlessly takes over the directing reigns, it has the right dose of action, humour and emotion. Even though the few surprises and twists are heavy handed- namely the The Mandarin and Pepper Potts thread Robert Downey Jr. gets to portray Tony Stark once again and develop the character a little further.Although Guy Pearce is given an unconvincing make up and hair introduction once he returns clean cut he excels and steals the show as bad guy Aldrich Killian. Rebecca Hall is form in a smaller role and Ben Kingsley is entertaining with his Captain Jack-like swagger as The Mandarin. A few of the Iron Man's series previous characters show up and never out stay their welcome.Black impressively handles the big budget spectacles and action scene sequences with precision, the special effects are outstanding. However, Stark losing his suit so often become a tad tiresome. Like its predecessor this has an interesting subtext with regards to terrorists, the Middle East and Starks relationship with the suit. There's also a novel brave closure ending, nevertheless it's a good outing with a humorous post credit sequence.Debatably Iron Man's most rounded outing for the masses.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"New director, same entertainment factor.","On the plus side, director Shane Black essentially does with ""Iron Man 3"" what Sam Mendes did for the Bond franchise with ""Skyfall"". He put it back on track (at least creatively anyway). It's not like ""Iron Man 2"" was a bad superhero movie (especially next to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") but coming off of the initial blockbuster that was ""Iron Man"", director John Favreau had much to live up to. Thus, for a lot of people ""Iron Man 2"" was a minor disappointment, of which Black has been sent in to correct. Now, does Black accomplish something profound here? Something Favreau wasn't able to do with the previous Iron Man's? Well, the answer is no, not really. Though the material is funnier, much of the visuals are explosion-centric and there is a startling amount of Gwyenth Paltrow abs, the direction isn't as different as many are claiming (which is a good thing). In the end, ""Iron Man 3"" is more of Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic sensibility, and that's basically all that matters when talking about this franchise.Synopsis: When Tony Stark/Iron Man begins suffering from panic attacks on the wake of terrorist attacks by the Bin Laden-esque evil doer, The Mandarin, he begins to reevaluate what being Iron Man actually means to his livelihood and sanity. So, while that storyline sounds dark (or Nolan-esque) ""Iron Man 3"" sadly contains a more prominent and quite generic storyline, having to do with an alternate villain. A villain who has been cleverly left out of the trailers, but after an experiment gone wrong, plans to take over the world (don't they always?).When these two story lines combine, the plot itself isn't as strong as I expected. In fact, at times it becomes a bit overcomplicated. But again, the Iron Man franchise has always been more about the performances and the snappy dialogue than the plot.Supporting Cast: Ty Simpkins (or mini-Robert Downey Jr. as I like to call him) the little boy who plays Harley Keener, steals the show for the relatively small amount of time he is on screen. Actually it is the chemistry between him and Downey Jr. during their scenes together, which are unequivocally the funniest moments of the film. As for Paltrow, who returns in her role as Pepper Potts, she is pretty blah. But not enough to be a distraction, so¬Ömoving on.Side Note: Undeniably, the most questionable aspect of ""Iron Man 3"" has to be the (dare I say) innovative way Black chooses to play out the role of The Mandarin (played by Ben Kingsley) whose character takes a comically unexpected, but spoiler-ridden turn half way through the movie. That said, when the villain in a superhero movie is delivering an abundance of funny lines, one could make the argument that at times the dialogue and scenarios have become a bit too Joss Whedon for their own good. And before you say it, I realize that Whedon wasn't a part of the writing team of ""Iron Man 3"". But maybe my issue with this overly comedic tone used for The Mandarin character goes back to the fundamental flaw with trying to compare the future of Disney's Marvel world with the future of DC comic films. On the wings of Christopher Nolan, DC has gone down the path of heavy drama, creating characters who are more flawed, more disturbed and more realistic. Now, Marvel seems to be going the other way with it, keeping an old fashioned sense of comic book levity, with film after film constructed on comedic foundations; i.e. ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"". Meaning, even though there is superhero action throughout, in Marvel films there are not only many comic relief characters, but also protagonists and antagonist who are quirky and quick with a funny one liner. So with that logic, the fact that ""Iron Man 3"" must be labeled as a superhero action/comedy, should not be held against it by fans of The Dark Knight franchise (like myself). In other words, from this point forward, if you are going to see a Marvel film, be expected to laugh. On the other hand, everything I've just stated may end up being toilet fodder with the upcoming release of Marvel's ""The Wolverine"".Final Thought: Don't bother waiting around to see what clip is shown after the credits of this film.

great just great,"""Iron Man 3"" does what most third entries in movie franchise don't do, turns in a great movie. This holds up very nicely next to the previous 2 installments, and I'd say it's probably better than ""Iron Man 2"" and about the same as the first movie. Here, Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) is haunted by the events of the Avengers and finds himself obsessing over creating and perfecting new suits. He is constantly trying to figure out new way to protect Pepper(Gwyneth Paltrow), and make the suits better and better. Then he placed in the cross hairs of a terrorist called the Mandarin(Ben Kingsley). Going any further than that would be a disservice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie, because there are quite a few surprises and twists, that I didn't see coming at all. Very unconventional super hero movie, which is great because it's a true breathe of fresh air. It's not your typical good guy vs. bad guy movie in a lot of ways. All the performances are great, and it really leaves you with a sense of ""how are they gonna do another one?!""

Incredible,"The events of New York(think ""team-up"") changed things. Gods and aliens exist... how do you deal with that? Well, the President(Sadler, as a passionate, protective man) feels the US needs its own hero, and repaints War Machine with Captain America's color scheme, calling it Iron Patriot(and the first person to ask why it isn't Norman Osborn in there will be slapped silly), and having it work directly for the government... and yes, it's still piloted by Rhodey(Cheadle, truly engaging the buddy dynamic), whose loyalties are thus split between his job and his long-time best friend.And Tony(Downey Jr., completely game, with the charm and snarky arrogance fully intact) has to face the love triangle between him, his obsession with tinkering with his tech, and Pepper(Paltrow again with personality, not a mere fantasy object, a strong female role, toying with the ""damsel in distress"" trope)... the one that matters most to him. He also has to deal with the anxiety he's feeling after fighting off an outer space invasion(and yes, the trailer is accurate: for much of this, he has to rely on his wits, improvising in order to make due... often the best type of story about someone who has enormous responsibility and/or skill. We again have something from his past, yet it feels original again).And from the outside, there is the threat of The Mandarin(Kingsley granting him immense charisma, leading to a presence that is felt whether he is on-screen or not; and yes, we finally have a villain who is there from the very start), who blows up and threatens targets, yet leaving no traces to follow(thus we get comments on the War on Terror, and in general this has the feel of a Tom Clancy thriller, and feels politically relevant, current... without cramming a viewpoint down your throat). Killian(Pearce, an ambitious businessman that can be hard to get a read on) emerges from relative obscurity with the Extremis virus, a substance able to regrow lost limbs, that will become integral to the plot.This is the best of the trilogy. Shane Black brings his style to it, with several elements reminiscent of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and melds them well with this universe - narration, quirk, etc. This rejuvenates the gotten-stale series(note that the overall film franchise did not need it), and clearly, that enthusiasm grips all the actors, as well, who do impeccably, several of them having to span a lot of the spectrum, and doing so flawlessly. The side characters are memorable and credible - be it Happy(Favreau, putting all his energy towards the portrayal of the now chief of security of Potts, with greatly increased paranoia for our amusement), a kid(who gives a truly believable performance)... I could go on.Somehow, this hits the gas on humor even more than they were already doing, and it is hilarious and infinitely quotable. The dialog is fresh, organic and smart. This has a ton of twists and unexpected developments, and rather than confuse matters, they add complexity to otherwise seemingly straightforward endeavors and keep you guessing. The action is huge(cemented by the epic score), exciting(and in spite of the scope, you never lose track of what's going on or become overstimulated) and effectively raises the stakes - the climax is stunning, funny and a fantastically constructed pay-off to everything that has been set up along the way.This is paced immensely well - it has you right from the opening seconds and through the two hours it runs until the ending credits start(and yes, you will want to stay after them!). The 3D is post-conversion, and it's good, not mind-blowing... if you're on a budget, you can forgo that.There is some bloody, tense violence(usually not graphic), a bit of moderate language and a little sexuality in this. I recommend this to everyone who is enjoying these(and yes, you will have to have watched the two first ones, as well as The Avengers... on the plus side, there is a lot of respect for continuity between them). 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

No silver linings playbook this...,"The comments regarding skewing the spirit of the Marvel comics not withstanding, plus a formulaic plot, I take a stand on the insidious way we are undermining our daughters.Whenever a script has anyone use the term ""pussy"" as a sexist slur to mean a coward, we are reinforcing negative stereotypes of our daughters, sisters, and mothers, regardless.And it goes by almost unnoticed, almost on a preconscious level.The movie industry would have us take ""pussy"" for granted as a normal every day nomenclature. We have come to take script writers use of this term for granted as if people in real life, folks from decent homes, who are trying to work on the life long process of learning and becoming better human beings, speak this way. As if most of us would not cringe if we heard an adult male ""motivate"" a young boy to action by asking him, ""Do you want to be a pussy?"" At this point in the plot, which is not that far in, I lost immediate total interest, and respect. ""Pussy"" as we all know, is the number two derogatory term for the vulva, next to the humiliating term ""cunt"", which is just as bad as the ""n"" word, yet I bet I would not be able to spell out the ""n"" word, even though there is nothing illegal about it when not used with the intent to intimidate or humiliate. We can use the ""n"" word liberally in our film scripts, just can't spell it out discussing films. Sexism still subsumes racism.But we can spell out ""pussy"" and ""cunt"", not seeing the connection between the epidemic of violence against women as being directly related to the use of hate words to spread an under pinning of misogyny worldwide, as in domestic violence, rape, child brides, female genital mutilation, sex trade, honor killings... yeah, honor. The epidemic of American high school and college girls thinking ""hooking up"" up is liberating, when in fact it is subjugating and humiliating in the long run, sometimes not that long of a run.""Pussy"" means in our culture the female genitalia, in a derogatory, misogynistic fashion. Who can define ""yoni"" by contrast without Googling it? We never hear it.And yet Iron Man can tell a kid not to be a female genitalia, implying females are weaklings. Even if one were to glibly argue that ""pussy"" means ""pussy cat"", every one would snicker. As if felines were not ferocious fighters.I hope other parents talk to their kids about the significance of words and how it shapes our reality. That they too caught Robert Downy Junior using ""don't be a pussy"" to goad on a little boy, and insult our daughters while he was at it. Tsk tsk, Robert, and I just saw you filming in our town.

Tin Man,"This film is mildly recommended.The simplistic genre of comic book action hero films usually fail to excite me. Yes, there have been exceptions to the rule: Marvel's The Avengers, The Amazing Spiderman, The Dark Knight quickly come to mind, as does the original Ironman. But in general for me, most comic book action fantasies are of the black and white variety: the good guys vs. crazed villains, plots to take over the world vs. plans to save it, the evildoer almost destroying our hero who makes a triumphant comeback, the CGI constantly overwhelming the real stunt work. Yes, the formula is set and hardly ever detours from its goal.Which brings us to the third installment of the Ironman franchise, which is more of the same one can expect from this genre, but also a rare commodity that adds some grayer tones to the story with its wry and cynical humor, its stronger character development, and a crowd- pleasing performance by its lead actor, Robert Downey, Jr.ÔøºThe formulaic plot of Ironman 3 goes like this: Our flawed and egotistical playboy Tony Stark dons the Ironman suit once again to stop world domination (and for some personal revenge, or course). With the aid of his loyal friend, Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and his trusty girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), at his side, Stark fights evil in the form of The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a madman who regularly interrupts the airwaves threatening the annihilation of world order. Also on hand are a rich entrepreneur named Aldrich Killlian (well played by Guy Pearce) who must have an ulterior motive and Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, a scientist who must supply some more conflict.This leads to various action set pieces that tend to wow the audience and give that special adrenalin rush to today's movie-going audience. These action sequences vary in success due to the frenzied editing and too many close-ups that interfere with the action. (One exception is an especially thrilling segment involving an air rescue mission to save falling passengers that is beautifully staged.)ÔøºSolidly directed by Shane Black, Ironman 3 essentially remains escapist pop entertainment. But with the world a-changing, reality is beginning to add a darker tone to the mayhem on the screen. The era of lively pop extravaganza is beginning to lose some of its color. Just how far can you escape from the horrors of terrorism, death, and violence these days, with the on-going epidemic of sadism and brutality we now witness on a daily basis? With so many images of 9/11, the Boston Marathon bombing, and ransom serial shootings plaguing our consciousness, can we now be immune to the real life senselessness of killing, even if this PG rated film sanitizes the gore by showing very little bloodshed? Can we allow ourselves to be so desensitized to the carnage in the form of entertainment for an hour or two?ÔøºThe filmmakers seem to have taken too many liberties in updating the source and giving it a modern slant, profiling the enemy to be Middle Eastern. Black deliberately changes the ethnicity of the main villain from the original comic book source. (Perhaps the Chinese backers of the film objected.) This new Mandarin, much younger in the comic book version and without any superpowers in this film, has even aged to resemble Osama Ban Laden and this uncomfortable image plus the film's more serious point of view grounds the film in the real world. Granted the successful Ironman franchise has always had a realistic edge to its comic book trappings. But now reality has reared its ugly head. Explosions are a commonplace occurrence and destruction without consequence is everywhere in Ironman 3. (This film made me seriously question at what price do we pay for entertainment value nowadays.)That said, the film has some assets amid some missteps, from its fine production values and its inspired casting. Downey and Paltrow continue to have the right chemistry between them, even if the script by Drew Pearce and the director gets a bit wobbly at times. Transitions between the narrative exposition and the gung-ho warfare and gadgetry became tedious and dull. An unfortunate amount of time is spent with a cute tyke at the midway point that might appeal to the pre-teen set but slows down the film's momentum. Also, while Guy Pearce brings the perfect sense of deranged danger to his character, Kingsley makes some unusual choice with his vocal delivery which I found more off-putting than menacing. (He sometimes sounded like a high-pitched Walter Cronkite.)Ironman 3 is a well-made Hollywood blockbuster that totally engages its audience with some powerful images, strong acting, and even has a twist or two to convert any naysayers. ( The ""surprising"" twists didn't surprise me at all.) Still, I personally needed more fantasy in my escapism, a further leap from the harsh reality of our world that this film was unable to give me. In retrospect, maybe the black and white extremes of past efforts are better than the grayer shades on view. I guess today's superheroes do have it even tougher after all.

Iron man 3,"The third instalment of the highly-successful Iron Man franchise goes off in a different direction to its predecessors. I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Growing up,"I would like to preface this review by saying I don't know much about the comic books that Iron Man comes from but I do know it serves as an inspiration. Upon exiting the theatre I heard some people complaining that the film differed from the source material and weren't very happy. That being said as someone uninfluenced by those standards I thought the film was great! Director Shane Black of the fantastic and criminally under seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang takes the helm with appreciated results. Jon Favereau fared well the first two creating a grandiose, sarcastic, sassy mouthed but fantastical universe filled with big characters people have loved spending time with. The first one is still the best in my opinion, it lost a little luster in the sequel but this follow up entry brings the franchise into it's smaller, more character driven roots which is much appreciated and changes the overall effect. The film humanizes Tony Stark played by the lovably jerky Robert Downy Jr. as he lashes out at a terrorist and suffers the consequences when he is attacked at home. Most of his equipment is destroyed and his girlfriend Pepper is nearly killed. Presumed dead by the public he moves ahead trying to solve the villains mystery and begin to rebuild his machinery so to speak. There's lots of clever quips and even emotionally resonant add ons. the humor is there for the most part but doesn't feel as funny but the action sequences are truly breathtaking. And there is finally a kick ass character arc for Pepper Potts played with a seductive ferocity by Gwyneth Paltrow. I'm not sure how well it holds up to the original material or even if it makes all that much sense but it is grade A entertainment and most of all it shows that the franchise is growing in a more adult direction a brave act in a slew of constant cinematic immaturity. 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man 2 was a bit of a prologue to The Avengers and part of why it was good and part of why it rubbed some people the wrong way. Iron Man 3 now takes what worked from those two films and, frankly, does it better. Right now, I'm calling this one the best of the three.Why? Well, first and foremost the writing in Iron Man 3 delivers genuine wit and is strong across the board. I think a lot of summer films are lost in pre-production when they decide to shoot a dumb script or make it up as they go along. Clearly, Iron Man 3 must have had a strong script and great writers. They avoid a lot of the mistakes other films like this make. The story is as good as any comic book adaptation I've ever seen. The plot actually tugs at the heart strings, makes you think and still hits the funny bone more then once. The story and epic battles make perfect sense. What I liked about the first Iron Man is that it was somewhat grounded in reality. How Tony and company reacted to certain thing is what resulted in the audience going along for the ride. They did that perfectly in this sequel. The effects really did surpass what they did before and I actually thought the last time out they did a great job. Just like Avengers, Iron Man 3 delivers some of the best scenes out of any action film that I've seen in years.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
He still is Iron Man,"We've all seen the trailers. And we've all probably built up a certain vibe about the movie - that its taking the dark route a.l.a. DC movies. So, if it doesn't end up living up to that vibe that its built around itself, its bound to disappoint viewers, mildly or hugely. Because in this case, the dark route actually seemed like a perfect fit for the third installment.Sample this: After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark suddenly realizes that there are other supremely powerful beings in existence, that he's not alone, and that when compared with the others, he's certainly not the strongest of the bunch. So he develops post-traumatic stress, starts getting anxiety attacks, and in the process has built himself an army of suits - an Iron Legion - all because he just doesn't feel safe anymore. This causes friction between him and everyone else he knows - between him and Pepper and their romance, between him and Rhodey and their friendship, and between him and Happy affecting their bonding. Lots of room for exploration there right ??? Add to that, an emerging terrorist threat in the form of The Mandarin whose organization, The Ten Rings was alluded to in the first movie and you have an opportunity to bring things a full circle. The Mandarin being Iron Man's most prominent foe in comic book legacy only helps.But sadly, it looks like the movie doesn't care to exploit all of these to their fullest. I'm not saying it doesn't use these issues at all, Tony's vulnerabilities are played out brilliantly. Its just that they could have done so much more with this material and the trailers gave us reason after reason to expect that they have that we end up a tad bit dissatisfied or should I say even mildly frustrated. And the pacing of the movie is quite feverish which isn't a problem if the characters are involving enough. But when they keep spurting out one-liners after another with a comic intent, it gets a bit irritating. Again, I'm saying a bit and not hugely irritating.There's no reason to scoff at the movie's production values. In fact, being a Marvel movie, I shouldn't even be commenting on how amazing the visuals are, or with Black at the helm, the action is top-notch. It would simply be wasting characters in this review if details are described. But yes, the airplane crash and the subsequent fall sequence deserves mention - its the only sequence in the movie that gave me real goosebumps. I'd say that sequence makes up for some of the movie's flaws never mind the brief duration that it last's for.Downey is at the top of his game here. He plays a more mature, sensible and disturbed Stark unlike the jolly good alcoholic of the previous movies. However he does retain his sense of humor which is good in a way but not so good when done excessively. The girls get little screen time but give in their best. As for the bad guys, they're all effective and any further comments on their performance would mean spoiling a big twist in the movie.With Iron Man 3, Marvel's Phase II has begun. And while this may not be the best of starts, its certainly not a bad one by any means. A little bit of fine tuning and even sticking to the vibe the trailers projected would have made this movie a serious force to bicker or reckon with. As it is though, Iron Man 3 is a pretty decent summer flick. Just don't expect anything extraordinary out of it.I was about to give it a 7, but I'll raise the score by 0.5 for Downey's performance and for the airplane sequence.Score: 7.5 / 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Breathtaking,"""Iron Man 3"" was pretty good! The acting of Robert Downey Jr. was excellent. The whole movie was funny enough and it also had several breathtaking moments. I watched it 2 hours ago and I'm still fascinated. Picture was perfect in its 2d release and I suppose that there won't be much upgrades in its 3d version. Gwynneth Paltrow was decent, but still wasn't as good as Downey. Ben Kingsley was perfect! His British humour made all the minutes he appears on screen to move the whole theatre into laughter! All the battle scenes were amazing and most of them made me stare on the screen and leave my pop-corn and cola for later! Having watched the two initial films a week ago I really had into my mind to see whether a third installment on the franchise was needed. Well, ""Iron Man 3"" is the best film of the trilogy and I dare to say that it was better than most of other superhero movies. I'm really looking forward for the next film with Iron Man!!!!

Underrated and solid movie,"Iron man 3 is actually a solid film, the main character Tony Stark is amazing and does a good job at exploring his PTSD from avengers assemble and Robert Downey jr is great as usual, The side characters like pepper and James Rhodes are great and have some good chemistry with Tony. The plot is actually very interesting and unique the antagonists are a big part of the film there's 2 (kind of) one at first is extremely well done and threatening and seems like he could be a top tier antagonist then a major twist happens and it kinda ruins the potential the antagonist had which is unfortunate, however we do have a second pretty decent antagonist aswell who poses a threat to Tony Stark and has decent motivations and is kinda interesting. The fights scenes can be quite good but others can be awkward and hard to follow the final fight in particular however is really great the choreography and cinematography in the final fight is amazing to watch. In terms of comedy the jokes can be extremely funny but others dont land at all. Overall solid film definitely builds on Tony Stark's character and is intriguing and unique",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is having trouble sleeping and having anxiety attacks.,"The Iron Man series of films has a couple of key strengths that put it just ahead of other super hero movies: Robert Downey Junior, the character of Tony Stark and snarky banter. Robert Downey Junior is delightful to watch as Tony Stark quipping his way through life, cracking jokes and just generally being effortlessly cool. He's a lot more fun to be with than brooding tortured souls like Batman, Spider-Man or the Hulk.The producers of the series know this too and so in the third installment of the franchise they give the audience exactly what we want, lots of Tony Stark being glib, making jokes and being charming. Bringing in Shane Black (writer of Lethal Weapon and director of Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang which is another Robert Downey Junior quip fest) was a great decision in this vein as the man knows how to delivery good banter.But whilst the dialogue was always the best part of the previous films it wasn't the only aspect necessary to make Iron Man 1, 2 and the Avengers work. For all his glibness Tony Stark as a character has depth. He's a conflicted character using his bravado to mask real feelings of inadequacy, of losing control of his life and fear of death.This film seems aware that it has to have a character arc for Tony Stark but it forgets to have one. It starts well. In fact the set-up is great. After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is having trouble sleeping, kept awake at night by nightmares of how he nearly died stopping the alien threat and haunted in the day by hallucinations and anxiety attacks. With his best weapon, his mind, seemingly fracturing two threats emerge. One a terrorist with unclear aims but seemingly immense power named the Mandarin, and the other a mistake from his past in the form of a biomechanical virus named Extremis. In short order Tony is stripped of his home, his supporting cast and even his Iron Man armour. Now the only tool he has left to fight back with is his mind, and he may be slowly losing that too.That is a brilliant first act with just two problems.Firstly that's the start of Iron Man 1 with Tony kidnapped and forced to use his wits to escape. Spoilers, he builds a suit of armour and kicks ass. Further spoilers, that does not happen in this film.Secondly, and more importantly, all of that set up gets tossed away haphazardly in the second act. Tony gets a pep talk from a cute kid and suddenly decides, okay, no more PTSD. There isn't any pay off. It's like the film knows it has to get rid of that stuff so we can have our big fight in the third act but can't think of a satisfying way to do so, so it just drops it.The psychological set up isn't the only thing that's jettisoned either. The most glaring example of this problem is the Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic in the early scenes; a terrifying and enigmatic presence that literally interrupts the film to deliver ominous warnings of doom. He's tremendously scary and the audience is eager to learn more about him. Then the second act undercuts all of that with a reveal that, whilst hilarious, leaves a gaping hole where the antagonist should be. Guy Pearce's mad scientist character Aldrich Killian suddenly has to step in and be the bad guy but he doesn't have the charisma or the personality to carry it. That's no slight on Guy Pearce by the way it's a fault with the script. We just don't get enough time with Killian to care when he suddenly becomes the big bad.The suit is another, similar, problem. At the start of the film Tony gets separated from his Iron Man armours and has to make do with a malfunctioning prototype. Now, unlike the other problematic aspects this one does build on the set-up. Tony has to use improvised weapons and his fast mouth to deal with physical threats until his armour is repaired. All of this builds up to Tony getting back in the suit and kicking righteous butt in the third act. And it does.The problem is they then proceed to do it again, and again. Tony gets suit, loses suit, gets suit. In fact the final battle is literally Tony getting into one suit after another as each breaks down or gets destroyed in turn. I know that the aim is to literalise the theme of Tony having to rebuild himself but the effect is just one big cinematic cock tease. Your film is called Iron Man, a significant part of the appeal of your film is seeing the man in the robot suit hitting things; get to the money shot people!Despite my complaints it's not a bad film by any means. I enjoyed it more than Iron Man 2 (which was a bloated overcrowded mess) and there's a lot to like. I loved the banter. I loved the multiple armour designs in the final fight. I loved the stunt with the people falling from the plane. I really, really loved Gary. It's just frustrating that there's one third of a truly great film here that gets sabotaged by its own plot twists.Flawed but enjoyable.Find out more about me and more film reviews at http://about.me/adamhalls",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"EXCEPTIONAL MOVIE! Complex, Emotional, Funny and Fun!","Iron Man 3 really is as fabulous as you've heard and as good as everyone is saying. It does the near impossible and that's improve on the first two films. The entire cast, the crew, the FX people and writers should all be as proud of this exceptional movie as they were of the first film. The entire journey and entire film is amazing but it's worth mentioning that they build on what worked in The Avengers. Tony's outward displays of bravado and wit have always hidden a deeply troubled and complex character. His demons are always under the surface. They make sure to recall the events of Avengers where this mortal hero faced impossible odds and even death in the darkest of deep space. That would rattle any person and I'm so glad they didn't gloss that over. It adds depth never before seen in these type of films. Tony was deeply affected and is deeply troubled. Now, add a twisted and truly formidable villain presence in Kingley's Mandarin and what they delivered was a movie as good as it gets. I loved the ending and how everything was handled because it can't be what anyone expected! This is without question the BEST film to finish a trilogy that's ever been made. The best ""number three"" film all-time in now Iron Man's title and Iron Man's title alone.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A good entertaining movie, but NOT the best of the series...","OK... let me start by saying I personally watch movies for either two reasons: either to be entertained or to enjoy great acting and cinematography ( directing, photography, writing, etc), sometimes a movie get kudos on both aspects, sometimes, just on one, sometimes just fail miserably. Iron Man 3 is a movie to watch to be entertained... period. I am not expert of the superhero mythology, so I cannot have an opinion on that. The plot start at some point in time after the events where the Avengers save the world in NYC. Yes, there are some development on the character of Tony Stark.. that self-centered, egocentric, and eccentric billionaire that Mr Downey Jr. has played so well on the previous three movies ( including The Avengers), he will realize even when he is Iron Man, he's still human, so the lesson that he will learn is that being in the limelight does have a cost, and sometimes that cost might affect and even make you lose the people around you. I do think this is the movie of the series that have tried ( because not all are good) to exploit the joke element the most..I let you be the judged of that. I still do think that the first movie is the best. As for the villain? well, personally I think for entertaining purposes and my personal rating, that's exactly why this one does not rate better for me , and once again, personally, the worst of the villains Iron Man has faced so far...why? simple...they never explained the reason WHY he do it, plus a big disappointed for me when Tony finally faces The Mandarin. If you enjoyed the previous two, would you be disappointed on the third?

A Quintessential Smart-Aleck Summer Action Blockbuster,"Iron Man 3 (2:11, PG-13, Imax, 3-D) ‚Äî fantasy: comics & pulps, biggie, sequelOK, I'd like to write a full review of Iron Man 3, but there are lots of plot twists in it, and I couldn't get very far into a plot description before having to shut up about them. This story complexity enhances the overall experience for me, but it's still just a glorious action-packed comic-book romp at heart, and so it's kind of hard to take it ALL that seriously. Screenwriters Drew Pearce and Shane Black (who also directed) certainly don't do anything to discourage that attitude, either.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), depicted as unaccustomedly angst-ridden over Earth's near- miss in last summer's The Avengers, bookends the film with motormouth talk therapy about his inability to sleep and anxiety attacks. These beset him at plot-convenient points in the movie but otherwise are far from crippling when it really matters, certainly not interfering with snappy sarcastic lines at every opportunity.The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is a suitably menacing bad guy in the Evil Emperor of the Universe mold, but he's not everything he appears to be. His main attributes are the ability to take control of all TV channels in America at once (something Rupert Murdoch would pay gigabux to acquire), a combination Burning Hands and Cure Serious Wounds spell, utter ruthlessness, and a flair for hammy theatrics. Again, not to be taken seriously.In addition to his loyal and super-competent aides, the human Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the AI Jarvis (voice of Paul Bettany), Tony Stark may (or may not) be able to count on 2 figures from his past, who pitched innovative ideas at him during his devil-may-care playboy days when he was partying like it was 1999 (because it was): biological researcher Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and fellow inventor/entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). They went on to succeed in their respective fields without the aid of Stark Industries, but they seem kind of taken with the idea of teaming up to save the world from malicious evildoers, since it got such good press in 2012.If you follow pro football at all, you know that there's been a lot of concern over player concussions, even despite helmets. These happen either when a fast-moving player is stopped suddenly and the brain bangs into the inside of the skull, or when a relatively stationary skull takes a hard smack and whacks into the brain. Either way, even if the hard outer shell remains intact and unscathed, the vulnerable squishy parts inside take the damage and pay the price. This fundamental fact of physical biology is utterly, utterly ignored in Iron Man 3. As are many other laws of science. As if anyone really cares.Did I mention Project Extremis? The White House plot? Iron Patriot? The many cameo appearances? The Exxon Valdez manque? The self-propelled armor elements? Harley, the cute little boy from Rose Hill, Tennessee, with the instincts of a future Tony Stark? Miss Elk Ridge? The rocket attack on not-at-all stately Stark Mansion? The chain-skydiving aerial rescue? Yeah, they managed to cram all that into the 2:11 running time, too.

It certainly makes me wonder if I will spend money on the upcoming Thor, Captain America,etc. I paid for 3D only to find around 15 minutes of it, badly used and non-spectacular.

Pass the Popcorn review,"In superhero movie franchises there is the famous rule that the second movie is, usually, the best one with the third being the worst. Ever since the flawed Iron Man 2 came out, it was pretty obvious the Iron Man franchise wouldn't follow this rule. After that set back, on the other hand, it was rather unclear what to expect from the third one. Will it be, nevertheless, the worst one? Or will it completely negate the superhero franchises' rule and triumph as the best one? The answer to these questions is: Iron Man 3 is neither the best nor the worst Iron Man movie. However, it is the strangest. You may ask, what do I mean by strange. Well, first of all, unbelievable as it may sound, Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie. Of course, there are some superhero movie elements here and there, but in its core Iron Man 3 is an action/comedy/thriller. To put in the words of director/co-writer Shane Black (who replaced Jon Favreau in the director's chair) - it's kind of a Tom Clancy style thriller. Because of that, Iron Man 3 is much more similar to another Robert Downey Jr. movie - also directed by Shane Black - 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. While I applaud the idea of experimenting with different genres, the ending result was not satisfying. Before I continue, I'll just say I have not seen the movie in 3D so I don't know how it holds in that aspect.The movie follows Tony Stark, as usual,who apparently got PTSD from the events that took place in the Avengers movie. He has trouble sleeping and has panic attacks from time to time. As if that weren't enough, his luxurious Malibu mansion gets destroyed by a terrorist called the Mandarin. Now he has to deal with the Mandarin and other potential threats in the form of old acquaintances. Thematically, Iron Man 3 is similar to The Dark Knight Rises - destroy the hero, put him on his knees so he can rise once again. That being said, Iron Man 3 is more about Tony Stark rather than about, you know, Iron Man. The similarities with The Dark Knight Rises don't stop here. Both movies have overly complicated stories. Not complicated in the intellectual way, mind you, but in a way that there are just too many intertwined subplots in the movie. Since this is the case, Iron Man 3 is prone to have some plot holes. I, myself, didn't notice many of them nor did I let them diminish my viewing experience, but I'm sure other people will notice them and they'll get frustrated. Anyway, the question remains - why all the TDKR similarities? And it's not only me, I've already seen people on the internet jokingly call this movie Iron Man Rises. To answer this question, we'll need to go back in 2012 when the Avengers exploded at the box office. Iron Man 3 was the first Marvel movie to be released after the Avengers and the stakes were pretty high. No doubt everyone involved wanted this sequel to continue the Avenger's financial success. When everyone realised they can't possibly re-create that success, they turned their heads to another last year superhero box office juggernaut, and copied it instead. And that's how the Iron Man franchise also jumped on the whole Dark Knight Trilogy bandwagon. I find this to be ironic since DC is trying to copy Marvel's Avengers by creating a Justice League movie. However, all of this is strictly my opinion.There's another famous rule in cinema, affecting especially superhero movies, which says that the movie is as good as its villain. And so we come to the Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin, in spite of how hard the trailers wanted to convince you, is not the main antagonist of the movie. Which is a damn shame, since he may be Iron Man's most famous villain. Instead of being the main bad guy, he plays this disappointingly strange role which I can't explain thoroughly without spoiling the movie. So yes, the movie is as good as its villain - Iron Man 3 is disappointingly strange. It puzzles me why he wasn't given the role he deserves. The reason for that can't be the 'realism', since the real main villain's powers aren't convincing as well, which contradicts Shane Black's statement that Iron Man will be fighting real world-type villains. I'll just say that regarding the villain, there's a definitive Dark Knight Trilogy vibe.Now that I got the two main things in superhero movie, the story and the villain out of the way, I must say I fairly enjoyed everything else - especially the humour. The acting is decent (Ben Kingsley being the best actor), the action is superb and the several Iron Man suits that show up in the movie are also nice. All in all, it seems that Iron Man 3 works best as a dumb popcorn flick. Unfortunately, it has no real re-watch value.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better than 2, about the same as 1","I have never really been a big Iron Man fan, and I thought the first movie was just fine, and the second was very hit-and- miss, with more misses than hits. This movie was overall better than 2. Robert Downey Jr. once again returns as Tony Stark with even more cool gadgets for his iron man suits. This movie takes place after the Avengers and there are a few flashbacks referencing it from Tony's PTSD.The villain this time is the Mandarin, a violent world-threatening terrorist, played by Ben Kinglsey. Without giving too much away, he targets Tony and makes his life miserable. I actually though the Mandarin was a weak villain though. Some people may not like what they end up doing with him either.Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle return as Pepper Potts and James Rhodes. War Machine returns and is also now called Iron Patriot. I liked both characters more in this movie than the other 2 and they have more important roles here. Pepper is in the first act, then disappears for a long time, then returns in the third act and I like what they did with her character.The movie is the darkest in tone of the trilogy, because of how Tony's world falls apart around him, but there is still a lot of funny dialogue and banter between characters, like in the other 2. A lot of this movie concerns Tony Stark only, not Iron Man. But the good thing is that Tony is not a total jerk like in the previous movie, he actually has a heart and tries to connect with people and help save the day.A few complaints I have are that the movie lags a bit in the middle, but not to a crawling pace. War Machine/Iron Patriot makes a few appearances but barely does anything. There are several plot twists in this movie, some I liked, some I didn't, like what they did with the Mandarin. The weapons that the Mandarin creates are completely unrealistic to me and seem like they belong in an entirely different movie. Also, he 3d was just OK, but not quite as good as I expected.Overall the movie works. It's a good summer film (taking place at Christmas) and mostly delivers what it promises.

An Honest Review,"This film breaks its viewing audience down into three categories.1) The people who hate it because of how awfully it veered from the comic books. It's the MCU, you have to expect that, so most people tend to give the Mandarin thing a wide breath.Sure, it was a disappointment, but not as big as fans make it out to be. It's the MCU, they are working in Feature Films not TV, you can't really make an epic villain out of anyone you know has to be knocked off and will never come back all in under 3 hours.So, why not warp him to fit the plot? 2) The people that want Iron Man and not Stark. From reading the bad reviews one gets the impression that people hate this because it isn't ALL IRON MAN ALL THE TIME.Stark isn't constantly suited up, and in fact, he wears it probably less than in any other movie.So the lack of CGI Iron Man action is going to garner a lot of distaste in some viewers.3) The people that like a balance between Stark and Iron Man, the story over action crowd.Not that this installment doesn't have action, but the action revolves around Stark and not Iron Man. It's good, but it's a total Stark story and one that develops his character nicely. What Iron Man 2 lacked in heart, Iron Man 3 made-up for.How are you going to like the movie? Well, that depends on who you are and how much you want to weigh one thing against the other. For Shane Black fans though, it totally works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh, no, another American president is in danger!","When I rate a film, I do it in comparison with the others of his genre. Luckily, for Iron Man 3 I have two other movies of the exact same type available, so that makes it easier. Unluckily, this is by far the worst film in the series. It doesn't mean it's very bad, just that it fails comparatively.The story is that a vicious terrorist appears to ""teach lessons"" to the American president and the US in general. All nice and beautiful, but before presenting this plot, it starts with Stark reminiscing about the past and presenting two major players. If it weren't for that, one would have kept asking oneself what is going on and kept a bit of the thrill on instead of guessing the plot from the get go.Afterwards, Iron Man gets his ass kicked. The manner is so simplistic an naive that it raises doubts about the entire franchise. Barely escaping he meets a kid that helps him out. Actually, that was the best part of the film. The kid story and their interaction was what saved this movie from being total special effects cr*p.Then the true horror is revealed with something so unlikely or believable that it made me laugh. You see, for terror and revenge, the villain has advanced the human race a few steps in its evolution and concomitantly solved any energy issues the world has ever had. Then Iron Man kicks his ass. Why?The ending was totally horrible, as a continuation of the start. Same lame voice explaining things, Stark realising he is the man and then a funny scene at the end, after the credits, which is not that funny.I have high hopes for Iron Man 4, though, as the villain can only be the biggest enemy of Starks: George R.

A terrific end to a phenomenal trilogy.,"Despite this film not being as good as the first two it is still a great film through and through. The story is riveting, the action is top notch, and the new characters are fantastic.Robert Downey Jr. Is exceptional once again as Tony Stark/Iron man. His acting is totally overlooked in this trilogy, and especially in this film, because they are in the Marvel universe.Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic again as Pepper Potts. The pain and emotion she shows throughout the whole film is just terrific acting.Guy Pearce is superb as Aldrich Killian. He plays the character incredibly well, and he arguably gives the best performance out of all the villains in this trilogy.This film just doesn't have the same atmosphere as the first two films, but that doesn't mean to say it has a bad atmosphere. The first two films just had a perfect atmosphere that fit the character, it's hard to explain.Overall, this is a great film and a very enjoyable watch.""My armour was never a distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon, and now I'm a changed man.

Marvel's Most Underrated,"This movie is a 9.7/10, due to how truly deep some of the things go. It shows us that no matter how much we change, our old demons don't just go away like that. It also shows us how properties don't make a man, but his wits do, and the amount of his preparation. Despite his world being destroyed by the Mandarin's goons, he managed to escape. He might've lost the battle, but not the war, and tries to avenge his defeat.Warning: Spoilers start below.His PTSD may seem like it was just forgotten, but it wasn't. His PTSD allowed him to make the invention which allowed him to escape from the compound, and which also saved his life when his mansion was destroyed. His PTSD also made Harley give Tony a piece of advice, to invent something to catch the Mandarin, which he promptly followed up on. The ending did not mean that Tony was giving up his suits, but instead means that he wasn't going to be basing his entire personality around the suits anymore, and moving on from his PTSD he got in The Avengers 1. I know that some people didn't like the sub - plots, but I think hearing WARMACHINEROX, and then having everybody in the sweat shop laugh is a good joke. Plus, it also allowed for Rhodes and Stark to come together. I could go on further, but it would not make my point any better. It was overall a great film, which is why I gave it a 9.7/10. Thanks for reading all of this, and have a great day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man is back,"The third installment in the Iron Man franchise is an entertaining movie like the first two, however i think of it as being a little dull when compared to the first two. The storyline is great, and actually a bit more interesting than others among these marvel superhero movies. Yet, it's ability to draw excitement is a bit watered down by the lack of Iron Man actually using his skills and the constant precense of jokes. Don't get me wrong - the jokes are good, and the movie itself is very laughable. Nevertheless, its hard to take a movie that is meant to thrill you seriously when much of is taken a sort of ironic distance to. It's as if the movie doesn't take itself seriously. But I must admit, that i did indeed like this movie and I can't help admiring every minute of Robert Downey Jr. playing this lovable asshole. Not to mention Guy Pearce's excellent acting as the total, yet tragic asshole. When it all comes down this movie is not the most thrilling experience, but it has good humour and some redeeming action scenes and actors. I would have given it a 7/10 but i am so much of an Iron Man fan that i can't help it but give this movie an 8/10. So if you're a marvel/superhero fan you will still love this movie despite it's flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
: ( I'm still weeping inside,Given all the hype and the talk of darker story lines and Tony stripped of the suit and using his mind again I really thought this was going to be awesome. Iron Man was brilliant. I try and pretend Iron Man II didn't happen and The Avengers was INCREDIBLE but this is a really poor movie. The humour is not through the usual one liners but through silly scenes. They wheel out Air Force One and the whole scene is a complete time filler that does nothing to move the plot on - it's just clich√©d and gratuitous. For the first time in a Marvel movie the best scenes are all in the trailers and the rest is actually completely miss-able. There is so much wrong it is hard to talk about it without discussing the plot. It really is poor and...and...I can't believe this script was okayed. I'm so upset I can't keep...writing...there's even stupid toilet humour...,2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not trolling, just being honest","Iron Man 3 is... screw it, you know what Iron Man 3 is, you know who Tony Stark is. Anyways, Iron Man 3 picks up after the events of Avengers: ""what happened in New York"", as the movie refers to that movie. I know there's a lot of every-which-way hype over this movie already but hopefully I can navigate my way through that and just give my unaffected view.But let's get down to brass tax, Iron Man 3 is an Iron Man movie, for better or worse. For me, mostly for worse because that FIRST trailer, (and none of the ones after it) promised a much edgier tone, and a finally not on-top-of-the-world Stark, giving the series a vitally necessary change of pace. I'm not saying I wanted The Dark Knight or anything, just something with more gravitas and a little less fizz. And the film dismisses the notion almost immediately. Yes, Tony does have some post-traumatic stress/sleep-deprivation stuff going on here, but it's not treated with any measure of depth or significance. Like everything else in the film, (EVERYthing, the characters, the plot, the fight scenes), it's treated as a throwaway gag, and has one of the most laughable half-baked resolutions I have ever seen for any plot arc.And lets face it, the mile-a-minute barrage of repartee-esque dialogue, and the infamous glib Stark one-liners which were so fresh and fun back when Iron Man came out... are all really tired and stale now; and that's pretty much the first half-hour of this movie.Once the film kicks into summer movie gear, it becomes an insipidly endless barrage of self-referential humor, broad slapstick, and lots (and LOTS) of noisy, flashy set pieces. And I'm not some action-hater or anything. I loved The Avengers. I just found the throw-downs in this overly bombastic, not particularly interesting, and pervasively noisy. That's not to say there weren't moments then and again that I thought were cool or found somewhat amusing, they were just drowned out by the rest.Iron Man 3 feels and plays much more like G.I Joe than any marvel movie. That especially goes for the ludicrous plot that stole it's villain origin story from an animated kidpic from ten years ago, it's baddies from (yes) G.I. Joe, and The Terminator, (sooooo Terminator, oh my gosh!!) and every clich√©' from every buddy action flick ever. I feel like somebody's gonna be like ""NO! that's cuz it was a throwback, look at who directed it jerk!"". But when your plot is derivative AND ridiculous... yeah, that's all.Some people will definitely enjoy IM 3 just fine. It's certainly one of the most ambitious superhero films thus far in terms of the amount and scale of action. But I would say, even Thor was much better as a movie because of its solid script and well-drawn characters. (Avengers miraculously managed to have both).Iron Man 3 is a mediocre film, which I happened to see coming off another mediocre film...so there's that. But my overall opinion stands that it's garish excess, endless self-referential commentary, and disregard of potentially interesting plot elements, (not to mention some completely squandered characters) renders it an underwhelming film-going experience. It might just be me, but I find ""good"" films to be entertaining. But oh well... it's gonna make sh**-loads. Oh I forgot to mention: my favorite part of the movie... Jon Favreau!! Did anyone else notice his unmistakably Vincent Vega getup in the first scene?? **/*****",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth a watch for the Graphics lovers,"Another Superhero movie who is trying hard to catch top listing like the Batman, Spiderman, Hulk, Superman etc. But what prevents from it is the making. Though apart from the Nolan's series of Batman even the same masked Bruce Wayne is a superhero who performs unbelievable things (may be thats why they are superheros)Coming back to the movie, I just wonder if the script had enough depth in it. Characters like Pepper could have been done better. May be a bad choice of actor. The expectation on Mandarin is kept the movie going with the presence of a great actor. But it too went nothing when we saw Guy was the original brain behind it.Now coming to the best part of the film, The graphics and stunts. It has been the best part like I said, because of the commitment of all the artist. But still once again another movie with a climax in a port and earth movers.At the bottomline, Iron Man remains a Superhero. He will never become a legend like the Nolan's Batman.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The perfect superhero movie you want to see.,"Ironman 3 is a superhero movie directed by Shane Black and stars Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Ty Simpkins, St√©phanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, Jon Favreau and Ben Kingsley in the leads with Paul Bettany reprising his role of Jarvis.This is one of the most perfect superhero movie I have watched with lots of action, guns, blasts, fights and a powerful Villain.Most importantly you can notice that in most of the scenes Robert Downey Jr. stays unmasked and also fights with pieces of his armour. There were thoughts in the mind that whether Shane Black will be able to do justice with the massive movie but he gives the movie a fresh feeling.The movie is purely entertaining movie with action, drama, comedy with a pinch of emotion.As far as acting is concerned Robert Downey Jr. has mastered himself in the role of ironman so beautifully that sometimes it feels that he is the real ironman. Gwyneth Paltrow and Guy Pearce were just amazing but the best character of the movie is Ben Kingsley who portrays his role with pure perfection.Overall if you are looking for an action packed superhero movie with some of the spectacular stunts this is the movie for you and a must watch for all the MCU fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fresh, thrilling and surprising, IM3 is NOT the disaster users are saying it is...","It's Christmas. Tony Stark, the self proclaimed playboy, billionaire, philanthropist is in somewhat of a rut after the monumental events of The Avengers. He can't sleep, and when he does has haunting flashbacks of that day in Manhattan. What's worse, a new terrorist called The Mandarin emerges and induces more country spread panic for the Americans, whilst Aldrich Killian comes back for a spot of oneupmanship, with his new invention, the Extremis serum.The creative journey taken by Black and Marvel with Stark is a smart one. In stripping back the armour (literally), they have not only rid the franchise of Iron Man 2's flaws, but also brought the focus well and truly back in their most powerful of weapons: Robert Downey Jr. Whereas in Iron Man 2 a certain complacency was evident in his performance, Downey completely eradicates that with an honest, vulnerable and achingly human performance, with his trademark wit and sarcasm very much present and correct.His seemingly new found energy and drive for the franchise is compounded by the terrific supporting cast. Gyneth Paltrow once again proves a welcome presence, and her natural chemistry with Downey is made all the more shiny by the superb script; the actors here get the best dialogue to deliver of the whole franchise, and it is obvious the difference it has made. Ben Kingsley, in the trickiest role, proves very successful, with his menacing and surprising turn proving to be one of the major rewards of the film (and THAT twist will be a talking point for years to come. Off the record, I absolutely adored it.) Of the newcomers, though, it is Guy Pearce who makes the biggest impact, with a charismatic, threatening and wholly satisfying performance as Aldrich Killian, head honcho of think tank AIM. Don Cheadle seems to have settled in his much more defined and driven role of Rhodes, now with him being the straight Glover to Downey's Gibson, a genius decision from Black.The most impressive thing at play here is balance. Writers Black and Pearce have created a sharp, witty and quite frankly hilarious script that feels fresh and original. They have brought back the off beat energy irreverent tone that made the first one such a blast. Gone are the plodding and leaden sub plots of the first sequel, and in comes a masterfully constructed rug pulling narrative; the perfect foundation to build on Marvel's most frivolous and entertaining character. Not only this, but IM3 marks the evolution of Marvel from a risk assessing, cautious world builder to a brash and brilliant risk taker. It seems in every sense that Marvel and Black have embraced and embodied the very attitude of Tony Stark. A welcome playfulness is present in Black's script writing; a mid act introduction of a child being the most convention-smashingly inspired, allowing Downey to show his remarkably adaptable and chameleon like range. He is able, in a blink of an eye, to go from vulnerable to lip-smackingly confident. Don't be concerned, Black avoids clich√© with some brilliantly judged moments in this mid-act tone changer (on child revealing his abandonment, 'Dads leave, quit being such a pussy about it'). The emotion is never a sacrifice for the gags though, with the threat of The Mandarin and the vulnerability of Stark being ever present and constantly reminded of, even if at times the film runs the risk of being too gleefully irreverent. The script's accomplished smarts don't stop there, with Pearce and Black also managing to play on the damsel in distress plot device (is Pepper the saved or in fact the savior?), whilst also providing wholly satisfying and engaging arcs for its characters. Inevitably, though, the journey of Tony is the most thematically and emotionally satisfying, possibly of the whole Marvel canon.A recurring criticism of both IM and IM2 was the uninspiring and repetitive action, with IM2 being undoubtedly the biggest offender. Simply put, two dudes in varying types of suits fighting each other isn't very interesting, nor is watching Iron Man kill hundreds of clone robots with one single swivel at all thrilling. IM3 solves this problem with aplomb, and then some. This is in no small part down to the ingenious use of Stark's mark 42, which can, on command, send its components flying onto Stark's body, allowing for hilarious slapstick and some genuinely tense set pieces. In fact, every action sequence in IM3 hits the spot; highlights being a Tom Clancy-esque action ballet executed flawlessly by an out of suit Stark, or the thrilling climax, which makes brilliant use of Tony's over-zealous amount of suits whilst offering further surprises and heart in the mouth moments. Iron Man 3 succeeds in all counts, meaning that we are left pining for Downey to sign another contract already. Oh, and be sure to stay for the hilarious post credits sequence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hilarious Movie, With One of the Best MCU Villains (So Far)","Iron Man 3 has very high stakes while managing to be hilarious at the same time.The dialogues are as funny as ever even though they don't always make complete sense. I think the Mandarin has been the best villain in the Iron Man movies so far, one of the best in the MCU. I knew who was behind the curtain all along, but he felt like a real danger and he was menacing. I like that Hogan got a bigger role and I also like how Tony Stark is evolving throughout the story. Speaking of the story, it was less predictable the most MCU movies, it had a few great twists including both the protagonist and the villain.The cinematography is good, the editing too, but it's a common theme with Marvel movies that most of them are a little too long or overstretched and this is no exception. The casting is amazing, the acting performances are good, Robert Downey Jr. Is just absolutely perfect for this role. Guy Pearce is amazing as Aldrich Killian is amazing. The visual effects looked wonderful, I had no issues with it. The action sequences were outstanding.Iron Man 3 is an amazing conclusion to the trilogy, which ends at a perfect point from the character's perspective.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Prodigal Returns,"Greetings again from the darkness. My initial reaction upon seeing this opening day was that some fan boys are not going to be happy. Of course, this happens every time Hollywood makes changes to the original comic book material in hopes of attracting massive box office numbers. While I recognize many of the ""flaws"", I found this to be an interesting turn on the Tony Stark/Iron Man series.Shane Black was brought in to direct and help write the script. Mr. Black is best known for his crackling buddy dialogue in movies like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (also with Robert Downey Jr), but doesn't have significant directorial experience (his most recent effort was KKBB 5 years ago). My belief has always been that what sets this franchise apart is Robert Downey Jr's take on Tony Stark. A wise-cracking billionaire playboy technology and mechanical genius searching for his true identity. Mr. Black re-focuses the story on Stark. In fact, he basically takes everything away and has him start over.Regardless of the story, many line up for these movies to see the special effects and the bad guys. The special effects are everywhere ... and loud ... and massive. The trailer shows a clip of Stark's Malibu mansion being destroyed, but the entire segment is quite impressive. The number of Iron Man suits seems unlimited at times and the big finale gave me the same feeling of a 4th of July fireworks display when it ends with so many clumps of fireworks being fired at once, that the impact is dulled. As for the bad guys, The Mandarin is one of the most fierce opponents faced by Iron Man in the comics. His portrayal here by Ben Kingsley is a blast to watch, but will undoubtedly upset the true fanboys. Guy Pearce plays Aldrich Killian, a demented mastermind, once snubbed by Stark - in a scene we witness in flashback.My preference here is to focus on the fun elements since that's clearly what Marvel and Black are shooting for. Jon Favreau directed the first two entries in the franchise and here takes on a slightly bigger role as head of security for the Stark corporation ... and he provides some comic relief. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) finally gets to do more than roll her eyes, but she still has her damsel in distress moments. Don Cheadle returns as Col. Rhodes ... or War Machine ... now known as Iron Patriot, but mostly he is just waiting for his own movie. Rebecca Hall has some screen time as a smart woman who is not so wise in her choosing of partners. No comment. Ty Simpkins plays Harley, a country boy who helps Stark in his time of need. James Badge Dale, Miguel Ferrer, William Sadler, and Dale Dickey all have strong moments, but therein lies what may be the film's biggest weakness.It's an incredibly impressive film to watch ... giant visuals, really good actors and quick, witty dialogue. But there seems to be an overload of each of these things. Guy Pearce's character is woefully underdeveloped. I so wanted more of his backstory and motivation. Same with Harley, the boy. Much could have been done with that. Miguel Ferrer, always a worthy opponent, must have had his best scenes left in editing. The scene with Ben Kingsley, Don Cheadle and Robert Downey Jr, may have been the best in the movie simply because we got a real peak at each of these character's personality. That's way more fun that another explosion!The film pummels us with action, probably has too much Tony Stark and too little Iron Man for the fanboys, throws in a hard-to-swallow sub-plot regarding Anxiety issues for Stark, and underutilizes Guy Pearce in what could have been a world class evil doer. Still, despite all of that, it's fun to watch and Robert Downey Jr will always be Iron Man!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst superhero movies ever.,"I'd like to keep my reviews short and sweet. So here it goes: Iron Man 3, really not worth the hype. First of all, we rarely see Tony Stark in his suit. Even when he gets inside one, the suit gets messed up real soon. Second, there isn't much to watch in the movie except the scenes we saw in the trailers. Third, the idea used in the story line seems stolen from another movie, whose name i won't like to reveal as it may become a spoiler, maybe. The 3D effects wasn't any good, but for that, i should probably just blame the movie theater. Ah whatever, the movie sucks.

Tony Stark returns in the best 'Iron Man' yet,"Following a film like 'The Avengers' for is no easy feat for even one of the most successful film franchises around today. After becoming the biggest box office smash of 2012 (taking over a billion in little more than a week) and garnering unanimously positive reviews, it was undeniable that 'The Avengers' successor would come with high expectations, as not only is 'Iron Man 3' following 'The Avengers', but it also marks the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase One and the beginning of the series' Phase Two.After the disappointingly flat 'Iron Man 2', Jon Favreau left the chair (while keeping his acting role as Happy Hogan) and passed it on to 'Lethal Weapon' scribe Shane Black. Any doubts of Iron Man continuing on the poor quality of the first sequel swiftly exit the premises, because it is clear - that like Joss Whedon ‚Äì Shane Black has expertly taken the source material in his hands and placed a big personal stamp all over it. Of course this means that we are treated to a cracking script that brims with sparkling one-liners that feature some great references to everything from Croydon to 'Downtown Abbey'), but there is also a real sense of human depth and development to the characters more than ever before. And being a Shane Black film, it is set at Christmas.'Iron Man 3' finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) experiencing PTSD after the events in ""New York"" at the end of 'The Avengers'; he is paranoid, suffering from insomnia and anxiety attacks. However, when a Middle-Eastern terrorist The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) issues multiple assaults on the US, Tony vows that he will face him...It's no great secret that Robert Downey Jr's ever-great turn as Tony Stark is one of the greatest assets in Marvel's arsenal, so it is unsurprising that many of this film's high points are when Stark is out of the suit. After having worked with Black on his directorial debut 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', it is clear to see that he and Downey Jr. form a great team; Black's knack for sharp dialogue is perfectly suited to the actor and works to laugh-out-loud effect in some scenes. The other actors are also given more to do than in previous installments, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow's as Stark's beau Pepper Potts and Don Cheadle as James Rhodes, who forms a double-act with Stark that's not entirely dissimilar to Riggs and Murtaugh.While Black has written scripts for nearly thirty years (becoming Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter at one point), this is only his second film as director, so it's a pleasant surprise that the action sequences are so well-directed conceived and directed, comparatively better than any other in the trilogy so far. A stunning first-act assault on Stark's home and a near breathtaking plane set piece are real standouts. Unfortunately, the final reel's battle, while well-staged, falls somewhat flat.Ultimately, 'Iron Man 3' is ‚Äì while not as good as last year's biggest hitter ‚Äì arguably the best solo outing for Tony Stark. It's consistently funny and occasionally heartwarming (especially in the bond Stark forms with a young boy), with great action and strong performances that are aided by an excellent script. Also, without giving too much away, let's just saw that Kingsley's performance as The Mandarin is quite good, just not in that way you'd expect. Marvel's Phase Two has gotten off to a hugely enjoyable start.Also, stay until the very end of the credits. It's a Marvel movie after all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The mechanic,"Iron Man 3 is the first Iron Man movie in which we get to see Tony Stark as a superhero in himself not just a man in a suit. The struggle that Tony experiences around his loss of the suit throughout most of the movie provide evidence of the actual hero being Tony and not the suit. The plot is okay but it overall isn't even addressed too often because the writing is meant to make way for the development of Tony during his final solo film. The villain is good at creating scenarios for Tony to prove himself however he is pretty surface level. I will reiterate once more that although the movie as a movie for the most part is not too great, the scenes when Tony is stuck without his suit provide more character development in a meaningful way than any other scene in any Marvel film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
RDJ & VFX team nailed it again,One thing that's consistently amazing with the Iron Man trilogy is it's visual effects. It only keeps improving in each Sequel which can't be said for the entire MCU.

The MCU (So Far) Ranked: #9,Iron Man 3 is great and I will not change my mind on that. This was the first team up between Robert Downey Jr. and screenwriter/director Shane Black since 2005s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and it was worth the wait. The dialogue is sharp and the plot with Tony Stark dealing with P.T.S.D. after the events of The Avengers makes for a great character study.I am aware that the general consensus is that the plot twist sucks but with Ben Kingsleys fantastic performance and the wonderfully absurd way that it is reveled I can't help but love it. In all honesty I just to big a Shane Black fan to hate this (the same logic does not apply to The Predator).,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dark but Necessary,"This is (and will be) the darkest of the Iron Man films. If it gets any darker, they will probably lose their audience. But, this was necessary. Stark comes thru the Battle of New York with PTSD; the Mandarin goes big on a terrorist campaign and the Tony-Pepper relationship hits a rough spot. The perennial teenager has trouble dealing like an adult. Downey really shows his chops as an actor, probably drawing on his own troubled past as source material -- he's got a lot and he needs it for this role. Paltrow really steps up for this one. We have seen her as the tough business woman, now we see her as the survivor. The writing isn't great. The effects are overdone. It might have been better if it was just 5 minutes shorter.

Iron Man 3 is MILES way better than nowdays MCU movies,"Iron Man 3 is MILES way better than Avengers: End Game. Iron Man 3 at leats did not kil Iron Man and itr finished the trilogy perfectly. I am glad Shane Black replaced the director Jon Favreau who ruined the sequel and didn't know what to do with the movie. I love this movie and it is one of my favorites MCU films. I love it more than the last ""Iron Man"" movie The third entry of Iron Man is a decent kick-ass bad-ass action film. There is a ton of action in there. The characters are better developments. Iron Man 3 is MILES way better than Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame and Ant-Man and the Wasp!!!!!!!!! Those movies suck I don't like em. I love this movie so much I have a blast watching it.Gwyneth Paltrow was more supporting girlfriend than she was in Iron Man 2, she wasn't so annoying like she was in the last Iron Man movie. I love her performance in this movie so much. This is the last time we see her in any superhero movie she only appeared in one scene in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Ben Kingsley (as Trevor Slattery) Mandarian was an okay and as did even-sexier-when-angry Gwyneth Paltrow. :-D The movie is set after the events of ""The Avengers"" after New York and Tony Stark is fallen to pieces suffering post-Avengers PTSD, Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark is called upon to stop a bomb-happy terrorist known as the Mandarin, as well a mad scientist who has used the experimental regenerative drug he created to build an army of powerful mutant humans, and who is now threatening to kill Tony's sweetheart, Pepper Potts.More entertaining, better story, good Special Effects CGI. The last good Iron Man movie almost good as the first one. I also don't understand the negative reviews. Shane Black directed well action MARVEL fun popcorn film that is also intrigue thriller and different from the first movie. I have enjoy this movie a lot and I had fun with it. This is not Lethal Weapon, Die Hard With A Vengeance, Terminator 2: Judgment Day or Aliens it is an own movie about dark fantasy and a different science fiction film filled with action. Even tough Stark and Rhodey are both in that ship without their armored that doesn't mean they look like Murtaugh and Riggs or McClane and Carver the story is different.I for once have enjoyed the helicopter action sequences which were bad-ass. Attack on Tony's house whit helicopters blowing Tony's house to pieces was the first time in the film I ever saw. Gwyneth put Iron Man Armor on in and she saved Maya Hansen that was outstanding. The scene was pure action! That was so bad.-ass action all Stark's suits were destroyed. I love the opening scene on New Year Eve in 1999 in which we see Tony Stark for the first time been selfish and arrogant person he was in the first Iron Man. We see Yinsen (Shaun Toub) how they met this deals with a prequel from the first movie. Yes I enjoy this movie more than any other MRAVEL film it so bad.-ass. The movie is set on Christmas Eve, reminds me on Batman Returns there was a kid Harley, a precocious 10-year-old boy in which helps to repair his suit Mark 42. He wasn't annoying kid. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene.The main bad guy is Aldrich Killian great performance from Guy Pearce who previously played in Christopher Nolan's Memento. I thought Aldrich Killian was brilliant mad scientist who participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Guy Pearce played a great bad guy Aldrich Killian, he was right from the comic books. To mask his illegal activities as a terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the ""Mandarin"" portrayed by the British actor Trevor Slattery to serve as his proxy, unaware that the Mandarin truly existed. He also conspired with Vice President Rodriguez in an attempt to take control over both the United States of America and the War on Terror, manipulating them for his own profit. Miguel Ferrer as Vice President is also in this movie he was in RoboCop (1987).Extremis are super soldiers who are impossible to stop. I hated it the Mandarian joke too and the twist around but I accept it they way it is. Aldrich Killian developed that program Extremis with Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) who was also love interest of Tony Stark for one stand. Aldrich Killian and Maya Hansen plotted revenge for years on Tony Stark. Great performance from Rebecca Hall.I disagree with the haters about this movie I have enjoy it from the begging till end. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is a nice fellow guy he promoted this movie and I saw him how good he was with kids he was so nice on his movie Iron Man 3. Don Cheadle as War Machine was much better than he was in the last Iron Man movie. The action sequences on the end of the movie looks like in Terminator 2: Judgment Day in a steel mill sequence while on here was on the docks on a ship. If you see Pepper Potts falling down in to the fire you see Tony Stark goes to do what he has to do, to stop Aldrich Killian as he put more suits on him self.Was a good ending of the trilogy I have enjoy it, it is my favorite MCU MILES way better movie than ""The Dark Knight Rises"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good.,"Although I mostly liked the part when Eiffel 65's Blue ( Da Ba Dee) was playing, the movie was awesome, cool, and the battles were cool.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome conclusion to the Iron Man trilogy.,4.5 out of 5 stars.Iron Man 3 is a really good superhero film. Coming after Avengers. The film does pack a lot more with action. Humor. And a good concluding story to Iron Man. The story was good. There is a twist with the villain that may divide fans. I thought it was well done. Shane Blacks direction was good. He packed enough action sequences. Humor. And a great cast. It may not live up to how Avengers was with pacing. But it was one of the best films in the trilogy.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Watchable if you don't read the comics, laughable if you do. **SPOILERS**","I was actually happy with the film during the beginning half of it. It did a good job of tying into The Avengers and blending the Extremis arc with The Mandarin. There were some details I didn't enjoy, like how they turned War Machine into Iron Patriot (who is Norman Osbourne in the comics), or Aldrich Killian being alive (who is dead and has a smaller role in the comics). However, these were details I felt were minor enough to forgive because the story was initially progressing in a good direction. However, once they revealed The Mandarin's secret, everything took a turn for the worse.How do you manage to take the main super-villain to Iron Man, fill his role with one of the most revered actors in Hollywood, and still manage to completely ruin the character that bad? This version of The Mandarin is just laughable, and it's really frustrating because Shane Black completely missed an opportunity to have one of the most bad-ass movie super-villains ever. And it seemed like everything began to just spiral out of control from that point. Aldrich Killian turns out to actually be The Mandarin, Pepper gets injected with the extremis virus and kills Aldrich, and just a bunch of other nonsense plot devices. They just strayed so far off from the comics that it became too hard to forgive all those minor details.I will say this for the movie though: If you ignore the comic-book mythos, then Iron Man 3 is actually a good movie. All the actors played their parts really well, the CGI looked great, and the action was solid. However, as a fan of the comics, this movie left a very sour taste in my mouth. If this is what MCU has in store for us, then I'm not excited at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3 - Noodles Review,"8 out of 10 as a movie; 5 out of 10 as an Iron Man movieYou might've noticed my scoring of the movie and that's because it's a very awesome summer movie. But if you're a fan of comics and superheros (which I hugely am), you might feel a little different about it. If you're a die hard Iron Man fan, you'll probably be disappointed. I'm not saying it's a bad movie because it DEFINITELY is not. However, there are some points in the movie that could alter the enjoyment of the film. Iron Man 3 was my 4th most anticipated movie of 2013 (after Man of Steel, The Hobbit 2, and Elysium) and I wouldn't blame anyone for really looking forward to this movie. The trailers were insanely incredible. While the movie doesn't pull through as well as the trailers, it's still somewhat of a treat.The premise of Iron Man 3 is actually quite interesting. It ties back to The Avengers in which Iron Man practically saved the whole world in the end. He gets anxiety and can't sleep at night because of his post-traumatic stress. The stuff really affected him big time. Then, The Mandarin has to come about and just bring him even more hell. I really liked the idea and where they were going with it. Tony Stark sort of has to use his wits and go on without the Iron Man suit for a bit. I liked that idea but it was a bit drawn out at times. However, the dialogue is quite on point (from the writer of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Lethal Weapon so I would imagine so). Sometimes I felt the humor was a little overdone but, oh well, it's a summer movie, I'll deal with it. The humor does kind of have a purpose though. That's who Tony Stark is. He's a narcissist who throws in one liners whenever he wants. Robert Downey Jr. obviously owns the role; he was born to play Tony Stark. Guy Pearce is an awesome actor and he pretty much owns his role but we'll talk about his character a little later. Don Cheadle was great and I was happy to see how much more developed his character was in this movie. However, I didn't really care about Pepper Potts in this movie as much as I did in previous movies, even though the movie tries to make you care about her. One character the movie did good at making you care about early on was The Mandarin. Ben Kingsley pretty much owns the role and I was expecting him to be awesome. If you don't get the gist of The Mandarin; he's the archnemesis of Iron Man, his most important villain. Joker to Batman, Lex Luthor to Superman, Green Goblin to Spiderman, Mandarin to Iron Man. You gotta do him well. However something happens that just completely splits the decision of whether or not you can enjoy the rest of the film. But I won't say it since this is a spoiler-free review; I'll only do a spoiler filled review if enough of you guys ask for it. Anyways, it's a pretty pivotal sequence in the movie. When you watch the movie, I guarantee you'll know what I'm talking about. It was a great move as a film. But as an Iron Man film, it just wasn't the way it should've been done.A lot of what I didn't like about the movie are spoilers, so I can't really elaborate big on them in detail. I'll say this: a lot of what happened was really cheesy and cartoony, while other things were clich√©. That's the most I can say without spoiling anything. Additionally, there were some flaws in the conveyance of emotion, where I sort of felt for the characters but then something would happen that would completely change that. But still, the action is pretty sweet in this movie. Whenever the suit just latches itself onto Tony Stark, I feel like I've seen some of the coolest things in the world. And the final battle is awesome! And that's something we didn't get with the first two Iron Man movies. It was really entertaining and I was totally amazed until the end of it... another totally clich√© scene occurred. However, I rolled with it and watched the rest of the movie, which ended up being a lot of important scenes, going through unnoticeably in about a minute or two.All in all, Iron Man 3 is definitely better than Iron Man 2 but can't quite get up to the level that the first Iron Man did. I'd say it's the most entertaining of the series for casual movie goers though. It has some awesome action and insanely cool special effects. There's subtle humor pretty much everywhere in the movie and Tony Stark is still a very lovable character. However, it does get kinda drawn out at some points, and cartoony at other times. As a regular movie, I give it 8 out of 10 Noodles. But, I can't deny my own feelings of the directions taken in this movie that really detracted from the experience for me, big time. It really doesn't compare to the level of emotion and amazement of the first movie, or the level of epicness that The Avengers reached. If adding the disappointing aspects of the movie as an Iron Man film, it's 5 out of 10 Noodles. I guess that averages it out at a 6.5, but in spite of that, I wouldn't really have a problem watching it again",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
But why? Why?,"Why did they have to go and screw a good thing up? I mean this was boring and hardly any good action scenes.The first two Iron Man's was good, this one not so good.Robert Downey Jr. was not his best , he is so much better.It's definitely not worth paying for in a theater.Wait till your friend rents it and see it for free.I sure hope they get Jon Favreau to be part of part four, I think that might have been the reason this Iron Man was not up to par.Can't wait for the next ""Avengers""Sincerely,IMDb loyal member",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I am Iron Man,"Iron Man as you know it - only that he now experiences anxiety attacks.There is the usual action, the Hollywood explosions, the maniac enemy, the cool suits and Tony Stark.But it's not more. Indeed, the enemies are really a bit boring and clichee. It's always the guy who wants revenge and then just mindlessly starts destroying things. That's such an overrated and overused enemy design. Yaaaawn.Nonetheless, it's still Iron Man, it's still Tony Stark, it's still worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Self-referential struggle with machinery,"This works for me, if only a bit, in spite of all the superhero trappings, which are tired even by Marvel standards. Typical post- 9/11 hero plot, with a bit of harmless shuffling of sides but pressing the same business as the White House movies earlier this year: for all its technologic might and security, poor America is at the mercy of chaotic, evil forces and needs war machines from the skies.What if the Osama-lookalike is really a puppet and a disgruntled American is behind the plan? Tony Stark's assertion that it's not about politics but good old-fashioned revenge stays. The bombings and televised messages stay, tapping into a more visceral fear than logic can dress in retrospect. Those images register closer to televised reality, while the actual villain is a more removed cartoon, a genetic supermutant.But moving on. This time they got Shane Black to write and direct and he brings a sensibility of equal parts deflating and indulging the iconography that he has honed in previous films and that Downey knows and can support. In fact that's his main job these days in this and Sherlock. A punch and a wink.And one reason why many didn't like this is that it's really a Tony Stark movie, which means a Robert Downey movie.Probably it came down to a simple practical matter for the makers; more Iron Man time needs a faceless robot (and Downey pretending he's in a suit) which minimizes Downey's charming draw as actor.So he spends most of his time outside the suit, improvising. And many of the situations this time revolve around the fact that his gadgets won't work, those that would yield the Iron Man movie. Sporadically they do, so we get bursts of uninteresting Marvel noise. But often, only parts of the suit will fly to him performing only part of their task. Often, they'll blow up in his face revealing a flummoxed Downey like a silent era comedian, a Lloyd or Chaplin, mystified at some thingamajig that won't work.It's all about a screwy actor feigning a struggle with machinery he's built. Clever and amusing. Along the way, we meet another screwy actor inside the story with drug problems. But that is all continuously swallowed up in the larger Marvel contraption he has to deliver, where the comedian's soulmate and world peace alike are grandiosely threatened in the dull way of Marvel.Interestingly, Marvel's grandiose aims with functional mechanics are reflected in the visual map of mind Guy Pearce shows early in the film. Impressive to look at but merely an embroidered function. For a brief time, neurologists thought they could come up with a computational model of mind that would explain all. No dice. Consciousness is its own space.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man 3 (2013) Marvel's most underrated movie,"A film that until today is very judged and considered very bad, but which is actually a very wronged film. In fact, it has numerous problems, such as the Mandarin's plot twist, the villain and the development of the story. However, none of these factors make the movie as bad as people say. The third film in the trilogy is only average and is certainly better than the second film. It is full of jokes that work, it creates an interesting drama, but I didn't use it so well, and the action scenes are wonderful. If the movie could focus more on Tony Stark's post-traumatic stress it would be much better. It's a film with many flaws, but it's still not bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 3,"Iron Man 3, An almost great movie.Good stuff: We see an Iron Man half of the movie weak and with anxiety, yet the screenwriters knew how to easily and gradually fix this thing during the movie and I liked it. I liked that little boy at certain moments . Pepper is extremely well built in this film, it shows us more and you feel the pain she feels(Because she has a husband who only does dangerous things).Less good stuff : The script is hmm I can't really find the right word but the script is almost good. The dialogues were ok almost good .Actors were almost good (I mention that here I am not talking about by Downey jr and Paltrow-They played superbly).Let's also talk a little about the acts of this movie, Act 1 was ok to good, act 2 was good to great and ... act 3 was .. almost great ..
However, I can't see the movie above a 7.3/10 .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing movie but not perfect...,"Iron Man 3 was a movie I was EXTREMELY looking forward to. The trailers were amazing and The Avengers was really awesome! This movie lived up to my expectations but was it perfect? Well short answer no, but it is very close to perfect. The acting was amazing from all of the cast. Robert Downey Jr will always be the best Iron Man! Don Cheatle, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Gwyneth Paltrow were also amazing. The special effects were great and the action was really awesome. There was a certain twist that ruined the movie for some people but not for me :) The only problem I had with the movie was that I thought the whole Extremis plot could have been scrapped. It served not much to the story. Another small issue was that I wish Ben Kingsley would be in it more :( But overall it is very amazing and I think older children will LOVE it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A thrilling journey of self-discovery and redemption,"""Iron Man 3"" is the third installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's ""Iron Man"" series, and it certainly packs a punch. Directed by Shane Black, the film sees Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) face off against his most formidable opponent yet, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), while also dealing with personal demons and a failing relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).One of the strengths of ""Iron Man 3"" is the humor that permeates throughout the film. The witty banter and one-liners that have become a hallmark of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are present in abundance here, and they help to balance out some of the more serious moments. The film also benefits from a strong supporting cast, with standout performances from Don Cheadle as James Rhodes and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.However, the film is not without its flaws. The plot can be somewhat convoluted at times, with multiple storylines weaving in and out of each other. Additionally, some fans were disappointed with the way the Mandarin was portrayed in the film, feeling that it did not live up to the character's comic book counterpart.In conclusion, ""Iron Man 3"" is an entertaining and enjoyable addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While it may not be perfect, it still manages to deliver on the action, humor, and spectacle that fans have come to expect from the franchise. For these reasons, I would rate the movie 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
