niceeee one,"""Black Panther"" follows some typical superhero plot points, but it does make a few changes along the way. Perhaps the biggest is in how the villain is represented. He doesn't really play a big part until close to an hour into the film. Until then, we are entertained by a more minor villain named Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). There are several stabs at humor (not unusual for a Marvel flick), and thankfully the jokes are very good-natured and funny.Speaking of the villain, he's one of the most interesting villains Marvel's put together. He's given interesting reasons behind taking over Wakanda. Michael B. Jordan gives an energetic performance that adds a layer or two more than what you might expect a villain to have. As for Boseman, he aptly provides the heart and soul of the strong but gentle-hearted character. Lupita N'yongo gives a memorable performance as the kind Nakia. Movie fans and ""Lord of the Rings""/""Hobbit"" fans, may be excited to see Martin Freeman (reprising from ""Civil War"") and Serkis together again in an interesting scene. There are a lot of characters to keep up with, however. This makes veteran actors such as Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker have less screentime than people might have hoped for.Ludwig Gorannson's score cleverly mixes African beats with some orchestral pieces. The production design and costume design carry bits and pieces of originality and uniqueness. The visual effects, like most superhero movies, are impressive, but sometimes over-the-top. The action sequences are exciting, but the camera work is a bit shaky in places.As for the usual Marvel elements, Stan Lee's cameo doesn't disappoint. And the second post-credits scene is worth waiting for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie but completely overrated,"Although this is a really good movie, it has amazing costumes, they really got the essence of a African cultures, the cast, in general, did a good job, it still had some problems, including, special effects, character development, wasting such an actor as forest Whitaker and a really common narrative superheroe story. In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Confused by the hate,"I'd heard this movie was good and finally got around to watching it. When it was done I looked on IMDB and saw hundreds of 1 and 2 star reviews that I can only fathom were written by people who would hate anything with an almost entirely black cast that focused on a fictional or real African culture, or dislike seeing empowered women characters. Was it my favorite in the MCU? No. Are there people who give it 10 stars just because of the all black cast? Maybe. But 1 Star? Please. That's just Alt-Right spamming. It's a good contribution to the overarching MCU storyline. Worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The amount of ABSURD negative reviews is telling.,"First for all the people comparing the plot to the other empty MCU plots... did you not watch the film........Michael B Jordan's character itself could have been made into a feature film. Really really think of the trauma he went through living in the poor streets of Oakland while his first cousins, aunts and uncles thrived in a country that's supposedly one of the worst places on earth. While he lives in a country that constantly rejects him. (Even in these reviews lol) Really really take yourself out your shoes and put them in his. I know for SOME this may be very hard.To say you didn't like this film because the plot lacked is nothing but pandering and hiding behind of a veil of ignorance. It's so ironic that this movie with so much grandeur and life is getting bashed by close minded Americans. It's truly telling. If you like superhero movies and diversity doesn't shrink your existence you will bare minimum get a kick out of it. Thanks for reading.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sadly Over-hyped,"Black Panther has got people throbbing, some saying it gave rise to Africa in the MCU. Critic's seem to all love it... reviews have been rave, even before the movie actually opened in Theaters.I found it funny, touching, strong as well as weak at some points... I do have to say that it has been over-hyped. It's not as good as Age of Ultron, and many of MCU releases. It didn't have a true villain we grew hatred for, Killmonger was just some angry kid to be honest.The women, do pick it up though, I'd hang a few but all of them did this movie good. Their roles infused well with the plot, and none of them disappointed me.To be honest with everyone else, I'd pretty much say that (as a black person) we loved Black Panther for it's cast and setting... Culturally - Black Panther is one of the greatest film's ever made, but Critically - It doesn't really deserve the universal acclaim. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
RIP Mr. Boseman,"The King has now rested. Don't know how I will relay this news to my kids. Especially my daughter, she loved Black Panther so much. Great talented cast. On a comic book level, this movie was very worthy. That's what we wanted especially when it comes to Marvel. Chadwick Boseman will always be King T'Challa. Will be hard to replace him.

Doesn't quite reign king,"Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more.My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant.Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception).'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clich√©d, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept.There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well.Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy.Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Long Live the King,"Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther.Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better.Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain.Black Panther gets an A.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An average and typical Marvel film,"97% Rotten Tomatoes. Really? Critics have gone mad or been paid a descent amount of money.It has no special story, and the plot is totally predictable. Colors and visuals are the only gorgeous parts of this film. I felt cheated after how amazingly Black Panther was shown in Civil War.It has been released in 3D but there are merely a few shots that felt good in 3D.Overall acting is okay; no actor leaves their mark on your mind.

Great addition to the MCU.,"A great addition to the MCU. Great acting, beautiful visuals and some intense action. First impressive thing I noticed was its rich attention to detail in world building and its characters. My only criticism, I would have like to have seen more of the Killmonger character, as I feel they didn't go far enough with him. Over-all, this is a fun and enjoyable movie with action, comedy, drama. There are some complex social political overtones mixed in, but it never feels heavy handed, and I feel that the over-all message is positive for humanity as a whole. If this type of movie isn't your cup of tea, fair enough, but if you are on the fence about watching due to pre-conceived notions about its content and message, I would recommend you give it a try, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I like Black Panther, but I didn't like this movie.","I really had high expectations going in, maybe too high, but at some point I thought the Black Panther was in the Fast and the Furious and then some typical heist movie.

I liked it at first.,I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies.

"Meh, highly overrated - not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie","The cinematography of this film was just OK with some obvious bad CGI, and one would come to expect something better from a Marvel superhero film (as shown by the budget). The directing was fairly decent.The story was ok, but nothing overly exciting. Way too much spotlight on the Black Panther conflict here. I feel the story would have been better told had there been another villain.The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie. It's only a 6/10 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely worth the watch!,"Masterful job by Ryan Coogler and cinematographer Rachel Morrison as well as the entire cast. People complaining of politics in this film are suffering from delusions of their own making. Its a movie about a fictional king in a fictional country. True Marvel fans will know that you can't tell the story of BP without the origins and practices of Wakanda. Anyway, Michael B. Jordan (No relation) plays the realest villain since Magneto. (Another character whose anger comes from a real place) Enjoyed Jordan in Creed and liked the character. Which made it hard to accept him as a bad guy. However he quickly made me change my mind as the menacing Killmonger. 
In short see the movie for what it is, another Marvel hit, this time with a different spin that will bring a new base of fans to the Marvel dynasty.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great visuals, story delivers no surprises","Well, i got to hand it to Marvel, though not always delivering great films, they manage to always stay on the right side of mediocre. I love the quality of their films, they more or less always look great, and in their films we constantly see great performances and witness memorable moments. But some of their films have stories and plots that can become somewhat predictable and washed down.This is unfortunately the case with Black Panther, it is a really gorgeous film, and it has some good performances, but nothing like we saw in for example Thor Ragnarok, where Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum delivered really memorable performances and are great villains, or Kurt Russel in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2. This movie lacks a memorable villain like these.But it's not Jordan's fault, he plays the part really well, and might be the one that delivers the best performance in the entire film. But the character he plays simply isn't all that interesting or deep, and combined with a plot that is quite predictable, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect will happen, does indeed happen.But of course, the movie has it's moments, there are many scenes that are hands down great. And some action sequences are really well orchestrated, for example a long one shot action scene inside a casino, which was quite good. And there are plenty of short scenes that brings the giggles and puts a small break in the action scenes.The strongest part of the film is the visuals, it's quite obvious this movie cost a lot of money, though DC managed to spend 300.000.000$ on Justice League, and that movie looks horrible. Maybe Marvel just know how to spend their money more efficiently. But i wished they could have come up with a better story for Wakanda, though they did manage to establish the soul of T'Challa, we now know him, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, which is exactly why i recommend you to see this film.Though not by any means a perfect movie, far from it, it's still a worthy entry into the marvel universe, but don't expect any surprises, this is a straight forward film, but it's an important stepping stone before the majestic Infinity War enters theaters in about 2 months, which is not only the most expensive film ever made, but also the movie with most A list stars ever made. And it's nice to know all the character's that will face Thanos.TL;DR - Great visuals, weak story, predictable plot, not very exiting villain.6/10 - Fair",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

T'Challa! T'Challa! T'Challa,"First of all, I'm glad that great ratings are continuing to climb on this film despite the phony low reviews that have been given here. My experience after watching it twice and also planning watching a third time, believe the hype.Ryan Coogler does an excellent job and the actors are incredible. He knows who his strong actors are and they deliver 110%. He made Michael B. Jordan's role as Killmonger so complex that you didn't know whether to dislike him or be on his side despite how menacing he was. I cannot wait to see him in Creed 2 so I can be reminded it that he really is a good person lol!This movie doesn't really show heavy action for Black Panther (you get that intro in Civil War) but it introduces you more to how he operates as the new king, and the choices he will have to make. However, leaves you satisfied just the same.Ludwig Gorranson who does an excellent job with the music score, is no stranger when it comes to working with Ryan, as he has worked with him in Fruitvale Station and Creed. The music score is a character within itself, as they literally speak for Black Panther/T'Challa and Killmonger during their quiet moments. The research and tours with these excellent musicians during his visits to so many countries in Africa really showed, and I understand why Coogler likes working with him.I do hope people do not fall for these bad reviews which are obviously there to try to scare people away. My parents are not even into comics and they enjoyed every second. For a lengthy movie, it didn't even feel like you were there that long. Go see the movie for yourselves.

An evolving Black Panther review,"This is my first public movie review. So I will keep it 100 percent positive i.e. all things good. I want to start with positivity. It was a good movie. Solid 7/10.Chadwick Boseman, playing the protagonist King T'Challa/Black Panther, has nailed the parts of ""a good man"", ""king"" and ""warrior"". The Kingship, channeled through his acting, peaked in the scene where he raises his voice in front of the preceding black panthers (in 2nd limbo/dream/ other world sequence) to make a point, his point, a point to bring change, a point that challenges the orthodox thoughts of the preceding Kings/Black Panthers. That is the sequence when the audience learns that the King has arrived(BAM!!).
Killmonger, the antagonist , has also been acted very well. Michael B. Jordan, as Killmonger, brought a mean/maniacal/destroyer look to him, which was enhanced by the upper body scars created by the makeup department, each scar stood for a kill. (There may be a technical term for the scars, Please comment if you know). Martin Freeman's character could have been more explored, because to me his look was too similar to BBC Sherlock's Dr. Watson. I was getting confused as to why or what Dr. Watson was doing in Wakanda? (Watson-Wakanda, maybe there is some connection.)There were multiple story arcs that were pondered upon in the film. The rise of a king, the revenge of an outcast (outcasted without his fault), a general's loyalty towards throne or the man sitting on the throne, a son dealing with demons created by his father and many more. On a personal note, I think the arc of Killmonger could have easily been taken to some other direction. His character has got such enriched background and history that so much more could have been done with his character.The visual effects were superb. Scenes such as the entrance to Wakanda, the dreamland/limbo sequence, the Black panther cave, the Vibranium structured city stood out amongst many others.Another uplifting thing about the movie was the comedy. The comedy that erupted between King brother and prodigy-scientist sister and between Dr.watson and Man-ape/M'Baku were the ones that stood out for me. I could narrate some of them in fresh fashion but I do not want to spoil the joke! So just watch it yourself.Costume design in the movie is another area that must be applauded. The Black Panther's costume is like Deadpool's costume. There is nothing fake about it. You don't need to CGI it. You can put a jacked dude in that costume and you've got yourselves a Black panther, looking person. It just feels real. The vibrant costumes worn by all the cast such as Queen mother and different tribes and people of Wakanda had a fresh feel to it. The costume design was as unique as Wakanda is supposed to be.Overall a good movie. Worth a watch in a theatre.SUMMARY- A ""good MAN"" must become flexible in his/her ways if duties of ""a king"" are to be performed aptly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over.

Worth the hype!,"I have to say, after all the hoopla (which I was growing tired of), Black Panther ranks for me as one of the best action movies of all time, 2nd only to Return of the Jedi (don't judge me), and even one of the best dramas.

I believe some used to the typical super hero flick of Today, simply want pulse-pounding action every minute, with a few wise-cracks thrown in, and maybe half-decent lines delivered. This is different, and that old formula is so tired and played at this point in the MCU. This story, the special effects, the intrigue, and the action were all superb. However, what was truly phenomenal was the acting by such a massive cast. This just doesn't happen in action, let alone super hero flicks, even today. Those who refuse to see it for the racial reason or know people like that.

Overhyped but entertaining.,"Well, here's a movie that's hated by a number of people as a result of it being overhyped. It was fairly entertaining and decent. Just that it wasn't worth all the hype. The only thing it has to be a unique MCU film would be that it had was the majority of people from black community as its cast members. I am not criticizing that, but that's NOT a legit reason to hype it up so much.Good.
It was whatever the first Thor movie couldn't be. In other words, it was ""Thor"" (2011) on Wakanda and better. It has some fantasy elements regarding the ""Black Panther formula"" and at the same time, it is quite of a sci fi too, and on the sideline it's also a crime film. These themes hold together very cohesively and make the movie a solid piece of art, on the whole. For the first time in an MCU movie, a villain was good. Killmonger is probably my second favorite MCU villain till date, the first one being Thanos. That character was well written to say the least. We knew where he was coming from, his motives, what he is up to and why. He is the best part of this movie. Many of the heist and crime film vibes it had was very interesting in the scenario they set up for this movie. The character interactions and the dynamic between various characters were good. Some funny scenes and dialogues land properly (while some don't, it's an MCU movie, after all). While watching this film, you won't want to skip any part of it, even though, in the end, you might be saying, ""is that it?! Dafuq?!!"" But most importantly, it gives you a really good introduction to Black Panther. We can get behind this hero for good. The character arc they give to him is excellent.Mixed.
A lot of it feels like parts of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The ""sci fi"" part feels quite like the stuff going on between Batman and Fox. The establishment of the character of Killmonger was (in an undertone) similar to how we got introduced to The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" or to Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Also, some scenes are quite similar to interrogation scenes of ""The Dark Knight"". I am not saying that it was a ripoff of Nolan's films. It might be the same in the source material they adapted, I don't know. But noticing those themes being dealt in a similar way, makes it kind of a mixed bag. The movie, also, apparently ""kills"" off a character, which doesn't feel so compelling because they were to be back in future films (which had already been announced or were seen in the trailer of Infinity War). Not saying that the way they killed off the character was bad. If we didn't know about him being back in Infinity War, it would've made a solid impact. But, we know about him being back. So, it wasn't much interesting.Bad.
Many fights and scenes in the film are super clich√©d. Not only that you can predict what will happen, you can even predict what kind of a dialogue will close that scene, and what will be the immediate consequence for the character who gave that piece of dialogue. The third act of the movie was just plain generic third act of a superhero movie with a lot of clich√©s and dumbed down ""Captain America: Civil War"" conditions with some of kind of ""Lord of the Rings"" vibe.Conclusion.
""Black Panther"", for me, was some kind of a mixed bag. It was surely overhyped, but wasn't so bad of an overhyped movie. On the whole, a solid entertainer. Not something like Infinity War or Iron Man or Avengers or Civil War that will be talked for a long time.Rating.

Much gratitude toward this movie!,"I am an avid fan of sci fi and action movies. Lately (for years now), I have gone to the theaters feeling empty after watching these newer films - they leave me wanting more and better - more action, better story line, better acting, better character development. However, after watching Black Panther, I think I have a little hope for movies restored in me. Without going into it, the story line was easy to follow, easy enough for kids and complex enough for adults to ponder as well. The acting from every single cast member was great, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, and Danai Guirira stole the damn show. Danai Gurira's character (Okoye), I think stole the fight scenes, and I wasn't mad about it. The fight scenes were great, really took me back to the glory days of movies (without too much CGI). You definitely get character growth and development in this movie. Kudos to the director and cast for putting 100% authenticity into this movie. I have watched this movie 3x and cannot wait until I get it on DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disregard most of these reviews,Opinions are obviously subjective but just taking a quick glance at these reviews.....my goodness they wreak of a people with a severe inferiority complex. This movie at the very least is on par with any and other Marvel movie and deserve reviews as such. My you trolls are hungry today.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Plenty to Like, Plenty to Dislike","Like most movies, there are plenty of things to like about Black Panther, and plenty of things to dislike.LIKE:
1. It's Marvel. Even a middling MCU venture is still worth the price of admission.
2. It looks sensational. Everything just looked really, really cool. The city, the technology, the natural splendor, the costumes, etc. Very, very cool.
3. It's something different. Basing a movie and a superhero franchise in Africa is refreshingly different.
4. Little sister. The ""Q"" of Black Panther. Tough not to love her.
5. Angela Basset is as lovely as ever. Lead actor was terrific.
6. Pretty good plot twist.DISLIKE:
1. I fear this whole superhero genre is starting to reach the end of its tether. All of the story elements are just starting to feel a little stale.
2. Although very good, Black Panther is nowhere near as good as X-Men, Avengers, Ragnarok, Spider-Man, and almost any other MCU production.
3. It seemed like it was pretty difficult to break away from the tentacles of The Lion King. It was really tough not to be thinking about it though the movie.
4. The racial elements seemed a little heavy-handed and clumsy.
5. I think I'm getting Forrest Whitaker fatigue.
6. These superhero flicks really need to reevaluate what a climactic fight scene is supposed to be. I was getting bored out of my mind during the last twenty minutes.
7. The opening weekend hype was pretty ridiculous.Overall though, another trophy on Marvel's overflowing, jam-packed shelf. Go see it, if and when you have the time. Just bear in mind it's nowhere as good as the public was led to believe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
WHY ALL THE HATE? BLACK PANTHER IS A COMIC BOOK!,"I don't understand the low ratings and the snide remarks that some of the reviews are making about the actors in the movie, Black Panther. It's a comic book with real actors portraying comic characters! Why are there remarks regarding how unrealistic it is and how illogical some things are, it's a comic book! Nobody gets upset about Iron Man and the highly-advanced weapons and high-technological weapons that he uses, it's the same thing with Black Panther. Could it be because 95% of the actors in the movie are Black? Come on people, get over it! Not everyone in America (or Africa for that matter) is white! I enjoyed the movie and took it for what it is, a comic book!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
WAKANDA FOREVER !!!!!!!!!!!!,"This film is amazing watched in imax 3d. I watch most comic book movies this way for the last ten years,black panther is on another level for a standalone film the action affects story pacing brilliant never bored once. I wanted to watch it straight away again the only better marvel movie is the original avengers and logan but that isn't really marvel. Trust me don't listen to all the haters and watch this film I'm going to watch it again and I haven't done that with a film since the matrix enough said long live the KING.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
We watched it at home...no interruptions...I fell asleep after the second major fight,"Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Shocked by the bad reviews.,"I can't help but think some reddit anti-sjw people with too much time in their parents basement all got together and decided to flood IMDb with negative reviews. SOMETHING about this movie bothered them. I CANT IMAGINE WHAT THAT MIGHT BE.Look, all that aside, it's a solid marvel movie. If you enjoy the MCU you will like it, and honestly, you already saw it. If you hate super hero movies, no, you won't like it (duh).If you like some and not others, this one tries harder with a plot, has some witty banter, and yes, some different scenery from a bunch of white dudes in New York. And honestly, it's nice. Refreshingly different while still being a movie about powerful people punching each other. And it has two of the best villains so far because they are kind of right... but take it too far. It's better than I'm evil because I'm adopted (lookin at you Loki).And if you don't hate it, come on here and review it. Mark the review you find accurate as ""helpful"" because it's ridiculous that the neckbeards are winning.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overhyped but far from bad,"This has been touted as a fantastic film by numerous critics, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. That is not to say it is bad, because there are many things that it does right. The soundtrack is easily the most interesting of any film in the MCU, as it uses a combination of typical superhero/action movie score, African tribal music, and modern hip-hop that blends very well together. Also, the acting and characters are done very well, with three standout performances. Lupita N'yongo is great, Andy Serkis is exuberant, and Michael B. Jordan portrays one of the most interesting villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and he provides a great foil with a potent motivation that is presented as pretty obvious social commentary. But even though it is on-the-nose, I did appreciate that the film actually attempted to get political. However, it is not without flaws. The first half drags a bit with a mix of dialogue-heavy scenes and generic action scenes. In fact, the action scenes throughout the film, save for the car chase and a fight between Kilmonger and Black Panther, are very bland. The filmmakers tried to recreate the same style of action that worked so well in The Winter Soldier, but they fell flat with some poor lighting, lack of grit, and CGI overload (particularly at the end). Overall, the movie is presented in a very generic way, with many of the same beats you would expect from every other superhero movie in the cinematography and editing. Despite these issues, I thought the positives outweighed the flaws and that the movie was an entertaining experience. I'd give it a strong 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dull,"I don't have a comic book background (well I did sixty years ago), so I go into these films without predispositions. This was highly touted because of the title black superhero. And so I embraced it because I like it when barriers are broken. The problem was that the thing was convoluted and endless. I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not the best ones of the Marvel package.... ! boring.,"'Black Panther' is a popcorn movie nothing more nothing less. Although It trys to grasp at the idea of western colonialism and racism, it only scratches the surface never really deciding were it stands. Although this has been championed as one of they greatest diverse films it is not and I would recommend you to check out '12 years a Slave' , 'Get Out' or 'Moonlight' who do a much better job than this meager attempt. The plot is by the numbers the direction is nothing special. Chadwick Boseman's acting is rather stilted and you can never attach to his character. Michael B Jordan is a one note villian who also struggles, phoning in a performance spouting monologues about messages that never really click. But where the movie really falls on its face is the third act which is cgi heavy and looks like its out of a video game. Black Panther by no means is terrible its below average and the concept of Wakanda is an excellent and well excuted idea. But this movie just needs to go that little bit deeper and seprate itself from the tired superhero formula.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One step in MCU's master plan and a mile for the Hollywood movie industry,"I'm from Asia and I don't understand the discrimination and racial crisis of Blacks and Whites in US. So I went to see the movie expecting it to be another good movie from MCU ( you have to admit they do have a good track record). And what I got instead was pure gold. 
I have never seen Africa and African culture depicted in such a beautiful way in a live action movie. Hollywood movies always paint Africa in colors that matches its name under British colonization, ""The Dark Continent"". We see movies of slave trade, blood soaked diamond industry, starvation and poverty. I've always wondered this can't be all that Africa has to offer. Though it is based in a mythical country and superpowers, it gave us a glimmer of what Africa would have looked like if European and middle eastern invaders sucked it dry of it's resources. In black panther we see a world set in Africa with bare minimal of those usual stereotypes about the continent. It is a breath of fresh air.The splash of color was a balm to the eyes and music, well i might need to write another review about how good music in this movie was. The end credits score for the movie was phenomenal.
Every character had his\her moment to shine. And all the actors did their characters justice. Black Panther's little sister Shuri was a delight to watch. Micheal B Jordan as the Killmonger was exceptional and up their with Loki when it comes to Marvel villains.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Boseman's performance was weak, in one scene he is joking with his sister, his delivery of jokes was just terrible.

Solid enough but not t'op drawer.,"The 18th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is another solid entry to the franchise but It's a testament to how far Marvel have pushed the concept of a ""Superhero film"" in the last couple of years that ""Black Panther"", which would have been amazing as little as three years ago, now feels a bit out-dated.Following the death of his father during ""Captain America: Civil War"", T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned its new King. He discovers that agents both within and outside of his homeland believe that the country should be doing more with their advanced science and technology to help the oppressed around the world. At the same time, Wakanda's most wanted, the only man to see hidden treasures and escape its borders, Ulysses Klaue, commits a daring robbery and may finally be vulnerable to capture.It's a beautiful looking film, and feels authentic to the region, even though Wakanda is a fictional land. Its debates about the morality of interference outside its feels like a genuine cause of conflict and Killmonger, excellently played by Michael B Jordan, is a villain whose motivation you believe in, even if the MCU's villain was/is family to the hero trope is again in force.However, I did find myself feeling at times that it was a bit po-faced, especially when compared to last years near comedies of ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" and ""Thor Ragnorok"", though the times when it is funny, usually revolving around Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister - Shuri - usually hit the mark.Another criticism I'd have for the film would be the editing, particularly in the earlier fight scenes. Modern action films are plagued by fight scenes shot too tight on the participants, which creates for a kinetic energy but, to my taste, makes it difficult to determine what's actually happening. Fortunately, for me, this stopped in the later fight scenes. Also, and very unusually for the MCU films, the CGI is occasionally a little subpar, particularly in the climactic battle.Though not breaking into my personal top five films of the MCU, there is much to enjoy with the characters and plenty of story scope for Black Panther 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid origin story,"T'Challa ascends to the throne of Wakanda and takes the mantle of Black Panther.This is an entertaining superhero origin story with a number of solid performances.The plot is reasonably strong with a structure that resembles a mashup of The Lion King, James Bond and traditional Marvel heroism. For me the best aspect of it are the themes that underpin the characters and their motivations. To have a story so explicit about the historical treatment of African peoples and the plight of African communities around the world as a main stream cinematic event is a breath of fresh air.There are numerous strong, positive, non-clich√©d characters. The main protagonist journeys through an arc that leads him to an important decision that impacts the marvel world. The antagonist is complex and fighting a cause worth fighting for, but in the wrong way. Through this it delivers an important message that is very relevant in today's divided world.Within the seriousness there is plenty of humour through dialogue and performances. Shuri has some great moments of witty banter along with Everett Ross and M'Baku.The visuals are for me a mixed bag. I love the cinematography, colours, lighting and editing in many scenes. Whilst the effects are brilliant in some parts I find the CGI action spectacle at times to be cartoonish, distracting and over the top. This for me hurts the film in moments, as the messages get lost in mess of video game type spectacle.On a more positive note, the performances from all cast are excellent. Chadwick Boseman is great, whilst Michael B Jordan is up there with the best of the Marvel antagonists. The supporting cast are great with Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Angela Bassett, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Winston Duke, Daniel Kaluuya and Martin Freeman all perfect in their respective roles.It is a 7.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Expanding the existing universe of the MCU!,"Just came back from the cinema watching black panther in the UK. I have to say, the film was absolutely fantastic! Loved it! I go to Vue/ Odeon cinema in Manchester to watch pretty much all the films that come out and not once have I seen the cinema room so packed before :scream: It's pretty obvious that Black Panther is heavily influenced by the African culture, from the language to the clothing and so on. The message behind the film was well written! Man, after walking out of that cinema I have never felt more pound to be an African! I am defiantly going for a re-watch! Worth the cash!Although I have to agree with some of the reviews, the storyline was a little predictable and generic. However, other than that the acting in the film was phenomenal!

This really has a different vibe than any marvel movie you've ever watched.This more is more sophisticated with a superhero with a net worth of 500 Billion dollars and he's got great costumes that'll make you get goose bumps.

Wakanda,"Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the
superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great warrior 's story,"After the tragic death of Chadwick, had thought about watching his movies and this one comes to my mind. This review is my tribute to Chadwick.This is one of my most favorite films in MCU. This is one of the best films in MCU when it comes to storytelling. The biggest strength of this movie is the characters and their motivations. The outline of the story looks like a throne fight between two brothers but inside it is more than you think.Chadwick stars as the titular character and fits that role perfectly. As a king, he chooses what is best for his people and also the world but he is the same king as previous kings in Wakanda. Everything changes when the killmonger arrives.Both Hero and villain journey are more than interesting. The film respects African people and their culture, history. This is one of the MCU movies with a lot of female characters and justifies them. Black Panther is a triumph of universal appeal and demographic specificity.The film is comparatively light on action, and the pacing occasionally stumbles in the back half, but the sharp character work and rich production design make up for nitpicks here and there. And when the action does arrive, it is brutal and to the point, with a second-act car chase combining real-world action with Wakandian technology that I could watch on a loop for hours on end.The first act is dedicated to setting up the world of Wakanda (an isolated nation shielded from the outside world and powered by otherworldly technology and arguably a What if Africa had never been colonized fantasy) and T'Challa's from prince to king coronation process.After we get a real introduction to our key villain (Michael B. Jordan) that we really get down to business. The movie asks knotty questions about reaching out to help those like you who have been persecuted, even if you yourself have escaped the world's subjugation and thrived by virtue of your invisibility. In a time of great social and political upheaval, the question of how much allies should be expected to sacrifice even if the rot hasn't personally affected them yet may be the defining moral question of our time.The film keeps its righteous anger mostly in the hands of its villain, and it works as a rousing superhero adventure for kids who want to see a black superhero doing the superhero thing. But it is still refreshing to see a Walt Disney superhero movie taking for granted that America is intrinsically detrimental to black lives.Black Panther is a fine stand-alone action drama that deals with the consequences of a modern civilization made possible by widespread colonization.The cinematography also very neat and the visuals were stunning. The ancestral plane sequences were top notch. The first fight between Tchalla and kill monger is well choreographed the end fight is full of CGI. The production design and costumes perfectly suited the African nation. The musical score is one of the biggest elements in this film. Salutes to Ryan coogler for this Marvelous movie.Thanks for giving one of the unforgettable heroic role #RIPCHADWICKBOSEMAH.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Black Panther - weak opening, interesting final","Black Panther is the 18. movie in the MCU and I expected to see a great story after the events in Captain America: Civil War. I am a bit disappointed with the film now and I think that it is one of the worst in the MCU.Firstly, I didn't see the great badass Black Panther from the previous movie - he was powerful, confident and inspiring in Civil War. In this film he was totally different character and I had the feeling that Killmonger entirely deserved his moral victory. Erik was an interesting villain, one of the best in the MCU - Michael B. Jordan did a good job in this film.I would also like to praise Martin Freeman and Daniel Kaluuya for their performance (I give this 7/10 mostly because of these two phenomenal actors).Overall, Black Panther is OK, but it is far behind Thor: Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy (1 and 2) and Iron Man (1) in the MCU.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This may be Marvel's 18th film, but it feels like the studio is just getting started. Brave and brilliant, this superhero movie is like nothing you've ever seen before.","Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.The film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself.It's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.But put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them.Most significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.If that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.Black Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music.Leading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date.Fantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challla's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.It may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner. And yet, fans of the comic books that have inspired Marvel's entire slate of films would say: it's about time. In the way it embraces its story and heritage, in the way its heroes are presented, and in the way its message will inspire and empower generations to come, Black Panther matters. And it cannot - and will not - be ignored.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Black Panther,"RIP Chadwick Boseman - WAKANDA FOREVER!Okay, I LIKE BLACK PANTHER; I've seen it more than a handful of times, but this film is not perfect, by any meaning of the word! The hype around this film, almost gave it an impenetrable force-field for negativity. Coogler and the creative team set themselves up for a lot of clear nitpicks, due to the predictability, extra dose of plot armor, and a decent amount of plot gaps and filler. With Ryan Coogler being one of the best up and coming directors in the game, he didn't really impress me here, but he still kept that Marvel vibe going, while adding in a lot of his own spices, sprinkled throughout the film. He made this more of a stand-alone film, but he tied in some nice, subtle references from the saga. Coogler utilized this huge cultural aspect, that worked well with the film's premise, while not jamming it down your throat, every opportunity they got. The issue with the premise; Yeah, it may have had a few enjoyable moments, and interesting ideas, but it felt exactly like The Lion King, just in a superhero format. The way that Ryan Coogler structured and placed the scenes, just didn't flow right, having a real choppy pace, making it feel like two different films, on some occasions. With just a couple of scene swaps, I feel like this film would've already been that much better. With the pace being one of the couple downfalls of the film, it brought the twist aspect of the film drastically downward, considering it was presented very sloppy and forceful.Sarah Finn had her hands full, again, by casting this wonderful group of talent. All of the characters were really fun, bringing all their A-games to the big screen, but the creative team had a tough time trying to balance everyone. One of the biggest issues of the film, is that the Coogler and Cole did their best to make everyone equally important, but it doesn't carry much weight, because you lose a lot of the value in the main characters, that we should be worried about, so when it comes to a high stakes moment, that feeling gets somewhat diminished. Chadwick Boseman is a fine protagonist, that's easy to root for, due to his backstory, with a great heart and wits, but he can get kind of boring and bland at times. He has more than enough to do, but he doesn't do much at all, until the final act. His character development was very predictable, and fast paced, by the end of the film, it doesn't really feel like we know that much more about him. With how his character is written aside, Boseman puts on a really good performance as T'Chala/Black Panther, fitting the Avengers like a glove. With Letitia Wright as Shuri, having the best chemistry with Boseman, she was one of the most entertaining characters, the film had to offer. Although she was nothing more than a plot device, she was a really nice addition, bringing some fun laughs, and great wit to the film. Danai Gurira was another great addition to the film, bringing this amazing women power feel. She was an excellent compliment to everyone, while serving her purpose well. Danai Gurira may have overcooked her performance just a little bit, but she was one of the best additions to the film. Lupita Nyong'o was the biggest disappointment of the film. Nyong'o is one of the best actresses in the game, but her character was written so poorly, being one of the biggest wasted potential of the film. Her character had a lot to offer, but due to insignificant writing, her character felt unconnected. Forrest Whittaker, Angela Bassett, Winston Duke, and Martin Freeman all had their own things to do, fitting their roles nicely, but they were all used strictly as plot devices. We finally got another taste of Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue, and he stole every scene that he's in! While not having the most screen time, he made the most out of it, serving his purpose really well! Our main antagonist of the film, being one of the best villains on the MCU, is Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan. Every single time he's in frame, he brings this dominant presence, being a real savage and memorable villain. The screenwriters did a great job fleshing out his motive, making it easy to get behind his character, and somewhat understandable why he's doing what he's doing. The only issue I had with his character, I just needed more of him. If they added little sprinkles of him through the long duration of when he wasn't around, it would've made things a lot more tense and exciting.The screenplay by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole did a pretty decent job overall, but there was a few holes that needed some patching up. The way they attacked the emotional aspect of the film, just didn't click right with the premise, feeling pretty weak, and dry. The humor was here and there, but it thankfully wasn't over saturated, because it wouldn't have worked with this film.One of the best things about this film, is the production. Coogler crafted these beautiful scenery shots, with so many bright colors that just pop off the screen at all times. This is one of the prettiest films the MCU has released, on the side of Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Strange.The action was really just okay. They had some fun combat scenes, but the overwhelming amount of CGI, almost completely threw me out of the film. The CGI was just super clunky, with a lot of pieces that looked unfinished. The score and soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson, was really enjoyable. It fit really well with the scheme of the film, enhancing every scene that it is included in.Overall, I do not hate Black Panther, but this film definitely has more than enough flaws to be talked about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fantastic Movie! Definitely a must watch! WAKANDA FOREVER!!,"Black Panther is definitely a great movie and a must watch for superhero fans as well as marvel fans. I don't understand all the negative reviews, its obvious some are just DC fans hating on the movie and some people are just nitpicking very small things, but of course the movie does have flaws. I am a big Marvel fan and a very big fan of the MCU, when I go to see movies in theaters I normally have high expectations as many people do, with Black Panther I did as well. What makes a movie good is different between every single person though i have very high expectations as long as the movie has a good plot, great fight scenes and characters I will be impressed whether i have high expectations or not.Black Panther had a good plot, it does not bore you and keeps you interested but it isn't unique it can be predictable and a bit cliche but throughout the movie i was very interested and wanted to carry on watching . The whole idea of ""Wakanda"" is great and is different from normal superhero movies.Characters are very great in this movie, Chadwick Boseman's character T'Chala was great through out the whole movie, he showed that he wanted to be king and had great chemistry between other characters. Considering T'Chala was introduced in Civil War he's character was developed but through Black Panther he's character develops slowly. Chadwick Boseman once again was excellent playing the character. The Villain Erik Kill-Monger was really good he was intimidating and he's ambitions were clear, although it was slightly cliche he was fantastic! Michael B Jordan did an amazing job and acting was good throughout. I don't want to make this too long but characters had good chemistry between each others and are very likable.To summarize this movie the plot was good,characters were fantastic because they had a good casting choice as well as brilliant chemistry among each other, fight scenes were bad ass and make you love the character BP even more.the jokes throughout this movie are not overused and not forced its just the good old marvel humor as well as the script was well written. Of course this movie did have it flaws the final fight scene between the protagonist and antagonist was disappointing and heavy CGI was used and it was obvious the characters were full CGI and the fight could have been much better. (also forgot to mention CGI was great in the movie at times it wasn't the best but shouldn't bother you) there was probably a few plot holes and predictable at times but didn't bother me too much.Overall the movie was fantastic and you should watch it, of course there are flaws but to me it did not bother me and i was entertained throughout, as I said before we all look differently to movies I said I have high expectations and the movies flaws did not make the movie bad for me but that's usually for most movies. Go watch this movie, lives up to the hype and you will love the character BP more!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I liked this one, but..","I loved a country of Wakanda, the culture, world, scenery and people. I think it was well played, CGIs were very good and story but, I have to be critical about some things. -2 stars because of clique and predictability. If I haven't seen almost all Marvel movies I would give it more stars but they are going on every new hero with one script and they are repeating it over and over again. I know exactly what and when it will happen. -1 star for progressive propaganda and hypocrisy. Example: if Ross tell something about skin color in the move but he didn't meant to insult somebody it would be racist. When Shuri tell Ross ""Colonizer"" and she meant as insult, it is ok and no racist. When I saw that I was like ""Are you kidding me?""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inwardly focused SuperHero film mostly works,"THE BLACK PANTHER is the first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that relies - predominantly - on characters (and actors) of color to carry it. Of the main characters, only 2 are Caucasian, the rest of the cast (including almost all of the supporting cast and the extras) - AND the Director are people of color. This has, rightfully so, created a ""buzz"" about the significance of this. It is a watershed moment for SuperHero films (much like last year's WONDER WOMAN was a watershed for a female led SuperHero film). But the question remains - is it a good film?The answer: Good Enough.Diving deeper into the character/hero T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) who was first introduced in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film, we learn more about the backstory of this man/character as well as the world in which he lives and the burdens he bears. It also, interestingly enough, pretty much ignores the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for much of it's 2 hour 14 minute timeline. It mostly concerns itself with interior issues in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda and I think this tactic is a welcome relief from the giant, CGI-laden, characters-heavy Marvel films of recent memory.Director/Writer Ryan Coogler (CREED/FRUITVALE STATION) decides to focus the attention of this film inward, rather than outward and we are rewarded with a rich, Shakespearean family drama that works because of it's simplicity.Much of the effectiveness is due to the charismatic cast that has been drawn to this picture because of the significance of it as well as the richness of the characters they inhabit. Bozeman is regal and strong in the title role - no hint of the suffering, ""I don't want this"" SuperHero angst so often seen in these types of film. Academy Award winner Lupito Nyong'o joins in just as strong and independently as Nakia a ""Spy"" and erstwhile romantic foil for T'Challa - though Coogler is wise to avoid the ""will they/won't they"" cliche as well as eliminates, entirely, the ""damsel in distress"" subplot that would have been so tempting.Helping these two out are a veritable ""who's who"" of actors of color - Angela Bassett, Forrest Whitaker, current Best Actor nominee Daniel Kaluuya and Sterling K. Brown - all turn out for fun (albeit brief) turns where each one of them gets a chance to show what they can do. Special notice should be made to Danai Gurira (TV's kick-ass Michonne in THE WALKING DEAD) as Okoye - T'Challa's chief general and bodyguard who must choose duty over honor (or does she) and, especially, Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger, wise-cracking sister - who also happens to be the ""Q"" of this film. She jumped off the screen and shone brightly (but not so bright as to wash things out) in every scene she was in.And...of course...there is Coogler favorite Michael B. Jordan (he's been in all of Coogler's major motion picture) as the villain of the piece - Erik Killmonger (the name says it all). Jordan does a nice job of bringing 3 dimensions to a character that was written a little too 2 dimension-ally, if you ask me. This character could have just been an ""angry young man"" cliche, but with Jordan, he becomes something much, much more.This being a Marvel SuperHero film, the Special Effects are terrific, showing a highly secretive, highly technolized Wakanda that is hidden beneath the surface.Is it a perfect film? Well...no. This is, in essence, a ""family drama"" with some hi-tech action scenes and the obligatory ""two armies fighting"" finale, and while the acting is good enough to hold interest throughout, I would have liked to have seen a little more action thrown in.But...ignoring the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a good move - as was casting such strong, believable and likeable film actors.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good,"A definitely more diverse approach to the superheroes universe of Marvel. I welcomed this like a breeze of fresh air, and not only because of the aforementioned diversity of the characters but because of the quality of the movie as such. After being misrepresented lately by dull and ridiculous movies like the last installments of Captain America and Thor, the famous entertainment company can now promote Black Panther as a good sign of recovery.Well acted, fun, humorous and passionate movie. This time Marvel allocates the epic and eternal battle of good and evil in the African continent, having its people as the protagonists of the story. Combining science fiction and fantasy, the decently written script leads the spectators through a well passed course of actions, supported with outstanding visual effects and a colorful and imaginative depiction of a richly recreated African universe.A most welcome addition to a cinematic universe in need of fresh renovation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ruined by Politics,"Had to make the movie ""political"", which ruined it for me, along with too much bad CGI. Poor acting, boring story. Movie way overrated! One of the worst Marvel movies ever.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ehh,"Black Panther is the story of a king with super powers whose throne gets questioned by someone who sees themselves as the rightful heir to the throne. Chadwick Boseman plays T'Challa in this film who is the King of wakanda, an African Country that is hidden by technology. Michael B. Jordan plays a kid a kid from California, Erik Killmonger, who believes that he has been cheated from the throne and decides that he will challenge T'Challa for it. These characters both want to prove they are not possers of the power and are not pushovers.
This movie was fairly entertaining, it had very good visual effects and fun action scenes. The movie just didn't hit that big not for me that it seemed to by everyone else. I had fun watching the film but I didn't think that it was great in anysense if the matter. The story seemed like a very played out of a man who thinks he should be king so he fights the king for it, just with superpowers. It was fun but again just not the best superhero film of the year or the past couple of years.
This movie came out early last year following the huge buzz that was Captain America: Civil War, where the Black Panther was introduced. The movie didn't need to be another origin story and it wasn't so I give props to the filmmakers for that part of it. I just do not see how this movie got nominated for an oscar, all of the performances were fine, the dialogue was fine and the story was fine.
All aspects of this film were done great, I believe with the script that the movie had it did the best it could on every level. The editing and sound were put together well to create seamless scenes and fights. All of the dialogue seemed real, for the most part. Not that the lines weren't written well, but the film takes place in an African Country and have been in that country forever, advancing far past the world, and staying hidden, but they all speak english. This is something that bothers me in a lot of movies, it might be very convenient but why don't they speak some African language, they have accents. Even the tribe that lives up into the mountains who seem to be a little primitive, when looking at how far they have advanced looking at how the other tribes have, they speak english as well throughout the film. Other than that though technically this film is very well done.
Going through and watching this film There was a scene that I really enjoyed, the scene in which Erik challenges T'Challa for his throne. The scene takes place in the throne room, Erik is taken into the the room where he is being prosecuted. Only to find out that his has rights to be the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther. The camera use in this scene is very minimal, just cuts to who is talking going back and forth. It is a very common technique used to just show what everyone's thinking and feeling and that was probably the best way to go with this scene as what was happening was shocking a lot of people so all of their emotions. There is nothing notable about the lighting, the scene is in a room with a big window during the day so you can see everyone's face well. What I like about this scene is something that has been done a million times over is the build up with music until you find out what Erik was hiddining from them when he revealed his blood right and that he wanted to be the king. Just a simple build up in music before that delivery was done well. The pacing in this scene was fun to watch everything seemed fine and going a nice pace, then once they start to exchange information back and forth the camera cuts begin to speed up. From this scene which has no action you can see that on a technical aspect there are zero problems with this film. Another problem this film didn't have was acting, there was an all star cast. Everyone does really well to make their character believable and give true emotions for what is happening and what might happen for them in the future.
I have only seen this film three times, in the theaters, once when I caught it on tv and when I just rewatched it this week to give a review, I do not have that big of a problem with the film, I am not a big fan of it though, as I have said I think that there are better superhero films, even better redemption films, which is a big element of this movie.
With all of these different grips with the movie i do not want to give the impression that I hate this movie, just a tad bit overrated. I enjoyed it for the most part and if you like the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than you would probably enjoy this film as well. If i was tot give this a film a rating from one to ten I would say 6/10. It was good on a technical scale but it was an overused story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

i admit that this movie is a good addition action flick to another marvel films that ever created until now, but i'm just expecting something more as a marvel fan, cause of the trailer that they always drop before the movie.
There are some weaknesses, such as a rather slow start, and some battle scenes that are somewhat forced timings .
there is a scene where t'challa is inaugurated as king and a black panther that should have an extraordinary scene but it looks rather dull and boring like nothing just happened.
nevertheless, the movie has some great moments and cool scenes even if it does not make an impression on my memory.
by the way, andy serkis gives a great performance here, he deserves more attention and I respect himIn conclusion, if you're a marvel lover, you might like this because infinity war is coming and everyone is waiting for it, and this movie is just a great addition to the other marvel action flick.

I will be sad if this does not win Oscars. Shape of water was nice but not that nice in comparison to this movie. 
Mother's role was very motherly, is it not awesome?
I would have given it 11 stars if there was a choice.
I was not going to watch this movie and just by chance I saw the trailer on IMDB and I told my daughter this is worth it. Here she booked the ticket and sent me and my wife to the theater. I think those who are giving lesser stars are jealous that this movie is better than the movies they liked.

"Exciting, fresh and everything I hoped it would be - one of Marvel's best yet.","TL;DRStunning aestheticsCommitment to African culture and Afrofuturism is wonderful with terrific resultsA very colourful filmA refreshingly different feel for a superhero filmExciting, fast-paced and varied actionAs much comedy as you'd hope from a Marvel movieGreat performances with a strong supporting cast and one of Marvel's most compelling villainsBlack Panther is a special film in a number of ways. Not only is it the 18th Marvel film and the last one before the big third outing for the Avengers, but it's big for black culture and Afrofuturism, being the first big blockbuster superhero film featuring a black lead and, more importantly, a nearly all black cast (and crew). It's a step in the right direction for an increasingly out-dated and politically incorrect Hollywood, with arrogant 'white males' quivering in their seats. More than this, Black Panther is an incredible movie, more than a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The aesthetics are inspiring, every inch of Wakanda utterly African, each scene evoking a strong and exemplary sense of Afrofuturism. Black Panther is absolutely committed to the African cultures it portrays and the effect is not only different, but visually stunning and incredibly colourful. More importantly, it never feels forced, gimmicky or frequently mentioned, constantly reminding people how PC they are. Instead the blend of African cultures embodied in Wakanda feels natural and organic and its detail is wonderful at every level.In fact the aesthetics throughout the whole film are gorgeous. CGI, as expected in a film of this calibre, is second-to-none, but the cinematography alongside really captures the beauty of Wakanda, the wonders of a fictional technologically-advanced African country brought to life. Wakanda, stunning as it is, also feels fresh; Black Panther isn't just another superhero film with the titular character fighting their way across New York City. This freshness stretches throughout the whole movie, making it seem like a new kind of superhero film and putting to rest any doubts that Marvel's films could become stale or repetitive.It is a Marvel film though so there are some aspects that we come to expect; some that are welcome and some that are happily missing in this movie. One is the comedy, which is abundant throughout Black Panther. With plenty of laughs from beginning to end - coming from M'Baku (Winston Duke) and Shuri in particular - it helps in allowing Black Panther to fit effortlessly into the broader personality of the MCU. Origin stories are also expected in superhero films, but here that is forgone, something that adds to its strength. It never gets bogged down in origins or unnecessary details explaining comic book lore; instead, like with Spider-Man: Homecoming, it just gets going and tells us what we need to know as it goes, letting exposition fit neatly into the film and never letting it slow down the pace. Superhero action too is worthy of praise as it is some of the best we've seen yet. With multiple films of this genre coming out every year, it's understandably becoming difficult to impress an audience. However Black Panther has a slightly more fresh approach to its action; not too deep-rooted in unrealistic sci-fi/fantasy, the action is fast-paced, fun to watch and brilliantly choreographed with varied action. This latter point is largely down to Black Panther being almost an ensemble film. While the focus of the story and a lot of the action is on T'Challa, he's not the sole interest of the film. Instead we often see him fighting alongside Nakia, Okoye and even sometimes Shuri. Each with different personalities as well as fighting styles, this lends a varied approach to the fight scenes and make them so much more interesting to watch. Yet the highlight is still the titular Black Panther, with expert martial arts and gymnastics blending together to be an absolute joy.The joy doesn't stop with the action though. The quiet times are sometimes just as much fun, with the cast clearly having a blast. Chadwick Boseman builds on his debut in Captain America: Civil War, still retaining the characterisation from that film, but expanding it and making us love this character even more. Wise, strong and determined, he makes a fine King for Wadanda; but funny, sweet and loyal, he makes a fine superhero for the MCU. Boseman excels at bringing out all sides of T'Challa and we can't wait to see more of him in later this year with the rest of the MCU by his side. By his side this time though are a fine group of characters who could maybe even give the Avengers a run for their money. Okoye has a harsh-edge to her and watching her fight is incredible, yet Danai Gurira gives us a soft edge that she only reveals occasionally, making her enigmatic character more appealing. Letitia Wright and Lupita Nyong'o too bring so much personality to the film, often stealing scenes from the titular hero himself. Michael B. Jordan makes a worthy antagonist, actually being one of Marvel's best villains yet. Since their history of villains hasn't been great to date, you could assume that that isn't too high an accolade, but despite that he is a sympathetic villain with a likeable, funny side - the sort of villainy that made us all love Loki - supported by fellow bad guy, Andy Serkis returning as Klaue. Though not appearing much, he certainly makes his mark and lives up to the character's reputation. Martin Freeman's return as Ross is also very welcome and never a gimmicky, unnecessary reference to the wider MCU; instead he is allowed to develop a part that was too small in Civil War. This time he fits in organically and his American accent is as impressive as Andy Serkis' South African.It's safe to say that all the hype for Black Panther was worth it because it really is everything we wanted it to be. With exciting and varied non-stop action, plenty of comedy and an excellent ensemble of characters it fits into the rest of the Marvel cannon seamlessly. And while this one forgoes the sometimes unnecessary origin story, dives into a great plot and actually gives us an enjoyable villain, the best thing that stands out about Black Panther is how fresh it feels and looks and how committed it is to the inclusion of African culture and inclusivity. Yet again Marvel have delivered another outstanding film that instantly soars towards the top of the list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Wakanda For Now,"Now, I'm just gonna lay it out there even though it's an unpopular review but I found the movie, uhm, just good. I have gone online and read multiple reviews about how it's one of the best of the 18 MCU movies to date and for me, it's not even in my Top 5. I've been trying to figure out why it didn't do it for me, and I'm not sure maybe it's because it comes right after Thor Ragnarok (best MCU movie so far), or it comes before Infinity War (we've all seen the trailer, like give it to us already!) I feel the first 30 minutes or so was a drag, albeit the cinematography and costumes were astounding (google the Filipino influence on the female warriors' costume), but was necessary in order to setup the movie but I didn't get reeled in until maybe Laetitia Wright as Shuri, the black princess (Disney's 2nd, progress!) that can give Tony Stark a run for his money (literally and figuratively) showed up and somewhat stole the show. Danai Gurira imposed herself very well as Okoye, Black Panther's General and leader of the fierce all-female badass army Dora Milaje. Lupita Nyong'o held her own as the requisite ""damsel in distress"", Daniel Kaluuya as BP's right hand man (hated him but still love him) and last but not the least, Michael B. Jordan who I'm thankful they rescued from the dreaded Fantastic Four reboot as one of the movie's antagonist. You know who I'm not raving about? Chadwick Boseman. He seemed okay in Civil War and I don't know if he had to stay stiff because he was royalty but he was boring as a brick. As in don-the-suit-already-and-scratch-my-eye kind of boring. I was actually thinking Chiwetel Ejiofor would've been a better choice but he's already come up as Mordo in Dr. Strange. Storyline was interesting and current, fight scenes were worth the wait, the ending could've been better but is good enough.So to recap, good movie, great visuals, impressive supporting cast, exhilarating fight scenes and we want a Shuri, Tony Stark face off.Favorite quote: We must find a way to look after each other, as if we were one single tribe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Vastly overrated.

Over-hyped and Rated,Simply put the special effects were pretty good at times but nothing we haven't seen before. The story was very weak.

Saying black panther is overrated... is overrated.,"I just don't understand why y'all continue to review the same thing on every post are all the people here racist!? The black community barely has any past, not to mention modern super hero's, it's not a race thing but for real. No one said Ant-man, Thor The Dark World, justice league, Wonder Woman and Venom was overrated. It's actually underrated because of the amount of people calling it overrated. Black panther isn't your typical marvel film, it tells a symbolic story of power,pride, loyalty and honor. It's obvious we come from different lifestyles and won't be able to understand each other, cause your so used to having things your way and everything having to do about you that when you see something different you don't know how to act.. because it's out of your normal supremacy reach. Black panther has been a influential character in the Marvel comics since the 60s it was based on the comics. Blame Stan Lee A WHITE MAN for the story. All the racial bias this movie is receiving is why the movie is so successful you bunch of ignorant bashing fools, on top of the fact that it actually was a well made film it also circulates around an entire race of people, culture and continent exist. It envisions something that can and could be possible and it takes the viewers imagination to a different world that people enjoyed and it's a lot only cause it had an entire black cast as I read many ignorant people here saying. the fact that all of these negative people can't appreciate what Black Panther has meant to the world and are instead focused on their own ignorant biases scheme is sad. You can hate all you want but that doesn't change all the achievement it has won.Long Live The KingWakanda Forever",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So much average,"This film is not helped by the impending Avengers: Infinity War. It is certainly not helped by running that trailer before the film and instantly removing any jeopardy by showing us which major characters live to appear again in the future movie!More importantly though, how do Michael Bay style fight scenes still exist in a world where John Wick choreography is available and Marvel money is on the table? Honestly, I hated the last 20 minutes so much I felt like I was watching a Transformers spin-off. Not just the war-rhinos, which were utterly, shockingly bad, but the entirety of all three of the final sequences were poor CGI, poorly shot, poorly choreographed and added absolutely nothing.Also this is the first Marvel movie where I simply didn't care about any of the characters. No-one was relatable. The closest I could get was to Killmonger, who at least had reasons for his overall behaviour and a character arc that goes somewhere. But if I have to associate with a murderous villain who kills his own friends for no reason that isn't endearing me to the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An AMAZING Movie,"I was a little apprehensive going into the movie just because of allthe hype around it. Many times movies can't live up to it. This one? Exceeded all my expectations! The casting was perfect. The visuals, amazing. I was amazed at the detail that went into the costumes and jewelry, and how they reflect those of real African people from around the continent. And the story was great. There were some kinda predictable things, and it did fall into a pretty typical Marvel trope of the good guy getting help from the ""bad but not as bad"" guy. However, it was never trite or boring. The character development was wonderful. Speaking of characters, I am so appreciative of the fact that the women in this movie were fully recognized humans! They had their own thoughts and feelings and actions separate from the main character, which isn't all that common. This movie deserves every bit of hype around it.

But overall the fight scenes were mediocore, in one fight Black Panther is just throwing punches with his opponent like a boxing match and they're both slow.

Overrated and lacking depth,"Black Panther is undoubtedly a culturally significant film, and its groundbreaking representation in the superhero genre deserves recognition. However, when it comes to the movie itself, it struggles to deliver a truly memorable experience. The plot is formulaic, following a predictable superhero origin story with few surprises along the way.The characters, while well-acted, feel one-dimensional, with motivations that lack complexity. The villain, Killmonger, is one of the stronger elements of the film, but even his arc feels underexplored. The action sequences, while visually impressive, don't offer anything particularly new or exciting.While Black Panther succeeds in terms of cultural impact, its storytelling and character development fall short, making it feel more like a standard Marvel movie than the groundbreaking masterpiece it's often praised to be.

People are using this forum to talk down this movie (they actually promised to do so BEFORE the movie debuted) and vent frustration over seeing blacks achieve, whether it's the black director and black cast or the fictitious characters they've portrayed.For once, they've made a big-budget movie about Africa that isn't about slavery or people dying of disease and being ravaged by war and poverty....and some rac*st folks just can't get behind that.

"Just way, WAY overhyped.","Black Panther was a solid movie, but it's nowhere near what the critics are making it out to be. All of the special effects were very good, and the parts were acted very well. The problem is that it kind of lacked this groundbreaking substance that we're being led to believe is there. The concept is great, but I just didn't feel like there was adequate character development to get you really invested in the ideological clash and manner of resolution they were working toward. For that reason I didn't leave feeling as uplifted as I could have for the theme that was used. It was just kind of, ""oh, alright...well he's a really decent human being."" I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, those are NOT credible critics. There's no way. It's in the top ten, and it was better than a lot of other movies over the last couple of years, but come on.

The Low ratings have an agenda,"The so called ""objective"" reviews of this film are probably just part of the Facebook campaign that was reportedly going to ""ruin"" the reviews by posting negative ones before the movie started. Though Facebook took that group down, the completely fabricated and racially tinged dislike of this movie by many of the 3 and below star reviews makes it obvious the plan was still a go.I love the Marvel universe films, and this one did not disappoint. The CGI and effects were just as good as any other film, the fight and action scenes were just as well choreographed. If anything the hand to hand combat scenes were more impressive than I've seen in a Marvel movie in a long time. Most of the time people are wearing their uniforms etc..., not shirtless on a waterfall.The story line was one of the most complicated and multilayered in Marvel history. And for those who don't believe a superhero movie should have any politics in it: Are you Serious? What IS a superhero movie without some political agenda. You are literally going to the movies to watch superhumans who are supposed to save the world! Where was this dislike of political agenda with the Hydra/Nazi storyline that has been on going for Captain America and the like? Was that not politics? The fight to stop the resurgence of a radical enemy who tried to take over the world and is still operating today? Come on Son!The biggest problem many will have when they see this film is perspective. If you are someone who can't relate to characters that don't look and sound like you- then don't see this movie. If you have a larger less myopic world view, you'll enjoy this. By the way, my theater was ethnically mixed, and we laughed all the way thru the film. If you are only going to ""hate watch it"" then don't go. Save your money.As for the political agenda- the only one I see is situating an Brown Skinned Superhero at the center of a superhero story. One who comes from privilege and not poverty. Offering little children of color to see themselves reflected on screen in a positive and empowering light. Giving them the idea there is a place for them in the super hero catalog. If that is a radical political message you don't support- that says way more about you than the film.

"Very Good Movie, Needed Some Upgrade in Action","I am from Portugal and finally i was able to see the movie.I need to write this little review, because i noticed that many users are making fake¬¥s reviews and it¬¥s noticeable that they didn¬¥t saw the movie (see the news about the facebook group that wants to sabotage this movie).Contrary to most people that talked about the action being great (because they thought they could use that to throw people off), the action wasn't as great. Some Shoots were too dark and some scenes had some annoying jump cuts, so overall it was decent to good, and maybe one great action scene. The pacing of the movie was odd at certain times, but nothing that can damage the movie.Very solid acting all over the place, even from minor supporting cast. They were able to introduce some comedy through the personality of some characters organically, and sometimes the females characters took the movie and had great spotlight's, making the main character look like a secondary character.The Villain...oh my, take Loki away, this is the best villain that MCU has right now (for me, even better than Loki). That is very apparent when you can understand and agree at some extent with is point of view. Even when you know his plans will bring chaos to the world, maybe because of his charisma, you want him to win at some extent.Great shoots of Wakanda and great world building.Great Story, with political views, they even manage to give appropriate screen time to all the characters, with essential dialogues and action.I will give it a 8.0/10.It¬¥s definitly a very good comic movie, but i need to see it again, to make a final judgement. Right now, is not better then The Avengers, CA: WS or CA: CW (this 3 are on another level), but i think that from the 18 MCU movies, maybe he deservers the #6 or #7 spot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Disappointed, could of been better.","Okay so I love Marvel movies and I was really excited for this one as the trailer looked awesome and because the hype seemed good.However I was sadly disappointed. I had an empty feeling when I came out of the cinema as I felt it could have been so much better. This is my unbiased opinion. I really wanted it to be good and awesome and different.There were good points. I liked Chadwick Boseman as the black Panther and there were great visuals and colours throughout the movie. However I wanted a bit more from T'Challa and the plot was pretty weak and many of the characters were under developed. I feel with many other Marvel movies they try to at least make the characters and concepts somewhat plausible but this one fell short.I mean ok I can accept that they got their power from vibranium which came from a meteor but like it didn't give any feeling of how they utilised it to the extent they had and Shuri just seemed so wooden. She looks like 16 or not much older and is supposed to be super intelligent tech woman with all this out of this world stuff, but she did not come across as a believable character in her field of expertise. She just came across like a teen who tried too hard to be funny. I mean at least with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner you get a feel for why they are so clever.Also the villain was bland and I was hoping for more street action outside Wakanda and many of the Wakanda people seemed flaky, like W'kabi.

Black Panther elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU's most absorbing stories.,"Black Panther is hands down, one of the best superheroes spin-off movies of all time! It delivers a witty, action-packed epic moments and brings a vibrant twist to the comic book movie formula while remaining true to the Marvel Universe it belongs to.It tells the story of T'Challa who, after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T'Challa's mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.Okay, even if you are not a fan of superhero movies... you may find the issues explored thought-provoking. It is well acted, dazzlingly shot by an expert cinematographer Rachel Morrison and full of humour. Black Panther is an untold story in modern cinema; a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism.This movie has a fast beating heart because it ain't just sincere for good sake but it is a heartfelt epic that doesn't fall flat. It's the kind of art that's star-strikingly theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel forced.The score is authentic, the movie has an electric rhythmicality; every scene bounces as if dancing to the beat of its own drum.In the context of values, Black Panther serves as an intelligent if broad debate between revolutionary rhetoric and the responsibilities of leadership.In a nutshell, this is one superhero film that definitely punches above the normal crash-bang-wallop weight. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got a whole lot more interesting.Black Panther doesn't just hit its marks. It leaves many many marks. Landmarks.

Culture Inclusion,"I feel sorry for those who have watched this film and gave it poor ratings because the actors don't act like your average marvel ""American actors"". I've grown up around Nigerians and Kenyans and I can tell you for sure the acting was spot on. They captured their culture and mannerisms in a respectable manner. 
I've seen most of the marvel movies and was growing bored until this movie. It actually has a message in it that's not to be missed. I've never experienced that within marvel movies. It usually features the same plot and the same cheesy ""good overcomes evil"" message. But the message portrayed in this movie is one that highlights current issues and should truly be taken to heart.
On another note, I feel so proud of the lighting, makeup and wardrobe used to highlight the beauty of black people. I often feel the lighting on black people within movies and TV still in this day and age makes them look washed out and grey. This movie truly makes their colour shine like pure gold!

It all seemed to get over too fast, didn't do enough to instill emotion so the viewer could be emotionally invested and end up feeling each hit a lot more.With nothing new to offer apart from a good depiction of what I guess could be African culture, this outing was all a big disappointment.Don't fall for the marketing of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

As Spectacular as Advertised,"This movie is awesome. Let's get that out of the way first. It's not the best movie ever, as some claim. It's probably not even the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it is at least worthy of that conversation, which is saying a lot.Black Panther ascended to levels of hype and promise that seemed nearly unreachable-and it reached them. It's virtually unprecedented for a movie to live up to these outlandish expectations, but that's exactly what it did.So, what is this movie that climbed all the way into the top five all time at the U.S. box office?Enter Wakanda, a fictitious African country posing as just another third-world nation, but it is secretly the technologically advanced nation in the world because it rests on a mountain on vibranium, the strongest metal in the MCU. Wakanda's king, T'Chaka, was recently killed in an attack, so his son T'Challa is set to assume the throne. T'Challa also fulfills the role of Black Panther, a cunning and powerful warrior featuring superhuman powers supplied by a Wakandian plant and stylish and functional suit made of vibranium.Wakanda is fiercely loyal to its traditions and to its people. It opts to interact minimally with the outside world and lets in no outsiders, as to protect its secret wealth. This way of life is threatened by the resurfacing of buried stories from the past and the arrival of an outsider who believes Wakanda can no longer sit comfortably as billions in other countries across the globe suffer. T'Challa is forced to deal with the challenges of being a good man and a good king as he navigates the dilemma of staying true to Wakanda's rigid tradition or adapting to a more progressive philosophy.Chadwick Boseman plays the role of T'Challa with exceptional poise, grace and an absolutely regal accent. He would have been the true standout of the movie if not for several other standout performances. 
Danai Gurira (Michonne of The Walking Dead) shines as General Okoye, the king's go-to warrior. Her love, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), though on screen less, plays just as significant a role, as he is one of the strongest voices pushing for change to Wakanda's international policy. And, of course, Kaluuya steals a few scenes with his remarkably expressive acting.Additional shouts to Winston Duke for his role as an intimidating leader of a Wakandian tribe with a dark sense of humor, a low-key warmth, and a penchant for barking. And another one to Sterling K. Brown for playing T'Chaka's brother, a spy dispatched in Oakland who sees the struggles of people firsthand.The greatest standout of the all the standouts is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. His intense presence fills the room in every scene he enters. He exudes such charisma with his American street manner of speaking and swagger that I almost found myself rooting for him, despite his violent and murderous tendencies. Even in his worst moments, he is always sure of his purpose and his message, which is a compelling one. This message, paired with his backstory, make him easy to empathize with.Another thing: Killmonger is powerful and scary. He's more than a worthy adversary for Black Panther. At times he appears to the be Black Panther's better. Like Bane in Dark Knight Rises, an intelligent villain capable of physically overwhelming the hero, he feels like a real threat. We legitimately believe he can win. It comes as no surprise that his fight scenes with Black Panther will leave you breathless.The action sequences deliver all the thrills you would expect from a Marvel movie and from a Ryan Coogler movie (he's now 3 for 3 in his directorial efforts). But the deeper social themes and inner conflicts of the key characters are what elevates this movie to elite status. Yes, seeing a movie with predominantly Black actors and a Black director is also important. It's important to viewers, young viewers most of all, and it's also important to movie studios. Hopefully Black Panther's booming success will finally dispel the myth that movies with Black lead actors don't do well in the box office.Before I wrap up, I have to give credit to Andy Serkis for his rare non-CGI performance. The guy comes in and throws 100mph from the jump and manages to be hateable, funny, and fun throughout. And final shout outs to Angela Bassett, for playing the royal and majestic mother of T'Challa, and to Letitia Wright, for playing T'Challa's wisecracking tech genius little sister, Shuri.Apologies to anyone I didn't spotlight. This movie is flooded with incredible performances, so I had to omit a couple mentions to keep this review to a reasonable word count.Bottom line: go see Black Panther. If you already saw it, see it again. It's that good. It deserves all the praise, and I hope to see it next year at the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The good, the bad.... and the ugly","As a marvel fan who began reading comics in the early 1970's, Black Panther was a name I had known for decades but even at this high point was a minor character, but like Captain America, whom I had little interest in, my interest in both characters changed following the movies. With that reason and T'Challa's presence in Civil War, I had very high hopes for this movie...The good: the cast is charismatic and works well together in most cases, even Boseman's delivery as he grapples with his move to king works well. The near break-out character is his sister, who is easily the most animated and gets the best lines in the movie. Vistas of Africa and inside the Wakanda capital are impressive and great eye-candy for a time. A thematic plea that we are all more alike than different and should be better people is present which frankly we all need more, which brings the films worst failing - more on that later.The bad: actors clearly were locked into roles without much input, the feel in most cases was very wooden at times, even Boseman which is a shame as his extra dimensions in Civil War helped put it over the top. The set designs are good, but the CGI is rough by current standards, and in typical Marvel budget much of the fighting is at night, to reduce costs, a real shame as Black Panther looked awesome in full daylight combat in Civil War. The story as many have noted is just rote... but hey, it IS a Marvel movie so...The ugly: for a film that purports to make a statement about moving to one human tribe, it is unconscionable that the two main white characters are portrayed as either evil post-colonial opportunists, or at best a stumbling federal agent who is so out of touch despite his connections to the events of Civil War that he is just dumbstruck and unable to comprehend quickly the state of Wakanda. Two light anti-white racial pejoratives were thrown around, which undermines the movies message of moving forward and not grouping people and making assumptions or unfair associations.At its simplest, Black Panther is a very routine Marvel origin movie, overlayed with a well thought out sociological black diaspora politic analysis it all with a nod towards greater unity and an ascendant Africa, which makes its willingness to allow and in effect condone anti-white stereotyping all the more annoying. See it for the overall message, and be willing to realize that like society in general, it's not quite as advanced as it thinks it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fight the power,"Marvel Films have their formula down to a fine art. Even their lesser known heroes are making hit movies.T'Challa made his initial appearance in Captain America 3: Civil War. In Black Panther he returns to his mystical homeland of Wakanda to become king after the death of his father. Wakanda so far has kept his its powers, wealth, resources and technology hidden.However T'Challa's late father hid a dark secret about his own brother, who wanted to use force to aid his fellow black brothers in the USA. Now the dead brother's son, Killmonger wants to battle T'Challa for the throne and he wants Wakanda to lead the struggle for black power and cause chaos around the world.The film pulls a nice trick in having two foes, at first we are led to believe it is going to be Klaue.However I found the film rather choppy and in some ways predictable. At times I kept thinking back to the Lion King.I liked that Marvel is not afraid to enter the debate about discrimination and whether it is right and legitimate to use force to overcome it.

another solid hit,"To the outside world, Wakanda is a poor, isolated, reclusive kingdom in the center of Africa. In reality, it is a technologically advanced nation of five tribes through its use of vibranium from a crashed meteor. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to take over the throne after the death of his father in Civil War. He is after arms dealer Ulysses ""Klaw"" Klaue who had previously stolen vibranium and caused mass Wakandan deaths. Klaw is working with Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who seems to have intimate knowledge of Wakanda. In 1992 Oakland, the former king killed his brother who assisted Klaw during the heist.Arguably, the MCU is the top box office franchise of today and it's nice for them to spread their influences into other niches of cinema. This is tackling some cultural aspects within the MCU superhero structure. All that is admirable but the question remains whether this is any good. The answer is that it's plenty good. First, Boseman is exceptional and projects a regal personality. The villains are great although I don't see the need of Killmonger working for Klaw. He should be killing him at first sight. There are a few things that concern me. The final battle feels obligational due to the superhero structure. The other great aspect is the women of Wakanda. They are all great. I also like the humor sprinkled among the action. It's not jokey but actually funny. The MCU is hitting on all cylinders and this is another solid hit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Disappointing, considering the hype","I felt guilty disliking ""Black Panther' because, like ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), there was so much media focus on the supposed social significance of the film. The entire plot revolves around 'vibranium', a fictional unobtainium-like element in the MCU, out of which you can make anything that the plot requires or that would look cool on film. Wakanda, a hidden paradise in the heart of Africa, sits on a mountain of the miracle metal and therefore has technology, including weaponry, far beyond anything else on the planet (outside of Tony Stark's workshop and similar MCU hero/villain enclaves). The Black Panther is the super-powered king of Wakanda, whose costume can be stored in a necklace, allowing him to change instantly (where his civilian clothes go is not clear to me, but certainly the tightfitting cat suit can't be worn over his Savile Road suit) and, as The Black Panther, he can do pretty much anything (regardless of physics). Despite its sophisticated technology, the rulership of Wakenda is decided by brawling, so we end up with two Black Panthers: a good one and an evil one (maybe semi-evil, as he seems to be possessed by murderous good-intent if you are a fan of race-wars). Needless to say, this narrative bifurcation is resolved by a huge melee and a Black Panther mano a mano (easily the worst part of the film from a CGI perspective). Even by MCU standards, most of the characters are pretty much cut-out dolls (especially T'Challa's trite Q-like sister) with the exception of Micheal B. Gordons ""Kill Monger"", an implausible but at least interesting character. As these sorts of movies go, 'The Black Panther' is fine. The look is novel but the script and story are pretty typical of the genre, so perhaps ground breaking in the sociocultural world of big-budget comic book adaptations but otherwise, not much new. Maybe I just don't get it, but Wakanda is this incredibly wealthy enclave in Africa but these elite 1%ers don't seem willing to do anything to help out their troubled continent. I can accept ethical reasons for not using their hyper-advanced weaponry to solve Africa's problems but there seems little excuse not to surreptitiously assist with their hyper-advanced medical technology (I suspect that these are awkward questions best avoided in a movie based on a comic book in which they are the 'good guys').",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Beauty of Wakanda.,"Like many others, i have waited for months for Black Panther to come out. Although i was incredibly excited, a little part of was worried that the movie wouldn't live up to the expectations placed upon it. BUT boy, did it blow my mind. It ended up surpassing my expectation by miles (and i was expecting a lot). It was truly an exquisite film. Chad Boswick acting as the Black Panther was perfection...not one thing was forced, everything he did, he did with grace and ease. Danai Gurira as Okoye was beyond words; she was fierce, elegant and a total badass. Lupita Nypngo, Letita Wright, Micheal B Jordan, Martin Freeman etc..were incredibly stunning as well. The heartfelt acting shined through every actor and actress. The visuals were glorious, the portrayal of African culture in all its beautiful halo was something of a sight to behold. And i can go on forever talking about the beautiful African costumes worn by almost everyone in the movie. This is a film that is educational, honest, visually stunning, humbling and historical. It does not bullshit or gloss up anything. No matter what others say, DO yourself a favor and go watch it. You will love seeing people at the theater dressed in their finest, happy and proud as hell.

The low reviews are from people who don't want to admit that they're racist.,"This movie has a seriously stable racial undertone. That unfortunately a lot of people are unable to relate to. The critics gave this movie incredible reviews because of what not only was done cinematically but culturally as well. The acting is special and I believed to be heart felt. Considering this is a first of its kind I was pleased that it didn't feel like it would be the last of its kind. The music speaks to you and gives you a great feeling of pride. No matter where you come from. I battled with the decisions the characters were making and the challenges they were faced which is a great thing because the movie made you think on several different levels. I read someones review and he/she stated the story was ripped from The Lion King but yet they rated it a one. If that's the case are you mad because you felt it wasn't original or did you dislike The Lion King too(another movie involving African culture). Lol what a misguided childhood if you didn't like the The Lion King.
Is there a large use of CGI yes but name a movie even without action that doesn't. Marvel/Disney are giving us awesome affects. Appreciate it! This is a superhero movie! I completely wish people that are bias would stop seeing these movies eyes wide shut and live a little. Watch this movie think outside the box. It's now one of my favorites from the Marvrel Universe and they are not at all giving us bad movies especially not ones that you could possibly put the rating of a 1 or under a 6 for that matter. Ones,twos and threes are for B movies with terrible visual effects and absolutely no plot. Know the rating system so you don't give people the wrong ideas!

Over hyped?,"The initial reviews were so good for this movie that I felt compelled to see the movie in the theater. Viewing it in standard format was probably not the best choice, and it is quite possible I would have given it a higher rating after watching it on an Imax screen.The pros- Chadwick Boseman did a great job as the Black Panther. He was a strong character and was fun to root for. Some of the visuals were very well done. Many of the set designs are also effective. 
The cons- Michael B Jordan as Killmonger was not very good. His street accent was on the verge of comical. The CGI was not horrible but did get a bit much at times.

An Iconic Movie,"Although I see a lot of people writing bad reviews based on the opinion that it was ""over hyped"", to me, this film exceeded the hype.I would consider myself a pretty average superhero fan, holding Marvel movies to a basic standard of good action, fun dialogue, engaging plot and thought out characters. This movie easily checks off all of those categories, while bringing others into the spotlight such as stunning visuals, well developed world building and lore, diversity in casting, thought provoking villains and complete badass-ery.As much as I can rant and rave about this movie, I noticed one critical flaw. There's a point in time where the writers decided to force the rotting corpse of a dead meme down the audience's throats that really took away from the atmosphere. Not one person in the theatre laughed, while lots were groaning in disappointment. 
Black Panther has it's own quirky dialogue between characters that counts as ""fun"", but if you enter the theatre hoping for Antman, Avengers or Guardians, you will be let down. Try and appreciate the movie's more serious tone as they tackle heavy topics such as classism, racism, segregation, globalism, terrorism, and many other ""isms"" worth addressing on the big screen. They do all this, without making the movie feel like a college lecture, but an entertaining superhero flick.Ultimately, Black Panther gets all of the right kinds of conversations started. To me, this movie outshone the spotlight, raised the bar for all other superhero movies, dropped the mic and left me speechless. I don't want to go into much detail so as to prevent spoilers, but let me leave it at this: you NEED to see Black Panther.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""He is a monster of our own making...""","I am no expert on Marvel comics nor superhero movies. And, I also must admit that I don't watch all that many superhero movies any more because the genre has become too glutted for my taste. I mention all this up front because my opinions doubtless will not be of the diehard fans out there...and I can respect this and understand my insights are not necessarily of the majority of viewers of ""Black Panther"".So why, then, did I choose to watch this film when I am rather tired of these films? Well, because ""Black Panther"" is so radically different from other superhero/Marvel films...reason enough to give it a try.The story is set, in part, in the fictional kingdom of Wakanda in Africa. To the outside world, it's a third world place...poor, uncivilized and backward. However, this is all a ruse, as long ago, the Wakandans received a great gift...Vibranium. This is apparently the world's strongest metal (Captain America's shield, incidentally, is made from it)...and it also has some magical properties.As for Wakanda's kings, for many generations they've chosen to maintain this ruse. And, this includes staying out of foreign affairs...which is the big struggle in the film. Should Wakanda allow Africans and black people around the world to be exploited as they have for centuries OR should they use their advanced weaponry and Vibranium to conquer the world for a greater good? Much of the film concerns this power struggle for the throne and the hearts and minds of Wakandans.The plot is amazingly fresh and unusual...a major plus in the film. It also is never dull! But it also is incredibly violent and parents might want to think before allowing kids to see the movie. It is odd that the film is rated PG-13 mostly because there is no nudity but the violence level is intense to say the least.

It had potential,"The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is ""Black Panther"", the first Marvel film featuring a predominantly black cast. Black Panther first appeared in ""Captain America: Civil War"", with Chadwick Boseman donning the suit of Black Panther, and alter-ego T'Challa, King of Wakanda, a technologically advanced nation hidden in the African continent. After the death of his father, T'Challa, son of T'Chaka, the King, takes the place of the throne, faced with obstacles as soon as he is initiated.Andy Serkis plays Ulysses Klaue, a mercenary stealing technology from Wakanda and selling it, is one of the main antagonists of the picture, giving a fantastic performance as a nonchalant, cockney thief, escaping the claws of the previous king, and now hunted by Boseman. In fact, what makes this film stand-out, is the back-up cast. The sister of T'Challa, played by Letitia Wright, and a clan leader, played by Winston Duke, are two characters who particularly stand-out, and serve as comic-relief for parts of the film. Whereas on the other side of the film, with Chadwick Boseman, are phenomenal pieces of lightning and choreography in a lot of his early battle sequences, paired with a purple-glowing suit (possibly the best suit produced by the MCU for any hero), any action sequence featuring him is exciting and awesome, especially the early battles, where the audience is introduced to the power of the Black Panther, discovering just why this guy is a hero.Speaking of costumes, the costumes of the citizens of Wakanda all vary in colour, being interesting and obviously well made. Despite this, it seems as if the costumes are trying to ""spread the colour"" with some, obviously blatant scenes of (costume) colour segregation. This is not helped by CGI which is successful for the majority, but falls short at the scenes of actual animal life, i.e. rhinos. Even though ""Black Panther"" is home to some of the best choreography for a Marvel film, the script lets itself down, with a dragged out plot and unnecessary sequences of ""falling only to rise once more"" (both literally and metaphorically).From the get go, one thinks, this is close to being one of the best Marvel films of all time, but, short of falling flat on its face, it stumbles over its own plot annoyances, making it equal to ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"" when it had the capability to surpass ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (although it would have had to be extremely good for that to happen).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Long Live The MCU,"Another MARVEL hero is here and this time it's not quite the usual stuff. Having been introduced in the Captain America: Civil War, the Wakandan prince returns to the big screen as Black Panther. This is not exactly an origin story, but it's more of a continued chapter of T'challa's life after Captain America: Civil War. The movie tells us the legend of Black Panther and the life in Wakanda which has distanced itself from the rest of the world. The metal, Vibranium plays an important part in all of this which itself is pursued by the evil arms dealer Ulysses Klaue. After his father's death at the UN bombing, T'challa has to prove his worth to the throne while he tries to rid of Ulysses Klaue for good. But the pursuit leads him to know the truth about his uncle and cousin. T'Challa has to protect the misuse of Wakandan resources by fighting his cousin Erik Killmonger who takes over Wakanda by defeating him in a fight.The plot of the movie is simple and also similar to many other superhero movies. However, the cultural and racial backdrop makes this movie very different from others. The city, Wakanda is one of the important aspect of the movie. It is technologically advanced than most part of the world and yet sticking to its cultural roots. Wakanda takes you to a different world altogether. This experience is enhanced by the background score which is very African and amazing costume design. Out of the very few scenes involving the outside world, the Seoul, action scene is a treat to watch.Black Panther lays out a perfect platform for the coloured actors in Hollywood to showcase their talents. Driven by the commercial power of MARVEL Cinematic Universe, this film is going to be a career highlight for most of them. Chadwick Boseman has literally incorporated the phrase 'actions speak more than words' into his acting. He nails the African accent so much that it feels weird when the other characters speak in an American/British accent. Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger is a supercool villain this movie needed. While the movie fails to provide much substance to the characters of popular actors Angela Basset, Forrest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and Lupita Nyong'o, it surely has a lot to offer for Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright. They play the characters Okoye and Shuri respectively, who are almost like side kicks to Black Panther. Marting Freeman as agent Everett K. Ross has a slightly funny role.Black Panther is not as entertaining as the other MCU movies, but it surely has its own charm.

Over hyped because it has a lot of Black people in it.,"First of all before anyone calls me racist on the other side of the screen I am a melinated person. I'm a huge MCU fan too.

But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time .

Groundbreaking,"In the same but different way, Black Panther is bringing on the same amount of significance that Wonder Woman did last year. Of course, it's crazy to think we're even at this point in 2018 where Black Panther (not the first overall) but the first mainstream superhero movie to have a black lead in years and the first one in the now 18 film long Marvel Cinematic Universe.To just say this film is important is an understatement. Diverse representation in films is among the most talked about things in the world of filmmaking these days and Black Panther makes another big step for the industry, especially looking at the box office results of opening weekend. Luckily, the film itself isn't just a step forward in representation, it's also a dang good piece of filmmaking. It should come as no surprise that the guy who made Fruitvale Station and Creed once again knocked it out of the park with Black Panther.Let's start with the cast because even before a single trailer, the cast was the thing that stood out of the most. For me, Chadwick Boseman stole the show in Civil War a few years ago. He made an even bigger impression than Tom Holland did as Spider-Man. His calm but fierce presence was unmatched and brought an entirely different vibe to the characters already in place in the MCU. Boseman, who has already played some pretty iconic people (Jackie Robinson, Thurgood Marshall, and James Brown), is perfecting the role of a lifetime right now.Alongside him is an incredibly talented supporting cast including Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and of course Michael B. Jordan. Nobody is wasted and all of them are well-written and fleshed out. Jordan instantly ranks in the top 3 or 4 Marvel villains (which isn't the hardest thing to do), and his performance as Killmonger was full of thoughtful planning and empathetic beats. So much so that I understood what he was doing and why he was doing, even if I don't agree as to how he was accomplishing his goals.But I've gone on far too long without mentioning the ladies of Black Panther. Wow did I love Gurira's noble and powerful turn as T'Challa's guard Okoye, Nyong'o's gentle but courageous turn as Nakia, and Wright's hilarious and energetic turn as Shuri (who is essentially Q to Boseman's Bond). There are other great beats by actresses in the film, but those 3 women are absolutely incredible in this film.There are some familiar story beats from say Thor or Iron Man, but I always say that even if a movie isn't original in story, but is presented and executed in a new way, then it's all worth it. Which is a very long way of saying , Black Panther is a uniquely satisfying piece of cinema that might as well change the way superhero films (perhaps all films) are directed, produced, written, and acted worldwide. Wishful thinking sure, but it seems like there's been a shift since Wonder Woman, so why not after Black Panther?9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Lion King dressed as a different big cat,"This is going to be difficult; did I enjoy the film - it was ok without being brilliant. Did I think it was as good as the critics say - not by a long way. Do I think it is worthy of all the awards and plaudits it has received - not entirely. Do I think it's been talked up due to the ethnic diversity contained in the film, particularly the cast - yes (sorry). Is the diversity a good thing - of course it is.Black Panther introduces the Marvel universe to Wakanda, the fictional home of the Wankandan people and their king/leader/superhero saviour - the Black Panther. In a nutshell the movie is this - a new king is born metaphorically), he doubts himself, the crown is threatened, a new quasi king emerges and dethrones the old king, the new king turns out to be bad, conflict ensues to the point of civil war, fights occur everywhere, the old king realises his worth and fights for the crown and his people. By the end of the film everything is ok again, the end.Chadwick Boseman plays a good role as T'Challa, but I felt that Michael B Jordan played a better villain in Killmonger. Boseman does display a wide range of emotions as he learns his worth through the plot, he is solid enough, but it is not really anything new. It is this that was slightly disappointing for me - I was more enthralled when he made his appearance in the Captain America movie. It is refreshing to see a black superhero, but the critics seem to have forgotten that there has been a black superhero before in Wesley Snipes's ""Blade"". With a more diverse script to work from and a character that portrayed a wider range of emotions, Jordan slightly outshone Bosenman for me in this film. Both were let down by the CGI fighting/ballet dancing though.The coolest things about the film were the weapons and tech, the best character was Shuri (Letitia Wright) because she delivered humour as well as action. For the good things that Shuri brought, it also felt like I was watching a scene from a James Bond 007 film, where she was Q, and she was explaining to Bond what a gadget did. Playing the queen, Angela Basset delivers poise and grace, but again drawing on comparisons, she could been portraying a version of M from James Bond 007 films too. The whole tribal council thing felt like it was from a Star Wars film too - a kin to the Jedi council.The plot was average because it has been done before, in fact I'm pretty sure that this wasn't far off the plot of ""The Lion King"". This was the biggest let down for me, not only had it been done before but it was plagued with light, throw-away ideas that weakened it. It didn't feel like a polished Marvel film that I was used to seeing, and it certainly didn't feel as good as the critics had been raving about.
I have an issue when superhero's fight practically identical carbon copies of themselves, for example; the worst part of ""Antman"" was Antman fighting Yellow-jacket as they were practically the same. The worst part of the Iron Man films was when he fought against carbon copies of the Iron Man he had made. I even hated computer games that did that - Ken/Ryu in Street Fighter - SubZero/Scorpion in Mortal Kombat - It is lazy and it's cheap! Black Panther sadly does exactly that. Throw together two black panther suits, identifiable mainly by the varying shades used on the trim - and then the action scene's just look like lazy CGI dancing, something you'd expect to see a college computer design student make. On the topic of CGI, it was in abundance here. Usually Marvel does it in a way that the film looks natural enough, but in this film it was that overused that it felt at times like I was watching a cartoon.I think this movie got the acclaim it did because 99% of the cast were black - for me I don't care what colour, race or religion somebody is - film is about the story, it's about losing yourself to something fun and exciting. There are some seriously great films out there with a black cast, but they do not get the praise they deserve - I'm sure there will be excellent films in the future with black superhero's saving the day too. Unfortunately, this film felt like it had already been done before a hundred times over. For me, it did not live up to the expectation of hype I'd read into. I really wanted a lot more from Black Panther - I just hope that the next instalment has a better and more original story line. I'd love to rate this higher but the best I can give it is 6 out of 10 because it didn't feel original or fresh, it looked good in places, but it didn't have the substance within it to make it a classic for years to come.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This movie will keep you entertained for the runtime, but unless you're a diehard Black Panther fan you will probably never watch it again. It's a generic Marvel movie that follows the classic Hero's Journey almost exactly, but strangely enough without any training between the first defeat and victory. The visuals were mostly good which is to be expected of a Marvel film. A lot of people loved the setting of Wakanda but I found it to be one of the weakest parts of the film. The costumes look interesting, but it doesn't really make sense that technology would advance while culture remained the same, this has never happened in any civilisation in history.

provocative story with a strong cast of actors,"With his father T'Chaka having passed away, T'Challa finds himself as heir to the throne of Wakanda and responsible for leading his people as the new king--a role which he is reluctant to embrace. He returns home to prepare for his coronation, that is until he finds his sovereignty challenged by both internal and external factions, and must seek help from some unlikely sources to prevent a conflict which could indeed have global repercussions. This innovative, well-crafted, and culturally significant entry to the Marvel Universe is a feast for the eyes with beautiful, breathtaking scenery, strong, captivating characters, but most importantly it's a very personal and compelling story with political overtones that raise serious, penetrating questions about the modern world. Though the pace lags at times it still holds your attention and is perfectly cast across the board with Boseman poised and centered in the lead, Jordan matching him as a fuming, physically imposing counterpart, along with Nyong'o, Gurira, and Wright who are all terrific. ***",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's okay as long as you don't think too much about it,"Black Panther is smarter than the average superhero movie, though that's not saying much. Just when you think this might be an intriguing movie there is a deus ex machina moment, plot convenience, or a really over-long CGI fight scene to remind you that this is simply another Marvel movie sliding off the conveyor belt. The ending speech that re-explains the plot is especially annoying.There's a lot of inconsistencies. The suit can absorb a grenade with no noticeable impact yet he is blasted back by an RPG ten seconds later. Also for some reason the suit can redirect damage some moments but not others. Chalk that up to ""plot armor"" I guess.In or out of the suit he is impervious, which leads to the major problem with Black Panther: the main character. He has no arc and has no flaws, unless you count being too humble and trusting. It's an incredibly boring character. I was actually rooting for the bad guy if only to make the film interesting. This is one of those weird films where the bad guys all have more personality and complex motivations than the good guys.The royal family for first half of this movie is smug and unbearable, and for the second half are hypocrites defending a system they suddenly realize is horribly flawed, but only when it disadvantages them. But that is never explored. Their main motivation is revenge and to usurp the throne for the sake of ruling...exactly the motivation of the bad guy, except he actually has a nuanced backstory, charisma, and a philosophy he wants to put into practice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Very disappoinring,"Allow me to preface my review by saying I have loved all the previous Marvel Universe movies. However, I found Black Panther a yawnfest. It seemed to lack the feel of the other movies in the franchise and I was really struggling to watch all of it until the end. It was such a relief when those credits rolled.ActuallyI thought the acting was good but the plot was lacking. It seemed to be going nowhere very slowly most of the time. I couldn't relate to the characters either which meant I didn't like any of them. If they make a sequel, I hope it's at least interesting.Overall a disappinting effort from Marvel but I still look forward to the next installment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The MCU has cat-like reflexes.,"This review of Black Panther is spoiler free**** (4/5)WITH ONLY A few films to his name director Ryan Coogler has taken a real turn in the world of cinema, first was tough-bearing directorial debut Fruitvale Station which was only a small indie project but after that it didn't take long for his name to be on the map, it was, inevitably a few years later when he made his second feature Creed (Rocky 7) where the illigitimate son of the late Apollo Creed would take his turn in the boxing world, and finally his third and latest film Black Panther is his chance at a big budget feature. However not only black power a main symbol in his features there's only one actor who has collaborated with the director in every one of his films; Michael B. Jordan. 
 
Black Panther opens not long after the death of his father King T'Chalka, which would then conjure up his revenge in Captain America: Civil War. Here he has swapped from being a supporting player to being the main feature, he's just about to be crowned King of Wakanda, the fictional African nation which has made an occasional entry in other MCU movies. For the ceremony he has to take on a challenger in gladiator-style combat, there's African-drum music in the air and the Wakandan natives are chanting to the beat. This is an important scene, one that changes the world of cinema in an excellent way, granted on occasion there have been a few films that make a few homages to a homely place, for example 2009's Avatar had the main character going to meet other tribes and there would be different design's to their clothing. Coogler follows that same insight. Like Taika Waititi before him who paid energetic homage to his home of New Zealand by adding his Antipodean style humour in Thor: Ragnarok, here Coogler is the polar opposite, he swaps the humour for the colour of the country and their natives who dress in African-style colours from bright reds, through yellows to the bright greens, even through the Africani accessories. Coogler's attention to the detail is exquisite.With that in mind, it's also an important film one that shows how much 21st century has changed and you could argue that it's for the better. After becoming king, T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) has to face his biggest challenge, to protect his country against the invasion of a former soldier with a mysterious past Jordan's Erik Killmonger (which sounds like a gaming profile), who wants to overthrow the king. So that's your average Marvel movie storytelling right there. However, Coogler doesn't make it the average Marvel film apart from his exquisite hand in the Africani detail, it's perhaps the most visually stunning comic-book movie, and the Panther's suit changing colour, the sand-like holograms and the amazing cityscape which shines thanks to Rachel Morrison's gorgeous cinematography. 
 
There's so much good in Black Panther, excellent action, stunning visuals, gorgeous cinematography and a director who pays an energetic homage to Africa, but the real standing point here is the female characters, from Danai Gurira, through Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o to T'challa's mother played by Angela Bassett. Who all put in excellent performances along with another standout performance by recent award's darling Daniel Kaluuya. Boseman and Jordan are excellent too, but here they're made into supporting players by these brilliant performers. In short, Coogler's go at the MCU and his third feature is a brilliant entry to his growing filmography one that takes an important scratch in cinema.
 
VERDICT Like Waititi before him Coogler pays energetic homage to his past life in the MCU's latest super extravaganza.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Long Live the King,"""I never yielded! And as you can see, I am not dead!""Black Panther was such a cultural signpost for everyone, and a great MCU superhero movie as well. As a young Marvel reader, I always wondered why the character was not used more at the time. He had a great origin story and was pretty kick ass. But finally, his time arrived, and he showed them all. Director Ryan Coogler was a great choice to make this movie.This movie hits all the usual superhero beats, while also being a landmark moment in black culture. It's a real honest to goodness epic tale. Wakanda comes to life so wonderfully that you wish it were real. So many great actors get to fill these roles we've only ever just read about previously. It does all this and still pushes the larger story of the MCU forward.Michael B. Jordan plays the rare villain in that you can almost relate to him, except he lacks any nobility in his actions. Andy Serkis steals all his scenes as a psycho bad guy you can't take your eyes off of. Danai Gurira as Okoye shows the world just how bad-ass us Walking Dead fans have known her to be for awhile now. Seriously, she's impressive. Letitia Wright as Shuri was another personal delight, such a fun character, great casting.Chadwick Boseman occupies the role of T'Challa/Black Panther with so much grace, strength, passion and just plain old aristocratic grandiosity effortlessly oozing from his very center...that it would seem practically impossible to consider a recast for future Black Panther movies. He was perfect and it's still hard to believe he's gone.Whatever happens in the future, we'll always have this movie to watch and enjoy.Wakanda forever, rest in peace, dear king. üëëüíîüê±",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time??,"Subpar to say the least. Political partisanship has now cemented its ugly head into almost every movie being delivered for mass consumption. Most moviegoers such as myself take in a flick to escape today's overt political nonsense and everybody's got an agenda world we live in........even if only for a couple hours. Forget about it. Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised.

The love interest wasn't that great, but also not a dealbreaker. The only stuff, I didn't enjoy, was the visual effects, and the fact, that the suit charges energy.

For Those Who Miss The Plot,"Yes the movie has some issues. Accents and languages and a few characters deserve some fleshing out, but a lot of the confusion about the plot comes from lack of knowledge.And normally I would never write a review but I feel there are either so many very young people of color and non-people of color that miss the plot, simply because they are not part of the culture they are viewing on screen. The movie's core was a long standing unspoken discomfort (putting it lightly) between American black people and Africans. This movie took some of those discomforts and pain and put it front and center. Those of us who have seen and understand that very convoluted ""thing"" understand what we were seeing. It's essentially the parent (Wakandans or Africans)that left the child (Killmonger or black Americans), the child was abused, left to fend for themselves, and then the child growing to see that not only did the parent leave them, but the parent was happy, comfortable and did not care about all the evil that had befallen them.And on the other side is the parent who had no idea, what happened, but assumed from what they had seen from afar, the child had every opportunity and decided to just not take them. The child instead decided to be a menace. Therefore the parent has a negative view of that child and really doesn't want to be associated with them in any way.What happens when they meet up? T'Challa and Killmonger in the throne room.Hate it if you must, but this storyline has never been on screen before. This painful under current has never been publicly mentioned. And I can see why it could confuse. But people of color, both Africans and black people, got it..and it's started a wonderful discussion. If any of you are confused and care to learn, a quick spin around YouTube to look at videos on what Africans think of black Americans, would start to give you some insight. If not, then oh well...you're going to be confused about a lot of non Anglo movies in coming years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What do our world powers hide from the rest of us?,"""In times of crisis the wise build bridges while the foolish build barriers.""This story is centered around the problematic whether one should help the outside world or keep knowledge to oneself to keep the insiders safe. Wakanda has far more advanced technology than the rest of Earth in the Marvel universe but they keep it hidden to avoid conflict in Wakanda - because we all know: Humans are greedy.I really like the premise about Wakanda and the little rituals they have. I wonder what societies nowadays have similar rituals, and how they function, as rituals that extreme can have consequences as shown in the movie.In the end, however, this is again a movie about revenge as are so many of the Marvel movies. The film takes revenge, technology and race as center motives.It was definitely refreshing to see this, though. Black Panther, yay.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Can we please get a movie with out a social agenda?,"Look, I stopped watching about half the DC comic TV shows (ESPECIALLY Supergirl) because I am tired of being preached to.

This movie was beautifully done with great cinematography.
The story was...meh with predictable plot (tho Gorilla man proving to be a class act was a surprise and a real bonus) with lots of scenes that I saw as...why?
Acting was melodramatic and trite.
But what ruined it the most was the regular victim mentality theme that has just turned me off to most of Hollyweird and the media in general.
Up until now Marvel has taken the high road with this but they have dipped their toe into the politically correct cesspool that is losing Hollyweird millions of fans and dollars.
This movie so far has been financially successful but I think it will be a niche viewership and its real success is that it had little real competition.

Black Panther: A Cultural Phenomenon,"!! Possible Spoilers!!Black Panther is a groundbreaking cinematic achievement that transcends the superhero genre. Director Ryan Coogler crafts a rich and complex world, introducing audiences to the technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda. The film is a celebration of Black culture, empowering its characters and showcasing the beauty and resilience of the African continent.Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa is a masterclass in complex characterization. The film explores the challenges faced by a young king grappling with the weight of his responsibilities. T'Challa's journey of self-discovery and growth is both inspiring and relatable. Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is a complex and tragic villain, offering a compelling counterpoint to T'Challa's idealism. The supporting cast, including Shuri, Nakia, and Okoye, are fully realized characters with their own unique voices and stories.The film's exploration of themes of identity, power, and responsibility is both timely and relevant. The contrast between the isolated and technologically advanced Wakanda and the rest of the world creates a thought-provoking narrative. The film's exploration of the Black experience is both empowering and inspiring, resonating with audiences on a deep level.Black Panther is a visual spectacle, with stunning cinematography and action sequences are thrilling and well-choreographed, while the world-building is immersive and detailed. The film's soundtrack, curated by Kendrick Lamar, is a perfect complement to the film's energy and cultural significance.The film's costume design is equally impressive. The Black Panther suit is iconic, blending sleek design with practical functionality. The costumes of the Dora Milaje are both empowering and visually striking, reflecting the strength and discipline of the all-female warrior unit.Black Panther is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cultural touchstone that has had a profound impact on audiences worldwide.

an antelope in the headlights,"Greetings again from the darkness. Adaptations of Superheroes, Comic Books, and Graphic Novels have been driving the movie theatre box office for a few years now. Where the financial success of a film was once measured in tens of millions, it's now hundreds of millions. Beyond that, these enormous productions are pressured to make political and social statements ... providing the hope of which real life leaders seem to fail. This latest from Marvel and director Ryan Coogler (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION), carries all of that plus the expectations of an entire gender and race. It's a heavy burden for a comic book character, however it seems, regardless of one's perspective, it's likely the film delivers, satisfies, and ... oh yeah ... entertains.The bar has been set so high for action sequences and special effects, that we take the great for granted and only speak up on those that falter. What allows this film to take its place among the best of the genre is a combination of story depth and the payoff for showing us a world we haven't previously seen. The cultural aspects of the (mythical) African country of Wakanda are not only interesting, but the setting itself is breath-taking. An explosion of color, texture and technology blended with intriguing and multi-dimensional characters bring the film to life and draw us into this wonderland of tradition, culture and humanity.It seems ridiculous to speak of a comic book film in these terms, but the number of talking points raised during its runtime are too many and too varied to discuss in this format. What we can make clear is that it's cool to watch an entire movie where people of color and women are strong, confident, and intelligent. Chadwick Boseman has played Thurgood Marshall (MARSHALL), James Brown (GET ON UP), and Jackie Robinson (42), and here he takes on a fictional icon in King T'Challa/Black Panther. He perfectly captures the pensive nature of a King balancing tradition with the needs of his people to evolve and transition. His chief adversary ""Killmonger"" is played terrifically by Michael B Jordan (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION) as a man out for revenge and power. For most movies this head to head battle would be enough ... but not this time.Lupita Nyong'o (Oscar winner for 12 YEARS A SLAVE), Danai Gurira (""The Walking Dead""), and relative newcomer Letitia Wright play Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively; a triumvirate of three of the strongest women you've likely ever seen on screen. Nakia is the love interest, but also carrying out her own humanitarian missions, while also proving to be beyond adequate as a soldier. Okoye is the ultimate warrior and absolutely loyal to her country, while Nakia (T'Challa's sister) is a contemporary version of James Bond's Q - the ultimate technology whiz, and one with the zippiest zingers. Any of these characters could be the basis for a standalone movie, but together they elevate this to something much more than a couple of dudes in sleek suits fighting.Martin Freeman (THE HOBBIT), Daniel Kaluuya (GET OUT), Sterling K Brown (""This is Us""), Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker are all contributors, and Andy Serkis is a frenzied standout in an all-too-brief turn as Klaue. The strong cast delivers even in the few moments when the script lags. In fact, the only piece of this puzzle that didn't seem to fit was the traditional hand-to-hand combat to determine the next king. Why is it that a nation so advanced still relies on primitive courses of decision-making? Perhaps this is merely commentary on our society, though providing a more intellectual solution would have been in line with the rest of the story.The world of Wakanda is stunning. The costumes are sleek, colorful and fascinating. The characters are multi-dimensional. The action sequences are top notch (armored rhinos!). The cinematographer is Rachel Morrison, who recently made history by being the first woman to receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography (MUDBOUND). It's these factors that allow Mr. Coogler's film to achieve the level of importance that most comic book films wouldn't dare to strive for. On top of everything, it accomplishes the one thing I demand from these type of movies ... it's quite fun to watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jordan was the Black Panther instead of Chadwick Boseman..Chadwick definitely nailed it as Black Panther but in my opinion, Michael B.Jordan would have done better as Black Panther but Michael did nail it as a villain and as well as Chadwick nailed as Black Panther.I myself am a huge MARVEL fan & this movie is a great great addition to the Marvel Film's Franchise..Definitely will be buying this on Blu-Ray/4K to rewatch this amazing masterpiece!!The VFX in this movie was unbelievable..I really wished that I watched it in 3D because I think this movie is meant to be watched in 3D & I did the same mistake with Thor Ragnarok which is another masterpiece..GO WATCH BLACK PANTHER IN 3D IF U CAN!!DONT MISS THIS IN THEATRE'S!! STILL SHOWING IN CINEMAS!! U'RE GOING TO LOVE IT!!! & I give Black Panther a 10/10..TRUST ME GO WATCH THIS MOVIE..",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not the Best Marvel Film,"This is not the best marvel film ever as some are saying, but it is also isn't the best. The acting at times is wooden. This film is very dull aswell. The jokes are very painful (what are those) to sit through. There are some good aspects of the film like Michael B Jordan as Kilgmonger and some of the action scenes. A lot of the characters aren't given much to do. For example Martin Freeman just shows up and does nothing important to the story. Chadwick Boseman also doesnt really do anything overall. Overall this film is nothing it is not com pletely terrible but is just anothe cookie cutter marvel film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'd love for black people to go back to Africa, their home and build great civilisations. I also want the same for my people- as a European I see this film as a unifying force between the Africans and the Europeans of this earth. Truly a message of unity, and a beacon of hope.

"Of palace intrigues, combat, emotional drama and special effects","Since it was nominated for best film at the Oscars this movie was on my "" must watch"" list for a long time, though I must admit I am no fan of Marvel cinematic universe movies. The main attraction besides the production values, sets and special effects is obviously the late Chadwick Boseman who has delivered a memorable performance as King T'Challa who has taken over duties of King of an African nation Wakanda after the death of his father. His ascent to the throne is challenged by a a tribe leader M'Baku, a duel is fought and Chadwick emerges victorious. But all is not smooth sailing for him as there are a number of impediments. Wakanda is technically advanced due the extensive use of a modern metal called vibranium. The movie is a thrilling mix of the old and the new with a mix of African tribes with protocol, a CIA operative, London city museum , gambling tables of night clubs, high speed car chases and crashes all made exciting with special effects and technical wizardry. Where there is burning ambition there are bound to be plottings and palace intrigues and both are in plenty. The attraction is the hand to hand fight sequence in knee deep water watched by many against a picturesque backdrop of cliffs and waterfalls. This remains a highlight of the movie. Definitely a movie worth sitting through as it transports you to another world. Some superior acting from Chadwick Boseman supported by Daniel Kaluuya, Lupita Nyong'o and Forest Whitaker. It was in later years that Chadwick got the Oscar posthumously for "" Ma Rainey's Black Bottom "" and Daniel Kaluuya got the Oscar for ""Judas and the black messiah"" . Waiting now to see "" Black Panthers Wakanda Forever"" later this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Black Panther,"I enjoyed watching the movie! The scenery was amazing! I especially enjoyed seeing the true Africa, not the mad up one with it's one note weather, but the beautiful, yet cold and snowing in the mountains as well. I would definitely go see it again.

Solid 7 - enjoyed it but it's not as good as the critics say!,"First off, really enjoyed it and so did my little boy (12). There were some great characters fleshed out really well with a great cast, plenty of standard comic book action and some funny banter/quips between characters which never felt out of place (T'Challa and his sisters banter is really enjoyable).Even though there's a lot of technology on show the films never feels too ""techie"" and, at it's heart, it keeps grounded and true to it's tribal kingdom roots. The main arc T'Challa character arc of taking on the Black Panther/King mantel, the tribes and storyline around that is really well done.Outside that there are some regulation car chases, shoot-outs, fights, etc which are pretty standard Marvel fare and nothing great. They look good (obviously) but are a little OTT and distracting from the well acted, grounded plotlines. There's also the annoyance of the overacting, ham-master himself Andy Serkis.All-in-all, it's a very solid comic book movie with some great sections (see above re: grounded, realistic story bits) and some decent standard Marvel schlock. Better than most Marvel movies it's fare to say, and yes it does have a great cast too!Definitely worth watching but not, as some have said, a 97% hit or as good as the critics are trying to have you believe (I assume that's more a case of pushing it's first black superhero thing - Blade might not have been the first but it wasn't that long ago, was it!?!?)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truely One of the best Marvel Superhero films!!,"I'm not going to lie. I went into this movie totally expecting it to suck.

I first saw the panther appear in Captain America Civil war and I thought the hero was meh.. I jumped to the conclusion Black Panther is only getting his on movie because Marvel studios are trying to appear more inclusive and progressive and all that PC stuff lol. I couldn't be more wrong. They actually had a plan for this hero. Great back story, Fantastic visuals, great acting, totally hilarious, moving and poignant in parts, thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

I just didn't find the story interesting and I don't think it did a good job of helping me be interested in the characters.

Also, there is no way an isolated society with a tribal government could be advanced like this, even if they had access to the vibranium mineral which appears to be their primary advantage as a civilization. It would make more sense to me if they just gave Wakanda a mythical origin story like Asgard, or perhaps an ancient alien society hiding from some deep galactic terror.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The newest and one of the best superhero movies,"I'd heard so much about this film though I had only heard about Black Panther from a comic book encyclopedia. But this movie delivers. There's one scene that looks like it was lifted from James Bond 007 and the plot is reminiscent of Disney's The Lion King but it's more than just that. It's the story of a young king and his greatest challenge against a jealous enemy. This really sets up the story for Avengers: Infinity War (which I have yet to see, along with Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Two). I liked how the casting went, with mostly African-Americans as the main characters and one Brit named Martin Freeman (from the Hobbit movies). The visuals were really good and the characters were well done. It makes me want to learn more about my favorite continent (besides North America).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but much overrated,"Being an avid book reader, I have watched all but 2 or 3 comic book adaptations since the late 1970s. I have witnessed the change in tone and approach, as well as the the whole world-building process take root in the recent adaptations as the times inevitably changed. What Marvel has done so far is much more commendable than DC, and many examples of Marvel movies of the last 10 years are the living proof of that. However, not all of these adaptations are on par with what we may get to call all-time greats, and I am afraid -despite all the high grades given to the movie by critics- Black Panther is one of them.Black Panther actually happens to be one of my favorite characters along with Thor, a few X-men and Green Lantern. Time and again, I have read it with utter joy and fulfillment, and have always looked forward to the next issue. Therefore, this movie was one which I looked forward to with extreme enthusiasm. And maybe it was this same enthusiasm that ruined the movie for me, but I sincerely doubt it.So, as to how I see the movie:OK, so the casting is right on target, no quarrels there. And so are the visual effects and the setting of the story. However, the story is somewhat shallow, and needlessly comedic at places where it shouldn't be.Marvel (Disney) has lately started to follow a certain pattern of writing scripts, just like in the Bond movies. A hero, a romantic interest, a villain, a side-kick (or someone who takes on the role of Q from those Bond movies), a moral dilemma... and we are set. This one here is no different, only -as I have said before- somewhat shallow. Also, there happens to be more than one coincidental occurrence which make the story a lot less believable, if you care about those things. All of a sudden, an unexpected piece falls into place, a miraculous twist happens, someone appears out of thin air, and voila... all is well.The movie that could have delivered so much more at us, ends up delivering a script which can be summarized in just 2 sentences, and a story full of plot holes.So, how come such a movie garner so much praise, and such high marks? I dunno, honestly, but I have a theory.Ultimately, I feel like it would be safe to say that this movie was sort of a hype created to promote a black super hero in these trying times and during the re-emergence of needless and disturbing racial tendencies. It was during these times the movie was shot and as such promoted to emphasize equality and fairness among all people. Which is all good and fine, but it still could have done that with a stronger script, with a more coherent and fuller story. The fact that it gets so many high notes is not because of the film that it is, but because of the film it was intended to be. At least, this is my take on the movie, and how the film was reviewed so highly.I just hope the next installment in the Black Panther saga delivers more, just like the Winter Soldier delivered after the first Captain America adaptation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Politically relevant, but ultimately mid-tier Marvel.","The hype surrounding Marvel's newest cinematic instalment was stratospheric. A predominantly African-American cast and crew generated the initial publicity, then a knockout trailer turned that buzz into genuine excitement. Perhaps with such high expectations it was always going to be difficult for writer-director Ryan Coogler to deliver; the timely political themes, big-budget blockbuster requirements and Marvel connectivity all vying for his attention. Let's get the bad news out of the way: the action is underwhelming. There are a few decent sequences-a casino showdown boasts an ambitious unbroken tracking shot, a ritualistic cliff-side clash between two major characters is brutal-however, the set pieces largely leave a lot to be desired. Majority of the action is a blur of choppy editing and dimly lit cinematography, making it hard to appreciate both the choreography and geography of the fighting, whilst the finale is a disappointingly banal battle featuring, wait for it, CGI rhinos. Where this movie thrives though, is in its story and characters. Undoubtedly the MCU's most politically relevant instalment, the central plot revolves around oppression, equality, power-sharing and class, all tied up into a potent narrative that gives its characters room to breathe and grow. As the eponymous hero from Wakanda, Chadwick Boseman is endearing as a confident but conflicted King T'Challa, while his opposing force Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is riveting as an unstoppable tornado of fury and revenge. Yet this film also gives us three of the strongest female characters of the franchise: Lupita Nyong'o as royal spy Nakia, Danai Gurira as fierce warrior Okoye, and Letitia Wright as exuberant tech-wizard Shuri. More often than not it's this trio who make the sound decisions, save the hero and kick some serious arse. Credit to Coogler and his crew for successfully weaving in so much African culture too. The stunning production design and costuming combines traditional African symbology with the high-tech world, whilst the score is a low-key fusion of hip-hop, customary African tunes and standard orchestral overtones. Its social and political commentary gives Black Panther a pertinence and edge most MCU flicks don't have, but as an action blockbuster it's merely mid-tier Marvel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Gee....,"The high rating and the outrageous box office would be definitely a myth to me, just like the American voters would vote an ego maniac into the White House. Neither my point of view nor the way of my reasoning is on the main stream political correct path.I've contributed a review to imdb several days ago, but obviously it didn't pass the censorship, so here again, I'd try to give a review with more kind words to this film. I have to say it again, this film actually sucks big time, poor script, poor acting, the overly messy background paintings with the poor CGI effect, making this film like a rush job to meet the release date. The scenarios also feel contradictory enough since futuristic tech somehow only belongs to a few, the traditional weaponries, such as spears, axes, knives and fist are still the main fighting tools used. There's only one flying machine and the tribal council and the council members sitting around to have a meeting looked more like what we've often seen in ""Star War"". Why the leading character got to put on the weird WWE mask before facing or dealing with any new situation? Does it mean the mask would give him some super(natural) power? But even this guy put it on, he still looked very deadbeat tired and emotionless. There's no showing of any passion or even enthusiasm from him at all, even the fighting for his dominance at the big Fall in front of his tribe, he still look half-hearted tired without energy; maybe because he didn't wear his mask?

Not the Best Superhero Origin Movie Marvel Had Produced,"I was actually hoping to see a story of how T'Challa from his childhood could became the Black Panther. But it was not the case. And this was not a conventional Marvel movies either as usually origin story was made first before the superhero appeared in other movies. Regardless though, the story was made a bit short and went straight to the time when T'Challa would be made king. Plus the how he came to know Everett Ross was not shown which made me felt the movie was not too complete as an origin story.Other than those minor shortcomings that I personally felt, the movie definitely had some good moments. The action sequence in Korea plus the climax scene was awesome. The special effects (apart from few brief ""a bit obvious"" computerized scenes of Wakanda in the background during the time T'Challa was going to be crowned king) were very good. And there were also a bit of funny moments which involved Shuri plus surprisingly from M'Baku (Winston Duke).I would really advise you to be fully concentrated from the start to understand better on the earlier parts. To my personal opinion, the movie developed to be more interesting when the villains began to appear and the fights started.I get the appeal of this movie to critics due to its rather complex character development of T'Challa plus the appearance/representation of the African people in a world where third world country were still looked down. I myself as a simple minded movie audience preferred a more intense superhero movie, which I thought I did not really get in here. Therefore, even if the movie was hailed as one of the best in Marvel Cinematic Universe, I personally did not feel that. It may be good, but certainly not the best. Again this does not mean the movie was bad at all, even my wife was able to truly enjoy it. But as I felt it was not the best superhero origin movie & the fact that the action sequence were not too much, I still prefer other such MCU movies like the first Iron Man, Ant-Man or Captain America. Oh another thing, there was not a lot of surprises here, even 1 or 2 supposed surprising moments could have been guessed by my wife and I.As usual, there would be end credit scene which was having 2 of them in this movie. So wait till the very end to make sure you see them. In conclusion, my personal view is that this movie was probably a little bit over-hyped.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Disappointing,"Black Panther is one of the most over-hyped disappointing movies of the year so far. Just like The Last Jedi this move flops in many key departments making Disney's cash cow a boring uninteresting standard run of the mill Marvel movie. Before I dive in there is some good things about this movie like the villian. Michael B Jordan does a wonderful job making his character, Erik Killmonger, a sympathetic villain and easily the best part of the movie. Anyways my first problem with movie are how generic just because it is about an Africa does not make it deep. The main character is really just your standard superhero there is not much to him which weighs down the movie since we spend most of our with him. Most of the side character are not fleshed out at all and really do not feel anything for them when they are in danger. Another bad thing is the action scenes they just look to fake. Whenever an action scene happens Black Panther is Cgied and so are most of the backgrounds making them really dull and not entertaining. The only good part of the film the villain is given little screen time when he is easily the best part of the film. Even though the movie does a good job fleshing out his motivations I wish he was given more screen time so we did not have to deal with the other characters. The movie also tries to weigh in on politics without doing anything thought provoking or powerful.

Worst of the MCU movies over the last 10 years,"I went into this movie not having seen the trailers and not expecting much, which I find generally is the best way to fully enjoy a movie, sadly this movie delivered on my expectations.
A pretty generic storyline, stretched to over 2 hours and missing any real depth. I thought Ant-Man was quite weak for a Marvel movie, but its humour saved it, this one however was ever weaker and just not funny at all. If this is the standard of MCU movies to come, I think they best just give up now.
It isn't terrible, but if people keep praising things that aren't good, all because they believe it stands for something else, then we will keep getting sub-standard productions.

"Of enormous cultural importance, but far away from being the masterpiece it is claimed to be","""Black Panther"" is a 2018 comic book adaptation directed by Ryan Coogler starring Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan.
‚ö™
All in all, the most exotic entry into the gigantic Marvel Cinematic Universe exclaims a powerful battle cry that announces probably one of the most important films of the franchise of superhero films, as it finally establishes a hero that properly represents the black community and gives them someone who they can look up to, but regardless of the enormous social significance, it sadly suffers from a formulaic, predictable and mediocre story that doesn't add anything to the genre or is worth being called outstanding or innovative, and neither did it deserve any of its Academy Award nominations. After hearing about the devastating news about the passing of Chadwick Boseman, my best friend and I decided to honour the influential actor by watching the first solo adventure of the comic book character he made come to life. To me it was a first-time watch, and I only have heard about the usual things, such as the surprising Oscar nominations. As already mentioned above, I can see the importance of this film as form of social statement, but as a film itself, I wouldn't call it outstanding. It is the usual MCU quality, and that is not a terrible thing at all. It just isn't as outstanding as it is made out to be. One of the greatest factors is undoubtedly the film's stylish blend of the African wilderness and futuristic environment, as it just looks great and creates the atmosphere in the first place. Also, the idea of the different tribes in the same country was somewhat fascinating, but other than that it suffers from the typical comic book film flaws. In a story that shares a striking resemblance with the second outing of the ""Iron Man"" films, villain Erik Killmonger is both interesting yet predictable and his potential not fully realised. Aside from the fact that he was more right than wrong, he was too underused and wasted in terms of what he could have been. In the end, the film assembled a decent cast (of which no one really acts outstandingly, though) and became a production that is more eminent as a political statement, rather than as a cinematic achievement. The nominations for the technical categories might have been deserved (well, at least it wasn't nominated for the CGI, cause that was terrible PS2 game quality at its best), but the nomination for Best Picture is nothing short of an insult to comic book adaptations that haven't received this recognition but were tremendously better than this (""The Dark Knight"", ""Logan"", to name a few). I don't want to say that it was a terrible film at all, quite the contrary. It is the usual dose of Marvel fun. Black Panther has already become a necessary icon. I just don't think that it is the remarkable cinematic achievement it is treated as. Nevertheless, I hope you are going to rest in power, King T'Challa.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There are three possibilities. 1) The complainers have never seen another Marvel Movie. 2) They aren't perceptive enough to recognize politics in most movies or 3) their racism is showing.This was the best superhero movie I've seen and I've seen almost all of them. It had an origin story with roots that run deep into a rich mythology. It wove in a contemporary and relevant theme and the players, hero and villain alike were human in the best and worst ways.The writing was solid and thoughtful. Superhero movies so often fall to employing A deus ex machina in the end or otherwise insult the audiences' intelligence. Black Panther did neither.

Wakanda is the new Asgard,"With Disney setting the ground rules, we now know that Captain America gets the adult themes, leaving Black Panther and the others to tow the family with it. Unfortunately, one of the villains from the backstory isn't really quite Disney, so the film mixes a Bond lack of sentimentality at the beginning before going full Lion King at the end. The political points do hit home properly, but don't stay with you.The design and look of the film was as spectacular as sold, and mostly everything makes sense. It is this that will keep Black Panther going. There was a certain elan, which is missing from many other Marvel works. The afrofuturism provides an ever present thematic anchor.The film follows the 'first in franschise' template that states you must see lots of Wakanda and its denizens. Yet when it is slightly mysterious it is much better. Consequenly too much time is spent with the royal family and it feels like Thor in Asgard. The film was strongest away from there.At the end you can feel that this film was carefully guided down a safe path to protect it, but it could have done with less of that. Character development suffered because the Avengers gets all the good dialogue work. The final fight was the usual weakly choreographed fudge, a decades old format now. And the Black Panther is as strong in his mask as he is lightweight without it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meh - pretty flipping average,"Disappointing. Just another superhero film but with a strangely realized African spin.I could not quite get over how the Wakandan culture made no sense at all. They somehow became a super advanced country courtesy of finding Vibranium yet didn't get around to ever working out how to develop a democracy or proper legal system but rather having totalitarian regimes ruled by Kings who are chosen on their ability to physically fight each other - i.e. stone age tribe stuff. And when they get injured there's no sign of the super-duper technology but rather they're reaching for some healing plant or other. It's like you discovered some primitive tribe out in the depths of the Amazon rainforest and found they happened to have iPhones. Weird.I can't work out if it's politically correct garbage or racist garbage. Are we being shown that black African cultures could be super advanced or being shown that even if they were, they'd still be acting like primitive tribes - which by the way, they're not even now.All that aside, I found much of the acting pretty awful and the rest of the plot and effects just bog standard.Overall very average.

Black Panther (2018),"I was actually quite surprised to see the immense hype surrounding this film. Part of me was like, yes its a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so it'll be big. The other part was like wow this is blowing away the box office and is quite the phenomenon. The final stop before Avengers: Infinity Wars so of course I was ready for it. The introduction of Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War was one of the highlights of a super hero studded action blast. Overall, I quite liked what I saw here. Its not mind blowing and nowhere near the best the MCU has had to offer, but its a welcome addition to the Universe and is a good vehicle stand alone for a superhero who deserves it.The film takes place slightly after the death of T'Chaka, and T'Challa (his son) becoming the new King of Wakanda and becoming the new Black Panther. Wakanda is a nation that seems third world to outsiders but the nation is actually thriving in science and technology because of its abundance of vibranium. However, outside forces are made aware of this and T'Challa's throne and kingship is challenged. The film has an absolutely wonderful cast at its helm. Boseman, Jordan, Nyong'o, Kaluuya, to name a few.Visually, I think this film is on par with the best Marvel has to offer. The futuristic and scenic display of Wakanda just pop on to the screen. Boseman does well as a soft spoken yet unmistakable leader of his kingdom. I really like the Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler collaboration and it works once again here. Killmonger is a good villain and its easy to rate him highly among the other MCU villains we have seen. Letitia Wright is also a real highlight of the film and likely has a bright future ahead of her.Something else that really sticks out for me is the costume design in the film. Black Panther probably has the sleekest and best looking suit in the Marvel film universe. Add to that the suits capabilities. That whole absorb kinetic energy only to redeliver it moments later onto foes is so cool. A lot of the lore of what is capable in Wakanda with vibranium is really eye catching and does well to add to the mystique of the nation.Some of the film feels formulaic though. Also, there aren't many gripping shocking moments, as the films plot unfolds into a predictable place. The action set pieces are quite nice, although the final battle is a tad bit disappointing. The mix of traditional African music and modern hip hop for the soundtrack/score was a bit off putting as well. I don't have that many complaints about the film but its also missing a bit of the awe factor that other films like Thor: Ragnarok and Civil War were able to bring.All in all, I'm glad a lot of people have been praising Black Panther and have felt really inspired by an African hero. I have to say though I think its not in that upper echelon of Marvel films, but is still quite a respectable entry into the Universe. I'm ready to see Black Panther and his Wakandan allies in the Infinity Wars. Ryan Coogler is officially three for three in solid films.

"I personally loved this movie! Lovely, vibrant addition to the MCU.","After nearly two years since Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther leaps onto the scene and gets his own movie; and what a great surprise this movie was for me.
Marvel's movies have gotten a little derivative for some, and I think Black Panther is something of a multicultural response to that criticism: the movie evokes The Lion King, Skyfall, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Thor and Wonder Woman while creating an identity of its own; the panther is no Batman clone I can assure you of that.Ryan Coogler writes, co-produces and directs the film with surprising ease and boy this man knows how to infuse style into franchised movies; we've got the first blaxploitation superhero movie of the age, and it has A LOT to say about war, entitlement, morality, political (& cultural) unity and feminism. This movie is a broadly appealing triumph of genre filmmaking with culturally distinct aesthetics that are otherwise outside the typical Western mainstream. African-American filmmaking got a tonne of coverage in the 70s, and it looks like that with the likes of Black Panther and Get Out, filmmaking made by, and centered around, black people is making a long overdue comeback into the modern mainstream. With Hollywood stars like Forest Whitaker and Lupita Nyong'o gracing Black Panther it's amazing that there are directors like Coogler are at long-last getting into the blockbuster scene.I love this film; it's a global semi-political-conspiracy thriller that takes place in Africa, South Korea and the United States and utilises those locations as beautifully as any of the very best James Bond films.Black Panther is a must-see of the highest order, and good job on MARVEL for making all of this possible!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A well executed,"Black Panther is another not only MCU triumph, but a Comic book movie triumph. Chadwick Boseman give live to T'Challa and The Black Panther. He is yet another example of the amazing choice for casting lead MCU roles. The rest of the cast shines in every moment, from the main support cast to the little roles and cameos. Michael B. Jordan is as Killmonger is one of the best MCU and Comic book movies villains of all time. His motives are clear and relatable. He is used in the right way and where he is needed to. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright as the main women of the film execute their roles in an spectacular way. They are selfaware, bold in ther choices and fun to watch. It was very pleasing to see that Freeman get a more deep role through the movie than just a short cameo. Andy Serkis made Klaw crazy and unpredictable, and a very good second villain for the movie.But one of the most terrific things in the movie is the representation of Wakanda. It looks and feels alive. Every shot is an art. Accompanied by the soundtrack it increase the richness of Wakanda and its mythology.The movie only flaw is that it doesn't have much of a turning points. It's pretty straight forward. Maybe there are one or two, but not on the level, let say of Civil War or Thor Ragnarok. However this doesn't hinder the great story of the movie and its narrative. There is some noticeable at the 3rd act, but it's doesn't take you away from the action in any way.Black Panther is another solid entry for the MCU. It feels different and for the most of it's parts self contained(for a 18th MCU movie). We can hope to see the greatness of T'Challa yet again in Infinity War.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Africa meets high technology,"Dear readers, Black Panther is here to remove all your prejudices about Africa and racism that counters the Africans, eventhough the word ""black"" here is not representing African continent, but the power of hero, like a Panther, whose the color is black. So, the Black Panther movie is not just about a hero, but also politics among nations. The term hero is because the source of Black Panther energy is made only for heroes and the term of politic is main of whole story plot. It is about a new King replaces former King, but the former King had some mistakes on the past, so that the new King must remove and heal the wound of the nations, but in the same time, he must also take sacrifices to do the right thing for protecting Wakanda people. That's why the tagline ""Wakanda forever"" becomes viral and now everybody wants to do tourism in Africa because the landscape is so beautiful and the Director could mixed up the African continent with highly technology, as similar as other sci-fi movies. The plot also contents the girl power; because the highest military commander of Wakanda is a woman and all women had their essential parts for the development of the movie character. Some of wardrobe of women look like Xena the warrior princesses, that is compatible with wardrobe of the men that is more modern. The story is easygoing, not to hard, because the reverse memories are only in some scenes, so that the other scenes are just going forward. We hope that there will be Black Panther 2!! :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Unfortunate piece of cheap propaganda,"The movie is clearly trying to present an alternative to the classic white male super-hero movies/characters. A very laudable idea, but the implementation is so bad that it has the opposite effect. Furthermore, it focus so much in the racial topic that at some points it is almost racist with continuous stereotypes about black people being in a given way. If the director would be a white person, I would sue him for some of the things in the movie (black people acting like monkeys, jokes of them eating people, etc.). In this sense, if someone is interested in good movies that present strong characters from African background I rather recommend ""Hidden Figures"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (sic.).That regarding the social topics that the movie was supposed to cover. But that's not all.The scrip is rubbish. After 5 minutes, one can imagine exactly what is going to happen. Most dialogues are such, that one knows the next sentence before the actor/actress has opened his/her mouth. The script is filled with cheap emotional sentences that seem taken from some fortune cookie.Most actors and actresses in the movie try to speak with some short of Nigerian/Kenyan accent and the outcome is ridiculous. The movie even managed to produce a ridiculous character played by Martin Freeman.The special effects of the movie are rather disappointing. Specially after movies like ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and similar ones, I expected at least the minimum ""Marvel"" quality standards regarding special effects.The soundtrack was also rather disappointing.One good thing in the movie were some of the action scenes. The fighting choreographies are quite good. Also the car chases (surprise!) are pretty decent.Another good point about the movie, is that if you happen to watch it with a funny group of friends then you might have ""cheap jokes"" for a month.

"Discount the hype, discover a film","For far too long, Marvel Studios' PR department has been waging a sustained assault on us patrons' psyche with over-the-top promotional material, ranging from comic conventions, merchandising, endless trailers/previews and cultural references. Whoever is heading that unit needs to take a vacation, along with the staff. Immediately. This is a serious request.Because what we have been led to believe is Black Panther is the best superhero film ever made on the legendary African warrior.This film is nothing of the kind. Instead, it is a compelling and competent drama of greed, loyalty, vengeance, and social standing. Other reviewers have pointed out that this film is quite overrated and not worthy of the hype. To be very honest, that was my feeling as soon as the credits rolled. It was a few minutes later that my appreciation of the film's tone and import started to change. This film is not about a fictional kingdom or a mysterious metal or other tangible things. It is more a study of who we are as a human race and where we stand today.I will try not to spoil the film for others. There are numerous scenes where characters wrestle with their inner conscience, confront a dilemma or two, and balance critical decisions with consequences. These scenes are not hoisted out of reality, we experience moments like these ourselves. Circumstances can make past decisions look outdated and wrong, even. At the same time, embracing change a little too quickly has pitfalls as well. There is a line said by a male character, which goes thus: ""It is tough for a good man to be a leader"". And it is true. Not everyone is born a leader. People learn and evolve over time, dealing with situations that sometimes are beyond their control. And by presenting those situations, the filmmakers have chosen a path that can be a little underwhelming to viewers at first, but relatable to us in some ways. I would even go as far as to say the overall theme of this film is more about what we are willing to do to protect who or what defines us without losing sight of what unites us all. It does sound serious, but the film manages to tackle these topics. Not expertly, but in a reasonably convincing fashion.The cast is near-perfect. While Chadwick Boseman could have done better by adding a little spark to his T'Challa, he has an extraordinary screen presence in the guise of the titular hero. A simultaneous ninja-statesman, his brand of aggression, without any outward weapons, is ferocious and decisive. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are excellent as General Okoye and War Dog Nakia respectively. Their fight sequences are superbly choreographed, along with those of the others. Michael B Jordan's acting chops are legit, he exudes menace and power as Killmonger. Daniel Kaluuya is a strong addition to an already-impressive line-up. But I was most impressed by Letitia Wright as Princess Shuri, the feisty younger sibling of the King. A firebrand techno-genius who can handle a skirmish quite capably, some of her inventions make Iron Man's creations pale in comparison. I expect to see more of her in future installments, if the post-credits scene is anything to go by. Seasoned veterans like Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, John Kani, and Sterling K Brown support the main cast with their renowned expertise. And not for the first time, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis' scenes together are a delight to watch. While Freeman does provide some comic relief, it is also refreshing to see him get actively involved and bring his own skills to the table.As for the crew, one important point first: bear in mind, the director is a relative newcomer in the competitive world of big-budget superhero franchises. I have not seen Fruitvale Station or Creed yet, but Ryan Coogler had a lot on his plate when entrusted with the enviable task of directing this highly-anticipated venture. He delivers a really watchable film, even if some adrenaline junkies might complain that the action sequences are few and far between. By choosing to focus on drama and intrigue instead of fast-paced, mind-numbing action (my number one reason for hating Avengers: Age of Ultron), Coogler makes a calculated move to pose questions about ourselves. His crew back him up admirably, whether it is Rachel Morrison with the camera (some of the wide-angle shots were gorgeous), special effects, or music. The production design is top-notch, the sweeping, high-tech interiors of Wakanda contrasting rather charmingly with the rustic, almost-idyllic outdoors. At just a touch over 2 hours long, the pace is neither too rushed nor sluggish.My sincere advice to those who have not seen this film yet: if possible, erase the sky-high expectations caused by Marvel's hype-machine and watch for what it really is. You will probably enjoy it more.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent,"This movie was heavy on battle and action scenes and had an ok plot, and could have used more in that area.

Okay movie but completely overrated,"I personally feel this movie is really forgettable and boring. Yeah, the story is fine and harmless but after watching the movie, you will probably forget what happens in most of it. I like that the movie is more serious compared to other marvel movies ut the few jokes that it has, dont work for me at all. Yes, the villain is good, has good motivations and is an actual threat, but besides him and Black Panther, I dont really like any of the side characters. I find this movie very average and to see that it created such a hype and was praised everywhere makes me think that people only say they liked it while they find it also to be average because if they didnt though that they would be cancelled or something.

Politically Charged and Highly Entertaining!,"I am very happy that director Ryan Coogler does not hide his politics in this movie. ""Black Panther"" celebrates African culture, Pan-Africanism, and Black Power with stunning visuals and excellent fight scenes. I especially enjoyed seeing African-American women portrayed as highly intelligent and strong. Almost anyone who loved the female warriors in ""Wonder Woman"" will really enjoy the fierce African-American female warriors in this film. I also like that the film does not reduce the fictional Wakanda to an African utopia. ""Black Panther"" shows intertribal conflict and violence.Overall, Black Panther is a highly entertaining and somewhat politically ""woke"" film. I do not know if typical Marvel comic books fans will appreciate the movie's very visible political agenda. I do know that the movie has broken box office records and that Hollywood executives worship profits. ""Black Panther"" appears to become a highly profitable venture for Disney. Perhaps this movie's success will prompt Disney to make and distribute more movies that feature African-Americans and other people of color as superheroes. ""Black Panther"" demonstrates that highly political comic book adaptations can be very profitable. I think that is a very good thing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Fresh, bold, exciting and cool!","Due to the recent over saturation of the superhero genre, most of us have developed a fatigue to these movies by now and are tired of seeing the same old thing rehashed over and over again. 
This was my biggest concern walking into this movie, so I kept my expectations low even throughout all the praise that Black Panther has been getting. I didn't wanna see the same story for the 19th time.Well, may you rest at peace because Black Panther is NOT that, it's an exciting, fresh take on all the tropes that we are so bored of. I would even go as far to say that it may be the most memorable and highest quality film Marvel has produced since Civil War. Sure, Doctor Strange was visually cool, Guardians was okay, Spiderman was better than other Spidermans and Thor was fun, but Black Panther stands out from the crowd. For the most part, it solves my biggest problem that 99% of superhero films struggle with, which is pointless and weak villains. The movie starts off with (super minor spoilers?) it's secondary villain, who is a familiar and exciting character that I really enjoy seeing on screen - Ulysses Klaue. He's fun, energetic, crazy, unpredictable and cool. But later as the movie is developing, a new brand of Marvel villain emerges, Killmonger. He has everything that modern villains lack - moral dilemma, comprehensive motivation, solid plan. You understand him and you sympathise with his reasoning, understanding why he has to do what he's doing. It's not your typical pure overpowered evil forces from outer space here to conquer for no reason. It's a human who wants to fix the world and do something right, someone who believes that they are doing good.Also, I enjoyed that the conflict of the movie was scaled (for the most part) and we didn't see any ""world ending"" implications or over the top CGI laser spewing magic boss battles (that look more like a video game cutscene than a movie, I'm looking at you Justice League). Both Black Panther and Killmonger were equally matched. Nobody was overpowered. The stakes were set at the exact right level, which gives me really high hopes for the upcoming Avengers movie. I don't know if this movie necessarily will withstand the test of time but what I know for sure that I really enjoyed it. In fact, it's a great movie that could be watched as a stand-alone film outside of the MCU, that doesn't require previous knowledge of comic book lore.From a cinematic standpoint, I really enjoyed that this movie mashes so many of the familiar things that you know and love and puts them in one movie and NAILS it. It doesn't feel forced but you feel the genuine love and care that was there behind scenes. You can tell that this was a movie made by people who like movies. There are moments where it feels like it could be a scene from the universes like James Bond, Fast and the Furious, Lion King, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and a million other things and it feels good. It was an awesome and epic ride that made me feel like a kid again.Other than a few cheesy jokes that felt a little bit out of place √† la ""hey there fellow kids"", there is really nothing to nitpick. 
I have to applaud literally every single department that's worked on this movie - the cinematography, the special effects, the set design, costumes, music, sound design, acting, etc, all of it was top notch.Overal, fantastic watch that's worth going to the theatre for. 
Also, for those who are concerned that this is a liberal aimed progressive movie that's gonna shove ""social justice warrior"" things down your throat? You're just plain wrong. It doesn't feel forced at all, in fact, it felt more natural than a LOT of movies that are coming out these days.P/SBetter than Wonder Woman, which I also enjoyed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Well done to the guys who marketed the movie.Black Panther tells the story of the secret African society the Wakanda which is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world. T Challa (the Black Panther) is the heir to the throne and the film focuses on the challenges he faces. The plot is a bit clunky at times, but the film is always watchable.

Black Panther - A must watch movie for everyone,"Hey all, with Avengers Infinity Wars is around the corner Black Panther is roaring at the box office worldwide. You can't miss this extravaganza, because if you do so then actually you are missing an art film which is crafted so well that each frame is splendid. Since release, people are talking about this movie and already broke some opening weekend collections at the box office surpassing major superhero/action films.From the start to the last, every scene is scripted well in a manner that you will definitely realize how a king should be. It took 10 years & 17 movies to bring this connection between characters especially the king T'Challa aka Black Panther. Last you saw him in Captain America Civil War which made everyone want this character more and led this epic movie to be a success.The movie is all about a fictional nation Wakanda (in South Africa) and element Vibranium (fictional). The story revolves around T'Challa his family, foes and loved ones where Politics is much more highlighted. The strong bond between T'Challa & Shuri is really appreciable which is rarely seen in any movies. The tech used by Wakanda is far more ahead than any of Tony's techs. The leader of Special forces/chief security head of the king is loyal to the kingdom. In between, you may feel that you are seeing Hollywood version of Kattappa (Baahubali).Movie lags in between which is correct because Director Ryan Coogler wants the audience to understand the character very well which they can later connect him with other members of the Avengers team. He is not only the King of Wakanda but also the King of MCU and he deserves the respect. Because many questions will be answered at the end and we can expect some blast in Avengers Infinity Wars. Actions sequences are for more well choreographed. Wakanda kingdom, people, traditions etc are visualized beautifully. Official movie runtime is 130 minutes which is honestly acceptable for this wonderful movie. Many things to be said, but this much is enough and rest you can experience at nearby theatres.Tony Stark is definitely going to be jealous of him.

One Of Marvel's Best,"I just scrolled though a slew of 1 and 2 star reviews on this site and I am wondering if the people who left those negative reviews were watching the same movie I have watched many times and thoroughly enjoyed again tonight. Black Panther is one of the best films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What were they seeing that I did not? I see excellent plot-line, action and special effects, and a message of hope for Wakandans working towards world peace and mutual cooperation with many nations towards world peace. It seemed they were ready to join the 21st century by sharing their technology to make the word a better place.This is the least boring I have seen in years, Chakwick Boseman who was fighting cancer during the filming put in an excellent performance as T'Challla, and I will miss him in the next Black Panther film. Lupita Nyongo was excellent as Nakia, and I loved Letitia Wright as little sister Shuri, with all those fascinating gadgets and gizmos.I admit there were some slow scenes in Korea with Klaue, the villain and setting up with Killmonger for later scenes. That's the only negative thing I can think of without giving spoilers.I love this movie. Don't pay any attention to the naysayers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great Movie, but it's Not THAT Great","I have been having a sort of ""burn out"" with superhero films lately, so I wasn't originally planning to see Black Panther at all. However, I kept hearing how great and awesome this ""masterpiece"" was, so I decided I would go see it (and at this point, it really is just something that's expected, which is fine). So, I went in with marvelous expectations (aside from some criticisms I had heard beforehand), and... how was it?
Well, let me just say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly. It was WAY better than I thought it was going to be, and it was really fun to watch. All of the performances are generally great (except for a few which I'll get in to), and the plot is good as well. There are some issues, however, that bring the movie down, which I'll go into spoiler free at first. Some of the special effects are just downright bad (there are bits where you can actually tell the person is standing in front of a green screen), and there is dialogue that is spoken that just seems... off. I don't know, it just seems misplaced and weird-sounding. Also, it is hard to ignore the fact that yes, the plot is good, it is certainly a Marvel plot, if you know what I mean.
My biggest issue with the movie, and the one that brings it down so much, is that there is a side plot that is completely unnecessary, and completely ruins the tone of the film. Basically, the only reason this side plot exists is to add a little more to the end, and to give the main characters a little more motivation. That's it.
In conclusion, check this out if you want a fun superhero movie, that's better than a lot of recent ones, but also has a few problems (7/10).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How does this movie have a lower score than Ragnarok!?,"I'm gonna have to go with the critics on this on this one, Black Panther was amazing! It wasn't completely flawless, but I will still give it a 10 star rating to balance the ratings a bit more. Honestly, I feel like the 1 star ratings are from people that didn't want to like the film from the start. There are barely any comedic jokes, the CGI was good (no CGI is absolutely perfect), the storyline was fantastic and the scenery was majestic. For those who were disappointed about the movie being boring, you shouldn't have expected a ton of action. Black Panther ORIGIN story is about his new responsibility, his ideals and Wakanda. He can go kick butt in the next Avengers film. Thoroughly enjoyed it and don't understand some hate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The king of Marvel Universe ..?,"The movie itself is fine, well-made, but nothing out of the ordinary. Marvel fans will love this one, since Black Panther is a well-developed character. Plus, the villain got more personal screen time, so for me it's one of the best villain of the MCU made thus far.The overload of jokes was toned down for this movie, which i think its a really good for two reasons: It fits the moral of the story, and previous marvel movies were full-on comedies, with not so great humor.So Marvel fan will have a blast, and im sure this movie will pick a large audience, not only Marvel Fans. It's a great action flick, with a great soundtrack too ! It's just not different from what you have already seen.It's good, go see it if you are interested, otherwise I don't think you will enjoy it, and will be rather disapointed with all the good reviews its getting (87/100 on metacritic).

A combination of a political character study and a superhero extravaganza that doesn't always mix.,"Black Panther is the newest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role from Captain America Civil War. The rest of the picture also features an great ensemble of well known actors. These include Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. All of whom give serviceable performances. After the events of Civil War, T'Challa (Boseman) returns to his home Wakanda, a land that is deeply hidden within the African forest. Wakanda has been hidden from the majority of the world for centuries, Challa has to make a choice when an unexpected enemy comes to take his place. Boseman plays Challa / Black Panther with a mixture of wisdom, patriotism but also a lack of experience when it comes to the world. This is a interesting combination that really pays off when T'Challa meets with the main villain of the film played by Michael B. Jordan. The idea of a advanced culture with innovative technology that remains hidden from the world is very interesting. The majority of people from Wakanda believe that this makes the world a better place. However when Killmonger shows up these ideas are challenged through his character. Killmonger is the best villain the MCU has had since Loki, this is because both T'Challa and Killmonger can learn a lot from each other. This aspect is easily the best thing about Black Panther, unfortunately the film only becomes compelling after we pass the first act. The first act consists of a generic superhero plot in which T'Challa and his team race after Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to capture him. This is important for the story in the long run but left me very emotionally empty. It also gives very little attention to Killmonger who only becomes interesting after the first hour. There is plenty of humour in Black Panther, the best jokes in the film came from Shuri (Letitia Wright) who plays the sister of T'Challa. She added plenty of self awareness that made myself and the all of the audience roar in the theatres. Unfortunately Black Panther also suffers from the same issues that Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 and Thor Ragnarok suffered from and that is the fact that jokes are implemented in the wrong scenes. Sometimes a scene is meant to be serious until a character cracks a joke killing the impact of the scene. The action scenes also let me down, most of the them were too cgi heavy and I would've prefered some more realistic stunt work (but that's personal taste), especially because the director's previous film Creed had one of the sleekest looking fight scenes of recent years. Many of the special effects in Wakanda also felt unfinished, the look itself were breathtaking. However there were many set pieces that felt incomplete and too cartoony. The costumes and music of the film is terrific though, they really give this exotic african feel, it makes the film a lot more authentic. After the first hour passed, I really enjoyed this picture. There were some minor gripes with special effects and tone, but for the most part I had a lot of fun with it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The fighting scene could have been better, but i dont even watch the fighting scene in movies, I typically just look at my phone till they are done. So i didn't mind. Will definitely see it twice!

Not the best Marvel movie - but still a watchable one!,"It is clearly not the best marvel movie but still a watchable one. I'll put down into small points listing the pros and cons of the film.1. Accent issues - it was quite hard to understand what the characters were saying. 
2. Acting - some characters were just funny when they said a dialogue. It could have been better for sure. Well, not as in all the characters were funny. Some of them did their part quite well. 
3. Impact - What I felt was the film did not have the right impact on the audience as they do in every marvel movie. This movie just felt unfinished. 
4. Story line - Well that is one thing I loved about the movie so much. The story was really great. It was far better than a lot of other superhero movies. If you are a marvel fan, you should watch this one to get to know Wakhanda and where the Black Panther comes from.Overall it was alright! Not a bad one. People definitely had a lot more expectations and it has just been overhyped that way. Don't listen to people who have been saying it is worst marvel movie or the best one.

Beyond Expectations!,"Long Live The King! Whatever I say about the movie will be a little. Definitely ""Black Panther"" takes its place as one of the strongest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cast is probably the best in a Marvel solo movie. ""Black Panther"" shows an unseen part of the MCU - Wakanda, their tribes, secrets and their way of life.Indeed, one of the strongest features of the film is the acting of everyone in this movie. I can't say only one name, but Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Andy Serkis, Danai Gurira, Angela Basset, Letita Wright and Forest Whitaker are just some of the best characters in this movie.The story is really strong, which makes the movie so good. Michael B. Jordan played the role of Erik Killmonger brutally. After the movie ends, the villain gets stuck in your mind, just because you understand his motivation and is presented perfectly, in two words ""memorable villain"". If you have not become Chadwick Boseman's fan in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" it's inevitable now! T'Challla must lead his people, be king and hero at the same time, which is a heavy burden.Every scene between him and his sister Shuri is a pleasure. She is only 16 years old, but her intellect can be compared to that of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner.Special attention should be paid to every action scene. Movements and choreography are just unparalleled. You will make sure you see Black Panther, Killmonger and Okoye in action.The colors in this movie are unique! The effects are great, except in some in some places in the final battle.The soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar is great. After the end of the movie, you will want to listen the songs of the album.The movie introduces us the story of Wakanda in depth and gives us many new characters, all of whom are great.In the future, ""Black Panther"" will be one of the often watched Marvel movies, as T'Challa is a person who easily gains the audience's sympathy, and you will not have passion to see him in ""Avengers: Infinity War"".In conclusion, if you want an amazing experience, watch the movie as soon as possible!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meh,"I was really hyped for this movie. The trailers looked amazing. Unfortunately, the action scenes in the trailer are, pretty much, the action scenes in the movie. For more than 2 hours, I sat through a live action Lion King without the humor or the cheery songs. The movie is certainly beautiful to look at - the graphics are stunning - except for the last fight scene that doesn't even look as good as many current video games.The actors are...fine. Their performance run the gamut from okay to good. That's it. Everyone seems to be angry or sad all the time. The humor in the movie comes from the leader of the outcast tribe and, of course, the great Andy Serkis, who seemed to be the only one enjoying his role.Frankly, the critics astound me. This movie was derivative and far too self-conscious. Unbelievable as it may seem, of the few negative reviews from professional critics I have read, the best is from Armond White. Do yourself a favor and read it.Ultimately, the measure of a good movie, for me at least, is how likely I would be to watch it again. Like Iron Man 2 and 3, I probably will never watch this movie again. Ever.In short, bland and derivative.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good, but not great","Marvel adheres to a tested recipe - ""If you've found a winning combination, stick to it."" They string high-budget action blockbusters one after another, maintaining the level with small variations. There are no masterpieces, but there are no failures either. Although I understand why they do it, personally, I don't like that approach, because all their movies follow same pattern and resemble each other. Without risk, there's no danger of failure, but there's no opportunity to make a really good movie either.""Black Panther"" is visually stunning, fast-paced and entertaining. The combination of tribal features and futuristic costumes and technology is in perfect balance and the landscapes of Wakanda are beautiful, while the action scenes are directed to leave you breathless. The acting is good, but the characters and the story itself could be much better developed. Rather than to provide a good script, and then take advantage of big budgets and modern technology to make this story as impressive as possible, I think that Marvel films are based solely on the visual spectacle, leaving the story in the background.I watched the movie in the theater and I'm not sorry, I enjoyed it and had a good time.

Marvel-lous,"When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.Not that in the comic book film universe, the going has got tough for Marvel due to DC Comics. We all know how Justice League ended up. The going has got tough for Marvel because of Marvel itself. Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok in their own way set the new gold standards. Also, as new characters enter the MCU, the treatment needs to change too. A comic book blockbuster today needs to be more than just a comic book blockbuster- and that is what makes Black Panther great. With gracious heroes, quipping villains, rocking car chases and fantastic weapons, it is an out and out enjoyable comic book blockbuster for sure. Elements of espionage sagas with homage to 007 Bond, paired with Afro futurist themes along with some Shakespearean twists gives the movie it's own flavor.Marvel movies are increasingly getting interlinked, so for someone who has missed Civil War, there is a lot to catch up. For someone who hasn't, we jump straight into Black Panther roots and origins.""Ulysses Klaue: Tell me something. What do you know about Wakanda?
Everett K. Ross: It's a Third-World country. Textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.
Ulysses Klaue: All a front. Explorers have searched for it, called it ""El Dorado"". They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. I'm the only one who's seen it, and made it out alive.""Welcome to Wakanda- blessed with mountains of vibranium, it is the most advanced society in the world. Fearful of the world's reaction to it's vibranium reserves, its culture and people, for centuries Wakanda has hidden it's true progress from the rest of the world. So while the motto is not ""America First"", but it is ""Wakanda Forever"".While T'√áhalla wants to stay the path, there are others who feel Wakanda should share it's success with the rest of Africa, who have been brutalized by invasion, exploitation and colonization.""To be or not to be the savior of the oppressed world"" - this Shakespearean choice for the characters forms the crux of the story.The hunt for Ulysses Klaue sets in motion the plans of Erik Killmonger- an American mercenary wronged in the past by the Wakandan royal family, and scarred by his experiences in the real world. T'Challa will need to draw up on every ounce of strength, and all the friends he has to save Wakanda.Director Ryan Coogler is coming off Creed, and he delivers here too by crafting a movie that isn't about fighting gods and robots, or chasing aliens, but more about the rights to privilege. In Erik Killmonger, he has created a villain to whom at least half the audience will agree too. Wakandans have thrived while the rest of Africa has burned. Killmonger has a point.He has also assembled the finest set of black actors working today- Chadwick Boseman plays Black Panther with pathos, Lupita Nyong'o exudes radiance as Nakia, a covert agent, Michael B. Jordan plays Killmonger with feral intensity, Forest Whitaker plays Zuri, the royal shaman while Angela Bassett plays Ramona, the queen mother. The standout characters though are Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, and Okoyo, played by Danai Gurira. Said to be smarter than Tony Stark, Shuri is the Q to T'Challa's Bond, and goes about her role with vibrancy and style. Okoyo is the badass leader of T'Challa's bodyguards, stars in the action sequences and also delivers some of the funniest lines. And I especially loved Andy Serkis in front of the camera as a maniacal Klaue!Coogler has really soaked up the culture of the continent and let his imagination run wild. Wakanda is a riot of colors, steeped in spirituality and culture and because it was undisturbed by colonization - also a technological marvel. Is this what Africa could have been?Bottomline- Black Panther is not only a fun movie, it is also a very impactful movie. Marvel getting marvelous, really!

"I don't know if this is ""grand and revolutionary"", but Black Panther is a very entertaining movie","In this day and age, the studios are under a lot more pressure to represent different nationalities and backgrounds. Those that are asking for it are right; it's important for black children to have black role models as it is for LBGT individuals to have role models that are just like them. Many artists and directors want to adapt and give people something different, but they also understand that studios are still trying to make a profit. That's not to say an African-American lead can't draw an audience, but movie making is expensive, so they have to make sure that whatever they put on the screen can draw in all people of interest.In the case of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they've done well so far with bringing in black stars. We've got Samuel L. Jackson for Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie as Falcon from the Captain America films, and Don Cheadle as Rhodes from the Iron Man movies. One of the surprise popular characters to debut was Chadwick Boseman from Captain America: Civil War as the Black Panther. The character has not only led his own series in comics that's still running, but is the only African-based hero I'm aware of. Let's see how he does on his own in Black Panther.In the hidden country of Wakanda, it has created groundbreaking technology, thanks to it's source of a rare substance called vibranium that landed via comet thousands of years ago. Though much of it could have benefitted mankind, the leaders and previous kings have made the decision to isolate themselves from the world.After the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa (Played by Chadwick Boseman) is crowned king and reigning heir to the mantle of the Black Panther. It's revealed that along with the suit that's made from it, he gets his internal powers from vibranium.When he hears that a Wakanda artifact is being sold underground, he travels to Hong Kong along with his sister Shuri (played by Letitia Wright), his ex-lover and spy Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o), and proud warrior Okoye (played by Danai Gurira). Though they capture Ulysses Klaue (played by Andy Serkis), he's broken out, thanks to his boss Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Played by Michael B. Jordan). By the time T'Challa and his group return to Wakanda, Erik reveals his identity as a tribal son and challenges him for the throne. T'Challa loses, is thrown down a waterfall, and Erik gets ready to ship out much of the Wakanda technology to black markets. Will T'Challa manage to stop him?Many people have been touting Black Panther as a grand and revolutionary super hero story that different. While I don't know if I can call this different and revolutionary, Black Panther is a very entertaining movie regardless. It's clear that director Ryan Coogler (Creed) not only wanted to show a different hero, but a different world together. The two best elements to the movie are the side characters and the setting.When it comes to who the movie is following, it tries to give us a lot of characters...and it does work. I liked Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurria, Andy Serkis, and especially Letitia Wright. The winner here is Michael B. Jordan who plays one of the better Marvel villains. While he is physically powerful and intimidating, he also makes a compelling case for the mistakes that Wakanda has made by it's isolationist polices. While he isn't bad by any means, the least interesting character was the Black Panther himself. He does carry a royal energy of leadership; he doesn't seem to have that same struggle for mistakes of his countries history that I got from Michael B. Jordan. I think the script could have done better with that, and show him how he earns his mantle back. The movie does try to show out hero at his worst before he tries to fix everything, the story still succumbs to typical superhero tropes.Now having said that, what they do with Wakanda is really cool. This design reminded me of The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, in which things are very colorful and lively. It seems the overall goal was to create an African utopia and everything from the architecture to the costumes are great. I wish there was a video game to Black Panther, just so that I can get a better glimpse into this country and it's culture.I'll give this seven Black Panther helmets out of ten. In a large sea of superhero movies, and even within Marvel superhero stories, Black Panther manages to remain it's own unique thing. I had fun watching it and families will probably be pleased with it. Give it a watch and see it's powerful roar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Black Panther was created in 1966 at the height of the US Civil Rights movement.There are several areas that do not make sense.

Chadwick Boseman's regal portrayal of T'Challa, the king of Wakanda, is both powerful and charismatic, anchoring the film with a strong central performance. The film editing seamlessly blends traditional African culture with futuristic technology, creating a visually stunning and immersive world. Its strength lies in its message of identity, heritage, and the responsibility that comes with power. The music, composed by Ludwig G√∂ransson, adds a unique African flavor to the score, and the cinematography captures the vibrant landscapes of Wakanda.

Best Marvel Fils??? Really???,"IMO about half of Marvel Films are better than this one.What about IronMan, Avengers, Civil War, Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Spideman Homecoming..,?My 10yo is a huge Marvel Fan and just after the end the told me it was ok, he liked Ragnarok better and I tend to agree.I think its ok that BP doesn't need any other Avenger characters to appear. But at times I missed Tony Stark, I mean he would kill to have access to Wakanda's technology, and what about Captain America pledging for Buckys fate?The worst thing IMO is that this one doesn't fit at all with other Marvel movies. It may be an average solo film, but nothing else, very much like Wonder Woman.Even with all the action, there's really no sense of danger, its supposedly going worldwide but the threat never leaves wakanda.

Ragnarok went over the top on comedy, but here, its non existant, I think I only giggled with Stan Lee's cameo.

Good not great.,"When the film released it was praised as an exceptional film that does the African American community justice. Imo ONLY the character T'Challa does the community justice. A lot of the practical shots blending futuristic architecture with ancestral scenery were captivating. The script and plot are laser focused so the film moves seamlessly. It's technically good not bad. Where I think the film falls short is it's soundtrack, underwhelming action sequences, use of cgi and Michael B Jordan's overacting in some scenes. Hip hop as a score doesn't draw the same emotion as contemporary or Orchestral soundtracks and would've preferred hip hop being an addition to rather than a focus giving an amateurish feeling... and I love hip hop, but just not as a way to set tone. A cringeworthy scene is when Killmonger gets in the ambulance and makes out with his side chick. LOL and the cgi in almost all instances at no point garnished a realistic impression. Unlike the Whedon or Russo entries it felt like a cut and paste superhero flick. I can praise the film on presenting an Influential antagonist, strong performance by Chadwick, cinematography and the effective pacing. I will revisit this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very disappointing...,"This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...clich√© phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Slick and entertaining even if interesting elements are impacted by the superficial sheen of the bigger franchise,"This film was very well received and praised by critics on arrival. The cynic in me still believes that the social importance of the film means that many people were willing it to success even before seeing it. To be fair, the film is a good standalone entry in the Marvel universe of films, but at the same time it is still a film in the franchise - not some magically new type of beast. The high percentage of the cast who are black and positive characters is probably the most obvious thing highlighted by the critics, although it does seem like window dressing at times, with the African culture laid on thick on everything. Interestingly, the film reinforces negative images of African-Americans through the view characters from this specific group - not overly so, but enough to notice as it clashes with the main presentation.Outside of its value as social tool, to show studios yet again that they should not assume what they assume about their mass audience, the film itself is fun, lively and mostly interesting. The plot has good pace and nice developments, although it is not as morally murky as it could have been. Some of the cast do play to this aspect, but the film never really wants to be in a grey area so much as to have clear goodies and baddies. The action sequences are good and play out with the usual humor and high production standards. The cast is well led by Boseman, who has charisma and presence. He is very well supported by a deep cast - with Jordan in particular making a great 'villain'. Ironic in a film praised in America for being a positive challenge to the sort of 'OscarSoWhite' world of Hollywood, that so many of the cast are British but regardless so many people are good here with few weak links.In the end it is still a Marvel franchise film, and first and foremost it does what this needs and does it well. The social aspects are important, but not while you're watching it - which is fine because it is enjoyable and slick enough to hold the attention and be worth a look.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Predictable and More Bland Than Expected,"I was slightly let down by thia movie, my expectations weren't very high but I still expected more than this. I'm gonna start off on a high note with the positives. First of all this movie is largely very well paced, you can easily define each act of the movie which aided in storytelling. The characters were all quite enjoyable and fit there roles especially the titular character, Chadwick Boseman felt so natural and comefortable in T'Challa. Fun additions to the cast were Andy Serkis and Letita Wright. The film was shot very well, I enjoyed the cinematography and it featured more vibrant colours than I would've expected. Unfortunately where this movie loses it's steam is in the script, it consistentaly put the characters into positions which lead to a predictable story, there were so many things that I knew were gonna happen before they did, not too many twists and turns to keep things interesting. Another thing that bothered me was the unrealistic technology, it consumed most of the action sequences with, ""hey look at this cool thing"", tech played an important part in the script but the unbelievability of it just took me right out of the story. The dialogue was also very campy from time to time and not in a self aware kind of way. The character motivations don't always make sense, I felt the conflict wasn't properly resolved by the end. And the action scenes took a dive into ""lazy cgi punchfests"" so to speak, I thought we were over that, especially after the scathing reviews this film recieved. I'm honestly shook this film has such a high metascore, I really don't believe it's that good. The positives are there I just think it suffers from a fair bit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, Though A Tad Overrated","Black Panther is the latest MCU movie. After he appeared in Civil War, there was much hype for Black Panther getting his own solo film. After seeing it I think this is the best MCU movie since Civil War. Is it the best MCU movie? No. I feel like every time one of these comes out now everyone praises it as the best in the MCU. Critics said that about Thor Ragnarok when that came out. I liked that film, but really it was an okay film at best. Black Panther is definitely better than Ragnarok. I'd it's actually a genuinely good movie, but not without its faults.The general cliff notes plot is as follows. With his father dead, T'Challa/the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is now the king of his home country of Wakanda, the most advanced, and secluded, nation on Earth. However, our main villain Killmonger challenges the new king's reign and attempt to use Wakanda's advanced technology to dominate the world.First I'll delve into the positives. Firstly, I really like the Black Panther as a character. I was already impressed with him in Civil War, but I wanted to hold off judgement until he got his own movie. Now I can say Black Panther is my second favorite MCU character behind Captain America. The side characters were pretty decent too.The film has great cinematography as well. The majority of the film takes place in Africa/Wakanda and it looks fantastic. Not only that, but the film does a fairly good job delving into the culture of Wakanda and its inner workings, backstory, and political stances and issues.Most of the action was good and shot very well, with a couple exceptions, which I'll get into. I also like the style this film has, from its opening and closing aminations, to its score, to even way of using text and credits. You'll know what I mean when you see the film.Killmonger, in my opinion, is one of the better MCU villains, up there with Loki and Zemo. His goal is rather basic, but his motivations are understandable to where you can sympathize with him to a degree. Michael B. Jordan does a great job in the performance as well.The film is not perfect though, as I've stated. The movie has the same issues the Thor movies do. The scenes in Wakanda are great, but the scenes in our society, while not bad, don't measure up in comparison. While most of the action was good there were a couple underwhelming scenes. The opening action in particular was shot too dark and filmed with much shaky cam that it was hard to enjoy. The final fight between Black Panther and Killmonger was also too short and underwhelming.Lastly, the minor villain played by Andy Serkis I did not care for at all. Andy Serkis is a great actor, but this was definitely not one of his best performances. I don't blame Serkis, but more the lines and direction he was given.Overall, Black Panther is a very solid entry in the MCU. Is it the best like so many say it is? No. Is it revolutionary, like many claims? No. Nevertheless, it's still a good movie that's worth seeing if you're a fan of the MCU or just comic book or action movies in general.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

And I do not believe in the need of artistic films to be , in obvious and almost agressive manner, political manifesto. ""Black Panther"" has a virtue- the cast. In few cases - the performances. But its fundamental sin is the high ambition to impress its audience. And it does it. But not always inspired. It is an impressive film, no doubt. But, maybe writing the bad word, it is...too impressive. It is more an eccentric show than a reasonable film. Sure, it must be a blockbuster and I am happy for its succes to the young public. But, it could be better . Maybe because it has the right actors and the spider - story could be more reasonable.

More of the same fare from Marvel (Disney).,"I guess if you like the other typical Marvel material then I guess you'll like this.

""Here comes another PG13, CGI action sequence"".In terms of all of political hub-bub, I'm not really going to comment on that except to say I'm not sure why *anyone* is pretending like there has never been a movie starring a black dude before.

Entertaining But Very Flawed,"Black Panther presents wonderful world building and perfectly played characters and has a cultural significance that's impossible to ignore. However, the plot is wracked by common Marvel-brand movie problems and for some reason the CGI is incredibly lacking. The love interest plot could be removed to no detriment of the movie and tension is sorely lacking. There is no concern or worry regarding the characters throughout the whole story and the resolution feels basic. The characters push it along well, however, and still make eh viewing very enjoyable.The reason for a 6/10 is that I believe 5 is average, and everything above that should be earned. Black Panther's issues are the type it never had to have and were so obvious that minor adjustment could have fixed them. It seems as if the movie was rushed and a bit of the humour is painfully dated. I would still recommend this movie, particularly if you enjoy the MCU.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A epic, moving and exciting ride all the way!","Black Panther is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars a phenomonel cast that includes Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyongo, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and the list goes on. 
Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Prince T'Challa is about to be crowned king of Wakanda, but when a long buried secret is uncovered it threatens the country of Wakanda and the rest of the World! 
I really liked this film! And for a number of reasons. First of all this is a very well directed film made by the very talented director Ryan Coogler. The entire film feels original new and exciting thanks to his vision!
Whats also great about this is Wakanda it self. This beautiful land is so well realised on the screen. It serves as one of the most interesting locations in the MCU. 
What set Black Panther aside from the other Marvel films is it's great story that suprisingly tackles a lot of deep themes. 
All the actors are great in it, espescially Michal B. Jordan as the villain Killmongor. Killmongor is by far one of the best and most compelling MCU villains so far. His backstory and viewpoints are explored and you really get where he is comming from. However there was not quite enough of him. But whenever he is onscreen you are on the edge of your seat!
All these factors makes the film much more than just your average Marvel movie. It makes it into a film with a strong message and compelling characters. 
Black Panther is absolutely one of the best Marvel movies and highly recomended!

"A strong entry for marvel, which almost lives up to the hype","Prior to seeing BP, I read a lot about the movie and how great it was, a game changer, an event. I didn't think the movie could live up to this hype and felt a lot of the sentiment was probably down to what the movie signifies and stands for, rather than the quality of the movie itself.I was right I feel, but only just. The movie has a fairly straightforward solid plot. Its characters are quite well rounded. Its visuals are quite beautiful. But for each of these positives there is a negative underneath the surface,The plot itself is pretty light. there really isnt too much to it. And I think for a complicated villain- which is what they were trying to create, the plot, his motivations and more importantly the way he planned to execute those motivations was too simple.The well rounded characters are just too many really. You cant in a 2 hour movie really get to grips with 10 characters, who are all largely new to you. At times Boseman seemed on point- at other times, it just seemed that his deep contemplation had nothing behind it. Having a slightly longer run time- they could have used more time for a couple of moments of personal reflection. Or one or two more moments where Tchalla and Killmonger spoke alone.. to talk as intelligent people, with a mutual understanding and awareness. we got this, at the end. But for me it seemed to hard a shift. from the aggression of killmonger and the unwillingness of t'challa to really try to avoid the fight.. to now a moment of sympathy and empathy. i wanted to spend more time with killmonger, when was just him.. not giving orders, not forwarding the plan or plot. the supporting cast could have also had more time, but thats a more minor point.finally the visuals in terms of landscapes were beautiful. The country of wakanda which they created, was this amazing mix of tech and earth.. but the moment there were any fight scenes, you got the same shaky cam, too close, too blurred rubbish which is very popular in movies these days. The fact that the hero and villain are both cgi only made the action look more fake, and harder to make out.. in a way it reminded me of transformers and the awful fight rendering. you just dont feel there is actual weight/gravity.. it all looks quite doll like.The above being addressed, would have made this one of the great movies.. As it is, it is one of the great comic book movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Its a very good film, but don't believe the hype","Pros: The character of Tchalla is one of the best that I have had the pleasure of watching in the MCU. Along with the supporting cast, the actors performances throughout the whole film are very good and a lot of credit should go to the way in which they portray the hero's and villains in the movie, especially by the females in the film.
As much as I feel the second half of the film lacks a large amount content, the first half is superb. Brilliant set pieces, funny dialogue, even though one particular joke feels as though it is straight out of 2015, and a large amount of intrigue. 
I mention the action scenes, they are superb a lot of action and a lot of emotion behind them
Some of the music is fantastic to listen to, some of traditional African music played throughout the whole film fits really well with the premise and setting of the movie.Cons: The green screen creates some of the WORST backdrops I have ever seen in the film. Completely taking you out of what should be some very intense scenes.
I never feel as though there is a lot riding on the story. It is very simplistic and it appeared to me as though if Tchalla was not to overcome the conflict in the film, very little would happen. The world created would not be in a worse place than before, and that is a problem.
As much as I liked the traditional music, the forced trap beats and songs that are jammed into it feel as though it is simply their to relateable to it's teenage audience. Although in some cases it works, they are few and far between, with it often not fitting well within what is being portrayed on screen. More of the traditional music would have been a welcome change and some more suspenseful scores for the car chase scene would have worked a lot better. However, I would say go and listen to the album, that is very enjoyable.Conclusion: I came out of the theatre dissapointed with the movie. And even though I believe it is over-rated I now, after looking back on it, feel as though it is a very good film that is well worth watching. Despite the issues that people appear to be looking over it is a very enjoyable film.

Good just not great,"I enjoyed it more second-time round but it is overhyped. It is a good MCU film but nowhere near the best. There are two main problems with it:1. Although the villain is strong and has a good motive for his actions, this film falls into the classic Marvel plot of 'villain is in a similar suit to the hero; villain's suit looks more advanced; hero is knocked down; then eventually wins' - it's a bit old and generally Marvel are thankfully moving away from this rather dull story device but it's well and truly alive in this film.2. The women absoltuely steal the show! This is almost a good thing - how wonderful to see both black people and women portrayed as strong and smart and I don't think there was even an inkling of women just being there to be pretty or love interests. This is one of the best films I've ever seen with regards to female equality and portrayal. However, the movie's titular (male) character is almost irrelevant. Not to slate Chadwick Boseman's performance, he did a fine job, but the story would not really miss him. The women seem far stronger and more capable and don't particularly need him for anything. He has his own story but this film is about Shuri and Okoye and either one would probably make a better and more interesting hero.Nevertheless, this is worth seeing just don't believe the hype. It's a bit more Bond than MCU for the most part which is an interesting take so if you're looking for a mystical 007 adventure in Africa, Korea and London then you'll enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nailed It,"I've read many of the reviews already posted, and I'm really surprised of the wide range of opinions. I truly feel like some who are giving it a poor rating wanted to dislike it from the beginning. Having said that, I admit I was looking forward to this movie for sometime, but I wasn't expecting it to live up to the hype. 
I think this is one of the best Marvel movies they have ever made. Visually it was stunning. The action was top notch. But beyond all that, I thought the story was great and well written. Michael B. Jordan stole the show and was convincing in his anger and thirst for revenge. 
Overall, I loved it and thought that everyone involved did a great job. I'm sure I'll see it again in the theater and I'll probably buy it down the road.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Imperfect adaptation for the Black Panther.,"This is your typical superhero movie or worse because It was a little frustrating. The cinematography and the sci-fi part were okay, but other than that it was hackneyed scripts unluckily, the film fell short of expectation. Perhaps because of the hype, there were few good acting performances especially in the combat scenes but generally the movie didn't pull me in I find Michael B. Jordan character more fascinating than Chadwick Boseman however still average. The characters are not developing, and that's a snag. The filmmakers didn't evenly focus on all characters. After the first thirty minutes, the movie jumped the shark for me, and I was so bored.
It's too stale for a high budget film like this it had box office success but that shouldn't matter when the movie is not extraordinary and lacks originality.
The African accent was apparently fake; I didn't like the way they forced it to their mouth. It baffles me that this film is nominated for the oscar. Out of generosity I gave this movie six stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Black Panther is THE movie to see!,"This film has amazed me in so many ways that I had to go and watch it twice. I am planning to watch it again and again because it is just that powerful. It carries a bold and important message not just to African Americans, but I believe for the world. Some have their negative opinions of this film, but I believe it is the very thing I needed to see to appreciate my black heritage on a whole new level. I truly thank the entire cast.

"The only thing awesome in this movie, is the end credits video song.","I liked Black Panther in the Civil War and was excited about this movie. I hoped to see some amazing adventure and action by Black Panther in this movie but what I got was a family power struggle for the throne of a kingdom/country.Many action scenes and a big part of the storyline doesn't even involve the Black Panther with all his powers and abilities. That was a bit disappointing. At the end, I remained thirsty for some Black Panther action involving his powers and abilities.The movie is good in what it's trying to show but I disliked the acting by the mostly Black cast in this movie. That doesn't mean I don't like Black actors; I have admired many times acting by Black actors/actresses. I don't know. Even Daniel Kaluuya whom I liked and appreciated so much in Get Out, seemed like a novice actor in this movie.The end credit video song is awesome in my view and it's worth purchasing the whole movie ticket for.

Refreshing Journey,"The non traditional Marvel Fan got an eyeful of beauty, style and culture as the backdrop to a long anticipated Superhero's story who not until now got to see the big screen. For the traditional Marvel Fan, I'm sure there wasn't enough fighting, crashing, noise and conflict going on to satisfy today's adrenaline addiction but if they could allow themselves to shift, they would realize what in fact they are experiencing isn't just a movie, but a whole culture that is foreign to a lot of us in America. The calmness of the characters, the steely keenness of their strategy and cool collected demeanor are all new. If you can appreciate that, you can appreciate every aspect of this film as a work of Art and something that young and old everywhere will remember for generations like the early days of Superman.

Best Marvel film to date (not just MCU but Marvel),"I already know the hate this review will get. But it's true, this film transcends the marvel films into territory they haven't been able to even brush upon with their other films. From performances to script, to cinematography, this film has it all. I'm very concerned at the reviews on here where people are literally complaining about CGI. The landscape culture and the vibrant way it was shot was amazing. The CGI is solid, I don't get why people use it to bash films. If I were to watch a 1970s or older film I'm not going to bash it because the effects. I will judge the film off the film alone, how was the plot? How was the characters and acting? How was the cinematography? How was the script??? Like don't get me wrong. if it has impressive effects I will give them that and acknowledge it, especially for it's time, but I don't understand these people that complain about CGI and expect everything to be real. Let alone they expect every film to be some James Cameron focused CGI. Don't get me wrong, I love me some epic CGI especially when it pulls off so well, but I'm not going to judge the film so harshly on that alone and it's not fair that people do that. You should only do it if it's honestly distracting you from the plot or vibe in a moment of the film I guess, but even then I guess you can hate all the old films that came out back then because effects weren't the best JUST SAYING. Tired of these CGI fest people. ANYWAYS, this film delivers AND THEN SOME. It deserved to win best picture I have no idea why green room won over it but it did. This film achieved so much that it's a shame some audiences wouldn't know a good film if it was slapping them on the face. The performances from each character feels so rich and vibrant and everyone learns and changes to the end of the film. The VILLAIN is kick ass and by far the best villain in the MCU (over thanos as well) Michael B Jordan bounced back VERY hard after his failure in fan4stic. This film has the traditional superhero story but adds so much more with its own unique take. The director has such good talent using the amazing script. My only minor issue is the plot feels like 2 different films just minorly though. The Andy Serkis villain was great but his character kind of drifts away because something happens to him but then it shifts to a different film somewhat. It was a twist in a way but felt a bit fast and plot changing. Either way the characters still developed and didn't feel forced. The film is so beautifully shot from wakanda to the culture to the beautiful message of helping everyone around the world. The soundtrack is amazing and the music is SUCH heart wrenching and really captures you into the moment. There is some forced politics thrown in there here and there but it makes sense because it's an African country that has the utilities to help Africans when they were in slavery. Why wouldn't messages come up? I wouldn't say they were forced though it didn't feel forced for me. Captain Marvel forced their politics down our throats. From the feminist power, to ""illegal alien"" skrulls running from Donald trump... UGHH. But that's another story. I think black panther has it all AND more and for me personally it's definetly my top 10 favorite superhero movies of all time and definetly my #1 marvel film ever. Logan might be ahead MIGHT. But idk this film just has so much going for it.Plot 10/10

Christopher Nolan, The Genius in filmmaking even acknowledged that it should have won. History is history. At least the academy acknowledged it. Either way this film was by far the best film of 2018 and it was nice to revisit the film once again to see if I wasn't crazy. When I'm sure I wasn't. It's a beautiful achievement in modern cinema. Not even superhero movies in general but in movies as a whole. It's definetly a film that stands out much more than meets the eye. I'm more of a DC guy but I can't deny marvel knows what they're doing. Good Job. Give the film a watch if you haven't. And if you have and don't agree then watch it again and take into consideration and try to focus on how it's such a huge achievement. And if you have seen it and agree with me, just watch it again because it deserves to be watched plenty of more times for it's beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Interesting female characters; Men...not so much,"Entertaining but only b/c of the female characters. The male characters (with two exceptions) had zero personality or depth. T'Challa's sister, girlfriend and general were the only reasons this movie held my interest. Give them their own movie already!Chadwick Boseman is a great actor but he's given so little to do in this other than act tough. Such a one-dimensional character. And Daniel Kaluuya's switch from good guy to bad guy back to good guy came with no apparent reason or explanation. And wait...did he have a relationship with the General? Don't know. And Forest Whitaker was DOA the whole movie. Wait...wasn't Sterling K. Brown in this? Can't remember. Come to think of it Angela Bassett was also given very little to work with. Snore. Martin Freeman's character had more charisma than all the above-mentioned characters put together.Such a waster of talent!At least Michael B. Jordan and Winston Duke's characters were given some personality that let them stretch their acting skills a wee bit.CGI was also pretty lame and plot holes were pretty wide.And what's Black Panther's super power anyway? He puts on a suit (created by his sister) and leaps around punching and scratching? The armored rhinos were more interesting and deadly.The best character in the movie was Wakanda itself. Make a movie about a high-tech country in the middle of Africa with a girl genius, a kick-ass female general and an endearing CIA agent. Leave out the super cat and all his stoic compatriots.

Black Panther-A Superhero movie with something important to say,"Black Panther is the most recent Marvel flick, it tells the story of T¬¥Challa the king of the fictional country of Wakanda and his battle with Erik Killmonger who also wants to claim the title of king.This movie tries to make something different on the superhero genre and to have something relevant to say.It deals with themes about family, racism, prejudice and the search for identity.It is one of the best superhero movies out there, it has a dfferent vibe in its approach thanks to the african culture represented during the whole movie in the mitology, the costumes, the figurine, production design, soundtrack, etc.
The script is good, the cast is great and the main character and villain are well defined, the motives that made Killmonger became the villain made sense and were credible.The battle sequences were also good and well choreographed.The cinematography is stunning, the mix between technology and nature makes for a unique look also in the interior sets.
The CGI in this movies is great as always, however there were some moments were it could have been better and the green screen was noticeable, and the script although is good it¬¥s a little confuse in the beginning and predictable in a moment.
Black Panther ends up being a great superhero movie and another great offering by Marvel Studios.8.1/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
remember the message of Dr. King,"I just want to mention that the message of Martin Luther King Jr. won out Malcolm X when they finally met and discussed opposing viewpoints, Malcolm would later change his way of thought and acknowledge that Dr.King was right. After all the message of Dr. King was one grounded in the truth of Jesus Christ and which borrowed from Ghandi's own movement against similar opposition from the English and yielded success, that coupled with the support of JFK who likewise borrowed from Abraham Lincoln and we have a model that cannot be denied. Therefore let us all pray as Dr. King prayed for peace, forgiveness, harmony, oneness, understanding and respect for everyone and everything which is a center piece of the beleifs of Ghandi but which all Christians must likewise support. This movie inadvertently appears at a time when the movie makers decided that enough controversy exist (Captain America's Civil War and last years sad and disturbing KKK riots in Charlottesville, we are not in the 60's anymore! ) in the world that it would generate enough interest and thereby sales to garner success for its efforts. While the marketing strategy succeeded, the moral implications should not be ignored specifically as mentioned above regarding all efforts toward harmony and peace in all areas concerning the social attitudes, beleifs and values of all the peoples living in this great country. It with great hope that the writers show every bit of responsibility in the upcoming films to remember that this is the true direction of a hero such as the one played by Chadwick, is for peace, forgiveness. Letting go of the past and embracing the future as harmonious beings seeking to heal and help each other as we work towards a brighter future must be the aim of our leaders that must be seasoned in the lessons of our past and dutifulminded to steer clear of repeating them, forgiving the wrongs and adhering to the right in our evolution to continue to raise the bar for the human condition. 
 On a side note please make sure that the comic code authority (a guideline to ensure that children would be protected from harmful messages or stories) is restored to comics, there are many comic books that have many harmful messages in them, parents take note that Marvel and DC comics got rid of the comic code Authority when they went corporate in an effort to make more money. Comics were always for children and still are, why are we not more concerned about the safety of their highly impressionable minds, please contact both Marvel and DC comics to pressure them about this issue for it will not go away. 
One last note regarding DC and the new Black Lightning t.v. show, the actor is great but the costume is really lame, he should have a black costume with small yellow lighning bolts near the neck or the left breast and a simple black mask that covers most of his face. The costume could be bullet proof but not mechanical, he is not Iron Man and he can fly via the lightning powers, finally he should make his debut in the Justice League Movie. One more point the actor who plays Martian Manhunter (also an African American actor) is really great in the role as the Martian, except his powers due to a low budget on the Supergirl series expires quickly, can you give him his full powers and have him also in the Justice League movie, he has always been a major character in the series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding,"What a movie. Going into the movie, my expectations were really high, and surprisingly, I cam out with not only reaching my expectations, but surpassing them.

Unfortunately, I was not able to watch the movie in IMax, but after watching it one time in standard, I would very much want to experience the ""IMax experience"" for this movie.

Good movie,"The premise of this film is kind of silly. There's a whole nation that's so technologically advanced that it hides under cloaking technology. Then again, suspension of disbelief is strong across the MCU. There's helicarriers with magic cloaking, literal wizards much more competent than Gandalf, Norse god using his hammer to do The Helicopter, world-spanning conspiracies that remain hidden, and Hawkeye somehow being a valid member of the Avengers.Potrayal of the fictive African nation of Wakanda is delightfully cartoonish, and the tone carries thorough the film. I really appreciate that main the characters, although Royal and portrayed as such, didn't take themselves too seriously. There's heart to the banter. This is true for the whole movie, even with the stakes being high the tone kept lighthearted.Wakanda as nation would not survive three months with this governing model, but with magical technology and comic book logic everything is possible.The catsuit is cool, and Chadwick Bosemann did a solid role as King T'Calla. Andy Serkis also does a strong role as Klaue and is definitely my favourite in this movie. Most of the central supporting cast was good too.Plot on this is straightforward, and has some very Disney-esque traits to it. Maybe this is from the original comics, haven't read them myself. All in all, an enjoyable romp, but not one that I have any desire to revisit any time soon.As a film in the MCU this is definitely in the standalone-category. The film does not tie much to the other plots, and is wholly understandable without the larger franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This Time it's Africa,"Black Panther is a pretty average marvel superhero movie which sets itself apart from the pack by a thick layer of African ethnocultural paint on top of it.Most of it takes part in the fictional African country of Wakanda, which has secretly developed sci-fi technology but otherwise is still a tribal monarchy where the leader is decided in bloody fist fights and high ranked jobs are given to members of the royal family in a blatant display of favoritism. Surprisingly no one in this film finds that problematic.The plot doesn't make much sense either, as we have a lost son coming home wanting to hand over advanced weapons to some unstated black people terrorist groups around the world, somehow expecting them to fight for their freedom. A freedom they already have in most countries with Wakanda itself being a notable exception as we learned above. To make matters worse, the ending is so US-centric that it's unintentionally cynical but at this point you probably switched off your brain anyway.The action however is captivating as usual, Chadwick Boseman does a great job in the lead role and the setting is refreshing at least. Together this is enough to make this movie worth watching despite its shortcomings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"All Hail Black Panther, King of Wakanda (and the 2018 box office so far)","Black Panther leaps off the screen in a dazzling adventure with a decidedly unique Afro-futuristic vibe. Director Ryan Coogler may have started out with independent dramas but his style feels at home within the MCU.Set not long after CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, the film follows T'Challa, the newly christened king of Wakanda as he combats evil forces from outside and from within his own nation.From a visual standpoint, BLACK PANTHER has one of the most beautifully rendered superhero worlds since the cosmic setting in both Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The city and landscape of Wakanda are artistically stylized as one might expect from an advanced African metropolis. The costumes and props seem practical within the MCU universe. Amazon warriors, prosthetic cannons, battle rhinos, and combat by waterfall don't seem out of place in this continuity.The nearly all-black supporting cast is mostly strong. Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis are both excellent as the villains; Jordan is especially great and perhaps the best and intimidating MCU villain since Ultron. Lupita Nyong'o is that rare capable love interest that you don't see often in comic book movies. In fact, all the female characters are strong, resilient, and play a role in the plot. Given the comparatively darker tone, both Leticia Wright and Martin Freeman lighten the mood as Black Panther's sister and CIA contact respectfully so.What's interesting is its tone and subject matter. Unafraid to incorporate politics into its plot, BLACK PANTHER boasts the usual stuff like action and spectacle, but its timely message of inclusiveness and altruism versus hatred and revenge ring so true for the present day. It's bold for a blockbuster, especially a superhero movie to proudly embrace the creativeness with an African setting and all black cast.Even rarer is the maturity to call attention to pressing social issues but condemn militant retribution as more radical elements often call for. Yes it addresses racism and other problems suffered by black people. There is already a backlash against the movie because of this. But it's conscious enough to not take the stance that means 'white people are evil' or 'black people should riot or take over'. For heaven's sake, the main antagonist Killmonger (Jordan) is an embittered black nationalist whose actions are condemned in favor of more peaceful measures. One would think the internet would be happy that an SJW is the villain but whatever.Sporting high tech gadgets, a wide cast of memorable characters, a kickass soundtrack, and even social commentary to boot, BLACK PANTHER starts the year 2018 right.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A new taste of Marvel before Thanos!,"I saw Black Panther today and I came out happy.It had a really nice story with a lot of heart and overall gave us a new experience. 
The whole cast was great and thanks to them and the directing team they have made a very good addition to the Marvel family. 
Fight scenes were pretty and the combination of technology was very cool.I did feel it jumped a bit too much in certain scenes.However I was worried, I found that recent Marvel films like Thor tried to hard to give us a comedy and failed with other emotions. 
Spiderman homecoming was good but for me it had a few issues like every character had to be funny except Spiderman and he suddenly lost his ability to use his suit despite being incredible in Civil War.But I came out surprised and happy with Black Panther!So overall I am giving it an 8 
The reason I didnt give it a 7 is because this is the last film before Infinity Wars so the Hype is at a new level!!!!Hope you enjoy this honest review 
Enjoy Black PantherAnd most importantly enjoy Infinity Wars!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Powerful!!,"Groundbreaking and empowering superhero film that not only shattered box office records but also became a cultural phenomenon with its celebration of African culture and representation.Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa, the Black Panther, is nothing short of exceptional. He brings regal charisma and depth to the character, making T'Challa a relatable and inspiring hero.Black Panther stands out in the superhero genre for its rich and vibrant depiction of Wakanda, an advanced African nation hidden from the rest of the world. The film's stunning visual aesthetics, costume design, and world-building create a captivating and immersive experience.The film's supporting cast, including Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger and Danai Gurira as Okoye, delivers powerful performances that add layers of complexity to the narrative. The characters are multi-dimensional and provide a refreshing departure from one-dimensional villains often seen in superhero films.Black Panther's thematic exploration of identity, legacy, and responsibility is thought-provoking and resonates with audiences on a deeper level. It raises important questions about social justice, the consequences of isolationism, and the importance of unity.Director Ryan Coogler's vision and storytelling skill shine throughout the film. He expertly balances action-packed sequences with poignant character moments, creating a movie that is both entertaining and emotionally impactful.The film's representation of strong and empowered female characters, like Okoye, Shuri (played by Letitia Wright), and Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o), is commendable and sends a powerful message about the importance of diverse and inclusive narratives.While some may argue that the film's CGI effects in certain scenes could be improved, Black Panther's overall impact on the superhero genre and its cultural significance outweigh any minor technical criticisms.In conclusion, Black Panther is a groundbreaking and empowering superhero film that celebrates African culture and representation while delivering a thrilling and thought-provoking narrative. With its stellar performances, rich world-building, and powerful themes, it has left an indelible mark on cinema and popular culture.If you're a fan of superhero films that go beyond the standard formula and celebrate diversity and empowerment, Black Panther is a must-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Its too overhyped as a MCU movie. But still a great exciting adventure for the Black Panther character.,"Black Panther was awesome and the triumphant king of Wakanda. First thing first, I enjoy and loved the film as it stands out on its own. Plus the world building of MCU, now were introduced to the world of Wakanda, were technology is advanced by a few decades than everywhere else around the world. But it is also kept a secret except for the people from Wakanda. It was beautiful visually; it had some good action sequences, and an inspirational plot. I will throw this out there, I feel like the movie is overhyped. It was a great movie. But when you put this up with other Marvel films. There are other great ones and better superhero movies than this.The pros about this film. Lets start with the plot. It does not feel like a Marvel movie at all. It is a good thing. It starts after the events of Captain America Civil War. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) heads back to Wakanda. He is declared King. When he sees that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up on the radar selling vibranium that only belongs to Wakanda. And the rest of the world is not ready for this technology. T'Challa chases Klaue down and discover a mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) may be his biggest challenge yet. When Killmonger wants to take over Wakanda. Plot is inspirational, about a king that does not think he is ready. But is faced with an ultimate challenge politically when he wants to do what is right for his kingdom and the rest of the world.The action sequences were good. May not be an action packed wild ride compared to other marvel movies. I ll be honest about the opening action scene was terribly lighted and dark and filled with close up camera shots and quick editing. When Black Panther attacks a convoy to rescue one of the hostages. But it gets better throughout. It has a few good action scenes. From the casino when T'Challa and Okoye (Danai Gurira) fight through some bad guys. To a car chase scene with Black Panther. And than a climatic battle Killmonger's followers and a fight between him and Panther on a futuristic railway. Director Ryan Coogler could have made some action scenes fun. When offered a 200 million budget. He really tried to be careful to not over do it. But he could have tried for a blockbuster approach. The visual effects were great. The music score stands out on its own as a MCU film with an electronic chant music.Chadwick Boseman was great as Panther/T'Challa. Michael B. Jordan was also good. And stands out as a villain. When his motivation is slowly revealed after a tragic past that made him what he is today. Lupita Nyong as Nakia was great as T'Challa's love interest and wants to do something about the real world's conflict outside Wakanda. Danai Gurira has a lot more screen time and is good too. Same with Martin Freeman, who has more to do than his brief appearance in Captain America. And Letitia Wright as Shuri was great as T'Challa's sister and is the brains in offering new technology and gadgets.Overall, Black Panther is a great film. I loved it. It is visually entertaining. The action was not top notch but it was good. The plot was great, it was a little too much in the political side than being a personal character story, and the huge cast ensemble was good. If the movie were standing alone as a superhero it would have been the best movie. But being part of the MCU, there are other great movies better than this. I feel like this film was lacking in the fun energy than the last several MCU films had. I still recommend seeing this film in theatres for its exciting action, an indifferent plot, and also there is two post credit scenes, I think the final end scene was a nice nod to a character.I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Boring!,"The hype surrounding this movie was too much, I get why alot of people liked it and that's obvious but don't be naive in thinking this is an amazing movie because the truth is it isn't. Let's be clear it's not a bad movie but it's just simply boring there's not enough action in the movie there's alot of talking and some glaring mistakes and poor acting. I don't want to blast this film because there is good things about it ( the black panther suit and eric killmonger where the coolest things about this movie ) but it's overrated and a movie I probably won't watch again unfortunately.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I liked it, but I admit it is a bit overrated.","Overall, I pretty much liked this movie, altho I admit it is surely overrated. I believe that the reason why it is overrated is because of the fame and glory MCU gets nowadays, but still it is a movie that deserves respect, most of all because of all the different aspects the movie offers. The special effects are all over the movie and they are amazing, altho at some moments they were even to much for my taste. But I honestly expected a bit more from the story, since I had not read anything about the Black Panther from the Marvel comics before. At times, the movie took to long to progress, which made it boring at few points , as the movie is 2h and 15 min. long. I certainly enjoyed ""Bilbo"" and Daniel Kaluuya being in this movie which made my day, since I did not see the cast before I started watching the movie and I was positively surprised. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Black Panther has arrived,"The Marvel universe just keeps expanding here, in every good way. After Chadwick Boseman first appeared has the Black Panther in Captain America Civil War, you knew like Wonder Woman it would not be long before he would get his own movie. I heard back in the 90's they where trying to get a Black Panther movie in hopes it would starring Wesley Snipes in the title role, but it did not happen and Wesley Snipes went on to play another Marvel character known has Blade.So how does this film hold up, I gotta say pretty well. Action scenes are pretty well done, like in any other superhero movie. Fight scenes are awesome to watch. And the effects are mind blowing. Chadwick Boseman gives a likable performance has the main character, I mean you really route for him all the way. Let's not forget Michael B. Jordan has the villain Killmonger, and the rest cast do well also. I'm looking forward for more Black Panther films in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Film,"Black Panther is a good movie, but not a great movie. The central portion of the film is really good and the characters are all engaging while the villain delivers motivations above and beyond the usual Hollywood standard.The problems I found with Black Panther really only came at the beginning and end of the story. For me it took quite a while for the story to actually get going (not till Michael Jordan's character shows up in Korea does the the story really start to pick up pace) though as they were establishing both the characters and setting this is perhaps understandable and I would expect this not to be such an issue in subsequent films. The ending I found a little rushed by contrast and wish they had spent slightly less time on the set up and more time on the pay off.The other major problem I found were with the fight scenes, which I found slightly repetitive; the 'challenge' scenes were quite well done however the confrontation between the hero and villain at the end felt underwhelming, certainly when compared with the rest of the battle taking place elsewhere, that however is not uncommon in Marvel films.Overall well worth seeing and I look forward to more Black Panther films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Yawn,"In a nutshell... Waited 2 hours or so just to watch the cut scenes.To elaborate, this movie lacked a decent storyline, instead it was rather dull. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and as such cared little for their success or failure. Much of the hype I believe is due to the dominant African American cast. That's fine, when I watch a movie I don't care what colour people are, but in this case the hyper seems to have heavily depended on that fact and ignored more important aspects of a movie like storyline etc. The lead character was rather bland. Wait for this movie on netflix or something. I gave this movie 3 stars because Andy Serkis was funny",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful film,"I was waiting with great anticipation for this film and it was not disappointing. Though some of the dialog wasn't the greatest and there were some missed opportunities to do more The Black Panther lived up to its hype.

Visually Impressive.... Plot less so,"Took a few days to mull this review over. Visually this as impressive as a Marvel title gets, Wakanda brought to ife and it's beautiful. The let down is the somewhat predictable plot, as the early part of the film plays out it was easy to see how the end was to play out.This in mind the there is a lot packed into the 2hr 15 runtime, which oddly with the story, you find some parts seem drawn a little too much, leaving the final act far too predicatble and extremley busy.The casting is good and Michael B Jordan in particular impressive.It will be interesting to see further development of Black Panther.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Saw it in theaters, twice!","This movie is an experience unlike any other I've had at the movie theater. I ended up seeing it again because I wanted to rewatch it with some friends who still hadn't seen it, and to also see their reactions. They of course loved it. Also loving Kendrick Lamar makes the movie and the overall feeling watching it ten times more enjoyable, as I ended up having the Black Panther album on repeat in the months after the movie came out. This movie most notably elicited a very memorable and important moment in time for a lot of Black audiences/creators, who unfortunately aren't used to superhero's that look like them represented so well, and not just one but a whole cast of incredible Black talent. Daniel Kaluuya who I remember from Skins and Black Mirror (where he was literally the definition amazing), only for Get Out to come and blow our minds entirely. Things like that is made the film incredible and impossible to forget. RIP Chadwick! Listening to the music and watching his other work since his passing has created a painful, but humble emotional nostalgia within me that no recent films can compare to, and I'm grateful for him and his impact, as many are.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"I don't find it as great as everyone else does, but it's really good","This is one of those films that definitely benefits from a rewatch years after all the hype, initial reactions, and surrounding conversations about it dies down so that you can look back at it without those aspects overclouding your judgement.I was never a huge fan of this widely beloved film, and it didn't help that it got a Best Picture nomination, but after this rewatch, I can look back and say that the praise is mostly deserving (except the third act), but I'm personally still not a huge fan of it, doesn't do much for me.The cast is really great, a great ensemble with great chemistry, and Michael B. Jordan is able to bounce off of that incredibly well in his great performance as Killmonger. The MCU really lost a great talent in Chadwick Boseman, his performance helps provide an extra layer of elegance to this film, future films could have really benefited from having him as the franchise's centric figure.The first two acts are incredibly well done, it shouldn't be surprising as Coogler proved his talents as a director in Creed (2015), but the third act does not help this film at all, it feels like it was done without him on set. Lots of terribly noticeable CGI and green screens, and the huge fights that always at the end of each Phase 3/4 film are very uninteresting, especially with those Rhinos.Overall, the story, themes, and characters are the strongest aspect of this film, with the ensemble cast being the highlight. However, the third act feels a bit anticlimactic, and its technical weaknesses are very distracting. Very solid film, but not as great as everyone says it is in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Average,Overall its a bit disappointing and the story isn't very believable. The lead villlian is a bit of a caricature who lacks any real motivation other than being a resentful child with daddy issues.One of the most annoying aspects for me is that the fight choreography is generally quite poor. Unforigiveable for a film like this! Super quick editing and super close camera work make fight scenes impossible to follow. The final 'big fight scene' between the 2 panthers is just by the numbers genericness and quite possibly completely CGI.The actresses/characters who play the tough and loyal General and Black panthers technological genius sister are the most interesting and unique in the film. While the actor who plays the Black Panther just about carries it off.One of the most interesting aspect of the film is the idea of Wakanda. A futuristic city hidden in the middle of Africa. Its a nice idea and kind of joyous celebration of African culture and uniqueness. Though one might object to the fairly incongruent mash of traditional tribal stereotypes and futuristic technology. It's not overly believable. But it is a sci-fi fantasy after all.Overall I'd say it's one of the weaker Marvel superhero films but still entertaining enough if you can forgive some of the sillier African stereotypes.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I don't get the over hype,"It's like the world is trying not to seem racist. Watching all movies up to date from the MCU i can witness that it has been difficult for the movies to gain an Academy award. Many have been nominated but none of them up until now have won any. Black Panther then suddenly took home 3 Academy awards and has grossed more money than any other MCU release. Also the metascore gave it an 88/100.It has it's moments of clarity and emotion but Black Panther as a whole is very average (in my opinion) referencing todays generation of meme's such as ""What are those?!"" It's like it's attempting to woo the audience with modern social references, it just comes across as cringy.This movie won an Oscar for best costume design, which i agree with as it's over view on african tribe traits was brilliant but the special effects were sour at times (No Oscar for that).

Wakanda Forever,"As heir to the royal throne, T'Challa returned to his country, Wakanda, to accept the challenge process of fighting as a candidate for the new king. However, the process changed Wakanda's future with a new threat that Wakanda had been hiding for years.Bringing up the Black Panther character is indeed a special attraction in the body of the MCU film. Black Panther does not just introduce Black Panther characters and other characters, such as Queen Ramonda, Shuri, Killmonger and even Ulysses Klaue. Nor is it by introducing the conflict of fighting for the throne to become the next king, but rather the cultural elements of African society that adorn this film. Many references to African culture are used in this film so that this film enriches the use of culture and history that exists in the world in the MCU, including the extraordinary African culture. Black Panther has an interesting and cool beauty in describing the country of Wakanda as a country with the use of cutting-edge technology. The design of the cities and even the technology displayed also attracts attention. In terms of the premise of the story, Black Panther presents a pretty good story to introduce the situation of Wakanda and Vibranium in the future of the MCU. It is worth appreciating the performances of Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. Featuring fraternal conflicts is like a medieval film in a power struggle. It's unfortunate that in some fights it seems that the CGI quality is not perfect, especially when the fight scene is in the cave.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Refreshingly Diverse, if Formulaic, Superhero Odyssey","After so many deeply interconnected chapters, it's relieving to see a film in the MCU that doesn't require much previous knowledge to enjoy. Referencing the preceding (and forthcoming) films in Marvel's repertoire only fleetingly, Black Panther is a largely self-contained, by-the-numbers superhero flick. Which works both for it and against it. In one respect, that enables the entire cast to establish themselves. Safe from the need to constantly pay homage to Tony Stark or Thanos, Panther's supporting players thrive and King T'Challa himself goes through a complete character arc. On the other hand, it often feels like we've been here before. Maybe not specifically, as the film goes to great lengths to set up Wakanda as a unique culture with authentic customs, but certainly thematically.As a ""back to basics"" approach with well-timed, socially conscious values, it functions very well. Its flavor is like nothing else we've seen from Marvel so far - a bright, optimistic blend of tech and nature that really works - and the wide diversity of the on-screen population is both effective and appropriate.A complete, enjoyable new entry in the publisher's stacked catalog of characters, and a short breath of fresh air, if not a complete breakthrough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

However, whereas you could sympathize with Loki's jealously of Thor, the level of hostility that Killmonger has towards T'Challa never seemed appropriate to me. Nor did I totally accept the circumstances surrounding T'Chaka's little secret.While the film may be worth seeing just to get a better view of the 'black' perspective of the world we live in, these small story details really dragged the movie down a bit for me. I really wished they spent more time with Killmonger's background as he had the potential to provide the most complex character/villain in the MCU universe.

Dumb yet entertaining...,"I went to see this movie with my friend in theaters without either of us knowing anything about the character. The biggest thing that took away from my experience of this movie was some a**hole who thought it would be a good idea to go on their phone during the climax and light up the theater.In case you're reading this review before you watch, I'd like to let you know that there are two end credits scenes. If you like watching them, be sure to wait around until the very end.This movie probably doesn't deserve the high rating I gave it, but I had a lot of fun watching.Cinematography - The CGI in this movie was a bit inconsistent. Some scenes looked really fake while the majority was extremely well done. Most of the fight scenes were done very well, while others looked terrible (there was a fight scene at the beginning taking place in the middle of a forest that looked terrible). Overall, this was a very colorful and aesthetically pleasing film.Characters - The acting was amazing all around, bringing these characters to life. Though most of the characters were intelligent, I did find The Black Panther's dad to be one of the most stupid and infuriating people to ever exist on this planet. Most of the characters had some kind of motivation for doing what they were doing, which just made them even more believable.Plot - The plot was predictable. I i figured out the majority of the events before they even happened. Though I had a lot of fun watching this movie, the plot was pretty cliche and formulaic. There weren't too many character arcs and a movie that had so much potential fell a bit flat. There could've been more conflict and possibly some kind of internal struggle within the main character to make it more interesting, but for some reason they decided not to do that.The Fight Scenes - Save for a few shots of your standard hyper edited Marvel movie fight scene bs, the majority of the fight scenes in this movie are well-choreographed. Despite there being no tension (because all the ""good guys"" are basically invincible) they are pretty fun. However, there is a scene where a woman gets her throat slit onscreen and there is no blood. There are actually a lot of scenes with people getting stabbed and there being no blood. This is a movie that will drop the f-bomb but avoid blood at almost all costs. You can't just pull a spear out of someone's abdomen and had it be shiny and clean THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.The Humor - The movie mostly fails at this. There are a few funny elements to this movie (like the leader of the mountain tribe) but most of the ""humor"" consists of outdated memes. There is actually a scene where a character makes a 4-year-old ""what are those reference"" and everyone in the theater cringed loudly (there were a lot of people in that theater). However, later in the same scene the same character is involved in a pretty funny gag where she kinda pranks The Black Panther by withholding information on his new suit. Like the CGI, the humor in this movie is inconstant in quality.Technology - Unlike other movies with futuristic technology, all of the tech shown in this movie looked convenient and actually useful in some way.Sound Design - The soundtrack for this movie was amazing (in my opinion) and unique. The sound design also helped with bringing to life this futuristic world. I have some hearing difficulties an usually have a lot of trouble understanding speech (at home I usually watch movies with the subtitles turned on) and especially people with accents different from my own, but at no point was I struggling to understand an English-speaking character in this movie. The music and background noise doesn't drown out the characters speaking. Also most everyone in the theater was polite enough to let everyone hear what was going on. I'm just mentioning all this because it was greatly appreciated.I realize that not everyone is going to enjoy this movie like I did, and there are plenty of people who will get bored by the 2 hour+ runtime, but I was throughly invested for the entire duration of the movie. I believe I've explained my reasons. If you don't like Marvel movies, don't see it. If you think that a sci-fi superhero story with incredible new worlds and a fun story sounds interesting, go see it.If you are someone who thinks that this movie is in any way trying to be political, I'd recommend that you go see a psychologist. There is nothing political about this movie. Its a fun dumb superhero movie with black main characters. I don't see why there are people using this movie in discussions about race.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I kinda like it,"I am not a marvel fan becuse i did not read the comics or stick to the MCU timeline but i pretty much watch most of super hero movies from marvel, i would say that this movie is a better MCU movie from the past years. This movie in my opinion was telling the story what it needed to tell the audience perfectly but there also alot of flaws. A non-marvel fan speaking so i mean it when i say this gave what needed and the whole movie makes sense and i understand the story line but there were A LOT of some specific scenes that could have tell the meaning better or the villian's story that could have line it to have more meaning or the CGI that if you know this fanchise this movie could have done a better job on that part.but overall? This movie was great the casting the story and cgi are definitely better. The star of this movie which is T'Challa is cool. Very cool but the plot and origin was kinda make you say ""that's it?'' the pacing was good but compare a stand alone superhero movie like captain america or ironman this movie is below the rank from how this hero become a hero. The part that i love is that the fact that we finally see some more of cool super hero that aren't just blone hair and blue eyes type of hero. No hate to other movies but if you really think about it, you will see the pattern. This movie has potential to be the one of my top superhero movies but the dialogues,origin story of characters are less interesting but look in the positive over all of this movie? It is not AS bad but also definitely not the best. I just wanna say that i enjoyed it as much as it gave so would say that i love this movie. Also this movie has the best endcredit song ever!!

Black Panther: The emperor isn't wearing any clothes!,"Marvel fantasy origin film.Based in 'Wakanda', which is an African fantasy location. The source of the population vast wealth, and advanced technology is an ancient cosmic metal called 'nonsenseanium'The plot is poor, the acting is wooden, with no humour and hardly any action. We see how the 'Lion King Simba' rip-off becomes king and is challenged by the 'Scar' rip-off for his throne.The film has been over-hyped and not as good as the reviews lead you to believe, it appears that reviews are being cautious of giving honest criticism in fear of being called racist!I didn't much like Wonder Woman either, but this isn't even as good as that.

A pretty good Marvel movie,"I can't say this movie's perfect, because it's not. However, it's better than most. So let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons.Let's stay positive for a minute. The costumes, designs, music, and acting is all really good. I especially like Michael B. Jordan's performance. It was a different beat to everyone else in the film. This movie is also a lot more colorful than most Marvel movies, which are typically kinda drab. This one pops with colors, much like Thor: Ragnarok and the Guardians movies, so that's great. Now let's get to the part you've been waiting for: the villain. Killmonger is probably my favorite MCU villain so far (I haven't seen Infinity War yet, so I can't say anything about Thanos). The main reason I like him is not so much the motivation, but the impact he has on Black Panther. Killmonger's vision makes T'Challa change his mindset, which no other MCU villain has ever done.The things I didn't like. The CGI was not always good. In some scenes, it looked like PS2 graphics, which is embarassing. This is my only big complaint with the movie.Overall, this is not the best MCU movie, but it's definiteky not the worst. It's probably in my top five.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as Bad as I was expecting,"Maybe it's because I went into this movie with low expectations, but I definitely did not hate this movie. The acting was reasonable for what they were trying to accomplish, the villain had more nuance than many other marvel bad guys (although I felt this was at least partially because it's 'wrong' today to create a black character that's irredeemably bad, but considering I want all villains to be treated like this I can't complain about the double standards too much). I had a few questions about how having a better metal makes them basically a futuristic sci fi society (stronger metal doesn't automatically equal flying cars, that's not how science works), but it made for a visually spectacular film. It suffers from the same syndrome as Asgard where for some reason their army forgoes ranged weapons in order to use amped up swords (despite being futuristic) oh well.

I'm not
Reminds me when I was in USA when avatar came out everyone goin on how grt it was I walked out of cinema thinking what a waste of three hrs and never watched again how he conned studios to make 2-3-4 lol
Well it's like this with marvel we all like comic book movies but getting to many I mean pt 1-2-3 etc y not do Thor 4 hrs or avengers 4 hrs with break in between like yrs back Bollywood do.

For once the fake reviewers are the ones rating it the lowest possible,"What I find laughable on here are the reviewers that complain that there are alot of fake reviews and so the ratings are rigged. You could say that from a movie that got only a dozen reviews but not in this case with more than 2000 reviews. I've seen dozens of movies where the ratings were rigged but Black Panther is not one of them. That you don't like this movie is your right, but don't talk about fake reviews, because in this case you're the one with a fake review, giving the lowest score possible is just a joke. You're not going to tell me that this movie was one of the worst movies you ever saw, or I can only conclude you never watched alot of movies before. I'm not a big fan of Marvel movies, most of the time I'm a bit bored, but with Black Panther I didn't have that feeling. The story was interesting, maybe not perfect but at least it wasn't boring. The acting was okay even if it was not world class acting. The computer generated images were in most of the cases good, sometimes they could have been better, certainly with a high budget like that, but nonetheless it was all entertaining. And entertainment is exactly what I expect to get when watching this kind of movies. So for the negative people I would just say to get a life and rate it fairly, like a four or five stars but not a one star because that's just ridiculous.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Black panther or African dreamland""","At beginning, let me clarify I am an greedy DC fan. In my vision, Black panther is the Marvel version of Batman. So, before seeing the movie, I didn't have any high expectations to this character. Just another version of Batman.
But let's face it - this is an different movie. 
First of all, whole film some feeling would get a hold in my mind. Am i watching a modern interpretation of Lion King or Marvel version of Agent 007 ? 
I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. And at the same time, a classy DISNEY film. That is not to say it is bad, but film where Black Panther supposed to get his own movie, not about his character a bit disappointed me. They focused way too much on portraying a political, racial, African cultures and futuristic African dreamland ""Wakanda"". Where illustrated how powerful black people are, even females in this movie were intelligent and extremely courageous. #feminism The Black Panther character was used just only as driving force to next scene. Despite this issue, the plot is solid and the actors are excellent. Especially Michael B. Jordan character (Killmonger) who provides a great contrast with a potent motivation. I can say, one of interesting villains in Marvel universe. Other characters are just complimentary for this movie. 
As usually Visual effects and CGI were stunning, there was a little gaps with some poor lighting, but probably problem accrued from quality of our local Cinema.6 out of 10 (If i have to classify this film as Marvel film)

IS EARTH READY FOR A HIGHER FORM OF SUPERHERO MOVIE?,"Ryan Coogler, relative new comer, and director of 2015's Creed, does an incredible job of realising this complex character first introduced in the third Captain America movie, Civil War, Black Panther was an integral part of the storyline and captured audience's attention with a flair for spectacular action stunts.Black panther stands triumphantly as it's own story, understood to be taking place in the grander scheme, but telling a story firmly rooted in it's own world, and not leaning too hard into being an infinity War lead-up. Compared to plethora of MCU films, and even to the current deluge of films in the super-hero genre, with releases this year from Fox, Sony, and others, Black Panther is a fun solid start to 2018's year of the superhero.The film has spectacular action sequences, a beautifully moving and creative score, design work evoking African culture while melding with fictional advanced technology. However, the film is not without its faults. The plot is predictable when it's not all over the place. The script fails to endear us to characters in the way the score is begging us to feel. Many characters' motivations are constantly undefined. And the 3D conversion is nauseating (and that's coming from someone who ALWAYS chooses the watch a movie in 3D if available).There is a moment in the Avengers where Thor says of Thanos' intentions that his interest in Earth stems from the fact that Earth has demonstrated they are ready for a higher form of war, and Black Panther asks the audience to accept a higher form of superhero film, and while I applauded it for its attempt, and for the moments where it succeeds, that just makes the moments where it falters all the more disappointing and unforgivable.You can't ask an audience to come along on a more intellectual movie and then hand them a B grade superhero flick. I don't fault critics for being so overwhelmingly positive about this movie, it's a good movie with a positive message, and I'm rating it positively too, it's just not the movie we needed, it's not the Messiah that it's being hailed as.Wonder woman needed to be good so that we can get other female led superhero films. Black panther needed to be good because we need better minority representation in films, in genre films specifically. Not just in characters, but in story. And in that regard, it will undoubtedly succeed in making sure studio executives believe investing in movies like Black Panther is a good idea and will bring audiences to the theatres in droves. In that way the movie has most definitely succeed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Refreshing hero in a fun, but underwhelming narrative","""Black Panther Down"" is the movie directed by Ridley Scott and starring Orlando Bloom for 2 seconds. Alright, I'm just joking. It's been a long day, but I got the chance to check out the new Marvel movie, which I had no real expectations for. The marketing didn't get me hooked and it all sort of felt underwhelming to me. But I wanted to see it since I liked the Black Panther a lot in ''Civil War'' with his ""I don't care"" attitude. The character did grow with his own little story arc, so when you see him now, he's become a more responsable man. The movie was fine in my eyes. It's your usual Marvel picture when it comes to story and visuals, but at least it's an entertaining flick with enough craziness to keep you locked in for two hours. That's something I feel that the guys at Marvel aren't afraid of anymore; to go all out with the comic book weirdness and sometimes campyness. Now they wanna embrace it. Which has been strongly evident in the last ""Thor"" movie. That's not to say that there isn't any grittiness, because there is. It's all combined into one here. I'll applaud them for going to new places. But the end result didn't stick out to be more than mainly a fun time with popcorn at the movies.I would have probably changed the visual style more if I was the one making it. Can they use less green-screen next time, please? It's Africa! I wanna see the savannas and the fantastic nature sights. There's an over-reliance of just resorting to fake digital backgrounds rather than using real locations. The digital gloom over everything lessened the visual appeal for me. But, hey! That's just the look. How's the story? Yeah, it's decent. I liked the grounded stuff mixed with African culture and/or mythology. The Wakandan technology and civilization was jarring to me at first sight. Not even Tony Stark has that level of tech. It was too much of a future city for my taste. Although the question of why the Wakandan tech has never been heard of before is brought in the movie as a major plot point. So I thought it was nice that it was addressed. The characters are fun and everyone brings a nice charisma to the screen. Chadwick Boseman, Lupita NYong'o and Forest Whittaker give their absolute care to the movie. It's no paycheck day for sure. It feels like Martin Freeman basically just hanged around on set. I was happy to see him there though. Because he would see and react to Wakandan culture like we, the audience would. The villains are good, but like in most previous Marvel films; they get sidelined again. Andy Serkis brought a fantastic personality to his mischievous guy, but his screen-time is limited. That was an unwise choice. Michael B. Jordan (AKA Creed) is also very interesting and unique. Not very often these days when you can understand the villain's motive so well. The main group are, like I mentioned, good and all.. But, the biggest problem I have is that the story line goes to all the expected places. It's pretty much like ""we've done all of this stuff before"". I wasn't surprised by where the plot ended up going because it's usual business and all so going through the familiar beats. It would have been more fun with some different twists. The action is entertaining. You even get a ''Skyfall''-like casino scene, but with some additional slow-mo fighting, of course.Did I care for the story? Sure. There are neat moments and a fun adventure with good heroes to root for. None of it was captivating enough to raise my enjoyment unfortunately. I could see the emotional things and what they were trying to do. But, I didn't feel it. Black Panther is a superhero I've known almost nothing about. That's the reason I decided to go in as blank as I could. I would have loved to have been surprised, but I got a fun action movie with like-able heroes instead. Ultimately the character is sort of a mix of ""The Phantom"" and ""Batman"". I'm a fan of both those two and if you haven't read the Phantom comics, then I would highly recommend them. I wanted to see more of the tone you'd read there. It's grounded, but it feels a little fantastical too. The jungle is dark and mysterious. Filled with many legends and roads to unknown adventures. Well, I think my review has ended up too long, so I'll wrap it up. I'm sure Black Panther can become even better down the line, if there's more focus on delivering something less predictable and maybe more personal. Oh, and delve into the mythology and the mysticism more next time. It did what it had to do; to entertain and make audiences feel familiar with Wakanda. Now my thought is that ""Infinity War"" better deliver. Show me what 10 years of this Cinematic Universe has been leading up to. Do not play it safe, please. Any way, ""Black Panther"" was fine. It's a good time, but it should have had more weight.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most visually stunning Marvel Cinematic Universe film.,"Black Panther continues with the story of T'Challa/Black Panther(Chadwick Boseman), after the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). After a family tragedy, T'Challa ascends to the throne & becomes king of Wakanda.Black Panther is a mind-blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe delivers another flawless masterpiece. Director Ryan Coogler, brings his own unique directing style to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That makes this movie more unique, than the previous films set in this universe. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. Kudos to production designer Hannah Beachler, for making Wakanda look absolutely gorgeous & otherworldly. Chadwick Boseman is brilliant as T'Challa/Black Panther. Boseman effectively portrays T'Challa's various emotions & inner conflicts. Michael B. Jordan is spectacular as Erik Killmonger. Lupita Nyong'o is outstanding as Nakia. Danai Gurira is excellent as Okoye. Martin Freeman is awesome as Everett K. Ross. Daniel Kaluuya is excellent as W'Kabi. Letitia Wright is amazing as Shuri. Winston Duke is great as M'Baku. Sterling K. Brown is unforgettable as N'Jobu. Angela Bassett is impressive as Ramonda. Forest Whitaker is good as Zuri. Andy Serkis gives the performance of a lifetime, as Ulysses Klaue.

The film definitely had its moments and plus points such as great CGI and effects. The fight scenes were a treat to watch and it had a great exotic feel to it.However the story was very predictable and linear in that there were no surprises and nothing too original. The villain, despite a likeable actor, was a weak and uninspired one. The son of traitor who trained in the army and has returned to take the throne.

Marvel did it again!,"I had a small window of an opportunity to go see this movie opening day between things I had to do, and I'm glad I did. That's saying a lot from someone who's used to routines throughout the week.
They pack a lot into this chapter for the panther. I haven't taken the time to actually research the comic book character. Thankfully, there's plenty of exposition at the beginning, which is a good thing considering that there has been plenty of hype for each Marvel movie that comes out. It really helps the audience because this day in age, most people won't bother to do any research. For some movies, yes, you should get on Wikipedia or YouTube the character and see what pops up.
There's a lot that Black Panther is, and there's a lot that it isn't in the way of comic book adaptions. Marvel is getting better and better at keeping the superheroes fresh for the intended audience. The problem with DC is the way they've been handling their superheroes, but that's a whole different topic.
Yes, this is a bit of a political storyline, but at the same time the political side of the movie thankfully doesn't overpower the rest of it. There's plenty of action, ripped guys w their shirts off for the girls to leak their hormones all over, plenty of comedic moments and everything else in between. Martin Freeman's character is rather left hanging on as the comedic role, considering he's done this before w The Hobbit trilogy. 
As far as the culture of Wakanda, it's a mix between Iron Man's work and something you might see in Bruce Wayne's Bat-cave. Several parts made me think they could've used some of this technology in The Dark Knight trilogy. That is one impressive cave the panther has. The only thing that really stood out to me that was different was seeing that one guy who had that ornamental piece attached to his lip, ;-)
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've learned to stop reading reviews and what critics are saying about movies today because all they ever do anymore is shred the filmmakers to pieces.

Saw it 2x and it's even better the 2nd viewing. I see a lot of average movie going fan boys looking for a certain atmosphere that very familiar in the other marvel movies and yet are unaware that this film breaks all of that with food reason. After seeing some of the mixed reviews it's VERY CLEAR that these so called Marvel fans don't read comics as much as they say. Particularly with Black Panther. This movie does does no set ups for sequels or other movies. (Unless u wait for end credits) It strictly holds its own as a solo superhero movie. And of course it speaks to black audiences like no other before it. So obviously NOT EVERYONE will relate to the allegorical messages. However, unless you've been living under a rock, those same messages SHOULD help you understand the perspectives. It's not convoluted nor complex in it's narrative. And I must say.....THE.....BEST....VILLAIN.....EVER. Yes Loki can take a seat. Kilmonger was vicious, dangerous and........relatable. As well as the rest of the cast. Phenomenal job with everyone.

"Yep, Just Another Super Hero Movie","I violated my own embargo on super hero movies in order to finally see what all the fuss was about.You see, I had decided never to watch another super hero movie because....well, because they all suck. But praise for ""Black Panther"" was over the moon, and people were specifically saying that it broke the super hero mold and gave us something unique and reflective of our times. To which I say....""Nope."" This is just another super hero movie, and it follows all of the safe, bland super hero movie conventions.I do appreciate that the film is driven by African American characters and themes, because Lord knows if any genre needed a dose of color (or estrogen for that matter), the super hero genre was it. And I also appreciate how the film uses a super hero movie setting to explore questions of black identity in the larger world. But folks are giving it way too much credit. I was actually shocked by how poorly directed the film was, especially the climactic battle scenes, a hot mess if ever there was one, and how terrible the visual effects were. The film looks incredibly cheap.And it's all just so silly, which is how I feel about all super hero movies. In super hero world, everyone wears ridiculous costumes and speaks in formal, portentous accents, and says things like ""vibranium"" with a straight face. This movie, like others of its ilk, would do well to plant its tongue a bit more firmly in cheek.No, ""Black Panther"" benefited from timing. It was the movie people needed in the cultural moment, and I think audiences were seeing what they wanted to see in it whether it was really there or not.

They are babies, they don't pay attention what happens on screen when there is no fight going on. Of course they are getting bored. They woud like to see a Black Panther movie like 90 minutes about hero fighting ANYONE.They right however, this film is not an average Marvel movie, however i would use the word BETTER, not worse. What I really like that side characters have been built up better than any previous Marvel movie before. Strong acting, but it is true that the lead character should have been better.
Wakanda representation was also OK for a 120min movie which is not a documentary film. This film also give time for such serious questions like migrants, technology sharing, moral decisions.The villain has clear motivations and they found an excellent actor for the role.Actions scenes are pretty good, although i have to mention the CGI had some quality issues, luckily only few times.I recommend to watch this film, but only if you don't want more than a popcorn superhero movie with more fight, less explanation",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Decent Marvel Outing,"I saw this film last night. I found the first half hour pretty slow, but it eventually got going and I found myself enjoying it slightly more than I had anticipated.1. Special Effects: Good, with a few very good parts, especially in a couple of the vision scenes.2. Acting: All characters were well cast, keeping with Marvel's record (in my opinion). Very impressed with Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa. He is believable as a king new to the throne and a man with a good heart who wants to be a good ruler. There was good interaction between him and his cousin, too.3. Story: Average, as stated above, it took a while before I really got into it, probably the longest out of any of the MCU movies.4. Humour: Classic MarvelI rate this film 7/10. It is good fun. I will probably watch again in the future, but I'm in no rush.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Liked It, But Didnt Love it","Going into this, I'll say I've become pretty tired of the established Marvel movie formula, and I'm pretty superheroed out, to be honest.Pros
1: the entire fate of the world / galaxy / universe is at stake. Not some alien creature yet again destroying some planet / world / universe yet again, until our costumed heroes stop them yet again.
2: Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger. Not just your usual 'Enemy of the Week Who Will Be Dead by the End of the Movie'. His ""you killed my father, prepare to die"" Inigo Montoya routine seemed very same old, same old that the reveal of his motivations initially left me fairly dubious. But Michael B. Jordan is so charismatic he sells it.
3: Letitia Wright's absolutely delightful, scene-stealing performance as Shuri in the film, I hope she is used in other movies. Shuri could schoolTony Stark on technology, and I hope Marvel put this in a movie. Wright's portrayal was a bright spot that lifted the dour moments without becoming just lame comic relief.
4: The supporting cast is solid (Not always the case with Marvel) General Okoye, played by Danai Gurira (Michone from Walking Dead). Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, or Lupita Nyong'o, all of whom are excellent in their respective roles as well.
5: Daniel Kaluuya performanceCons
1: The combat scenes are a real problem. The casino battle was too dark and difficult to follow what was going on. The final showdown didn't work as well for me. CGI Hero fights someone with identical powers in a different-coloured CGI suit. How many times have we seen that in Marvel movies?? 
2: The CGI was quite poor at times
3: A bit predictable at times. I appreciated the foreshadowing with the introduction of the second suit, though. As soon as it turned up in Shuri's lab, it was obvious what it would be used for
4: Daniel Kaluuya (he is on both lists) The screenplay really doesn't do him any favours at all!! His character arc is basically ""We're best friends!! Wait. You lost one fight with a guy I hate, so I'm supporting your rival. Then, I've changed my mind, let's be friends again now that my side is losing!"" W'Kabi isn't portrayed as a weaselly character that bends whichever way the wind is blowing!! He's just an underwritten character who just goes back and forth as the plot demands.
5: It lacked an emotional connection for me. When Forest Whitaker died it is played out as a moment that should have left us devastated, but I just wasn't bothered.Overall, I enjoyed it, but it's not up there with my top Marvel movies, let alone my favourite superhero movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A new kind of Superhero,What a great movie. The story is pretty simple but its still pretty interesting to follow. It have some funny moments and interesting action scenes.

"Just another typical marvel movie, rating 1 star is just idiotic.","To be honest, i am not the biggest fan of any of the marvel movies. Most them have weak plots, lots of cgi and 2 years later i can't remember them.
This film is no different to the rest. It is neither overly bad or good.@ People crying about it being over hyped etc. EVERY movie is over hyped. If you havn't learned that by now then you have some serious misgivings.Black panther turned out to be exactly what i thought it would be. Nothing more, nothing less. It has plenty of decent action, a couple of scenes in which you think to yourself ""really?""But all in all rating it 1 star says more about you than this film. Can people PLEASE start making their reviews AFTER thinking first. Don't let the over hype anger you and then rate it 1 star. It is both unfair and and unintelligent way to review.All you see these days in IMDB is 10/10 and 1/10 with very few others in between, unless the movie has an adult audience.

A nice addition to the MCU canon,"Black Panther is a solid, good movie. Nothing less, nothing more. I wasn't as impressed by it as with some other MCU movies, and there were definietly a few flaws, mainly in the action and CGI department. That being said, the positives in this movie most definietly outweigh the negatives. The plot is engaging and showcases the fictional culture of Wakanda nicely. I liked how different it felt than other movies in the MCU, and how it was more about internal political struggles rather than The End of the Entire World as we Know it. The characters are great as well, T'Challa and Erik were both nicely fleshed out, and the side characters were mostly good as well. The chemistry between them all is very delightful. The pacing is solid as well, and so are the emotional moments. I have a few problems with the movie though. The cgi is way too overused at some points, especially the final fight scene. The action itself also feels a bit stiff, the fighting feels a little too slow and unimpactful. The movie also tries to be funny at some points, which more often than not feels extremely tedious. Still though, those flaws aren't enough to make the movie bad, not in the slightest. It's a well told, well written, pretty powerful story that ties nicely into the MCU storyline, and I have no regrets about watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not the best from the MCU,"It's okay not bad it not great, I really wanted to enjoy this movie instead I found myself bored and uninterested.

"Tries to be different, but keeps pulling back to the same.","I want to start this review saying that I think it's really silly that this movie has caused a political discussion. Not because the movie and marketing didn't ask for it, but after watching the film, the movie is really nothing more than another marvel film. The movie does things better and worse compared to other marvel films, but as it stands outside of the spectrum, it's predictable and isn't anything more than a superhero film. I'm very glad we have a superhero film that is this heavy in the representation of the black community during this age of popularity in superhero films, but that's really as far as any ""political stance"" should go into this film.As a movie, it's fine. There wasn't any moment in the film where I felt impressed from what I was looking at, and there were times where I know Marvel can do better. Lets start with what I think it did superior to other marvel films.1. The music. I think this is hands down the best original soundtrack we have gotten from a marvel film, and this is easily on par with the actual usage of their soundtrack outside of the guardian movies. Instead of being generic samey orchestra music that is used in every marvel film, we now have a soundtrack that sticks out from others in the franchise.2. The villains. Marvel has been getting better with their villains since Guardians Vol 2. And this movie has two. Both of which were my favorite performances in the film, being Michael B Jordan and Andy Serkis respectfully. It's really refreshing also seeing a villain you can root for this time around.3. The designs of the characters, world and weapons. How the CGI looked is a topic for later, but i loved the world of Wakanda and watching the characters walk around it. And every character had something in their design that felt right for the character they were playing.And that's really about it. And those things listed above aren't anything real impressive, just good. Now for the negatives.The CGI and all the effects were horrid. And I can't believe some people are trying to say it was passable. Every time the camera was zoomed out and black panther was on screen he looked straight out of a video game. It was superman in Justice League levels of bad. This goes for most of the environments, spaceships, animals etc. I know CGI is necessary for this movie and I'm not bashing CGI, but when you film outside couldn't you just use the outside? what's the point of the green screen and why does it look so bad? Anytime they were in a room that didn't have anything more than 1 level, it was clearly CGI city.Also the jokes. Marvel movies are known for being pretty funny and generally I agree even when the jokes ruin perfectly good scenes, (cough cough Ragnarok, cough cough Guardians 2) the jokes in this movie gave me a smile at most. And I think a dreamworks executive might of mixed his script into this one because there is a ""what are those"" joke, a ""I make it rain"" joke, and a ""whip her hair back and forth"" joke. Way to slap a stamp on this movie that says ""this was made in the 2010's""While the negatives of this film affect my overall score pretty greatly as they are significant parts in the film, the rest of the film is very okay. The story and plot is okay. The dialogue outside of the jokes is okay. The action is okay. If it wasn't for the original setting and feel of the theme in the music this movie would be right alongside Doctor Strange and Ant Man as just another stepping stone for the marvel franchise. I'm glad I watched it, I still enjoyed it, I'm just really not rushing at all to see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Here is what I mean, I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen next. It was very play by play.Some of the visual effects were amazing and some were a little off. The last fight between Killmonger and Black Panther seemed a little repetitive and boring. I expected to see Black Panther have a little more action throughout the film also being a superhero and not fighting so much without his powers.I was left hoping for a little more.

"Emotion, Character development, and Stunning Visuals all while avoiding the Cliches of recent Marvel films.","This film seems to have done something that many Marvel films have been lacking in recent years, it conveyed real emotion. 
There wasn't the regular reliance on quick witted jokes when fight scenes were becoming boring which have become commonplace in Thor, Dr Strange, and Avengers. Instead each fight scene was important for the development of the plot and the character arcs often showing us the struggles characters had choosing their loyalties between country, humanity or their loved ones.
This movie avoided, for the most part, the cliche of the all powerful object which if the enemy get their hands on it will bring about the destruction of the universe as we know it. In Black Panther the story trying to be told is of the dangers of isolationism and the conflicts and caveats to blind loyalty to your country not the normal story told in Marvel films of fighting against the threat of the destruction of the universe. There a thread of ideas weaved throughout this film, illusions to the injustices of colonialism and slavery, and the many injustices that persist in our world today like the ever widening wealth inequality on earth and across the USA. This change of tone may have thrown some regular Marvel enthusiasts off slightly but it is vitally important. I believe that the inability to see these messages or the rejection of the truth in them is something that has driven many bad reviews on this site.
The director and writer managed to build multiple interesting characters all with developed characteristics and understandable reasoning behind their actions. Our main antagonist for example had an important relatable world view and his motivations were not so different from many of the hero's of Marvel and DC.
I am thoroughly shocked at the amount of negative reviews on this site and have noticed that the only criticisms they have been able to conjure could be applied to any comic book based film from the last 10 years. It seems they've been placed here to slander the film when there is little evidence that any of these 'critics' have actually taken the time to watch this film.
I need not mention the great things this film has done for the empowerment of poc and women. As a white man I may be the wrong person to represent what Hollywood's acceptance that a film like this needed to be made means to the world. With a nearly all black cast and strong female characters in positions we wouldn't normally see them in technology and war we're finally seeing some progress. I'm happy to see that Hollywood is changing its ways and I hope this isn't just an isolated example.
Along with Winter Soldier, Guardians and Wonder Woman I rate this as one of Marvels greatest successes, I hope they continue to make movies like this in the future and less of the over reliance of Bathos that we've seen in recent years in Dr Strange and Avengers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Black Panther is a political statement disguised as an exciting superhero blockbuster.,"The enormity of the pressure that has manifested over time for this film has been nothing short of extraordinary. Not just for Marvel Studios as they continue their effortless cinematic universe, but for the multicultural film industry. The biggest blockbuster featuring a predominantly black cast, I have to applaud every single contribution made...they never succumbed to the pressure and have produced one of Marvel's stronger chapters. T'Challa returns to Wakanda after the events of 'Civil War' and must prove to be a worthy successor to the throne. Meanwhile, the precious resources secluded in this region are slowly becoming noticed by other nations, to which a worthy adversary soon arrives to challenge T'Challa. We are presented with an ever present scale. Either securing an extremely powerful material for the benefit of one nation or distributing it to other countries to establish a sense of hierarchy. This subtle political message adds that additional layer of depth amidst the hectic action. Boasted by energetic engrossing performances from all cast members, and we have ourselves a successful blockbuster. The story surprisingly was thick with plenty of world building, memorable characters and a few shifts in motives that provide some complexity to the narrative. A barrage of humour, some jokes land and several lines do not...I'm looking at you whoever included ""What are those!?"". The fight choreography was well executed, particularly during the ritual challenges. The visual effects were put to good use, Wakanda's architecture and technology was creatively inventive. The human CGI still remains mediocre, and is ridiculously noticeable during the final battle. The soundtrack masterfully blends African drums with American beats, highlighting modern and cultural significance. Oh, and finally a villain that just doesn't want to destroy the world. How refreshing. It really does come to no surprise that Marvel Studios continue their current dominance in blockbuster cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great addition to the Marvel universe that stands alone,"I made an account just to review this movie because I think it is worth the hype. If you haven't seen the numerous other Marvel movies, fear not. Black Panther stands on its own, and doesn't feel like an episode in a series like many of the other Marvel films. Most of the film takes place in Wakanda, an African dreamland that is both traditional and futuristic. When the film jumps to other locations around the world like London and South Korea (got to target that Asian market) I found myself wishing they would go back to Wakanda just because it is so visually stunning. The plot is solid and the actors are excellent. So much in fact, I wish they had spent more time on character development. The film seems to focus more on the villian, Killmonger, than the hero, T'Challa. I'm not complaining though, because Killmonger is an interesting character, and Michael B. Jordan is captivating. Black Panther brings up some heavy themes, and I think they could have gone further with them. Maybe in the sequels (I hope there will be sequels!) they will. The set design, costumes, and especially the music of Black Panther make it a joy to watch. I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good movie, definitly not the best film of all time like the hype, but solid effort","I saw it last night with a fellow comic book nerd in a theater with about 30 folks. Unfortunately, 20 of them were little kids who came on a church bus and talked loudly through the whole movie. The plot was solid and the action was great. The CGI was pretty bad in a few places, (a missing arm that you can kind of see). We liked the tech and there were a couple of laughs. The bad guy was believable with motivation that was on track. There was a romance that played well. Overall a great effort from Marvel. The politics kept us away and when I said it was 4/5 stars on FB it only took a few minutes before someone called me racist. Like Wonder Woman (which was also a 4/5 star film for me), they don't get the absurd statement. If you like a movie because it has a woman you are sexist just as if you dislike a movie because it has a woman. Same thing here with race. Race did not play into my enjoyment of the film. It was good. It wasn't in my top 5 superhero movies. Maybe my top 10. I'd recommend it. One of the best things about it is they kept it PG13, no cussing or nudity or over the top violence.

"Black Panther, A new stand alone movie form marvel.","If there is anything that makes you more happier than watching a marvel movie first day-first show, then this film is for you. Just a humble reminder, this review is SPOILER FREE,so read along.
Firstly, you aren't a true marvel fan if you are reading this, but if you are not sure and are confused about the mixed reception this movie is getting, then may be you should consider going through this article.
CAST-
The casting, as every other marvel film is just perfect. Chadwick Boseman, who was last seen dawning the black panther outfit in Captain America- Civil war has done justice to the role, and we all loved his performance as king of Wakanda. Micheal Jordon who plays the lead antagonist in the film is rumoured to be the best marvel villain after Loki (and of course excluding the titan Thanos) but I would like to disagree. The role did demand a level of seriousness, but I loved Andy Serkis as Klaw.He did cracked us up with his great coming timing and funny behaviour.Coming to the female lead Nupita Nyong'o, am I the only one or she really looks similar to Jennifer Lawrence? The rest of the cast faithfully presented as their respective soles demanded.The writers did an amazing job in telling us a story of Wakanda, and linking it to El dorado. It does gets a bit predictable at times, but you do have a good share of scenes where you involuntarily will go ""Ohhhhhs"" & ""Ahhhhhhs"".
The action scenes are few but brilliantly executed,and the Wakandan empire, the most advance country in marvel cinematic universe does blow your mind with all its science and technology.I can identify why people are not appreciate the movie and the ratings are also not what it deserved. The first one being inadequate action (perhaps?). The trailer packed us all with loads of excitement,but the movie was more of a great plot and drama but a bit less of action. Also, there are obviously going to be comparison between this movie and the last marvel film, Thor-Ragnarok. The third instalment for the Thor series, is considered,by far, the best marvel film ever, and mainly due to its superb comic timing. Black panther too does boast scenes which tickle your funny bone, but we also need to understand that this is the first Black panther stand alone movie, and considering that the movie is fit to be called a blockbuster. Not to forget what marvel movies are famous for, a good Stan Lee cameo and a post credit scene as well, which I not going to reveal.DO NOT READ this paragraph if you haven't watched the movie till now.
The greatest disappointment was that there was no sign of the soul stone. There were a lot of valid arguments and speculations about soul stone to be introduced in this movie, which didn't come true.My conclusion is that no matter what the world thinks,this is a marvel film and YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fun and significant.,"Black Panther, to which I took foster son yesterday. Like many parents, I've taken him to many superhero movies. He loves them; each time, though, we're sitting there seeing white people/men doing amazing things in America or Europe. How refreshing, then, to sit with my brown-skinned (foster) son and see a cast of people who represent him for a change, doing amazing things in Africa and doing so without white people rescuing them. How refreshing to see a vision of Africa without colonisation; how refreshing to see a hero character who learns something from the villain and where Africa has something to teach and give to the world. How refreshing for a South African audience to hear a South African language in a mainstream movie. How refreshing to hear the round of applause as the audience recognised their stories being told, the laughs of recognition. I don't think my foster son is aware enough of the context to appreciate the significance of this movie, but I was moved and thrilled. As a white Western male I've seen too much of an idealised vision of myself on the screen; I want my children to be able to see themselves in films like this, with inspiring women and the stories of black people being told in films that are both good and fun.

Everything in this film it's a hit or miss.,"I got to see this film a few a days back and It was....mind numbingly mediocre just like most other MCU films. Maybe I had too high expectations for it due to the hype but a lot of elements felt way worse than other marvel flicks.The action(both fight scenes and action set pieces) ranged from semi-decent to God awful. The final fight in particular had terrible CGI and wonky physics. The normal fight scenes weren't that good either. They were both shot(sometimes it feels like the cameraman is having a seizure while the combatants are having a slap fight, sample of what you're going to get I guess) and choreographed terribly. It's like they watched the fight style of the Raid films but forgot hire good stuntmen and choreographers.The MCU can do really intense fight scenes like the elevator fight in TWS but nothing in this movie comes even close to that. So anyone expecting badass fights based on BPs scenes in civil war, you're going to be massively disappointed.Edit: sample of the final fight I am talking about as wellThis isn't a work print. This is what you will get in the cinema. I got called a troll for saying it. So you can look at it yourselves.If anybody thought the CGI in wonder woman climax was a turn off , then you're certainly not going to like this and unlike WW the CGI is like this in most CGI heavy scenes in the film.(particularly the car chase yikes).The world building is good if you think Bright and the Star wars prequels had great world building. It just felt artificial for the most part(again partly because of the mediocre CGI), you're not going to get a memorable location like the cantina bar or the Troll market from Hellboy 2 which feels like real places with it's own unique personalities. Wakanda for the most part like Asgard has a few cool establishing shots where we see some interesting designs but they're are not really fleshed out much and again the uneven CGI isn't exactly helping.The villain is above 99% of other marvel villains for he mere fact he has a lasting impact on he hero and for being somewhat sympathetic, though I felt the characterization itself was a bit disjointed. However his dialogue is often absolute cringe, he seems to awkwardly switch on and off his AAVE which just seems forced. I thought his final piece dialogue for example was absolutely forced and cringeworthy. The actor, I think did his best with what he got and he felt more interesting than the rest of the characters in the movie.The music was decent in this movie(though I didn't care for the rap which was mostly centered around Eric but then again I am not huge rap fan, so don't out too much weight on my opinion on this one). Most of it's themes are pretty obvious and blatant as well.This movie definitely isn't going to win any awards for subtlety.Overall, the movie just felt generic.I know movies are subjective but anyone who says this is a masterpiece or groundbreaking in anyway whether it be effects, acting,action or even the plot(I don't think this movie does anything new or anything that's even new for CBMs except for the nearly all black cast I guess) is quite frankly a fanboy or someone who hasn't watched much films.That's all I have to say about this movie. It's solid 5/10 for me but I am guessing if you liked the previous MCU films you'll probably enjoy this as well but for others go in with tempered expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wakanda Forever,"Black Panther is a worthy installment to MCU. The movie truly succeeds as a movie basing on the hero after being first introduced in Civil War thanks to very solid writing that has given a great story and a ton of entertaining and intense action. The characters are likable too. And it has features beautiful visuals and cinematography that brought Wakanda to life. I won't spoil anything, but the final battle has demonstrated its message against hatred. If you're a true Marvel fan that would like to see Black Panther part of MCU, definitely go check it out. I would honestly say this is one of the better movies from MCU. Rest In Peace, Chadwick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"was it good, yes, worth all the hype, no","Had its moments, and was enjoyable, but they hype train derails pretty quick.
I did like how the story was about Black Panther, and his origin as king, not really about him becoming BP (he was already that in Civil War). There were lots of people saying things like ""breaks the Marvel mold"" This is a brave new direction for superhero films"".
It doesn't and its not. The only one that has changed the mold was Winter Soldier, a movie that was a spy thriller first and a super hero movie second, but we are not talking about that movie here.
The acting in the movie, for the most part, is fine. Some actors really did need to step up their game, but they didn't get too much time wasted on them.The villain, though better with his motives, was just as forgettable as the rest of the villains in this franchise.If you are a marvel fan, yes you will like it, if you are a super hero fan, yes you will like it....will you need to come back and see it again...well I don't, but hey maybe they hype worked on you....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A visually stunning and culturally aware Marvel Movie,"Black Panther stands out from all of the other MCU entries by taking a deep dive into culture, and making a villain who isn't necessarily the bad guy. Everyone on the cast does a really great job of bringing the characters to life. They aren't two-dimensional, and have rich backstories, that aren't cliche. My favorite part of this movie has to be Micheal B. Jordan as Killmonger. He does a really good job of portraying someone who has dealt with a tremendous loss in thier life, and is fueled by grief and rage. It's nice to see a villain who isn't really a villain, just a person who is doing bad things, but for (to some) good reason. The film itself is visually stunning, with long drawn out scenes of sunsets, and skylines. Unfortunately, the green screen effects don't always work, and that is a big disappointment, especially when some of the scenes are breathtaking. I personally don't love the films ending, but that didn't really make the movie any less enjoyable. This is one of my favorite Marvel movies so far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The villain did me in.....,"The movie itself was pretty good, if not politically charged, but what can you expect these days.

The big drag was the villain, the character was poorly developed, shallow, he almost didn't even fit in the movie it was so bad.

One of the better Marvel movies,"Black Panther is a superhero movie, that binds sci-fi, comedy, and action nicely. It's what makes this movie so great. Everything ties so well together. The Violence isn't very bad compared to other action movies, there are stabbings throughout though. But most of them are in low detail. Characters do get impaled, but then again it looks fake (Looks like someone took a spear split it in half, and glue the ends between the person with red dyed glue). There are tons of explosions, a few shootings with armed or weak armed people. It is more violent than any other movie from marvel (if we exclude the Rated R ones) from the last 5 years, but it's a great deal. Only a few kissing and make outs and nothing more. Men are shirtless, but for tribal reasons, and never sexual. The action scenes get pretty tense, tight, understanding, shocking and emotional.

I looked the scene where people in various running costumes gather sound a waterfall. That was spectacular. The story itself is very engaging, and it's great to see both traditional and superhero style fights in ample quantities. The cities are very stylish as well. It is a great blend of enough elements and futuristic elements. There are also plenty of rises and falls in the plot to engage the viewers. The visuals are great as well.

"I Don't Get The Hype, But I Liked It","I just watched Black PantherI enjoyed it at the cinema, but truthfully it has not held up for me on repeat viewings. Whilst I appreciate the cultural significance of the movie, a Best Picture Oscar nomination it did not deserve. It wasn't even the best Marvel movie of the year (That honour goes to Logan).Chadwick Boseman is slightly over shadowed by a ridiculously charismatic turn by Michael B Jordan. Forest Whittaker and Angela Bassett are both good, as are Danai Girira and Lupia Nyong'o It is Letitia Wright who steals the show as Shuri however, she is a delight.The action scenes are all well done, but the final fight left me a bit bored as two faceless CGI characters slugged it outOverall I liked it, I just do not get why it was so over praised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
New look super hero is welcome addition.,"Black Panther is a generic super hero semi sci-fi grounded on earth featuring the offbeat casting of an all black cast in the first feature of another Star War's franchise. With it's pacifist warrior lead (Chadwick Boseman) it offers up a less stoic more in touch with his feelings super hero that resonates beyond the action with underlying statement but ultimately relies on it's bread an butter action to seal the deal.Oakland gang banger and rightful heir to the throne of Wakanda, C'halla, is recalled to his country to take up the crown and deal with a crisis involving vibranium, the key to the country's incredibly advanced society. C'halla would like to promote the technology to help oppressed people throughout the world but it has fallen into the wrong hands and his attempts to retrieve it are being distracted by challengers from the throne; first from the imposing mountain people and then a crass one man war machine from the USA by the name of Kilmonger (Michael B. jordan). Kilmonger is no pretender to the throne however and is allowed rightful challenge to the crown.Panther breaks no new ground as the first all black Hollywood production but it certainly is a step forward in the evolution of the black film in Hollywood from the well intentioned Halleluah (29) to the talent laden Cabin in the Sky ( 43) to the abysmal The Wiz. Unlike the cliches, the patronizing and mocking (in the case of The Wiz just an incredible waste of talent) Black Panther maintains its dignity from end to end but most importantly offers a welcome twist to the Marvel franchise to film in setting, character and plot.Boseman is an approachable an amiable breath of fresh air without the stilted stoicism as the super hero, his actions involving a lot more familial activity with a precocious sister to play off as well as have a partner with a backbone. This well grounded humanity may serve him well in future episodes, creating problems and missteps on his part, causing him to drop his guard when it calls for steel resolve, enabling for chaos and confrontation and allowing the action fantasy film to do what it does best in this age of technology, speed, blowing things up and super human effort in making the Universe a better place.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wakanda won me over!,"I was honored to receive an invite to attend an advanced screening of Marvel's latest release, ""Black Panther"". I will be honest I didn't know a lot about this character before reading about him recently and seeing the film. The story line crosses both racial and cultural lines which has made this super hero a fan favorite for more than 50 years and I really love him now too. He is a fierce fighter and is empathetic to those around him. He has a big heart and wants to do his very best.T'Challa is haunted by the mistakes of his father and is also a flawed person but puts a lot of pressure on himself to be the best king he can be for his people. During his transformation to King he goes to the land of his ancestors and is able to have a brief talk with his father. His father assures him he will be a good king but it will be hard because he has a good heart. This is a weakness and something he has to figure out how to balance with his leadership and superhero roles. I really enjoyed watching Mr. Boseman as this character and he brought not only a fierceness to the role but also a sensitivity and a humor that was just so human and optimistic. Things might be hard but he tried to come with an openness and we saw more of that come to fruition as the movie progressed.I loved the entire cast of this movie and felt like the right people were put into the right roles. I can't imagine anyone else playing these characters. The performances were incredibly strong although I definitely felt like Shuri, T'Challa's sister played by Letitia Wright, stole the show. I just loved her character! She was strong, funny and intelligent. She is the force behind inventing much of the Wakandan modern technology (if this was Bond, she would be Q) and most specifically the Black Panther suit. On top of all that, she is a character girls are going to look to and be inspired by. I really loved the chemistry between all of the characters and felt like they genuinely liked or loved each other. It didn't feel forced.I felt like the action really kept in line with what is shown in other Marvel movies. In fact I felt like there was less fighting and violence in this film than in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and some of the other Marvel Studios films. There is sword play and a couple of scenes using guns but the most dramatic fight scenes are hand to hand battles for the throne.After seeing this movie I couldn't help thinking back to last year and seeing the new ""Wonder Woman"". Seeing a woman yield such incredible power, yet being allowed to also be tender, hit me so hard. I walked away from Black Panther with the same feeling I had with ""Wonder Woman"". Seeing fierce, powerful, intelligent, tender women standing up and being a part of the action spoke to me and I cheered for them every time they picked up a spear or showed the technology they created or acted as advisers. I really liked that the women were treated as equals. There was equal ""saving of each other"", never portraying the women as weaker and needing help. They worked together. This spoke to the message at the end of the film that we all need to learn that we are one tribe on this earth and we all need to look out for each other.We highly recommend the film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a good film,"The hype around this film during its initial release was overwhelming, I may not agree with it but it's understandable as Black Panther is the first film in MCU to feature a predominantly black cast. Which is something that's rare and has been underrepresented in the MCU, and cinema in general. I thought the writing and directing were all very good. And also the film is technically an excellent movie. Visually Black Panther is stunning. The cinematography (especially in Wakanda) is incredible. The visual effects used during the fights/action set pieces are excellent ( tho the CGI is dodgy in most parts). I also like the costumes, in particular those of the various Wakandan tribes. The make-up effects also deserve some praise. The soundtrack is very impressive; the rhythm of the drums give that authentic African feel; and the modern music is integrated perfectly to intensify the action. In terms of performances; Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa does a pretty good job. As the new King, he has so much going on around him; Not only must he deal with the external matter of preventing someone from using vibranium as a destructive weapon but he must also face internal challenges for his crown. T'Challa could have sat back and enjoyed his position, maintaining the status quo. Instead however, he felt it a duty to consider what he believed to be the failings of past Wakandan monarchs and do what he believed was right for this generation.
Michael B Jordan as the villain Erik Killmonger is also amazing. The character's motivations, albeit villainous could in a way almost be justified. This is what made him such an interesting character. The rest of the supporting casts are good in their performances.On the whole, Black Panther is being deem as a perfect film, which I don't agree but I still think it is a well done origin superhero flick. The cast performance is terrific and the technical aspects are all good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

He's relatable, yet so so menacing... an actual threat for not T'challa or the world perse, but the goal of T'challa.. to his actual legacy. The women were amazing and empowering, showing they can also love and choose to be warriors(not because they cant come out of wakanda.........).Cinematogrophy/VFX 9/10: Beautiful.

The movements are very gracious and quick, which make for wonky image sometimes.Story 10/10: This story is AIRTIGHT. For me it was kind of a perfect. Everything wove in perfectly. Every storybit had a pay off. The scenes served the story and not the other way around, which results in a rewarding film and is very rare. I think I only saw that in maybe civil war, winter soldier and the dark knight.All in All, I cant stop loving this film. It is perfect for me.

Generic writing but still a perfect film especially for Marvel.,"Marvel has been on a streak of good superhero and I'm pretty sure they managed to outdo their work compared to DC Comics. Seeing Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was amazing and I was looking forward to seeing him in an actual film.So this takes place right after Captain America Civil War when T'Challa returns back to this nation Wakanda after his father dies in an attack. While there, he decides to take his throne and rule Wakanda until suddenly a powerful enemy N'Jakada invades the nation and has intentions of destroying Wakanda. How T'Challa defeats N'Jakanda and protects the nation of Waanda is basically what this film is all about.Creed fame Ryan Coogler introduces a superhero film also ""the first black superhero"" of marvel (not racist but praising Marvel for their generosity of how much respect they're showing towards human race). His script was abit of a dissapointment because the movie had a very predictable story and eventually after 45 minutes of the film, the audience will for sure find out what will happen to N'Jakanda. The pacing was a bit slow but that still doesn't shy away for mbeing a perfect.Luckily there things that were integral to Black Panther such as showing a science fictional version of Africa to traditional clothing. The VFX was fantastic and that is all hats off to MS (Marvel Studios). The look of Busan and Wakanda was just commendable and delightful to watch on the big screen. The action was well choreographed and seeing Marvel with their remarkable efforts doesn't lack justice.Acting was a phenomenon. Chad Boswick playing T'Challa/Black Panther will just knock your socks off. He was exhilirating and edgy which proves how he is superhero material. Michael B Jordan was the major highlight of the film and his villainous attempt as N'Jakande shows a perfect match of subtlety. Lupita Noyong'o and seeing her as the African spy was defintiely worth devouring espcially how she manages to come clean with ther accent.Overall, this film may not be perfect because of the average writing but the entertainment of it is something the audience should go and experience.3.75/5 - Atleast it is a perfect film for the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A refreshing take on a familiar story,"#MCUrewatch. The strengths of Black Panther are quite obvious: the traditional African setting, score and rituals (in the eyes of us Westeners) mixed with the tropes of the MCU. It is a refreshing take on a by now familiar superhero story. The thematic references to slavery and racism are nice touches to a comic book story. The fictious world of Wakanda is interesting in the details and the backstory of villain Killmonger makes him one of the more nuanced bad guys. Great performances by Andy Serkis and Letitia Wright. But Chadwick Boseman is not as charismatic as Downey Jr or Pratt. Michael B Jordan is more impressive (sorry you Boseman fans).

Marvel's fantasy version of Obama vs. Trump and 'Lord of the (Vibranium) Ring ',"The Black Panther is written to be to pander too many different types of people, and in the end impresses no one and draws a 'meh' from everyone.In a nutshell, the movie is the story of the 'black panther' becoming king and learning that 'heavy lies the head that wears the crown' in the process.It is a comic book movie and seems to be written for kids. The characters lack depth. There is a fair bit of hyperbole and even over-acting in some scenes, which might appeal to the younger audience.There are several plot holes and some attempts to conceal plot holes are ill explained and contrived for the sake of subsequent action scenes. So, it seems the writers made and attempt to create a coherent narrative but did not do a good job of it.If the movie kept itself to a simple comic action movie fanfare, then it would be fine. Unfortunately, the movie delves into mature territory of race issues and falls woefully short of reasonable treatment of this serious topic.Implicit in the movie is the confrontation between the politically left-wing 'black panther' and his right-wing cousin. As the movie progresses, the black panther becomes a politically centrist (essentially Obama) and the antagonist becomes ultra right-wing (almost Trump). Consequently, Black Panther could also have been called Obama vs. Trump. The Republican audience in US would call the writers of this movie as 'snowflakes' for the movie is clearly biased in favor of the left-wing 'black panther'.The humor in the movie came from the confrontation between Gholum (Andy Serkis) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) as they were both after 'Precious Ring' (Vibranium metal) which gives great power for global conquest. Martin Freeman also plays the 'token white friend' in the movie where the joke is the inversion of the 'token black friend', but Martin Freeman's character has to be schooled in movie logic that 'token friend' has no meaningful dialogue.Overall, Black Panther could and should have been much better than it was. It had the obligation to make a bold statement without the need to pander to people's prejudices. That after all is what art is!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Love the diversity of this movie.,"I find it ironic that for an ethnic race that is always in the limelight screaming for equality, for diversity, for attention...that the movie has no diversity at all when the movie is directed by a black person and written by two black people. If you google, 'black panther movie cast' and click on the cast icon, It shows 48 cast members of which 38 are black people, 8 white people, and 2 Asians. Don't you love the diversity in this movie? Movies and tv series have been changing characters from white to black lately. To give examples: Superman(Michael B Jordan's Superman), Mary Jane Watson(Spiderman), Kingpin(Daredevil), Catwoman(The Batman/Catwoman), Jimmy Olsen(Supergirl), Johnny Storm(Fantastic Four), Perry White(Man of Steel), Harvey Dent(Batman), Deadshot(Suicide Squad), Heimdall(Thor), Nick Fury(Marvel Studio Films), Martian Manhunter(Smallville/Supergirl), Alicia Masters(Fantastic Four), Pete Ross(Smallville), Iris West(The Flash), Electro(Amazing Spiderman 2), Baron Mordo(Doctor Strange), Callisto(X-Men Last Stand), Manchester Black(Supergirl), Starfire(Titans), Hawkgirl(Legends of Tomorrow) to name a few just in the Super Hero genre. If you are going to diversify and change the vision for the creator's characters, you are essentially changing the essence of the characters themselves. To give you examples: Black Panther, Luke Cage, Storm, Amanda Waller, Aqualad, Black Lightning, Bishop, Green Lantern John Stewart, Shadow Hawk, Spawn, Ironheart, Sunspot, War Machine, Lady Hawk, Misty Knight, Falcon, Shadowman, and Blade...let's diversify and make them WHITE.

not as good or as bad as you've heard (in the opinion of this reviewer),"One of the most hyped movies I think has ever been released, 'Black Panther' is definitely something special for Marvel, but to cinema as a whole it is somewhat mixed. Most everything about it is at least competent (except for SOME of the lesser CGI effects), but the final battle is less than compelling or entertaining, sadly drowning out some of the really great things in this film that would make it more worth a rewatching. For most of the film's running time, I genuinely enjoyed it, particularly in its first half. There is some really good humor (although there were a few moments that were rather eye-rolling in their unfunniness), some great action (I thought every action sequence was almost perfectly handled UNTIL the lengthy and frankly boring battle the film climaxes with), some very interesting concepts explored in a very fair and well done way, and an extraordinarily compelling villain whose arc does contain some real sympathy and understanding. Much of the film is a fun, entertaining ride, but towards the end it does unfortunately fall apart and breaks into some pointlessly loud and disorienting scenes of generic action and such. A very good film that could have been groundbreaking if some flaws were fixed. Not as bad as some w/overly high expectations or even an alt-right-esque racial agenda might have you think, not as great as some liberal critics and hyper reactionary twitter users may have you think; instead, it is a bit of a fun improvement of the standard Marvel affair that contains various elements that I feel could have made up a masterpiece but were sadly put slightly down by some of the film's weaker ones.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"this is an outstanding movie, especially for being a super hero film","Black Panther (2018) is a movie we saw in theatres as soon as it came out. The storyline focuses on an African civilization that has kept itself isolated from the world and contains unique disciplines, scientific and societal advancements within their establishment. When an entitled young man with a troubled past has a different way he feels those virtues should be applied to the civilization's way of life, he decides to disrupt their equilibrium and take charge. Can the chosen king of the African civilization emerge and stop him? This movie is directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed) and stars Chadwick Boseman (42), Michael B. Jordan (Just Mercy), Lupita Nyong'o (Us), Angela Bassett (Vampire in Brooklyn), Forest Whitaker (Last King of Scotland) and Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out). The storyline for this has a lot of depth on social and perception issues. I really enjoyed the depiction of the female's strength and their lack of backing down for what's right. They were probably the best part of the movie. The backdrops and special effects were out of this world. The supporting cast with the various subplots were very well done. This picture was executed in a very thorough fashion, whether it was the outstanding fight sequences, issues that need to be overcome, or how their fictitious perceptions of society is something our society badly needs.

Must watch with friends,"Good Movie. I think this movie was Chadwick Boseman at his career best. Amazing Graphics.. Just like every Marvel Movie. Nevertheless, boseman was the best suited for the role of Black Panther. Storyline was similar to any Marvel movie. There was humor in between and the fight scenes without the suit looked realistic. I think Black Panther could have more powers because he is a Super Hero who has gained his strength from the past. Wakanda seems to be portrayed as a safe place for fighting Thanos in Avengers. I also believed that there exists a place called Wakanda after watching the movie. However, if there were any sequels to Black Panther, i would not be much interested. The story was predictable and i watched the movie once for the graphics and to know what superpowers Black Panther could have.

Strange to see so much hatred towards this,"I am not a fan of Marvel production and find superhero movies infantile, so it amazes me to see so many comments pointing out how stupid and illogical the premises are in a superhero movie :)I was therefore surprised that I actually enjoyed the film and the entertainment it provided. I thought acting was good for the genre it was in (again, what kind of Shakespearean depth can you expect in an action movie? What are you comparing it with, Iron Man? Please.). I absolutely loved the visuals, the costumes were great. The idea of having a magical yet also cultural narrative to a superhero film makes it that much more like an actual movie. The female warriors and the general male-female dynamic is quite a statement in itself for a movie in this genre as well. I guess those who hate on the film are not able to appreciate these aspects. It's sad to see so many people calling this (and those who reviewed it positively) political. But we live in a post-factual hyper-reality so I guess it's the new norm, unfortunately.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Rousing Spectacle!,"One of the Biggest Box-Office Blockbusters of All-Time, 'Black Panther' is PURE Popcorn Entertainment! This Panther is a true superhero, whose cultural triumph is even more important than its storytelling propose.'Black Panther' Synopsis: T'Challa, the King of Wakanda, rises to the throne in the isolated, technologically advanced African nation, but his claim is challenged by a vengeful outsider who was a childhood victim of T'Challa's father's mistake.Predictable to a fault, 'Black Panther' is a zesty blend of mesmeric action & predictable cliches. Having said that, there's no denying that this worthy critical & commercial smash never fails to engage its viewer.Ryan Coogler & Joe Robert Cole's Screenplay is up for the claps as it rightly establishes Stan Lee's raging Superhero. And make no mistake, the experience & joy of watching an Black Cast delivering explosive action & drama, is one of its own. The Writing is well-done, although the second-hour does give inn to many cliches, that do effect its impact overall. But, for the most part, the Writing is nicely sustained. Coogler's Direction is superb. The Director seems to be confident & assured in his first blockbuster directorial effort. Cinematography & Editing are done with merit. Art & Costume Design are excellent. Graphics are top-notch. Action-Sequences are simply spell-binding. Ludwig G√∂ransson's score is rocking.Performance-Wise: Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther, is charismatic all through. He has the heroic presence to hold his own. Michael B. Jordan as N'Jadaka / Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens, is over-the-top. Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia, is charming. Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi, passes muster. Danai Gurira as Okoye, is first-rate. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue, is a strong, persuasive menace. Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross, is effective. Angela Bassett as Ramonda, is adequate. Forest Whitaker as Zuri, does not deliver. His role appears forced.On the whole, 'Black Panther' offers a strong impact & its cultural importance, is impossible to ignore. Lets Marvel This!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Black Panther is unfortunately the least best amongst the other marvel movies out there!,"I kept wondering how the story about wakanda's super secret city & strength be revealed to the audience. And I couldn't have expected any better, simpler, crispier father-son narrative on why wakanda is the way it is!
Black Panther covers most of Marvel's ingredients, but it feels to have gravely lacked in finding the proportions. There were hardly a couple of scenes that was really funny. Neither the story nor the plot felt fulfilling. Story was weak, didn't cover much but just revolved around the technical advances of Wakanda's super secret city and its rituals. Plot could have been better, didn't have much coverage either. VFX was really good, and that was it.
Killmonger was shown the main villain, but for some reason Klaw seemed a better and audience loving villain who got killed in a jiffy. Killmonger needed a stronger background and story showing him more competitive to the black panther, but it was just his muscles, attitude and an american accent that took more coverage (oh i missed ""Nay"". You'll know what i mean).
 Black Panther is not as much a negative movie as i might have made it sound, but the expectations for various reason were so high, that the movie just failed to meet it. Although it is a definite 1 time watcher, but one lacks the content of having watched a full-package Marvel movie simply because there just wasn't enough of everything.Black Panther a one time watcher if you are a Marvel's fan. Else the film will interest you only in parts.

Wonder Woman is still the best superhero film ever made,"This is your typical Marvel film, which is not a bad thing in itself. It has top level special effects, great action sequences, gorgeous settings and costumes. What it doesn't have is a very good storyline - it's totaly predictable and rather weak. This film also suffers - as usual in Marvel films - from the villain deficiency sindrome: the villian is simply too weak and totaly uninteresting.
As for the actors, they're all good and obiously capable of much more, but they all did what was asked of them flawlessly. But none of them will win any awards for this film, and that's the truth. Chadwick Boseman makes a competent hero, though not a very memorable one. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o stand out as two very strong and gorgeous women (I think I'm a little in love with Lupita Nyong'o, she's one of the most beautifull women I've ever seen and an extraordinary actress). Andy Serkis is awsome, as always. Michael B. Jordan stands out for the negative, as possibly one of the worst and dullest villains in movie history.

The way the director creates each individual character is very unique they each character has special characteristics that is unique to them.

Amazing...,"""Black Panther"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch follow the story of T'Challa the king of Wakanda. He has to lead his people on a new era and also defend it by a new threat.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot, contained plenty of action scenes and it was accompanied with a beautiful music (won the Academy Award for the Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures) and the costumes of the characters were simply amazing (won the Academy Award for the Best Achievement in Costume Design). The interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as T'Challa was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michael B. Jordan's who played as Erik Killmonger, Lupita Nyong'o's who played as Nakia, Letitia Wright's who played as Shuri and Martin Freeman's who played as Everett K. Ross.

As a cultural moment - 10; As a superhero movie - 6.5,"You have to be suspicious of any movie that sets out to deliberately break new ground. ""Wonder Woman,"" for example, was a pretty good movie but had some flaws. It got a pass from critics because it was the first woman superhero movie. Had it stared Chris Hemsworth or Tom Cruise, it would have been treated much more harshly.""Black Panther"" does a fabulous job of building a super advanced civilization in the heart of Africa. The depth, complexity and thought that went into all of this was truly delightful. Too bad it could not have been explored in a ""Game of Thrones"" style long-format story ark. As it was, we spend almost half the movie world-building for a disappointingly small payoff in terms of story. The middle drags while so much track is being laid.The story is OK. ""Iron Man"", by way of comparison, was a great movie because of the main character's growth ark. We saw an immature and deeply flawed Tony Stark come into true adulthood. He emerges from the shadow of his father and faces the truth about the deadly weapons he creates. In ""Black Panther"" we see T'Challa also emerge into true adulthood. He starts as an admirable and nearly perfect Prince and develops into an admirable and slightly more perfect King. The growth ark is interesting but underwhelming.The truly fascinating character is Killmonger (Michael Jordan) and his sidekick Claw (Andy Serkis). We end up wishing more of the movie had been about them rather than T'Challa's angst over whether to be just noble or really really noble.Still, definitely worth seeing. The creative detail and near total immersion into alternative African culture makes up for the lackluster character development and predictable story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Magic metal,"It seems like Marvel movies are intent of developing invincible villains and heroes to stand against them through some combination of extraterrestrial god powers, magic, or incredible technology. In this case, it is a magical herb and a magical metal. We've seen vibranium before but now they've added magical healing powers and who knows what else. Throw in the fact that a relatively small nation has hidden technology that appears to be dozens, if not hundreds, of years ahead of the world. And I don't even want to talk about the political undertones.Kudos for not having scenes that fictionally destroy millions upon millions of dollars of infrastructure and vehicles not to mention potential lives in major cities. There is still plenty of cold-blooded killing and a villain whose only character trait is hatred. When the big bad battle takes place, it's fought with weapons that appear on the outside to be medieval technology but really pack a futuristic whollop.The action and graphics are first rate, as always with Marvel. The acting is stilted for the most part. There is a story, but it's a pretty old one with no surprises.The movie also avoids one of my pet peeves with several of the latest Marvel movies.

"Not as good at the hype suggests, but still a solid chapter in the MCU","Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther was one of the best characters in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. He was the ultimate hero; cool, confident, and determined to stop evil. Two years later, he's starring in his own film that shifts him into the leading role. While not being the best superhero film or even an overall good film, Black Panther is still a solid experience that makes for another adequate chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The film follows the reign of T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), aka the Black Panther, over the country of Wakanda. On the surface, Wakanda is a poverty-stricken country, but behind smoke and mirrors, it is revealed that it is actually the most advanced civilization on earth. This advancement comes from the extraterrestrial metal vibranium, which landed in Wakanda thousands of years ago and allowed them to advance further than anyone else. Fearing the outside world, they isolated themselves inside a hologram projection system, never allowing themselves to open up to the rest of humanity.T'Challa is a firm believer of isolation, but his views are challenged by a new wave of Wakandans, ones led by the villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan, marking his third collaboration with Coogler). They see the world as weak and ripe for conquest. A rebellion soon breaks out that threatens to tear families and ties apart, as well as the whole of Wakanda.For boasting a revolutionary cast and director of newcomer Ryan Coogler, Black Panther never really feels original. It very much follows the typical superhero formula where the hero saves the day at first, a villain emerges and beats the hero, hero and his team regroup to fight back, and finally, hero returns and overcomes previous obstacle to beat the villain. I know almost every superhero film follows this formula, but this film was sold on the message that it would be different than the rest, when in fact it's the same as everyone else.Black Panther also has trouble with inconsistency when it comes to dialogue. The range of quality is all over the place as some lines are delivered really well and some are really poor. The script felt like it was written a couple years ago and never updated. Some of the jokes fall flat because they rely on trends that have faded away, such as the ""What are those!"" joke that was old a few years ago.Where the film stumbles in writing and storytelling it makes up for in its wide range of characters that piece everything together. There's a rule that no hero can truly work alone and that rule definitely applies to T'Challa as he is aided in his journey by his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), a tech whiz that serves as the Q to his 007, and Okoye (Danai Gurira), a fierce warrior that never backs down from a fight. Also acting as support is T'Challa's queen mother Romonda (Angela Bassett) and his spiritual advisor Zuri (Forest Whitaker).Technically speaking, Black Panther does have some of the highest production quality of the MCU films. Having the setting of Wakanda allows the film to embrace colorful and lush natural locations. The visual effects used to create the world are really well done and the expert cinematography by Rachel Morrison really adds to the experience.About every actor brings their game here. Chadwick Boseman is the standout as T'Challa. He delivers on making his character believable. He's a king and hero, but also just a man thrust into a hard position very quickly. He has his flaws and Boseman highlights those perfectly.Playing his polar opposite is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger, who is probably the most complex character. He's an outcast Wakandan who was abandoned in America during the 90s. Now after becoming almost a living legend among criminals, he's come to take his revenge on Wakanda. Jordan brings the rage and molds his character really well to fit the circumstances.The rest of the supporting cast fill in nicely, except for Forest Whitaker who is caught here trying too hard as always.Many will find Ryan Coogler's Black Panther to be a breath of fresh air for the superhero genre. It's an aesthetically pleasing film, but it's not one to jump and clap for. It never lives up to the hype but the film still never has below average quality. Avengers: Infinity War is boasting one of the biggest casts of all time, and having the Black Panther and Wakanda included is something that is going to be great to see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Quite Overrated, but still a Really Good Effort from Marvel","To be honest, I am rather baffled that there are critics who are hailing this film as a cinematic masterpiece and one of the if not the best superhero movies ever made. I sometimes wonder if I even watched the same movie they did. Even with that said, I still thought that this was a really good movie and I had a fun time watching it in the theater.Chadwick Boseman is quite good as the Black Panther, bringing the right blend of confidence and emotion to the character. There are many supporting characters who are quite interesting as well. I was skeptical about Michael B. Jordan playing the villain of the movie, but he did a surprisingly decent job.The best thing about this movie by far is its world-building. Wakanda is a wonderfully fleshed-out setting, and the gorgeous cinematography really sells the beauty and grandeur of it.The story is interesting and filled with intriguing commentary, with it only occasionally feeling preachy. The action scenes are a lot of fun, with the car chase being my favorite. I also liked the final battle.It does have some problems, though. The film dragged in some places and was overlong, and there were some instances where the CGI looked too obvious. The worst thing about this film by far is Martin Freeman's character. He had no real impact on the story and was kind of embarrassing to watch.All in all, this was another strong addition to the MCU. Even if it is overhyped and overrated, I still really like it. Check it out.RATING: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
In the higher echelons of the MCU,"Sit through the first half hour and you are duly rewarded. There's a lot about the MCU from a scriptwriting standpoint I couldn't stand, but this and Ragnarok prove that we are thankfully far away from the days of Iron Man 2 and Captain America 1. Black Panther is so much more thematically dense, rich and driving that many others in the franchise, and unlike Ragnarok, the emotional conflict drives the core physical conflict that is the cause of all the explosive action scenes. The film does not shy away from the obvious political bent; the dying lines of the villain lean so hard into the theme of oppression vs. the potential/imperative to improve upon it that I almost can't believe the soulless heads driving the Marvel project let them get away with it.But you have to make it to the Forest Whitaker exposition scene around the midpoint. Until then, Black Panther doesn't feel like it has much of a story. The first act is all set-up with one action scene and not a particularly great one at that, and with only three more big setpieces to follow it doesn't actually get to show off the Black Panther toolkit much at all, even with all the Chekhov's Guns going off in just the right places. So while I think this is one of the best Marvel movies from an artistic standpoint, there are others, like both Guardians and Ragnarok, that are better paced, better delivered movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fails on so many levels... not even a fun superhero movie... plain bad.,"One of the most controversial opinions I have is my hatred for Black Panther, and how I think it may be the most overrated movie of the year along with Ready Player One. Before you start commenting ''Oh you are racist'' just hear me out.Obviously there are good bits about Black Panther, not many but, even Ready Player One has good parts to it, so of course Black Panther will as well.To be fair to Black Panther, the costume design in the movie was fantastic, mostly due to the rathertalented Ruth Carter. Black Panther won the Oscar for costume design, where Ruth Carter became the first black designer to win the award. I would argue that The Favourite and Sandy Powell would have deserved it more, yet I wasn't too bothered with this win of theirs. The costumes used in Black Panther are fantastic and apparently very costly as well. These costumes include futuristic designs and African tribal designs, Ruth Carter does a tremendous job on the costume design.Black Panther had a very impressive production design, a rare sight for Marvel films, who have a reputation of having a poor production design. Again, Black Panther was nominated for an Oscar in this category, and for once, I would agree that they should've won in this category. The production design is so impressive in Black Panther. Hannah Bleacher, the production designer for Black Panther essentially created a whole society, in Wakanda. She created a sub-Saharan country, and used essential real-life elements and incorporated in this fantasy world. She made an futuristic city in a country that is clearly located in Africa. Hannah Bleacher used the costumes designed by Ruth Carter as inspiration for the production design. Bleacher clearly worked extremely hard in order to create this world, in fact, she traveled around Africa in order to get ideas on what Wakanda should be like, and other settings. Despite my hatred for the movie, I put my hat off to Bleacher as she does a great job with the production design.Music is ok, nothing much to say, can't judge music. It fits well with the movie, and I thought the music was appropriate.Now onto to the political commentary. Most of the reviews to this movie were politically motivated, due to the political commentary in the movie. But the political commentary in the movie is basically that Michael B Jordan who plays Killmonger in Black Panther wants to kill all the white people, and Chadwick Boseman who plays T'Challa wants to stop him. This movie attempts to make a commentary about how black people are treated in the United States, but it's so bad. Zootopia has better political commentary in it. All these reviews are so deluded, and think the movie is a great movie because of its message it sends. The movie's target audience is so mainstream, it targets everyone.The director of this movie, Ryan Coogler, is a fantastic director, and has directed great movies, such as Creed and Fruitvale station, but he has no experience when it comes to making a Marvel movie. He is an extremely talented director, and his talent is put to waste in this movie, he is unable to express his full creativity, and clearly wanted to steer the movie in another direction, but was unable to due to Marvel wanting to sell this movie to a mainstream audience. He has a 200 million budget to work with, yet can't express his true directing talents. He uses the basic marvel structure to a film, making the directing poor and unoriginal. The storyline was basic and lackluster. The action scenes in Black Panther are badly shot, and extremely lazy. Ryan Coogler had no past experience with filming action prior to become the director of Black Panther. Let this experience be a lesson to him, he is much better off not filming big blockbuster movies that's sole purpose is to gain a large financial reception.The main character who is portrayed by Chadwick Boseman is T'Challa or Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman is solid in his performance as Black Panther, but the character is so uninteresting. He is just boring. He seems to be good at being a king and a warrior, and seems to be unbeatable, making the movie very predictable. He's the son of a king, and a warrior for Wakanda. He is a very uninteresting, yet I think Chadwick Boseman is a good actor, just doesn't have a script to work with.The villain is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan. Michael B Jordan isn't a very good villain, despite the villain being one of the best parts of the movie according to the critics. He is a very generic character and doesn't have a good motivation, just wanting to take over Wakanda and use his power for the better. This is a regurgitated motivation, and is used in so many movies. Michael B Jordan is really poor in this movie, despite him being such a great actor. Again he can't work well with the script. He was a forgettable villain, and was a completely overrated character. Compare Killmonger to The Joker from The Dark Knight. The Joker is almost better in every single way. He has a better motivation, Heath Ledger portrays him perfectly, and is so unforgettable. Exactly the opposite of Killmonger. There is also no character development in Killmonger. He has a two minute backstory in the middle of the movie, which doesn't explain much.Forest Whittaker, who is a fantastic actor, and played one of my favourite roles of all time, in The Last King of Scotland as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, does a poor job in Black Panther, he plays the exact same character he did in Rogue One.Just look at this video and you'll know what I mean;The visual effects in Black Panther is so inconsistent. Sometimes the visual effects are amazing, but sometimes it's awful. As you can see in the video just shown, Black Panther had some horrible CGI.Not much to comment on the cinematography of the film, it's so basic, and uncreative, but what can I expect from some a bland looking movie. The color palette of the movie is basic, and the CGI, as I said before is inconsistent. Ryan Coogler doesn't know how to direct film scenesLarge parts of this action sequence is badly shot, and again throughout the action sequence you can see the inconsistency in CGI.The dialogue is one of the worst bits about the whole movie. It's so weak, and bland. The dialogue is so predictable and bland. Every character speaks their mind, it seems like they don't think before they say anything. It is a superhero movie, so I wouldn't expect an amazing script, but dialogue this bad?The movie is so cringeworthy at some parts, and the humor is so bad. At one point they make a ''what are those joke''and it made me want to kill myselfOverall, Black Panther is a bad movie. It's extremely overrated and didn't deserve those oscars it was nominated for. The movie failed on so many levels. The plot is predictable, unoriginal and doesn't start until halfway through the movie. A movie doesn't need a good plot, as seen with the lobster, which has one of the craziest plots I have ever heard. The plot of the lobster is a man needs to find a wife in 40 days or else he'll become an animal, the plot is stupid, unique but bad, yet it is executed so well.Black Panther has bad dialogue, basic cinematography, okay music, no humour, inconsistent visual effects, bad acting, poor characters and a bad plot. The movie is a really overrated movie, and has been completely overrated by critics, who think the movie as much deeper than it actually is. If this movie was a superhero with majority of the cast being white, it would be compared to the third reich.I give this movie a rating.... 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""BLACK PANTHER""- My Review","Just like we were introduced to Asgard in the Thor trilogy (although it was more fun in the the third movie), Black Panther introduces us to Wakanda, a place/Kingdom, hidden from the outside world in the continent of Africa.
Directed by Ryan Coogler, The plot follows the events after Captain America: Civil War, where T'Challa a.k.a. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman ) , is to be crowned the king of Wakanda where he have to face his nemesis in the form of Erik ""Killimonger"" (Michael. B. Jordan) who has a past related to Wakanda.
Now I have to say that this is a more matured movie after Civil War. There is action and fun in good amount but the story is given more depth. Add to that the African Culture and background gives the film a new look and from the view of the MC universe.
Technical matters of the film are all done well. Be it the Cinematography, Editing ,Action or the exhilarating Background score..
Now to the performances...
Chadwick Boseman has done a perfect job as The Black Panther. Although he appeared in a brief role in Civil war, the depth of his character was felt more in this film. Equally brilliant was Michael B Jordan in a negative role bringing in the required menace and can be considered another best villain in the MC universe. The supporting cast was efficient. The ones who require a mention is Daniel Kaluyya,
Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright. Andy Serous in a small role has done well.
So all in all Black Panther is another feather in the cap of the MC universe and is a must watch...
My rating: 4/5",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overhyped as hell but still pretty okay entertainment.,"It was with some hesitation that I went to see this movie. I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.I actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.The story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.The characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less...well...stupid!Personally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.Special effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.On the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wakanda Forever !,"""After the brief but strong performance of Black Panther during the outstanding Captain America: Civil War, MCU scheduled the right steps to build-up this African-beloved world which has all the potential to become a great franchise, just as Nolan's The Dark Knight""Spider-Man and Black Panther were gigantic surprises because, after a decade, one superhero could join the MCU and the other gave a new perspective of the African Continent which was something genuinely innovative. What makes the film so special (taking into account the prestigious cast, the well-developed villain, the beautiful imagery, and many other qualities) is the mixture of cultures, never leaving the influence the environment had within it. The film innovates the superhero world after a decade of US and UK origin storyline, finally, we can afford to do so in a spectacular way, I swear this will be an iconic origin story to a bunch of new-generation flicks. Practically, I took off my hat after watching it because it signified two positive points: a) Marvel golden years are still there (since 2016 Captain America: Civil War) and, b) The film brings back forgotten characters of the MCU and moulds their appearance while expanding their complexity (take the example of Ulysses Klaue, haven't heard of that folk since 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron). When stating the performances, everyone plays a key role and does it perfectly, my personal favourites were the main villain Killmonger, who turned out to be the third best villain I have seen in the MCU; Shuri, who is an exceptionally-awesome sister, and Nakia performed by the fisrt-class-talented Lupita. Finally, but not least, there is so much going on! For example, the action pieces entertain the audience as long as you could imagine, because they are set and dynamically prepared, then, the characters' development, it constructs Killmonger's profile and builts it, in order to present a final setup.It is difficult to find some defects, nevertheless, I considered the CGI a little exaggerated, while the comedy side was lacking a little bit...

Action-packed and a great tribute to African-Americans,I loved the movie because the special effect it's so amazing .The sound was of really good quality and the video was enjoyable for the eye.There are a lot of talented and great principal actors such as Chadwick Boseman and Danai Gurira and there is a lot of action. I think however that the movie was too long because it lasts 2 hours.This movie is unbelievable ; it was literally the best movie ever ; but also it was the FIRST MARVEL movie which had a black principal actors and this is just incredible because I think it's a tribute to african-american culture and it was wonderful!,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Shallow conflict,"The conflict was shallow and one dimensional. They both wanted to give away their technology, just in different ways. Marvel could make an entire movie over two librarians fighting over an Oxford comma. I'd like to see real deep-seated disagreement like libertarians fighting socialist. This movie belittles real conflict and makes wars and conflict seem so trivial (most Marvel movies do). They make it seem like people just fight over nothing. 
Another thing that didn't make sense was the villain waited to challenge the young king, when he could've challenged the old king and had a higher chance of success. Apparently by the movie rules he can challenge whenever he wants. 
I can see why racists won't like this movie. It's very Africa centric. The bad white guy had more character than the good white guy (there are only 2 white people).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There have been a lot of them recently, and while the quality varies, they are usually at least decent.Now, don't pull the racist card, because I am in no way that kind of person. But this... had it not been for Stan Lees cameo and the Marvel logo at the beginning, I would have thought this to be some random b-flick with decent CGI. But even that seem somewhat half-assed.So we have these very developed high-tech bunch of people, with technology far beyond the reach of the rest of the globe, yet they make decisions based on the outcome of medieval combat? There was very little incentive to like the characters. The few puny attempts at ""humour"" was at best cringe-worthy.The whole thing didn't seem to have any connections whatsoever to the rest Marvel universe. A few connections might have been positive, because then at least there might be something to look forward to. But as a standalone movie, this serves no real purpose for the average moviegoer.

Me , as an initial viewer of Marvel movies, did not like the IM2 movie as it lacked the action and a good story. Though, people argue that story of both movies (IM2, BP) were great and some even went on great lengths to praise it (BP) as best for some race.

At a high level: the acting ranges from serviceable to great, the action is pretty good, CGI is a bit spotty at times, it has a great theme and music. Most of all, it has its own identity. Despite the weak and often cliched writing / story, and even thin characters, the film still has a mostly fresh feel given the African setting, culture, etc. that helps make it memorable, along with its villain (and his ridiculous plan) who actually leaves a serious ideological impact (somewhat like Baron Zemo, though more successful).7.75 / 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Out of Africa,"During an interview in 1992, Wesley Snipes complained about how Africa usually is portrayed in American films. In contrast, the actor wanted to make a movie to highlight the majesty of the continent. By using Marvel Comic's iconic character ""Black Panther"", he thought he'd found a way to do just that. So, no time to lose. Snipes immediately began shopping around for a workable screenplay.The project proved to be more difficult than expected, though. Soon Wesley Snipes was forced to drop out. He had been given a leading role in the movie ""Demolition Man"", and that work would occupy most of his time. With no star attached to the project, Marvel therefore decided to drop ""Black Panther"" altogether. At least for the time being...Fast forward some twenty years. By this time the re-named Marvel Studios had quite a number of successful films in its catalogue. It was time to get ""Black Panther"" back on track. After hiring an almost entirely African-American production team, Marvel put up-and-coming director Ryan Coogler in charge of the picture.Coogler's vision for Wakanda, as Black Panther's kingdom is called, was inspired by the African country Lesotho. A nation that has managed to preserve its independence thanks to a mountainous, difficult-to-access terrain. The director was also careful to give Wakanda a futuristic look in line with the original design in the comic books.Marvel Studios had barely made the film's first teaser-trailer available online before ""Black Panther"" completely dominated the conversation on social media. A few days later, the picture opened globally, including a ""cross-nation release"" all over Africa (a first for Disney). And the success just continued. At the box office ""Black Panther"" took in well over $1.3 billion worldwide. That made it the highest-grossing movie ever by an African-American director.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A kids film - barely watchable for this adult,"Without a doubt this is a culturally important film, one with an important message to tell its audience. We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully. Blind loyalty to a power structure keeps the system intact. Wakanda is, in essence, an African fantasy, one in which the continent is able to withstand white oppressors and consequentially has the power to build an empire off Vibranium, a natural resource that is more powerful than steel. And many of us enjoy seeing people of color on the big screen. After a century, Hollywood may be waking up to the fact that Black heroes are actually bankable. Surprise!Wakanda is hidden behind clouds and mountains, and a fantasy rain forest canopy. But wait a minute. It is a sci fi film with advanced aircraft. Doesn't that mean the world possesses radar, and satellites? Well, then why have the clouds and rain forest kept this place such a secret for so long? DO NOT ask questions like these, of this film. If you are the kind of individual who can suspend your reason and intellect for two hours, and just watch, you may enjoy this. Personally, I felt alot of pain while watching this film. I might put it in the category of Lone Ranger, and Wild, Wild West. It really stank, as a story.The capital is from the evils of white colonizers, but any sort of imagination is left in the back seat when it comes to this emerald city onscreen. It's a missed opportunity on the part of Coogler because, after all, this is an MCU movie set in Africa! I wanted to see the savannas and the fantastic natural sights and beauties that come with this fascinating and colorful continent, but instead, there's an over-reliance on fake digital backgrounds rather than real on-set locations. This is detrimental to bringing any kind of humane connection or absorbingly artful feeling to the film, which quite frequently feels artificial and computerized rather than lived-in and three-dimensional.To sum it up, if you like comic book films, you may like this one.

One of the better Marvel movies,"""Black Panther"" benefits from being a stand-alone movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This allows it to have a really clear story arc without the disruption of stars from other franchises dropping in.And it is a very enjoyable storyline. Part spy thriller, part sci-fi spectacular, part historic battle, it keeps you engaged throughout a T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) accedes to the crown of Wakanda and has to keep his homeland's secrets safe and its enemies at bay.It's at its best when it's being serious, and most of the cast are very good in that respect, Boseman and Lupita Nyong'o being particularly convincing.But when it tries to add humour, it fails. Letitia Wright is good when she is playing a proud family member or a scientist, but her wisecracks fall flat. Martin Freeman is badly miscast as a CIA agent with a terrible accent which makes all his scenes awkward.As with all superhero movies, the powers work against the drama. The Black Panther suit is simply too strong, and most action scenes end up with high speed destruction and an excess of CGI animation (the final ""underground"" battle being a particular offender). One early scene in particular has a build up like a Bond film, but instead of gaining an advantage through sharp wordplay or a well-timed punch, the Wakandans engage Hulk mode. I much, much prefer the scenes where ""normal"" people are fighting (the final ""overground"" battle being a great example of this).Visually the film is great, with the colourful combination of tribal-inspired outfits and futuristic tech on screen.Overall a refined superhero adventure that doesn't quite have the spark of greatness.PS I do feel slightly uneasy about the use of accents. The cast is almost exclusively black American and British actors ""putting on"" an African accent. And one of the main baddies (played by Andy Serkis) is a white South African. It skirts along the edge of stereotypes - I think it just about gets away with it but it is a dangerous area to be in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's all about the plot,"I was pleased to see Black Panther introduced to the MCU in Captain America Civil War, and I really liked their choice of actor, even though I didn't know him before. Being into martial arts, I like superheroes who are experts in hand combat, and Spider-Man is my favourite. Black Panther is a bit like him, and we got a glimpse of his fighting prowess and learned a bit about the ""magical"" country of Wakanda, in Africa. So I was excited to see a movie dedicated to him.By the way, Black Panther isn't some new superhero recently cooked up by Marvel/ Disney. The character and his Wakanda background were created by the legendary Stan Lee in the sixties, so he's been around for a while. Personally, I think that the concept of Wakanda is brilliant, and can open up some interesting stories, if played right. I wish I had read and followed him in the comics. My guess is that it's probably a bit different from the direction they took here. I vaguely remember another story, probably animated, where Black Panther was trying to keep vibranium only in safe and peaceful hands.This movie felt below my expectations. In sharp contrast to Captain America, it's all about Wakanda. And that would have been fine if the plot surrounding the villain was more interesting. Unfortunately I can't help feeling that there was some sort of agenda behind it and it's not clear what the objective was. Sure, it's just a story, and it's very clear that the ideas of the villain are rejected by the hero Black Panther and others, who speak of unity and the world acting as ""one tribe"". An ideal that I think most people applaud.Somehow though, I can't shake the feeling that they made the voice of the villain so loud that it makes it harder to hear the message of love and unity. Plus, his idea just doesn't make sense. Yes, there's still some racial injustice in the world, but what exactly is he proposing, that advanced weapons are the solution? The idea is so ridiculous that it doesn't make any sense even for a fictitious story.Also, it's disappointing to see that the most technologically advanced country would have such outdated barbaric rituals for challenging the throne. It seems to contradict their image of a wise and spiritual country, like the scene of the warrior woman meditating. That said, I very much like the idea of preserving good traditions along with technology and that's something positive about this movie. And another is that one tribe is vegetarian!The action and the visuals are good, especially when they were on a mission abroad. And I wish that had been the focus of the movie, Black Panther as a superhero out there in the world. Or even in Wakanda, but it's the plot that in my view robbed this movie of being much better. The martial arts style fighting could have also been longer and better. Nonetheless I enjoyed it in the cinema, and just enjoyed streaming it. But it'll probably be a long time before I feel like watching it a third time, if ever. Curious to see what happens in the upcoming sequel...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Imaginative premise, great music, the rest hit 'n miss","You can see why Black Panther was such a meaningful potent movie experience for the world's black community. The idea of Wakanda is fantastical, and harks back to the afro-futurism ideas some of us know from the cult musician Sun Ra...'there are other worlds they have not told you of'.That vibe was portrayed quite effectively, tho' in the real world the healthiest way forward should probably be less iron focus on our racial identity...but the world is what it is. And Marvel were quite brave here to show us it. They went pretty close to all-in: the cast, costumes, language, music...a lot of thought went into it. As a music-lover myself I appreciated another more unique-flavoured soundtrack (after Ragnarok's synthwave vibes). The less of that formulaic orchestral vapid noise that makes up the soundtracks of most of these films, the better.The african-flavour was almost all great except for the accents: while a few of the actors were raised in African countries themselves, all the cast had to manner their speech to get it consistently technically and tonally right for Wakandan, and it shows: speech patterns are too slow, too stiff, they don't have natural conversational flow. This also put paid to some already-clumsy attempts at humour. To top it off, token ""white boy"" (Shuri's words) Martin Freeman puts on a painful American accent! But credit where it's due, the movie went there...we even got to hear a few of those typical African tutting-consonant sounds, quite special to hear it so regularly in a big Hollywood production.The plot itself, once we accept the inventive premise, is standard fare. As are the conflicts. One major issue is the pacing: the first hour was really good and nicely varied, but without giving away spoilers: the film develops the main antagonist far too quickly once he's introduced...to the detriment of our sympathies for Wakanda. In Thor: Ragnarok, while Hela also developed quickly, we had the benefit of previous Thor movies so had built up a familiarity & sympathy with the place and its people. The antagonist himself isn't very interesting, his motivations and actions feel contrived to the plot rather than a real person. So was Hela's, but she was visually mesmerising.The other characters - and the plot itself - also suffer from the main conflict escalating too easily, tho' watching Lupita & Winston was fun (both great in Peele's Us), and the Okoye character's stunts were pretty neat. The action generally was a bit hit 'n miss: some cool acrobatics, but poor CGI ideas. Wakanda - the place - was fairly well realised tho' like Asgard in Thor-1 feels like there's room for more.First hour 8/10, second hour 6/10. Settle on 7/10.Objectively, however, Black Panther is an important movie in Hollywood History. It's good that it was made.Next: Infinity War. This is clearly gonna be the Big One!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A Decent Movie, but What's All the Buzz About?","Now I understand that a big reason for this movie's popularity is the fact that it is made up of primarily black people. Now don't get me wrong, I think this is great; in fact I would say it needed to happen. This is something we've never seen in a superhero movie and it was quite refreshing. Erik Killmonger is an excellent antagonist; in my opinion, the best in the MCU (at least until Thanos came around). He was a great opponent to T'Challa physically and emotional due to their very apparent clashing ideologies. The reason I say that is because his motive and his cause is something that is very relate-able to the US today. Many people still feel a sense of racial prejudice and he resembled that pretty well. The only problem is that he was really only in the second half of the movie. The first half was about Andy Serkis character and his whole crusade for vibranium. I think he did pretty well, but he and the Black Panther had no qualities that really resonated well together; I just wasn't interesting in the story for the first half. Then once Killmonger comes back it's a totally different movie with a new plot. Why? Because Ryan Coogler wanted to tell Killmonger's story and he simply had Andy Serkis in the film to keep up continuity after Age of Ultron... Black Panther as a character was very boring and un-compelling to me. The CGI was mediocre at best; there were multiple times where I was taken right out of a scene because I was focusing on the background that was very clearly fake. I also thought the cinematography was questionable, especially during the fight scenes. I am tired of shaky tight shots during big action scenes, which this film has a lot of. Check this movie out of you want to, but I'd say you'll live by passing it up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good ""villain"".","Pretty good ""Lion King"" type of story, with a cousin (Killmonger) instead of an uncle.Boseman was good, but the writing for the character of Black Panther was better in other Marvel movies.Tough to rewatch because of all of the quasi political garbage stuffed into the script.The character of Shuri was more irritating than entertaining, but overall it was decent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
BLACK LIVES DO MATTER,"Not only was this one of the most celebrated and most beloved superhero movies of all time, but also one of the bests in technical terms and significant culturally. The hype around this MCU gem during its premiere was so justified because it was that good. The visual effects and costume design, as well as hair and makeup, were top of the line. Being a sure staple in Black Peoples' entertainment must-watch playlist, this would appeal not only to its assigned audiences but to the general public as well. Chadwick Boseman did not fall short in portraying a grieving superhero seeking revenge and protecting his domain. He was so effective in the role that if this movie was released in the 90's, he would have been a bigger star. The deliberate changes in accent was a little disturbing for me, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable Marvel Movie,"What make's a great movie? The elements which bought together a super hero movie, was great script, character, acting, and performance.The purists who say that this is overrated and over-hyped is probably not willing to conquer change, as they believe in supremacy of one's characters brought upon this itself.I would rate this way higher than any Captain America, or Hulk, or any other Marvel movie, is because the story even through predictable, brings a black super hero to the table, with unique, much better, far supreme versions ever they wanted to ever be!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Black Panther headlines his first solo MCU outing in a solid effort anchored by Boseman and Jordan's strong performances,"In the African nation Wakanda, a land rich in technological resources and Vibranium that is believed by the outside world to be a third world country, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) has ascended the throne following the death of his father T'Chaka (John Kani). Soon after taking the crown, T'Challa learns of the re-emergance of South African arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) who stole a large amount of Vibranium from Wakanda and killed several of their citizens. However, ubeknowst to T'Challa, Klaue is working with former CIA asset turned mercenary Erik Stevens aka Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who holds a grudge against T'Challa's family and is tied to secrets in T'Chaka's past.Black Panther is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics character of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966. Attempts to adapt Black Panther date as far back as the early 90s when actor Wesley Snipes lobbied hard to play the character in an adaptation, but the project wound up in development hell thanks largely to executives who remained unfamiliar with the character and Snipes would instead go on to play another Marvel character, Blade, instead. When Marvel Studios was established, one of the priority projects was a Black Panther film and like MCU's Spider-Man the character was introduced and established in Captain America: Civil War with the Character given a strong position in that film that was well received especially for the performance of Chadwick Boseman as the character. Ryan Coogler was signed to co-write and direct the stand-alone film following his success with Fruitvale Station and Creed, and the film upon release became a massive critical and commercial success earning $1.3 billion against a $200 million budget and became the most successful Black lead superhero film ever made. Black Panther is a solid entry in the MCU that creates an engrossing world and an engaging lead character.Much like Captain America, Black Panther doesn't have the character flaws of Tony Stark or Thor and is instead a good man with strong convictions who's struggles come from his responsibilities in how he should govern and protect his nation and where he should take it in the future. T'Challa doesn't claim to have all the answers and is surrounded by several advisors and allies who give him advice on how he should best approach be it in his former lover and now War Dog (spy), Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o who believes Wakanda should be a more active in helping the world in contrast to their isolationist position, or T'Challa's head bodyguard Okoye played by Danai Gurira who is a staunch traditionalist. The movie gives us some fantastic villains with Andy Serkis delightfully despicable as arms dealer Ulysses Klaue who's given much more to do than his introduction in Age of Ultron, but complementing Boseman's T'Challa is Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger who is probably the richest and most nuanced villain we've seen in the MCU who has more in common with someone like Magneto rather than the typical Machiavellian businessmen and dictators we've seen and there's a strong sense of tragedy to the character while still making him a threat that challenges T'Challa on a physical level, but also in terms of his beliefs and principles. At it's core the movie is about T'Challa navigating two extremes coming from both his father's legacy and Killmonger's motivation and where he choses to lead away from those and it's done in a very satisfying way.Black Panther has deservedly gotten all its praise for good reason and continues the strong streak of the MCU's third phase.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A promising film ruined by formulaic box-ticking,"Black Panther has a strong start that deceivingly promises viewers of a memorable film, only to end up just like the bulk of Marvel movies. Predictably formulaic, bloated and tiresome. Whilst the film isn't entirely devoid of merit, its mild form of momentary entertainment isn't noteworthy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated and Underrated,"So many reviews here with 1 star, and the majority of them specify it's dull, dry and only rated highly because of the political reasons.On the other hand, many critics have gone a bit too mad in saying it's one of the greatest movies of all time with it being the first black superhero movie etc.But overall I'd call it a solid addition to the MCU, being something a little different, and setting up Avengers: Infinity War very nicely.
The feel and atmosphere of the film was different to what we'd experienced before in the MCU, assisted nicely by a great score by Ludwig G√∂ransson, and originals by Kendrick Lamar.One major criticism I have is the execution of the climax scene as T'Challa and Killmonger face off and Killmonger is defeated but other than that there are some fantasticly directed, one being the car chase, or perhaps the two scenes where T'Challa is challenged, specifically the Killmonger challenge.And on Killmonger, he's one of my favourite villians in the MCU. Michael B. Jordan did a brilliant job there.People who think it's dull are probably just watching the wrong film.
There are different genres in the MCU, for example The Winter Soldier is a Spy kind of movie, whereas Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok are more like Fantasy and Comedy, and different people like different genres.People who complain about it being too politicaly correct are just morons. This film (along with the entire MCU) is based on the comics, and Kevin Feige wanted to introduce Black Panther just before Avengers: Infinity War, so that the setting for Wakanda was ready to play a prominent part in the film. And for this to happen, a lot of the cast has to be black. They can't make it without the cast being black, they're basically forced to include them. So there's no way it was made just for political correctness and what not.Anyway Black Panther was a very good film, and I'd probably give it a 7.7/7.8 kind of rating which rounds up to 8 for this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but not so good,"At the and of the film, everything was so good. I liked the story of the film and the technology. Also we discussed about Wakanda in our class (should they open their sources to the world). As I mentioned everything was so good. But the fight between T'Challa and Killmonger was so boring. Especially while they were fighting at the subway, nothing was realistic. This is my view. But mostly I like it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"entertaining, but how so political?","Just saw it in 3d dolby atmos, curve big screen, nice piece of audiovisual entertainment. The story line and the acting wasn't that great, just ok. I understand this movie is really political in the USA, but I don't really get why this is a black movie, and something for black people to be proud of. The movie is a thin fairytale in the fictitious African kingdom of Wakwanda, so not that weird the cast is African (looking). One of the messages in the film was that Africa was robbed empty by others. There's truth in that and nothing wrong with it being told once in a while. But on the other hand, this can be said about every continent on earth. the last centuries the westerners are the evil do-ers, for example I'm Dutch and the slave trade of the Western Indian Company was repulsive. But before the 17th century western Europe was peripheral, where was plundering and a place where people were made slave and taken away. What I want to say is, I don't really get this playing politics of Hollywood. I find it most of the time quite pretentious, embarrassing, arbitrary and mark missing. Concerning this particular movie, to me it wasn't that (bothering) political. This movie made me think of Avatar, the nice visuals and also somewhat story wise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Much more then just another Marvel Movie. Incredible,"Movie has a bit of everything for everyone from the music and the amazing cast, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B Jordan as well as the whole female cast were excellent.

They all rose above the need for constant action in a superhero film and actually carried the film well instead of the other way round. It was beautiful and grabbed me from beginning to end. Marvels greatest score so far? I Think so. I had been looking forward to Black Panther ever since I saw the first concept for his costume and it did not disappoint.Glad to hear it could do $200+ Million opening weekend just to show these people hate will not stop this movie from being successful.

"Good Film, But Still Over-Hyped","Black Panther did garner many whistles with its brief appearance in Civil War. MCU left no stone unturned in investing above $200 m in the film which is huge considering its not as popular as other super heroes. But last few months it has generated so much hype that, the box office estimates have gone over the roofs.The same hype made me crazy enough to not able to contain my excitement and subsequently find out what the fuss is all about. Strangely, even when the film is done I am still asking the same question. Black Panther starts off with one of the most important scenes of the film that becomes the fulcrum on which it develops its plot post mid-way. The story without spoilers is basically about a precious metal, Vibranium which is the root reason of the secret city, Wakanda's technological advancement and power. It is about whether it should be available to the people around the world for other countries' problems and if yes, who gets to decide the right people who should lay hands on the massive power. And if no, then is it really right to continue its use for the selfish well-being of Wakanda alone?Keeping all the hype aside (Rotten Tomatoes' 97% score, Box Office), I found the film strictly just ""good"". The characters are well developed, Wakanda city has been beautifully realized and the conventional Marvel wit adds to the charm of the whole. But the film never really takes off to build enough tension to keep us engrossingly glued. It is more of an exhibition of the tribes of Africa and their rich persevered culture. It also makes clear statements of racist atrocities and its payback, whether it is Killmonger screaming his lungs on how T'Challa should use the power of Vibranium for ""their people"" or the frequent use of ""these Americans"" in a form of their subjugation to the Wakandians. With past few Marvel films showing an individualistic innovative style of action, this film fails to offer anything that impresses you beyond the anchoring use of claws. More than the Black Panther or Killmonger, it is Andy Serkins' Ulysses Klaue that steals away your attention with captivating screen presence of a chilled maniac. Unfortunately, the appearance is limited to brief after which Killmonger takes over. Killmonger played by Michael Jordan feels like an immature street punk hip-hopping away his dialogues. When he starts talking, all you feel like saying is, ""You just lack some knuckle slaps when you were growing up"". His motivation is without depth or understanding, its too outlined to generate any taste for the villain. Even T'Challa, whether he played a king or even a super hero, always felt like a character who is undergoing a 2 month course with his shrink for confidence issues. The music shifts gears in discontinued forms from rap beats to African tribal and the usual loud score for action sequences.Overall, the film is an entertaining pass time for the well etched characters and the relationships among them, some unexpected comical expressions that was very subtly fit into the writing and a refreshing change from the usual we have been coming across.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the most over-overrated movies.,"At the time, the hype about this boring movie was absolutely everywhere, you'd hear about it in every corner of the street, surprisingly, it turned out to be one of the most terrible action movies, cheap effects, amateur acting coupled with horrible storyline and ending, yet a massive marketing compaign was made to make it profitable and it's a shame they succeeded at that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Embarrassing, to be honest","Admittedly, I only watched this movie because it was on my list of Oscar winners for 2019 (best original score, best production design), not because I am a fan of superhero movies, but I still harbored the distant belief that it might be a hidden gem in disguise.Unfortunately, it was only a fraction of a percent better than Suicide Squad, which was also diabolical, for a number of reasons:The plot! So Africa has a super-advanced country hidden under the forest that no-one knows about, which is able to make incredible alien technology beyond anything ever seen before, without any ability or need to import raw materials to build production plants and laboratories, including Apple-esque glistening-white research centers?In fact, I am more angry about watching this film today then I was yesterday when it finished.And the totally embarrassing scene in which the white man was not allowed to talk in the company of the ""ape king"", which I quote from another character, including ape chanting and stomping sounds, which was supposed to be funny? It was horribly embarrassing, and I can only deduce that this scene was included for cheap laughs in the black community, much like the cheap laughs in The Patriot against the English 'tyrants', although The Patriot wasn't a totally bad film.It's quickly becoming the same old scenario in modern-day superhero movies: everything seems made up as it goes along because it can be hidden away behind special effects.And I totally get the need for black inclusion, which is one of the reasons I watched this movie, but it was instead patronizing to black people and included inverse and bizarre racism and parodies as well, causing Black Panther to badly misfire alongside its dull plot.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Different but just as good,"19 February 2018
Second Film of Choice at tHe Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Black Panther. Time for another Marvel production. This was not your usual Marvel film. However it was fabulous. What made this one different is we were not bombarded with lots of superhero stuff this was more a tale of sci-fi folklore which erupted from a hidden city in the depths of Africa onto the rest of the world. This was a tale of who wins the throne and who is worthy to carry on the name and the work of Black Panther. There was much solemnity in this film interspersed with irreverence at solemn moments which elicited burst of laughter from the audience. Although slow it parts I felt this was necessary to the storyline and kudos must be given to the model makers and animators for creating a city fitting of both a metropolitan situation and an African savannah. Great use of rhinos, and some rather fancy intense battle scenes. I like the panther suit and the technology which comes with it. It was a little like watching Q from James Bond with all his gadgets, only way cooler. Although very different from the usual Marvel film I do feel this slots neatly into its place in the franchise.

Wakanda and Na√Øve Globalism,"Marvel has scored another hit at the box office, as well as among movie critics. I read some reviews before seeing the movie and was surprised at the wide range of ratings. Going in I was willing to give it a ""7"" going in, just because it is Marvel. I haven't seen a bad Marvel movie yet. Black Panther was no exception, yet it possessed a strange dualism. On the one hand, the movie was superbly made, cleverly written, possessing great cinematography, exciting special effects, top-notch acting by all the principals and several moments of laugh-out-loud humor. I would not be surprised if Black Panther received Oscar nominations for more than special effects.On the other side I felt, as a Conservative, that Coogler and Cole were intent on lecturing me from their Leftist-Globalist political ideology. There were subtle but obvious jabs at the Trump Administration. I suppose we should give T'Challa some slack since he is so new at governing. He (indeed the entire MCU) ignores the threat of Radical Islam and he hasn't considered what he would do if millions of illegal immigrants showed up at the gates of Wakanda for their slice of the pie. Killmonger did offer a valid reality check that as soon as the world became aware of Wakanda's scientific advancements, other powers would want to come and take it away from them.Wakanda, of course, is a fantasy. While it seeks to reflect African culture and succeeds in various ways, it fails to represent the diversity of the continent of Africa. Many times in the movie speech patterns, idiomatic expressions and mannerisms reflect black culture in America rather than Africa. One aspect that is accurate is inter-tribal competition, which in the history of Africa resulted in internecine warfare. Africans have not historically manifested the philosophy of ""one tribe."" ""White people"" are presented in the film as colonizers (which Everett Ross rejects), but ignored is the fact that Christian missionaries brought medicine, hospitals, schools and improved agriculture. Yes, white people engaged in the horrific slave trade, but conversely white people ended it. White people have given over and over for the good of Africa and Africa is the better for it.Frankly, I liked Black Panther better in Captain America: Civil War where he wasn't preaching at us. I wonder if he will try his Liberal ideology on Thanos. Nah. Thanos does not believe in sharing the wealth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Well I guess their acting and emotions dont really match the situations4. There are a few jokes, which feel very very misplaced and very low.
