Pretty good!,"There are some films which take the genre to some other level. This film is definitely the one to do so in the superhero genre.Good : There's a whole bunch of good things that I can talk about. Bryan Singer does his best to tell the story, considering the comparatively weak script for an experimental film like this. This was the first time in YEARS that a superhero film was taken seriously. Given that there had been no introduction to any of the characters prior to this film, it does a really good job to make them interesting. Plus, it establishes the conflict between Eric and Xavier, which have been an integral part of many films that came afterwards. Not to mention, the character introduction, especially that of Wolverine, was incredible. We instantly know the basic characterization given to each of them, which was enough to get behind the movie. Hugh Jackman was the optimal choice for the role of Wolverine, and he proved it for next 17 years. Every single actor have done a good job in their roles. Also, I believe that X-Men films have been the best superhero films when it comes to ""social"" themes. We get to see the first of many times two friends with different world views clashing with one another. It has grown incredibly stale now, but was great to see back then and some other films after this, especially First Class and DoFP. The mutants wanting to be accepted by humans, and the other mutants wanting to destroy mankind - what other superhero series have given such a theme, or a similar one? This movie is the reason we are getting films like Infinity War, Civil War, Endgame, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. While I prefer these over the first X-Men movie, if it didn't bring the genre back on track, we would've never gotten such films.Mixed : It feels dated. Had it been made today, it would've been a lackluster. It was clear that they were trying to experiment with this movie and still figuring out how to get things right. While they got most of the things right, they could've made the story a little more complex.Bad : The story is quite a bit of a throwaway story. While there's an interesting twist, it still feels like the movie becomes a little goofy and cartoony after that twist. Some moments feel like they were shoehorned just to give some ""comic accuracy"", but they didn't feel justified. I believe that if you get the basic elements right, it doesn't matter if it's not deadly accurate with the comics. But if you want it to be so, make some baseline for that. Don't do it randomly.Conclusion : It's a movie that set the genre back on track forever. While the story and script might feel a little lazy when viewed today, you can see that the execution of the ideas were as good as humanly possible. If you are a superhero movie fan, it's a must watch. Not because it's insanely great, but just as a reminder of what led us to where we are. I am a huge fan of the genre. All credits go to Nolan's Batman films, the good X-Men films and Raimi's first two Spider-Man films. I absolutely love the MCU and many DC films apart from Nolan's trilogy - Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, Shazam, The Dark Knight Returns, Superman/Doomsday, etc. But for me, like for the genre, it all started with the first X-Men movie. So, I have a very special place for this in my heart, as a fan.Rating.Score : 8/10Grade : A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Smart, stylish, and very cool","""X-Men"" is a rare treat-- a blockbuster that lives up to its hype and a comic book adaptation that hits the mark.Along with Tim Burton's ""Batman"", this stands head and shoulders above all other superhero movies.  It's a genre that's usually synonymous with silly, campy, cartoonish crap, but Bryan Singer delivers a long-awaited exception to the rule.  ""X-Men"" is smart, stylish, and very cool... one of the better sci fi/fantasy films of the last decade.Of course, it helps to have good source material.The X-Men comics, which originated in the 1960s, are more politically progressive and morally complex than older superhero stories such as ""Superman"" where the heroes are always right, and truth, justice, and the American Way always prevail.  The series is a well-crafted parable about individuality and discrimination.  The characters are mutants--struggling to find a place in a society that rejects them.  Its primary villain, Magneto, isn't an evil lunatic-- he's a sympathetic character, a misguided revolutionary playing Huey Newton to Professor Xavier's Martin Luther King. The iconic character, Wolverine, is a beer-swilling anti-hero who cares little for ideals and fights only to protect himself and his loved ones. The female characters are as powerful and important as the men, rather than being mere love interests.Rather than making just another flashy explosion-per-minute-special-effects-extravaganza, Singer practices the lost arts of character and plot development.  As a result, the movie has a far greater depth than the average big budget summer flick.  The acting is also quite good on the whole.  Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine, is fantastic--a bona fide Clint Eastwood caliber badass.  Some of the dialogue is fairly cheesy, but in the hands of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart it sounds quite convincing.  (Stewart has made a career out of making lame dialogue sound cool.)Hard-core fans of the comics have complained about the omission of several popular X-Men.  This is silly.   A movie that gave the background on every character in the comic books would be 6 hours long.  There will be plenty of time to develop new characters in the forthcoming sequels.  Fans have also complained about the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue.   I disagree.  Rogue is unable to touch another human being without harming them--she would not realistically act like a confident, sassy warrior.  Paquin did a tremendous job of conveying the fear and isolation that such a young woman would feel. She will undoubtedly grow into the part in future movies.In the end, ""X-Men"" is a comic book movie.  Superpowers are explained with silly pseudoscientific babble, the plot revolves around a fairly ridiculous take-over-the-world scheme, and names like ""Magneto"" are spoken with a straight face.  Don't read all the glowing reviews and expect Citizen Kane. But don't underestimate ""X-Men"" either.  It is an intelligent movie that people will enjoy whether or not they are familiar with the comic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-ellent entertainment!,"If this film had been given to the wrong director it could have been incredibly cheesy. Being a reader of the comics I know that there are a few things that works on the page of a comic book but not in a film and let me say that the costumes is one of these things that in all probability wouldn't work. Singer chose to go with black leather outfits and I, for one, am very thankful for this choice. There are many things in this film that works but unfortunately there are a few things as well that prevent the film from being truly great.Lets start with the things that work. Acting wise the film is very good. This is above all attributed to some excellent casting. Hugh Jackman is simply perfect as Wolverine and brings out the duality of the character in a very satisfactory manner. Also the scenes were we see a glimpse of the rage in the character work remarkably well. The only thing that could be said about him is that he is too tall but it seems most people, including myself, have accepted this fact. I think also that it was a wise choice to let a relatively unknown actor play the part because in that way we have no preconceived notions about him. As for Professor X no other man than Patrick Stewart could/should play him. Stewart simply becomes Xavier both in presence, voice and looks. An example of perfect casting. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Magneto and succeeds in creating a human villain rather than the usual clich√© like villains we see in Hollywood productions. The acting aside from the ones mentioned above is pretty good. Not spectacular but good. The only one who does not look and act like the character we know from the comics is Anna Paquin who plays Rogue. The character is nothing like in the comics and Paquin's performance doesn't help the character.When it comes to music and sound effects in general the film is a notch above average. The musical score has a very grand, even epic, feel to it and this suits the film very well. The score is not as memorable as the score from Batman (1989) but it is very adequate. As for the general sound effects they are both very fitting and believable adding to the overall credibility of the film which is considerable. The sound Wolverine's claws make when they come out is exactly as I imagined it. Very well done. The effects in general are also very well made. Not as good as in Spider-Man but still very good. A lot of care has been taken to make the effects seem as believable as possible and from where I'm standing they work. The only character whose powers I did not fully believe in was Toad's. Ray Park is an excellent athlete but many of his stunts look like obvious wire work. This is a pretty general complaint I have as some of the action look rehearsed. There is, however, some interesting action scenes and overall the action is acceptable.The story is pretty well written and the dialog is both witty and sharp. Especially much of the dialog between Wolverine and Cyclops (James Marsden) is very entertaining and true to the comic books. Where I feel the story is lacking is in the climax which I am afraid to say is a little silly. Magneto's plan for world domination is actually pretty stupid when you think about it and that is a shame because much of the exposition is very well done. Generally, however, the first film is all about setting the stage for the films to come and it does do that in a satisfactory manner.All in all X-Men is definitely one of the better super hero movies out there and although it was surpassed by the sequel it still stands as a true testament to Singer's skill.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
intelligent and significant,"With so many movies out right now that are designed solely for entertainment puposes--from ""Gone in 60 seconds"" to ""MI-2"" to ""Scary Movie""--it is promising to sit through a 90-minute film based on a comic-book that actually gives you an opportunity to think and be challenged.Bryan Singer's ""X-men: The Movie"" is nothing more than an introduction to the lives of the characters from the comic book. The very fact that his movie doesn't try to add new elements, or change elements that already existed within the comic, is what makes it so successful.X-men the comic series has been around for more than 30 years. And for good reason. It has dealt with all of the important elements that good storytelling includes--rejection, loneliness, hope, fear, distrust, love, selfishness, power, and the price you pay for doing what you believe is right. By consistently exploring various difficult elements of humanity, the X-men comic has been able to be not only entertaining but stimulating as well.Thankfully, Singer's movie translation is no exception. ""X-men"" is very well executed, with excellent character work for the leads (Logan, Rogue, Magneto and Xavier), a good exploration of the motives of each character, and dialogue that is sharp and intelligent. However, lest you think X-men is only intellectual, let me assure you that the special-effects department has done an incredible job of mingling the human elements of the story with action. From Wolverine's claws to Rogue's devasating touch, from Storm's namesake displays of nature to Magneto's awesome power, ""X-men"" constantly finds new and arresting ways of showing-off each mutants power. And the closer you get to the end, the more exciting it is.True, the movie was not perfect. Certain story elements were modified slightly for big-screen adaptation (nothing, however, that is disloyal to the ethic of the series). The soundtrack was only sufficient, rather than being something truly memorable. And not all of the characters were given equal time on screen (some important characters were completely missing).But for a 90 minute movie that needs an action plot, it's obviously impossible to give all the X-men (and their evil counterparts) equal attention or character development. In fact, the sheer scale of the series alone all but requires a sequel to flesh out what was missing in this first, ""Intro to X-men"" movie.Yet, as a beginning exploration of the ""X-men"" universe, this movie shines. It is attractive, fun and meaningful. Whether you're an X-men fan, you're looking for something that will make you think, you want an action movie, you enjoy sci-fi, or you just want to leave the theater feeling like you didn't just waste a couple of hours and seven bucks, go see Bryan Singer's ""X-men."" You won't be disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
FIRST,"X-Men is first superhero team movie in history. Also it is Marvel's first movie with a high budget. Movie is amazing about storytelling, especially in first one hour. I really liked the world they created. But then it becomes a bit meaningless and complicated. CGI's are good for 2000. Actors and actresses are awesome with their roles, every one of them. This film have some surprising scenes, especially with Mistique. Bryan Singer made a good job at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not a ""Comic-book Movie""","There's no doubt about it, X-Men is not a stereotypical ""comic-book film"". Whenever a movie is made that is based on comic books, there is always a fear that it can and will be typically pigeonholed into the ""comic book film"" genre and that the movie is basically made for the fans of that comic book.  Comic-book films are usually unrealistic and unappealing to the general audience.Bryan Singer, however, did a wonderful job at making X-Men a movie that will not only overjoy the fans of the comic book, but also the general movie-goer as well.  The movie is grounded, without the flighty unrealism of comic book material, and it delivers a message about prejudice that has always been what X-Men were about: fighting for a world that hates them.The performances are outstanding, especially Hugh Jackman who, in my opinion, did a dead-on Wolverine, and Patrick Stewart, who never failed to show the peace and self-control that Professor Charles Xavier always strove to maintain.Aside the characters, the plot was original (I couldn't tell you what was going to happen in the end by the middle of the movie) and most importantly: the world was REAL.  The only suspension of disbelief that is required is the assumption that these genetic mutations can happen, and did, causing these extraordinary people.  Honestly, I was a little disappointed that the colorful high-flare costumes were omitted, but I instantly forgave Singer when I realized why.  It was simply to add to the realism.All in all, X-Men was excellent.  If you're a fan of the comic book series as I was, then you'll endlessly enjoy seeing these characters come to life.  And if you've never been exposed to the comic book, this movie will give you an entertaining way to be exposed to its message about fear, hatred, and prejudice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men,"It was way back in 2008 when Iron Man first suited up and the Marvel Cinematic Universe caused an irrefutable shift in the cinematic landscape, for better or for worse.It's easy to forget that 8 years before Iron Man there were still solid Marvel movies. For it's time, X-Men is a really solid flick that, in a sense, prepared the way for The Avengers by telling a story while juggling numerous characters at once. Before Downey Jr embodied Tony Stark, Jackman had done the same thing with his portrayal of Wolverine. Before Killmonger or Thanos managed to steal a film through proper and engaging portrayals of villains, there was Magneto's, well, magnetism.It was all still in its infancy then and it lacked the polish and richness that would come later. There is some clunkiness, lightning toads come to mind, and there are a bunch of underused characters, poor Cyclops, but it's still a fun movie, even years later.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-cellent!,"A tale of super-evolved mutants in a struggle against human oppressors, X-Men is an instant sci-fi classic, combining impressive special effects with an involving plot to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.Lacking the tongue-in-cheek camp of the later Batman films and other recent comic books-turned movies, X-Men draws the audience into its world of mutants and superpowers, and prevents it from becoming tacky or absurd. Not to say that there isn't any humour in the film, in fact it delivers some of the best one liners in a film this year.It is a rare thing for an action blockbuster to feature great acting, but with a cast that among others involves both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is bound to be above average. Both Stewart (as Professor Charles Xavier) and McKellen (as Magneto)deliver stellar performances, and their onscreen chemistry is compelling as they play two old friends turned arch enemies.The rest of the cast deliver solid performances, including Hollywood newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Oscar-winner Anna Paquin as Rogue, and another rising star Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the seductive but deadly Mystique.A classic tale of good versus evil, with heroes, baddies, and great special effects, I don't think it's going too far to say that X-Men is destined to be mentioned in the same breath as Star Wars and other all-time sci-fi greats.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It was a pretty straight forward action packed flick that featured some neat effects for it's fairly early time it hit theaters.

A pretty straight-forward storyline throughout the film as the team of mutants known as X-Men try to protect and rescue one of their newer and younger ones from ""the dark side"" of mutants, with one of the helpers being a new member of the X-men as well.

Can your comic heros really come to life?,"The answer to that question can be found in this movie with a resounding YES.  Being a fan of X-Men comics and cartoons, I watched this movie with great skepticism.  It was wonderful how the characters remained true to the comics.The special powers that our mutant heros and villains possess are displayed exceptionally.  It made me wish that I could have a special power of my own.Enough can not be said of the phenomenal cast of actors that were selected for their roles.  Not only did they fit their parts perfectly, but they made you believe.  Bravo to Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen and a host of actors who were lucky enough to take part in this adventure.Bryan Singer does a fantastic job of bringing it all together.  The special effects in this movie, only enhance the great script and acting.  After seeing the DVD with the outtakes, the editing was quite effective.The true battle of good versus evil can always make for a great story but when a comic book is adapted to film and you feel that what you see is really possible, it is a true stroke of genius.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Execrably bad,"Was ""The Usual Suspects"" a fluke?  Bryan Singer turns in a decidedly B-movie job directing this flat, predictable comics adaptation.  It's almost too faithful to its original medium, with 2-d performances from all the principals except for Hugh Jackman (as the grouchy Wolverine, he displays the closest thing to personality among these cardboard cut-outs).  Patrick Stewart is lifeless.  Ian McKellen, who was believably dark in Singer's ""Apt Pupil,"" here only looks very drowsy.  And the X-Men themselves look like the cast of ""Dawson's Creek"" in drag.This film has endless problems.  The action sequences, and in particular the climactic battle in and on the Statue of Liberty, look terribly staged: just as on the comics page, the characters halt to strike dramatic poses, or dotingly brandish their ""super powers"" (one of them, hilariously, even utters at one point: ""Storm, use your power!"").  It simply doesn't work any more than if Singer had put speech bubbles above the characters' heads. Compare these silly little fights to the superb sequences in Jet Li's ""Black Mask,"" (1996), a film shot for a fraction of this one's budget but obviously with much greater talent and vision.For a comic with a rich graphical past, the movie's art direction delivers a strangely bland, sterile look, both for Professor X's school and for the Liberty set.  Both look low-budget, but neither is quite as bad as the villain's secret seaside hideout, which Singer shot in such darkness that nary a detail can be seen.Oddly, ""X-Men"" looks like two different movies.  The first 15 minutes are lavishly designed and shot, from the opening flashback of Jews herded into a concentration camp to the discovery of a Wolverine slumming in a moody northern logging camp.  Then, abruptly, the flair is gone, and for the remaining 90 minutes we get a film that looks like one of the Star Trek TV franchise vehicles.  (Except for Storm's look: it's pure Penthouse Magazine, ca. 1975, with Halle Barry's vapid expression rounding out the bill.)  The villains are half-comically done, but even that is a blunder by Singer -- we don't really get any comic relief from them, and we can hardly worry too much about the X-men if they're beset by the likes of a villain called Toad, and even less when they remind us of the far wittier and better-looking send-up of all this nonsense, last year's ""Mystery Men.""Apart from the inanities, there is also a true sin: it's unforgivably trite when a pulp fiction like this one hijacks the Holocaust to inflate its meagre storyline and insincere theme.  ""X-Men"" isn't really an allegory of genocide, or even merely of racism.  That stuff is just tacked on to what is really an exercise in big fights and big boobs -- the old Marvel formula. Fights and boobs aren't bad in their own right, but they're done much better elsewhere without the pretensions to social justice.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lee and Kirby's Finest Creation Comes to Life...,"The film version of Stan Lee and Jack ""The King"" Kirby's best-selling comic book creation, X-Men, has finally succeeded where more than twenty years of four-color, superhero movies have failed.  They have finally got it right...It is a stunning cinematic experience, faithfully adapting nearly 40 years of continuity into a stream-lined, fast-paced, wonderfully exciting trip into the legendary Marvel Universe.  X-Men features incredible portrayals of much of the classic mutant cast, especially virtual unknown (at least here in the States) Hugh Jackman as Logan, the Canadian wildman we all know and love as Wolverine.  Jackman seems born to play this coveted role with every bit of gruff and grim gusto; his Wolverine looks as if he simply stepped off one of Chris Claremont and John Byrne's exquisitely crafted pages.  The rest of the cast was also pleasantly well-casted and well-suited for their roles, including the handsomely chisled James Marsden as the stoic field commander Cyclops and the gorgeous Anna Paquin as the can-never-touch-but-wish-we-all-could Rogue.  Famke Janssen and Halle Berry are beautiful and bold as Jean Grey and Storm, respectively, not just appearing as fleeting shards of eye candy, but actually adding depth and strength to the flow of the film.  Patrick Stewart's excellent Professor Charles Xavier is in fine Stewart fashion, extrapolating on his Jean-Luc Picard character, and adding genuine compassion and warmth.Ian McKellan is superb as the tortured master of magnetism, Magneto, playing the part with malicious glee, tempered with an extreme form of jingoism for his cause of the militant uprising of mutants over ""normal"" people.  His Brotherhood of (Evil) Mutants is composed of Sabretooth, viciously and animalistically portrayed Tyler Mane, The Phanton Menace's Ray Park is the wickedly amusing Toad, and the stunning Rebecca Romaijn-Stamos is the shape-shifter Mystique.  Park actually had the most to say of Magneto's henchmen, but it was appropriate as these three comprise an awesomely evil team of muscle and not philosophy like their leader.The productions values were spectacular, as were the settings, taking us from a stark, malign concentration camp in Poland to the wilds of the Canadian north to the serenity of Westchester, New York to a mind-bending climax on Liberty Island.  The action sequences were well-paced and action-packed, and much more smoother and better choreographed than any of the Batman films.  The special effects, especially Wolverine's legendary adamantium claws, were truly awe-inspiring.X-Men was meticulously directed by Bryan Singer, who along with 20th Century Fox, actually listened to and cared about what X-Fans thought and wished to see on screen.  Although we would have all liked to have stayed in that theater for another 95 minutes, there are many more stories to tell, and God willing, Fox will let it happen.Most importantly, X-Men finally gives Marvel Entertainment Group a firm footing on film, a foundation that was never fully in its grasp until the surprise hit of two years ago, Blade.  Now that Marvel has discovered that it can succeed with its top-tier characters, the sky is truly the limit for its varied cast of great characters.  I hope that Warner Bros. will sit up and take notice at what X-Men has accomplished.  Maybe this will be a wake-up call to those studio executives in charge of Superman and Batman, and make them realize that the fans' input really does count in the end...Highest recommendation!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A solid start to the X-Men film franchise,"Not one of the best Superhero films but a long way from one of the worst. While with imperfections and better was to follow in the franchise, X-Men is a good film and a solid start though with a yet-to-properly-find-its-feet feel. X-Men is well-made, the special effects while not mind-blowing are great, the film was slickly shot and edited and the dark, moody visual style worked wonders. Michael Kamen's music score had those grand, mysterious, rousing and haunting qualities that really add a lot to the film's atmosphere. Apart from the odd cheesy moment the dialogue is smart and taut with some subtle humour that thankfully did not feel out of place, and Bryan Singer shows that he does know how to direct an action sequence, tell a good story and not let the special effects overwhelm everything, a solid directing job indeed. The story, while simple compared to what was to follow in the succeeding films, is compelling and doesn't try and take itself too seriously or like a joke. The character exposition was nicely done on the whole and doesn't drag things down too much, Cyclops, Storm and Toad are underdeveloped but Wolverine and especially Magneto(who actually has depth to him rather than being a clich√©d villain) are interesting characters. The relationships between the characters were also believable, Wolverine and Rogue's was a standout. And the story didn't feel like it was second fiddle to the action sequences, which weren't big and bold as such but were tightly choreographed and performed with spirit and passion. Admittedly though the Statue of Liberty climax while strikingly filmed is on the silly side at times, but it was fun too. The cast are mostly very good, apart from a stiff James Marsden(he and Famke Janssen's chemistry was very bland), a monotone Tyler Mane and Halle Berry and Ray Park also felt a bit bland. Hugh Jackman however shows great charisma as the lead character Wolverine and has a powerful screen presence, Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is a sexy and icy Mystique, Anna Paquin did bring a feistiness to Rogue and Famke Janssen is fine. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen promise much on paper, and both of them deliver, Stewart brings a cool, classy command to the screen as Professor X but even better is McKellen, who is certainly menacing but gives Magneto a sympathetic edge. To conclude, a good film and a solid start to the franchise. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lot better than expected.,"After watching a lot of animated X-Men stuff, I thought that it was time to watch some live-action movies. I'd heard rumours that the X-Men franchise was rather hit and miss. Well, this was a very solid start.Not everyone delivers a top performance, but I was so happy that my favorite characters delivered. Hugh Jackman does a relly good and charismatic job as the tough Wolverine coming from a place he doesn't even know himself. He ends up meeting Marie aka Rogue who brings him to Xavier's School for the Gifted. Their relationship is a highlight here.Magneto gets a lot of star power from the magnificent Ian McKellen and a well done take on his harsh past which leads him onto his dark path in life conflicting with his old friend Xavier who are also given a nice portrayal by Patrick Stuart.The otherwise talented Halle Berry wasn't as convincing as Storm, I must admit. The booming persona I knew was shifted to a quite monotonous one, and her powers weren't to show before nearing the climax. James Marsden was a good choice as Cyclops, but was kind of the same case as Storm without real punch to the performance.But despite a few small bumps on the road, I enjoyed X-Men more than I had expected, because the story was actually really engaging when the focus was on the right elements like Wolverine and Rogue and how Magneto fulfills his plan. It's not the usual superhero movie where action and special effects are the main focus, but more like a psychological drama with some hero elements. That makes it stand out among the crowd.But even though the special effects weren't the main focus they were awesome, hands down! It may be a movie from the year 2000, but back then the effects weren't used as much as they are today, so when they were good they really rocked the screen.I would recommend X-Men to people who like a well balanced movie with a well told story spiced up with the right amount of action and special effects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I gave this film an 8.,"I've always been a fan of the X-Men, since the Animated Series aired (I'd never really read any of the comics though... ^_^). So when I heard they were making a movie about them, I was counting the days until it was released. Maybe that affected how I viewed the movie, but I was a bit disappointed. Director Brian Singer (Usual Suspects) did a good job with what he's got... the multiple characters, etc. The whole project seems a bit ""safe,"" though, as if the producers wanted to make sure this big production didn't flop. It's a good movie, but not a great one. Fans of the X-Men might be especially disappointed if their favorite characters do not include either Wolverine or Rogue. Mine personally is Cyclops, but he had a minor role. James Marsden, who played Cyclops, was a bit on the stiff side, but I forgive him because I like him as an actor. On that note, all the actors did an excellent job, especially Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, as the forces of good and evil. It brought an endearing humanistic side to a story I had thought was dominated by sci-fi. If you're an X-Men fan, I would definitely recommend this film--but you probably have already seen it!

entertaining special effects masterpiece,"""X-men"" is a well done sci-fi action film for all action fans: especially for those who as kids dreamed of having special powers themselves. Each of the main mutant characters has a special ability and during the film I sometimes found myself thinking about which of those abilities I would choose if I were given the chance. Of course all of those special abilities are visible in the film's spectacular special effects. But the special effects were not the only thing that made watching this film fun. There is also plenty of action and character interaction besides shooting and beating and using special powers. As each mutant character is given a past (to give him a motivation) and a weakness, the film's plot never got boring because I also wanted to know how things developed between the mutants themselves.And I won't even talk about the ending. It actually surprised me. But go see for yourself",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Mutants, Puns, Action","X-Men is a 2000 film based on Marvel's X-Men comic book series. The plot follows a drifter named Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, who is soon introduced to a young woman, nicknamed Rogue. Wolverine quickly realizes why the girl wants to stay with him: they are both mutants, or people who are born with supernatural abilities. The misfit duo's genes soon bring them in the middle of a clash between two organized mutant groups: Charles Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart, and his mutant X-Men against Magneto, played by Ian McKellen, and his Brotherhood of Mutants. Action and heroism follow that lead to an epic battle of mutant against mutant.The film takes many liberties from the comic books, but it seems to work well in this setting. The movie has all the action and fun you'd expect from the X-Men, including a smug Cyclops, the rebellious and awesome Wolverine, and an interesting cast choice of Halle Berry as Storm. The special effects are good, the movie keeps an exciting pace, and the story is interesting.The problems with this movie mainly consist with the poor dialogue. This is the part of a comic book movie that needs to be the least like a comic book. Corny one-liners, puns, and melodramatic dialogue take away from the seriousness established in the conflict. Some of the fighting scenes are a little silly, especially the ones including the shape-shifting mutant, Mystique. My final complaint, which I make in hesitation, was the way some of the plot devices were handled. I cannot elaborate too much on this without giving anything away, but one example I can make is the villain's clich√© ""doomsday"" weapon. Where did it come from? How does it work? It's just there to be there, to be the conflict and the problem that has to be addressed.Despite these flaws, the film is still entertaining and enjoyable. Action-packed and full of your favorite characters from the comics, this movie is mostly for the fans. Outsiders are in for a corny ride that the action may not justify.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What is everyone talking about?,"How is this a good movie?  Maybe if you were into the comic books, a movie of it would seem like a cool thing, and then you just don't want to admit that the movie is pretty bad.  It was not an engaging story at all after they left Poland in the beginning.  You kept expecting something that would to grab your attention, but it never came.  The ending was pretty lame, and it seemed like the last 3rd of the movie was just setting up for the sequel. I never really understood what the story was.  I was expecting much better things.

X-Men,"I find X-men a good start to the x-men franchise since it brings the characters we all know in love from the comics or even the old animated TV show of x-men with people like the wolverine, jean grey or mystique, all of which we know from the comics and I get why some people say now that it doesn't really have good CGI anymore but in my opinion I honestly think that it still has good animation till this day.

X the known,"I knew about the ""X-Men"" graphic novels but never read them. Although I did find the movie fairly interesting, mainly because it shows how Sen. Kelly (Bruce Davison) tries to create a McCarthy-style fear of mutants. I guess that for the most part, this movie is not much different from other superhero movies, but worth seeing as a cultural reference. It was surprising to see Ian McKellen go from ""Gods and Monsters"" to this. A particularly funny scene is when Cyclops (James Marsden) has to verify Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) identity. This movie does make one grow to respect mutants.So why do you ask questions to which you already know the answer?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
*The Dawn of a New Era in Super Hero Genre*,"Bryan Singer's X-Men was a pivotal moment in superhero cinema, marking a departure from the campy, often ridiculed genre and establishing a darker, more grounded tone. It introduced a world where humans and mutants co-exist in a tense, often hostile environment.One of the film's greatest strengths is the complex relationship between Professor X and Magneto. Their contrasting philosophies are brilliantly portrayed by Stewart and McKellen, respectively. While Xavier advocates for peaceful integration, Magneto believes in mutant supremacy. This ideological clash drives the narrative, creating a moral ambiguity that is rare in superhero films. This dichotomy forms the heart of the narrative, giving the film a thematic depth rarely seen in superhero movies of its time.Their dynamic is further enriched by their shared history as friends and colleagues, turning their conflict into a personal tragedy. The film subtly hints at a deeper bond between them, suggesting that their paths diverged due to differing responses to human oppression.The ensemble cast is exceptional. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is iconic, capturing the character's gruff exterior and complex interior. Halle Berry as Storm, James Marsden as Cyclops, and Famke Janssen as Jean Grey deliver strong performances. However, it's the veteran actors, Stewart and McKellen, who truly shine, bringing gravitas and complexity to their roles.Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is a standout character, and the film does an excellent job of establishing his iconic persona. However, it also hints at the complexities of his character. His amnesia and animalistic nature are intriguing mysteries that would be explored further in subsequent films.Wolverine's role as a reluctant hero, torn between his feral instincts and his growing sense of loyalty to Xavier, adds depth to the character. His interactions with the other mutants, particularly Jean Grey, provide opportunities for character development and emotional resonance.While the special effects might seem dated by today's standards, they were impressive for their time. The film's visual style, with its blend of gritty realism and comic book aesthetics, was groundbreaking. The action sequences, though not overly abundant, are well-choreographed and impactful.X-Men in Year 2000, was a game-changer for the superhero genre. It proved that comic book adaptations could be mature, thought-provoking, and commercially successful. The film's darker tone and complex characters set a new standard for superhero storytelling.Moreover, it introduced a diverse cast of characters with unique abilities, expanding the possibilities for future superhero films. The success of X-Men paved the way for a wave of superhero adaptations that followed, many of which borrowed elements from this groundbreaking film.X-Men is more than just a superhero movie; it's a character-driven drama with a strong social commentary. It laid the groundwork for the successful superhero genre we enjoy today, proving that comic book adaptations could be intelligent, thought-provoking, and visually stunning. It's a film that has aged remarkably well and continues to resonate with audiences.8.4/10üî•",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
i am looking forward to the sequel,"I know absolutely nothing about the X-Men.  I went with a guy who did and he was like a guide.  He explained things to me about the characters that I needed to know.  But after a while I began to realize that it was unneccessary for him to do so.  The film did a pretty good job of explaining it all to me.  And I was impressed.There was much left to be desired in this film but I think that was by design.  I wanted to know more about Professor X and Magnetto.  I wanted to know more about their friendship and their rivalry.  How did it start, how did it get to the point it's at now and so on.  But that is also a credit to the makers of the film because there is obviously enough material here to make a dozen films.What I enjoyed most about the film was that the bad guys were not really cut and dried bad.  There was no true villain.  I guess you could say that Magnetto's henchmen ( and henchwoman ) were more evil than not, but Magnetto was an interesting study.  This is a man who was in a Nazi death camp and he is being ostracized from society by humans that can't and won't accept another species as being better in some way than they are.  The subleties of racism are not subtle here.  There is a great line in the film when Magnetto says something to the affect of ""Humans are always afraid of what they can't understand.""  How true.  There is also a scene in here that shows humans experimenting on a mutant and that is similar to what we do to animals. Mutants are treated like lab rats but what one of the underlying subtleties of the film says is that everyone and everything should be treated equal. It is not up to us to play God and decide that just because someone or something is different than us that we should should arbitrarilly exterminate them.  This is a deep movie disguised as a slam bam summer flick.  I guess now I am just learning what comic book fans have known all along....X-Men is a great story, with many layers to it.My favourite character is Wolverine.  Not only is he Canadian, but he is a rogue and quite the bad ass.  He reminds me of a bit between a cross of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.  He is abrasive and cocky like Han and he hasn't quite learned how to control and utilize his ability quite yet, like Luke in Star Wars.  I would like to see him learn more about himself and his ability in the sequels to come.  In fact, I am looking forward to the sequels just so I can learn more about all of these characters.  My friend told me that there is a lot more to the X-Men than what we saw on screen and he said that Wolverine and Sabretooth hate each other and are always battling.  That is something I am looking forward to with great anticipation.  And of course, I want to know more about Magnetto and Professor X.  This series should be treated as if no one knew anything about the history of the comic books. If it does so, this could really be a James Bond type series where it spans 4 or 5 decades.I enjoyed this film.  As I left the theater I wasn't quite sure what to think.  It was good but it took me a while for it to sink in.  Once it did, I realized that this is a great film and the fact that it introduced the characters just enough to garner my interest is also a bonus.  I am now looking forward to perhaps 2002 to see the already greatly anticipated sequel.7.5 out of 10.... I have a feeling the next X-Men is going to be even better.  There is so much more that I want to know and learn about these characters and a sequel is almost a guarantee.  This is a great summer film and I look forward to seeing all of the characters back for the next one. And one word of advice to the writers....Give Toad more to say next time.  He was funny and he cracked me up with his childish like antics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Treat For The Eyes & Ears,"Special-effects and terrific 5.1 surround sound are the highlights of this science fiction film. And what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories, at least for 2000 when this film and DVD came out. At the time, they were the best special-effects I had ever seen, but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see. Audio-wise, the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie I've heard.As for story, once the beginning plugs for evolution and political correctness are over with, it is a simple good guys-trying-to-get-the-bad guys fare. It's pure escapist fun made so with tons of sci-fi effects. The characters aren't particularly involving, either the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys."" The two leads, played by Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, should have been, but weren't. Jackman's ""Logan/ Wolverine"" always seemed to be pouting and angry, but I guess he's a favorite of females.For me and most males, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was a treat for the eyes. Her outfit was something to behold.If profanity bothers you, the film was treat in that department, too, as there was very little.

Special Place in my Heart,"This was one of my most favourite films as a kid. I watched it so many times I memorized the lines. It was the first of its kind back in the day, a movie filled with people who had special abilities. I would think to myself, what would it be like to be able to do those things?Watching it today, 20 years later after the film was created, it still stands up. The actors made this movie extraordinary. Patrick Stewart as the professor with his smooth voice and commanding presence. The amazing Ian Mckellen who makes the perfect bad guy who you love at the same time. And above all Hugh Jackman who will always be The Wolverine. The movie that brought the man out of the shadows and into the Hollywood spotlight. His perfect wolverine hair with the kick butt attitude and the heart under it all. Adding in the gorgeous Famke Janssen, lets admit it, we all wish was our girlfriend. We are left with an amazing cast that delivered a spectacular performance.The plot is simple and easy to follow, with some great action scenes. But even with the simple plot the movie is entertaining and fun to watch. My only dislike in the film, is that I wish it would have been longer. It ends far to quickly.Hands down X-Men will always have a special place in my heart and is one of my favourite films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a pathetic movie.,"This movie tries to be an action movie and an intelligent movie but fails dismally on both counts. The so called intelligent parts to the paper thin plot were extremely weak and never really got past the ""we shouldn't pick on those who are different to us"" message. As for the action, it was drawn out, predictable, relied too much on special effects and lacked any sort of suspense. Also, for most action type movies to work we need to at least care a little bit about the ""good"" characters and hate the ""bad guys"". Quite frankly, I didn't care who won or lost thanks to the almost non-existent character development.Well done X-Men, this is the first movie I have ever awarded a .....wait for it.... ----> 1/10 <---- on imdb.

"The usual tedious superhero blockbuster for humorless, fun-hating fanboys","Fanboys have no sense of fun. It's partly their influence that makes these superhero tales increasingly self-important and witless. If you flip through comic books today, you'll find they tackle issues such as drug addiction, street crime, racial bigotry and homosexuality, all while muscle-bound louts in circus costumes are flying around and shooting laser beams out of their fists. And no one fights crime any more; they just wrestle with their own demons. I recently scanned a comic book where an old Superman and a young Superman were throwing trucks and boulders at each other as they screamed pop-psych jargon about their grievances in what seemed like an apocalyptic episode of ""Dr. Phil.""This movie opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp‚Äîyes, a superhero movie with a realistic Nazi concentration camp‚Äîwhere we meet the villain Magneto as a boy, who discovers his ability to move metal with his mind. Once we're in the present (or the ""near-future""), we see the U.S. Senate debating on whether mutants like Magneto should be exposed and listed on a public register. It's like the yellow stars and number-tattoos Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany. Get it? I don't. How is a fear of Jews parallel to a fear of people who can walk through walls, shoot fire out of their eyes or control the weather with their minds? In this movie the earnest idealists are against the mutant registry and the snooty hypocrites are in favor of it. Frankly I'm with the snooty hypocrites. What would we do if there were real super-powered mutants among us? Thanks to the fanboys' thirst for ""realism"" even in comic book adventures, the issues of Wolverine and his ilk are made to seem like urgent social problems.Fanboys have no sense of humor either. A sense of humor is not the ability to laugh at everything, but knowing when something is funny and when it isn't. Fanboys have nerd-humor. Nerd-humor comes from the desire to condescend to the very thing that one takes deeply seriously. It comes out in this movie when Logan (later to be Wolverine) mocks silly superhero names like Cyclops and Storm. ""What's your name,"" he says to Professor Xavier, who uses a wheelchair, ""Wheels?"" This sounds like the movie spoofing itself, but it isn't. It's the movie congratulating itself for being aware of its own absurdities; and once it acknowledges them, it can dismiss them and take itself all the more seriously. This is in contrast to the 1960s TV show ""Batman,"" which really was a spoof. But a fanboy doesn't get it, not even if you tell him the joke. ""Yeah, I know it's a spoof, but what kind of Batman has a pot belly?""Marvel Comics used to have a jaunty sense of fun, but that's the company that introduced social relevance and superheroes who have everyday problems just like us. The DC Comics concept of heroes that are larger than life is dead and now even Batman and Superman have ""issues."" This opinion will guarantee me 0 of 564 useful votes, but I think the ultimate superhero show is the wonderfully ludicrous cartoon series ""Challenge of the SuperFriends"" (now on DVD). It's funny, fast-paced and entertaining in a way that a movie like this never could be.""X-Men"" (the word ""the"" was dropped so that no one would give up on the title before he finished reading it) offers the usual fare for fans of fantasy blockbusters: great old actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan) spouting nonsense; younger actors delivering dismal wisecracks (""You're a dick!""); rapid cutting so that we're unable to savor a performance or believe that an actor is making more than one move at a time during a fight sequence; CGI out the wazoo; grand-looking sets and fabulous sound design for those who want their junk to look and sound good; and overblown music.Obviously I don't like the movie, but it could have been far worse. I watched the whole thing; whereas I shut off ""The Fantastic Four"" (""The Fantastic 4""? ""Fntstc 4""?) after 30 minutes. And I was amazed how compelling and subtle Anna Paquin could be in a sea of SFX. I kept wishing she and Hugh Jackman would steal away from the freak show, sit down at a coffee shop and just talk for 90 minutes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good film,X-Men is one of the first good superhero films in my opinion. I really enjoy the characters and storyline in this movie. Hugh Jackman is the perfect actor for the Wolverine and his performance was top notch. I liked how the film incorporated the Brotherhood led by Magneto as the main villains of the film.

A great start to the franchise.,"Telepathic, follically-challenged, wheelchair-bound genius Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) aims to promote the peaceful co-existence of mutants and humans, teaching students at his School for Gifted Youngsters how to control their powers. Angry metal-bending mutant Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) has other ideas: he wants to transform the world's political leaders into genetic freaks so that they will no longer show prejudice against his kind.""This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard""‚Äî Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), X-Men.That may be so, Wolverine, but it makes for great entertainment. A smart script that explores interesting themes is expertly brought to the big-screen by director Bryan Singer who uses every special effects trick at his disposal to brilliantly realise the incredible world of the X-Men, giving us just the right balance of drama and action (the film culminating with a fun battle atop the Statue of Liberty (very apt, given the film's motif of tolerance and freedom for all).X-Men also benefits from excellent casting: distinguished thesps Stewart and McKellen possess the necessary acting chops to effectively portray two such powerful and complex adversaries, Hugh Jackman makes for a very likable hero, Anna Paquin is adorable as troubled mutant Rogue, Halle Berry is hotter than a July heat-wave as weather-controlling babe Storm, Famke Janssen is super-sexy as brainy telekinetic Jean Grey, and Rebecca Romijn looks gorgeous even though she is blue and covered in scales (must be something to do with the fact that she's completely starkers under all that paint!).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Trust a few. Fear the rest.,"I have not seen this film in a long time, so this is just my thoughts after rewatching it, which is why I will start by saying that the very first X-Men film is not as bad as a couple people say it is, along with it being at least better than when I first watched it; I have read enough X-Men comics to notice certain things that occur in this, and I know there are quite a few people who do not like director Bryan Singer, but I honestly thought he did a good job in making the first X-Men movie. The film X-Men (2000) was entertaining with good and great performances, a mix of dated and good-looking effects, some fun action, slow pacing, and some issues with some of the character's decisions and some weird editing choices; though there are changes from the comics, there will be quite a bit X-Men fans will like seeing, despite some things that occur that they do not go all the way with.At least one of the characters they focus on is Logan/Wolverine played excellently by Hugh Jackman in his first appearance as the character, with him not remembering anything from his past, and him meeting Rogue and the X-Men team; Rogue played ok by Anna Paquin could have been better considering certain things they do with her character that involves a ability she has, a relationship she starts, and how she does not do much. There are mutants like Cyclops played well by James Marsden who does not do much in the film, Storm played well by Halle Berry wearing a silly wig and talking in a weird accent, and Jean Grey played well by Famke Janssen who does not have much to her character except for having a relationship with Cyclops like in the comics but this time without much chemistry shown between them. Lastly, Charles Xavier/Professor X fantastically played by Patrick Stewart, though not in the film that much, but he was still good in the role with him having a believable rivalry with Magneto when they talk about how mutants should be treated with Xavier's good X-Men team and Magneto's group of evil mutants.The villain Magneto is played very well by Ian McKellen, I believed his rivalry with Charles Xavier, and I believed his reason in why he thinks mutants will not be accepted by normal people, along with him some cool scenes where he uses his powers; working with Magneto in his plan is Mystique played well by Rebecca Romijn who was cool in certain scenes she was in, along with an occasional cool scene with Sabretooth and dumb moments with the villain named Toad. Though there were some cool action scenes, there were uses of dated effects except for Logan/Wolverine's adamantium claws which looked cool and believable; what I did not like was how certain rivalries from the comics were not built up well, some relationships were not believable, the film had slow pacing, and there are things either comic book fans will like or not like depending on some minor changes made that are different from the comics they are based on, along with people who watched the animated series from the 90s noticing these changes too.The film X-Men (2000) was entertaining with good and great performances, a mix of dated and good-looking effects, some fun action, slow pacing, and some issues with some of the character's decisions and some weird editing choices; though there are changes from the comics and the animated series from the 90s, but there will be quite a bit X-Men fans will like seeing, but also that this was not bad of a start for the X-Men ever since being a part of 20th Century Fox at the time.

Bryan Singer starts a great franchise,"Based on the Marvel comics, this is a great introduction to these characters. And that's the biggest job in this movie for director Bryan Singer. He needed the right actors to play these characters properly in a viable story. The fact that he did it well meant that a new movie franchise is launched.Of all the actors, the most important ones are Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Jackman is a find. Before this, he's done mostly Australian TV. That's really lucky. He's not a meathead weight lifter. He's the real deal. Patrick Stewart is the more easier choice. Not only is he Captain Picard, but he's a great British actor with a vast repertoire.The story itself is a great persecution and outsider story.

I also just think it's cool that each person has his/her own unique abilities, especially when they work together to stop bad guys.

Erik is then confronted by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who suspects that his old friend will take action against `humankind'. X-Men spends nearly half the movie introducing us to the world of the X-Men and create the setting.  The film also uses the beloved character Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to introduce us to the rest of cast.  This makes the film slow moving for fans of the comic book who are already up to speed.  Soon the X-Men discover Erik's AKA Magneto's plan to destroy a United Nations conference and make the first strike in a new race war between humans and mutants. Director Bryan Singer manages to weave the vast backstory of the X-Men into the film without boring fans or overwhelming newcomers to the X-Men and the Xavier School.  Singer manages to coax an exceptional performance from his players including Ian McKellen with whom he worked with in ""Apt Pupil.""The only people who may be disappointed with X-Men are the die hard comic book fans who can't appreciate Singer's handling of a complex (and yes sometimes unfocused) screenplay.

"A solid start to a fantastic franchise; not the best of the bunch, but certainly not the worst.","While 'X-men (2000)' can be lacking in action and its age is starting to show in a couple of areas, this pioneer of the genre is still an entertaining experience with great character moments. It's at its sharpest when exploring themes of civil rights, those that were at the heart of the series since its inception, and the thematic elements can be surprisingly dark; I don't think anyone expected this big budget blockbuster to begin in a concentration camp. The film is a solid start to what would become a major franchise and it's easy to forget what a monumental task it had. Setting up its fantastical but grounded world and characters while making them digestible for a wide audience is no mean feat and the fact it pulls it off so effortlessly is commendable. Its fantastic casting helped, with most of the main cast sticking around for over ten years. While the series did get better (though it also got much worse), this feature is an enjoyable and engaging one from start to finish. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men is a classic in the superhero genre and among the best Marvel movies of all tim,"I recently rewatched X-Men (2000) with my daughter on Disney+. The storyline follows a world that discovers the existence of mutants among humans, individuals with unique powers. The humans respond by segregating and seeking ways to control them. Two mutants, Logan and Rogue, with their own unfortunate experiences, are almost kidnapped by evil mutants. Why? Meanwhile, some benevolent mutants from a special school come to their rescue and offer them a home and hope for a brighter future. Can Logan and Rogue trust their newfound friends, and why were they almost kidnapped?Directed by Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects), the film stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Ian McKellen (The Lord of the Rings), Halle Berry (Monster's Ball), and Famke Janssen (GoldenEye).This movie is intricate, well-written, and expertly crafted. The characters are perfectly cast and their performances delivered superbly. The inner struggles of the characters are perfectly depicted, their powers are brilliantly displayed, and the storyline contains smart subplots with clever twists and turns. The backstories of the characters are well-told, making it easy to root for both the heroes and the villains. The special effects and CGI are top-notch, capturing the imagination. The conclusion is satisfying, making it easy to root for both sides, and brings the film to a perfect close.In conclusion, X-Men is a classic in the superhero genre and among the best Marvel movies of all time. I would score this a 9-9.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Welcome to the X-Men,"2000's X-Men is the beginning of Fox's live action X-Men franchise, of which continued until Fox was bought by Disney in 2019 and last film being the New Mutants and Deadpool and Wolverine merges it with the MCU. It features Hugh Jackman's first performance as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart's first as Professor X, and Ian McKellan's first time as Magneto. It does feature the X-Men's theme of discrimination, with mutants being discriminated against because of their special mutations that give them powers. That seems like an obvious theme throughout the X-Men franchise (except for the first Deadpool). I find it is an alright start but I do prefer other films in the X-Men franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"X-Men: A Claw in the Past, But Still Great","Prepare to suit up, mutants! Let's travel back to a time when superhero movies were more likely to be campy comedies than critically acclaimed. Enter X-Men, a film that dared to rip off the spandex and show the genre its reflection - flaws and all. Was it a mutant masterpiece or a Magneto-sized misstep? Time to unleash the claws of critique!Director Bryan Singer conducts the mutant orchestra with surprising grace, even considering the script's occasional ""meh"" moments. Remember, this was an experimental film in a genre known for phone booths and tights. It's no Oscar contender, but it hums with a genuine desire to tell a story, not just sell popcorn.Forget the ""Bam! Pow!"" of yesteryear. X-Men ushered in a new era of superhero films that were taken seriously. Gone were the goofy villains and cheesy one-liners. Instead, we got complex characters grappling with real-world issues (albeit with superpowers). Introducing a whole team of characters, each with their own quirks and baggage, could've been a recipe for disaster. But X-Men pulls it off, making each mutant (well, most of them) instantly interesting. And who can forget Wolverine's claws extending for the first time? Talk about a cinematic ""snikt!""Casting is everything, and Hugh Jackman was born to play the gruff, cigar-chomping Canuck. His portrayal set the bar for future superhero performances, proving that even a grumpy mutant with claws can steal the show. This film tackled themes of prejudice and acceptance in a way no superhero movie had before. The conflict between Magneto and Professor X resonated deeply, and its influence can be seen in countless superhero films that followed.However, time travel isn't kind to special effects, and X-Men, despite being groundbreaking at the time, now feels a bit like a relic. It's still watchable, but don't expect the eye-popping spectacle of modern superhero flicks. It's clear that Singer and company were trying new things, and some elements feel rough around the edges. The story could be tighter, and some scenes veer into cartoonish territory. But hey, that's the risk you take when you're pioneering a genre!The plot itself is a bit forgettable. While there's a decent twist, things get a little goofy afterwards. Some moments feel shoehorned in for pure fan service, sacrificing logic for comic book accuracy. Remember, accuracy is great, but it shouldn't come at the expense of a good story.X-Men isn't perfect, but its flaws are overshadowed by its groundbreaking achievements. It clawed its way into superhero history, paving the way for a more mature and thought-provoking genre. So, while it might not be adamantium-strong, it's definitely worth a revisit for any comic book fan or film buff.

"After all, my childhood also had such beautiful days","It's been a while since I last watched this movie, and in some strange way everything is even better than before. This movie is associated with my childhood. I watched it when I was a kid, back in the VCD days, and I didn't know the Marvel characters. I still maintain my opinion that this is the movie that brings superheroes to real life more successfully than the MCU. Good acting combined with interesting stories about the world of mutants, and without humorous scenes like the MCU, the story of X-Men is truly captivating. Up to now, reality has proven that my opinion is well-founded. Ironman, Thor, Captain America? No, no. To me, the mutants in X-Men are the memories of the child in me. Even Toby's Spider-Man.

"Best Superhero Movie After the 89 ""Batman"", But Lacks Compared to Modern Comic Book Blockbusters","The history of comic book adaptations to the big screen is an interesting one. It's rather surprising to me that the real potential of adapting costumed superheroes to the big screen has only really become a lucrative business within the past fifteen years or so. While the 2008 ""Iron Man"" film was what really kicked off Marvel's flagship franchise, I think that that film is hard to contextualize without the help of two other pretty sizeable comic book series from the 2000s: Sam Raimi's hugely successful ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, and the ""X-Men"" franchise. After the success of the 1989 Tim Burton ""Batman"" adaptation, there was a large influx of sub-par superhero movies from the 1990s. A lot of them either tried to alter the source material to make it seem more ""mature"" and ""dark"", or they went over-the-top in terms of campy-ness and cheesiness, never really striking the balance that both the original comics and the superhero movies of today were able to find. And then came the 2000 ""X-Men"" film.""X-Men"" had become a very popular group of superheroes in the 1990s, getting their own cartoon series and also breaking comics sales records. Marvel had previously dipped its toes in the waters of film with their low-budget adaptations of ""Captain America"" and the ""Fantastic Four"" that decade, but ""X-Men"" was Marvel's first shot at trying to make something as big as DC was doing with their ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" films. (And yes, I know that ""Blade"" exists, but that was more of an underground cult thing, and the character is more of an anti-hero with roots in the horror genre. ""X-Men"" was their first shot at mainstream blockbuster superhero cinema).""X-Men"" is a movie about a sub-race of humans known as mutants. These people are born with supernatural abilities that some consider dangerous. Mutants are persecuted against and face discrimination, and most decide to live underground and hide their identities. Magneto (Ian McKellan) is a mutant with the ability to control magnetic fields and bend metal with his mind. He believes that mutants are the superior race to normal humans and will stop at nothing to achieve domination. Charles Xavier, A.K.A Professor X (Patrick Stewart), has the ability to read peoples minds and communicate telepathically, and he believes that humans and mutants can live together harmoniously. It's basically an allegory for Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, with both men holding different views on integration and the persecution of minorities. One of them holds a more radical view that the populations cannot live together, while the other has a more optimistic belief. I wish that this movie would have spent more time exploring the dynamic between these two characters, as they are definitely the most interesting part of the movie, but instead we spend a lot more time with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Jackman does a great job, channeling Clint Eastwood in his performance of the amnesiac Canadian mutant with retractable metal claws and regenerative healing, but the movie spends way too much time dealing with his relationship with the emotionally confused teenager Rogue (Anna Paquin). She's an interesting character as well, with the ability to ""borrow"" fellow mutants powers at the cost of draining their energy, which is portrayed more as a curse than anything. I just personally think that the focus of the film's story should have been more on the ""chess game"" between the two old men. Wolverine and Rogue act more as pawns in their game, and I think that the focus shouldn't really have been on them. With such a large cast of characters, it's hard for other fan favorites to get their time in the spotlight as well. This is a problem that I personally have with the modern ""Avengers"" movies as well, but it's more apparent here because the movie is much shorter than any of those at just 104 minutes, and much of that run time is spent focused on Wolverine.In light of the other superhero behemoths that have been released in the two decades following the original ""X-Men"" film, it's hard for me to give this movie a glowing recommendation. It's visual effects have aged, the humor is either non-existent or just out of place, and it lacks the fun and adventure that we've seen since. It's worth a watch if you're an ""X-Men"" fan, and it's definitely not awful by any means. Heck, it's better than a lot of the early MCU films. Check this one out when you're waiting for that next superhero adaptation to hit the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

They picked the right actors for the parts and the actors did not overshadow the characters they played. You have to stretch your imagination a bit but it is worth it. The only drawback was the morals of you getting what you ask for in spades.Now it has been years since this movie was made and many movies were made about individuals and different team combinations.

I also wish the x-men fought together as a team near the end in a climactic fashion, maybe to take down sabertooth, instead of wolverine alone, then a mediocre teamwork scene.

Dark comic book adaptation,"In the near future, where children are being born with a special X-Factor in their genes, giving them special powers, and making them ""mutants"", the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sewn by Senator Robert Kelly. The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto, and Professor Charles Xavier into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out, with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called ""X-Men"" to stop him.  Two mutants with dangerous powers, Logan and Rogue arrive at Xavier's retreat seeking refuge.This is one of the few comic book adaptations that delivers fully.  Ignore the fact that this takes liberties with the comics by changing costumes and leaving out characters.  The changed costumes are better - darker colours making it feel more realistic rather than bright spandex, the missing characters maybe a disappointment but the film would have been too packed for any characters to come through.  The basic story is exciting and allows plenty of room for great set pieces.  The mood is perfect, Singer delivers a dark vision of the near future.The script is pretty clever, taking the US's natural reaction to mutants and putting it onscreen - this is a country that doesn't accept other nationalities readily, of course some senator would try to make political points out of hatred.  The fact that both Magneto and Xavier are both flipsides of the same coin, trying to deal with the same problem makes it very clever - not merely a bad guy and a good guy set-up.  The action scenes are the best though and are very stylishly done by Singer - it's clear he likes his  characters and their powers.The cast are roundly excellent.  Stewart and McKellen add great class in the two fatherly roles and both give good performances.  Hugh Jackman is the best of the rest, it was here that his star started rising.  In fairness it helps that he has the best character in the whole film in the dark, mysterious Wolverine.  Does anyone else think he looks like a young Clint Eastwood?  Paquin is good as are Janssen and Berry.  The bad guys are OK in terms of looks but they don't really have any character - they are merely henchmen.  Given the screen presence of Ray Park when he did his recent heavily made-up bad guy his Toad is a bit of a disappointment.Overall this dark comic book action movie is excellent for a blockbuster. It's main problem is that it is far too short and really leaves you wanting more.  Hopefully for X-men 2, Singer won't take the Batman route and lighten the mood to make `Happy Meal' merchandising deals easier.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not X-traordinary, but better than average","'X-Men' has much to commend it compared with the average comic book flick. There's a star director in the form of Bryan Singer, and excellent performances from veteran British actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. Although McKellan plays a villain, he also draws sympathy to his character, which is also unusual in a film of this type.  Above all, there's an uncommonly interesting scenario.  The original comic book was apparently inspired by the civil rights struggle in the U.S.A., and in the film version, there's also a hint of the McCarthy era.  Ordinary human beings, far from being portrayed in an attractive manner, are shown as weak, small minded bigots who might vote for George Bush or read the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, a civil was erupts among the mutants they persecute, one faction (Stewart's) committed to peace, the other (McKellan's) convinced that co-existence with humans is no longer possible, and ready to fight all those who stand in their way.Against this, there are a few negatives.  The acting of the attractive characters who play the young X-men is wooden (or, more appropriately, metallic) compared with that of their elders.  The expensive special effects are also slightly cumbersome, they feel like inserted sequences.  'The Matrix' may have been empty-headed, but it set new standards for integrating computer-generated animation into the entire world of the film, and 'X-Men' rates poorly by comparison.  Also, the possibility that McKellan might be right is never acknowledged by the film.  We're allowed to accept that he is genuine, but not that his chilling analysis may yet be correct.  And finally the plot is a 'by-numbers' affair.  Neophytes are inducted by a master, only for the master to become incapacitated leaving the newcomers to fend for themselves, before a happy (and sequel-setting) ending - exactly the same as 'The Matrix', in fact.Better by far than the average blockbuster, 'X-Men' doesn't quite live up to it's potential.  But there's more food for thought here than in most films of its ilk.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Nice, thrilling, but not the greatest","See, I like this thrilling and well done film, but in no way will claim that this is a masterpiece or a serious social commentary. The idea is clear and straightforward - there are mutants among us, they are different, they are the others. People hate them, are afraid of them and want to get rid of them. Right, the film is about how unique and different we are all and that we all have to be tolerant and correct. But the very meaning of tolerance was distorted and mis-used so much these days that it is almost a wrong and bad term now. Anyway, the film is well made, the video effects are impeccable and the characters of Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, or Ben Kingsley are very good. But, still, even with all this in mind, I watched this film not as a any serious or deep attempt but only as a quick, up-tempo and highly entertaining fairy tale. I am sorry if I hurt any of your feelings, but this is what it is. Nice, upbeat, good-looking work and that is all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Live action anime, but why?","Passable but not great adaptation of the popular ""X-men"" comic series. Once the decision was made to adapt this story from comic to live action, rather than opt for the obvious path of creating an anime version, the question had to be asked: what is the live version trying to achieve that an anime can't? It wouldn't be the special effects - CGI is so good by now that live action and anime can produce similar end results, only the palette and textures are different. The answer must lie in the acting, in the ability of human beings to provide emotional depth and subtlety that animation and voices cannot. ""X-men"" doesn't quite make it in this regard. Which is a pity, given some of the names on the cast sheet.In fact, some things such as action and fight sequences in this genre are still best done by anime. A number of such sequences in this film look like manga frames brought to life. It's impressive, but ultimately weird. The fight scenes are cranked up to such a bizarre level, with odd camera angles and exaggerated violence, that they look frankly unbelieveable. Particularly when no-one actually appears to die in this film, if they lose a fight they just get belted for miles out of the frame and disappear. If the camera happens upon them sprawled on the deck, they get up and wade back into the brawl. If it doesn't, they seem to just quietly disappear from the film. Odd.Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart have both done better work than their roles as the two mutant leaders, doing their own version of the War of the Roses (check the actors' birthplaces and your English history!). Much was made in Australia of ""nice guy"" Hugh Jackman landing the plum role of Wolverine. Apart from a simplistic study of macho posturing, he brings little to his role, it must be said. My favourite from this film is Anna Paquin, all grown up and looking just a bit like Claire Danes, which is no bad thing. We first see her upstairs in her suburban whitebread house, her mom's piano tinkling downstairs (a nice touch and this film's single delightful moment). Anna gives a brave and layered performance in what is admittedly the most interesting role of Rogue, the mutant with the poison touch. A few more performances like Anna's and this could have been a great film.To summarise, the film does enough to pique the interest of those unfamiliar with the corresponding comic series to give it a look. But only just. I cannot speak for existing fans of the comics.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men 2000 Review,"For a decently boring film, this went by pretty fast.
And to my surprise, it's actually pretty dark.
2000's X-Men has some perfect casting choices with Patrick Stewart as Prof. X, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and Ian McKellen as Magneto - all being pretty iconic and rememberable in their roles. Also some really .. unnecessary roles like Toad who did literally nothing the entire film and Sabretooth who was somewhat lame.
Plot-wise I don't think this is anything special, but it does do a good job setting up these future X-Men films and lays a good groundwork for them to build off of.
Editing though, was bad. Random cuts that felt abrupt and out of place, that being combined with the subpar cinematography made the film age a little poorly in my opinion. And while i'm on the topic, the over abundance of CGI in the finale fight made that scene a total eyesore. Even the wire work / green screening aged kinda poorly and took me out of the film. With that being said, I have to be pretty forgiving on this in particular since this was made all the way back in 2000.
Overall pretty okay for a 2000's superhero film. X-Men lays some groundwork that's pretty solid for future films, perfect casting choices with a handful of characters, and an ending battle that's CGi filled and honestly just an eyesore.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not just another comic book movie...,"This movie ranks up there with Spiderman as the best comic book adaptation. It introduces us to the mutants with a little of their background and how they joined Professor X in his fight against Magneto.Stellar acting and a plot that doesn't take itself too serious, yet serious enough, keeps the movie fueled. The mutants and their adversaries are interesting, the showcasing of their various powers a real treat. Because they are not overly endowed with powerful abilities, each mutant having one definable power, their one on one matchups are all the more attractive. We have a little bit of a love triangle, three dimensional characters, tortured souls, comedic relief, and an attractive cast all wrapped up in costumes. Great stuff! The movie inevitably sets up sequels for years to come. There is no doubt this will become a franchise, much in the way Batman Begins and Spiderman are.

As for everybody else...Halle Berry is all wrong as Storm (not exotic enough); James Marsden is a good actor but he's totally miscast as Cyclops; Famke Janssen (sp?) is given nothing to do as Jean Gray and Anna Paquin is too whiny as Rogue.

Made my ass hurt!!,"This film made my butt hurt!?!!? Sometimes you can sit through a three hour movie, and it keeps you captivated all the way through, not giving you a reason to think about your sitting position in the theater seat. Even though ""X-Men"" is about ninety minutes long, it's really slow, and it made me think about how I was sitting, and therefore it made my butt hurt. So now you know that!!But ""X-Men"" is not just a pain in the a**, it's quite good, but not a must see.The trailer for ""X-Men"" promises an action packed movie, as trailers often do. But ""X-Men"" is more of a character film, even though the characters are not that deep. So I guess this movie would be more fun for readers of the comic book, to whom I don't belong.Anyway, I was hoping for action a la ""The Matrix"". And surely director Bryan Singer has been inspired a little by ""The Matrix"". One of the female characters makes a sideways flip in the air, and I think that shot even has the same camera angle as in the otherwise same shot in ""The Matrix"". This is the kind of stealing that film makers call homage. But to Bryan Singer's defense, I would like to say that he has already proven to me that he has a good visual sense, in ""The Usual Suspects"".The problem with ""X-Men"" is that the action scenes are few and far between, even though they are visually stunning.

Dissapointment,"Bryan Singer shows with this movie that he feels a little embarrased that he has to direct a comic book movie.As a result he has made xmen completely different than the original material of the comic book.First of all the casting is almost all wrong.Ian Mc Kellen as Magnetto is one of the worst choices that could be made.I respect Ian Mc Kelln cause he is truely a great actor but that role simply didn't fit him.Magneto is a powerfull and menacing force and that feeling we never get in this movie,not once.All the actors who play the Xmen are inadequate and are a disgrace to the original material with one exception:Patrick Steward was born to play professor x.The movie feels slow and boring.The action sequences are sparce and boring.The effort to make an antiracist message out of this movie is blown out of proportion and feels quite cheesy.I have to dissagree with the wood,spider man has finally done it right as far as comic origin movies go.Sam Reimi wasn't afraid to make a movie first for the fans of the comic and then for the casual movie audiances unlike Bryan Singer who did the exact opposite.I am really happy that spider man is going to crush xmen at the box office.It's not that Xmen is a bad movie(it's actually a descent one)that bothers me,it's the fact that the director had the most spectacular comic book heroes in his hands and made such a boring and unexciting film out of them.Descent film but much much worse than Spider Man and Batman 1+2.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""We are the future, Charles, not them.""","There have been so many comic book movies since the year 2000, and quite a few of them X-Men movies, that it may be a good idea to think back to when this movie came out and remember this got the ball rolling. Yes, there had been Batman and Superman before that, but they were DC properties that seemed to exist within a little bubble all their own. There was also Blade but that was a supernatural action movie. A lot of people didn't even know it was based on a comic book character. This movie was the first successful superhero movie based on Marvel comics characters. It took the source material seriously and treated it with respect. It did away with the notion that superheroes were solely kids stuff and what followed was a wave of comic movies based on Marvel properties that is still going strong today.The casting is mostly spot-on. Hugh Jackman became a star overnight due to his performance as Wolverine. It's hard to imagine he'll ever have another role to top this one or that they'll ever be able to recast with an actor better-suited for the part. And no, nerds, don't say he's not the perfect Wolverine just because he's not physically identical to the comics version. Open a window, people. The casting of Patrick Stewart as Professor X was a no-brainer and he's also perfectly suited for the part. Ian McKellen's excellent as Magneto. It's arguable he's older than he should be but he's so good in the role it really doesn't matter. Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Famke Janssen (Jean Grey) are all great, as well. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Jackman and Paquin. Their scenes are some of the film's best moments. Not all of it is a home run. James Marsden's wooden performance as Cyclops is something of a negative. He has no chemistry with Famke Janssen, which ultimately weakens that portion of the film. Tyler Mane's monosyllabic Sabretooth and Ray Park's ridiculous Toad are both lame. These two are frequently mentioned by the movie's detractors and I find it hard to defend them. They are also the worst of the ""Hollywoodizations"" of the characters' appearances, something they all suffer from. Despite the movie's many strengths, it still exists within the narrow mindset that you can't do movies with people in colorful costumes without it appearing silly. So, hey, black leather y'all because that's not something you literally see all the time in movies.For some reason, this first movie gets a lot of flack today in certain circles. Is it perfect? No, but neither are some of these more recent superhero movies that have been hailed as masterpieces. The direction is strong, the script is smart, the acting is wonderful. There are some flaws and I've addressed a few but, on the whole, it's a fantastic film that entertains me every time I watch it. There have been some good (and bad) X-Men movies since this one but this stands as the one I rewatch most often.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I needed more than this!.,"After much hype, I finally got around to seeing X-Men.  Some of the effects and set peices were alright, but I somehow was left wanting more at the end.This movie appeared to be a starting point of a possible franchise, as the characters were introduced to the viewers without any real story to them.I was left wondering what might've been.

The Usual Suspects are Apt Pupils indeed,"Rouge and Wolverine, two mutants with extraordinary powers (Rouge can sap people's energy by more touch, while Wolverine has an exoskeleton made of an unbreakable alloy, retractable claws, and an accelerated healing factor).join Charles Xavier's school for gifted young students and become the newest members of a team of other mutants, called the X-men and together they fight Magneto, a Jewish mutant who hates humanity after growing up in Nazi-era Germany, and his brotherhood of Evil mutants. All the while trying to dissuade a public from hating all of them. This was one of the first superhero films that opted for a more serious tone as opposed to the campy ones that preceded it, and for the most part works, True there were a few things I would have changed (Glenn Danzig would've made a more kick ass Wolverine, I never warmed up to Halle Barry as Storm), but all the other actors are very good (particularly, Ian McKellen as a spot-on Magneto).

It can't hold up to today's hero standards at all,"X-Men is the perfect example to showcase the gaping flaw in my reviews: older movies have a lower chance to be good, on average. Regardless about how much they progressed the industry or how new the concept was at the time, some older films have been severely outclassed by newer. X-Men was probably great in 2000. Superhero movies weren't dominating the screen, and some of the effects probably looked great. However, now that big budget hero flicks are the mainstay, X-Men looks like silly childs play. It doesn't hold up to today's standards, and whoever tells you it does is fanboying a bit too hard.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
".. Awfull, nul, lamentable.","I was not waiting for a clever plot, but only for good special effects. The plot was less than bad, and the special effects sequences together are not new and do not represent more than 15 minutes of these 90 minutes of annoyement. The caracters have no consistency, the plot is weak, predictable and targeted to 3 years old kids, the open gate to a second film makes us laugh as nobody will go to see it. The dialogs are absolutely ridiculous... I only wanted to leave the theatre and go back home to play Blade Runner or Starship troopers on video.In France, the more people speak about this film, the more they go to see something else.

Next, the ""not too distant future"" in Mississippi, where the girl known as ""Rogue"" (Anna Paquin)kisses her boyfriend and almost kills him.There is activity in congress to legally require ""mutants"" to be registered.

Delivers as promised,"It's very rare for a movie to live up to the claims made about it by publicity and in articles prior to its release; even GOOD movies often fall short.  But by George X-MEN does deliver the goods right down the line. It's made in a straightforward, basically realistic style, with superpowers taken for granted and, thankfully, not >explained<. If this isn't our world, it's the one next door.  I loved the first Tim Burton BATMAN, but it takes place in its own dark universe; the Richard Donner SUPERMAN (and Donner was involved in X-MEN, too) has some problems, but its big, sweeping, almost pastoral approach was just right.  Singer does X-MEN differently, but just as legitimately.  It's one of the best super-hero movies ever made, and the best big-studio movie this year -- easily.Just as they said they'd do, the movie concentrates on the characters and their relationships to the degree that the superhero stuff, of which there is plenty, seems almost secondary to the story which, in this first entry, is mainly about Wolverine and Rogue. I was very disappointed in APT PUPIL; Singer misjudged that one, so I was unsure as to what to expect with X-MEN.  Would it be more like USUAL SUSPECTS or more like APT PUPIL?  It turns out to be MUCH more like USUAL SUSPECTS, at least in terms of quality.And you get to see the X-Men turn into a team before your eyes. Very satisfying movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Hugh Jackman is perfect as the Wolverine, he's just missing a bit of bulk, but the attitude is there. Patrick Stewart is also right on as professor X. Ian McKellen makes a great super villain as Magneto. At that point James Marsden wasn't well known and this role is a little bit weak for him, he can perform better. Although Halle Berry was already a star, and she fits her role to perfection, it didn't stretch her acting talent at all. Anna Paquin plays the sweet Rogue with a good sense of dramatic flair.The bad. The CG are starting to show. They're not too old yet, but we can see them on the edge.

Where it All Began,"It's hard to believe Hugh Jackman has been playing Wolverine for 17 years now. 'Logan' is just around the corner and it's time to take a deeper look at all of the times Jackman has graced the screen as the legendary comic-book character.X-Men (2000) hasn't particularly aged as well visually as some other superhero films, but the story is just as relevant as it's always been. It's nice to go back and watch the beginning of it all again after two separate trilogies and a few spin-offs. And just like in every other X-Men film, it always comes down to Charles and Erik. Professor X and Magneto have probably the most fascinatingly complicated relationship in comics. Charles wants everyone to get along and make peace with the humans, while Erik has always believed humans will inevitably turn on mutant kind. What makes the dynamic so great is that neither are 100% right. The only major problem with Erik is that he usually involves killing. Even in 2017 we are having issues with accepting people who are different than us. That's what sadly makes these X-Men films so relevant and timeless.With that said, there are certain aspects of the film that are more than dated. Storm's inconsistent accent is awkward at best, and Halle Berry doesn't really add anything of value (at least in this film). Sabretooth and Toad are nothing more than pawns for Magneto's use. Some could even say Mystique is one as well, but at least she has some cool action sequences. Mystique adds to the plot with the Senator, but I don't understand the reason for Toad or Sabretooth. Perhaps there just wasn't enough time to cover their motivations in a breezy 105 minute film. On the good side of things, Anna Paquin gives a strong turn as Rogue, Famke Janssen brings an appealing gracefulness to Jean Grey, and Jackman as Wolverine may have been the most brilliant casting in any comic-book property. The early films hold up because of the incredible characters, and not necessarily because they have the most memorable stories or visual flare.It's always nice to see how far characters have come and see where it all started. For the widely popular X-Men franchise, this is where the countless continuity issues began, when the team first suited up, and where Jackman first donned the claws. It doesn't have the narrative scope or the dazzling visuals that the films do now, but it will always hold a special place in my heart.+Where it all began+Story is still relevant+Charles vs Erik+Dynamics between characters-But really, what's the point of Sabretooth or Toad-Berry's accent7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men Review,"As mutants are becoming more common leaders of the world begin to answer the fears that the world has about them. Mutants have been discriminated against ever since coming into existence and now the world wants to put them in check. Magneto (Ian McKellen) plans on fighting what believes to be an upcoming war, but he needs a young mutant to do so. His plan threatens the lives of many and the X-Men need to stop him.This film does a really great job showing that comic book movies aren't all about action and crazy characters. This film shows the ability that comic book movies have to tell a story and create a meaningful film.The film is incredibly cast. Hugh Jackman is perfect as Wolverine aka Logan, Patrick Stewart is amazing as Professor X, and Ian McKellen is extremely intimidating as Magneto. Another notable mention is Anna Paquin as Rogue who in many ways is the audience character as she to is learning about this world.The characters I mentioned above are great because of how they were written. All of their motives are clear and you understand why they make the choices they make. The rest of the X-Men such as Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry), and Jean (Frankie Janssen) didn't get as much so I wasn't as invested in them. Same things goes for Magnetos goons.The action although clearly outdated is still very entertaining because of the intensity and what exactly is on the line for these characters.This film is all around great and really shows what a comic book movies is capable of.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
it's better to have read the comics in advance,"Mostly, I agree with the others: it's not a bad movie, but it's also not a great one. At least for people like me who had not known about the comics before, because I felt as if I didn't know something throughout the film. The characters were introduced rather fast, and some strands definitely have the purpose of justifying a sequel. Thus, the movie itself seems somehow incomplete to me.

Not Bad,"I thought this film was OK.This was more chat-packed than action-packed, which I found very surprising for a movie of this genre. The talking slowed it down considerably and I found myself becoming rather bored sitting through the film. I chalk this down to expectations of non-stop 'Die-Hard' action!Characterizations of Wolverine and Rogue were very good. I liked Wolverine and Sabretooth, they were played well, especially Sabretooth with his pointed fangs and roars (too bad he doesn't have a lot to say). Anna Paquin's Rogue was interesting, it is nice to see her as a confused teenager, before she became the Rogue we know in the comics.Patrick Stewart played Xavier well. Additions of other X-men (Shadowcat, Iceman etc) was smart. I especially liked Toad, a mutant I don't recall having seen in the comics! Magneto should have been made more evil.Introducing the X Men this way obviously sets the sights for X Men part II, III, etc, so I shall be very curious as to how the sequels will be handled.CONCLUSION? Fans of X Men comics will love this film. Roll on Remy Le Beau (Gambit!)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It is very tightly written, cover a lot of themes and events and with all this it's short which is also good.

Rogue is the weakest link of this movie, and is very out of character compared to her comic book counterpart, but aside from characters the plot is great and the effects are amazing to say this came out 19 years ago, overall, even though it isn't the best X-Men movie, it's certainly an enjoyable ride and a great comic book movie, I'd be sure to give it a watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good fun, and it shows respect to the comic book and its fans","It's always nice to see a superhero tale told with an amount of respect shown to the source material, rather than taking the easy route to campy humour and frivolity. The X-Men, one of Marvel Comics' most popular titles, if not THE most popular, concerns itself with a group of young mutants, using their powers to protect humankind.The movie focuses on two of the more interesting characters as they discover their powers, come to terms with being ostracised from society, and eventually find a home at Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Children, from where the X-Men launch their missions to protect mankind.Much of the casting is inspired. Patrick Stewart would have been a popular choice for Professor Xavier if it had gone to a vote anyway, but Shakespearian thesp Sir Ian McKellen turns up in the unlikely role of a costumed supervillain. He pulls it off in fine style.As for the X-Men themselves, Hugh Jackman was a great choice for the pivotal Wolverine character, and Halle Berry's icy-cool Storm was perfect. As always, though, Berry seems to be underused. A shame, as she's a great actress. Anna Paquin's youthful Rogue was cute but didn't seem to have much to do except play a hapless captive. Hopefully she'll get her chance to kick some ass in the sequel. Janssen and Marsden were fine as Jean Grey and Cyclops, but they seemed to be secondary characters. Again, maybe there'll be more for them to do second time around?As far as the sequel goes, hopefully we'll be getting more action, as the necessary exposition about the mutants and their world is now out of the way. It's slightly disappointing that we'll be seeing the same villains again, as apart from Magneto himself they were a little drab. For all her lithe sexiness, Romijn-Stamos's Mystique was little more than the dull old shapeshifting villain, and Mane's Sabretooth nothing but a bumbling musclehead. Ray Park seemed to be having fun as Toad, though, and it'll be worth seeing more of this particular villain.One of the best movie adaptations of a comic book then, and we should be looking forward to an exciting sequel next year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty average but gives a good start to the X-Men francise,"Not anywhere near best of Bryan Singer. That man has great potential and I seriously like his subtle yet so flattering direction. The movie lacks good action choreography, which some some of you may disagree with because it's the time it was made. But I'd seriously like to bring this up that many other movies did good action before 2000s or even 90s.Anyways I really wasn't hoping much from the action side but story-wise I must say I was expecting a lot. The first half of the story is not that common or used as much, but, the second half, you already know what's gonna happen. As I mentioned before, good for the beginning of the francise (not considering comics or any other references/adaptations). You'd want watch the next movie for some reason but not desperately.The casting is brilliant of course with popular names are already seen to play the major roles and their characters and performance was at par good. I liked it I would of course love to watch more from these.I won't recommend this movie but if you want to start a series of movies this won't disappoint I hope. But naah!

"""I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school looking for trouble.""","Not only did Bryan Singer's first X-Men film pave the way for following films to come in the franchise, but it really set the way for the modern era of superhero films. The very first X-Men film really told people that comic book films could mean something and that they weren't just goofy films. These films could relate to the real world and that's why it works so well.Co-written by Bryan Singer & Tom DeSanto, X-Men is the first time a superhero film truly played with real problems we face in society. The film plays with the ideas of racism and discrimination throughout as soon as the films opens. That's why the comics and the film works wonderfully, the way that the people and mutants fight - in politics or in hand-to-hand - is fueled with passion and true hatred for one another.Shot with a knowledge of the comics, and a true passion to make the film successful, Bryan Singer directed this first film so well. Its quite mesmerizing how well Singer shot this given it came nearly 17 years ago. The sequence of Logan waking up and exploring the mansion is done to perfection and the quick editing makes it to me a tense scene. I also love just how small scale Singer keeps the film. It all takes place within a somewhat contained area and it really allows the film's characters to hold it together, and boy they sure do.It seems like Marvel as always been great with casting, because X- Men has a pitch perfect cast. Patrick Stewart's Professor Xavier is just pure brilliance. Ian McKellen as Magneto is menacing and brilliant at the same time. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is pure badass. He resembles everything the character is, and matched it to a tee. The supporting cast of Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, and Anna Paquin, make the film so much better. Their conversations really bring life into the film and their banter is hilarious.Another key component to why Singer's first X-Men works so well is how well he treats both sides of the characters. I feel the comparison between Xavier and Magneto and I feel for both sides and that's important, because most films don't allow that to happen. The technical aspects of the film are pretty 50/50. In some parts of the film - Wolverines claws, Storms powers, the fighting between Wolverine and Mystique - the effects look really good for 2000, but some parts - Wolverine flying out the car window - are pretty bad and some dialogue can be a tad cringy, but works overall.Bryan Singer should go down in history as a director who really allowed the superhero genre to take off to where it is now. X-Men allowed itself to resonate with the audience on a realistic level and that's why it's one of the best comic book films to date. The direction from Singer is beyond it's time, the effects, while iffy sometimes, bring in realism, and the characters are so brilliant and truly make X-Men entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Probably one of the best comic-to-movie transitions ever made.,"Up until the 21st Century, DC had dominated the comic book adaptations on the big screen. Film franchises like Superman and Batman were essentially the only acts in town. Of course, by the time the year 2000 rolled around, Superman hadn't been in theaters for more than a decade, and Batman had become almost as campy and goofy as its 1960's counterpart. This was now Marvel's time to shine. Partly due to a large cast of recognizable characters, X-Men was the right choice to reboot the comic book adaptation film franchise.Even though X-Men set the standard pretty high for comic book adaptations, very few have followed in its stead. Where most first films in a hero franchise focus on the origins of the main character, the X-Men spans such an enormous timeframe, with characters coming in and out of relevance, that it would be difficult to give all of their origins at once. Instead, the focus is on Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Logan (Hugh Jackman), essentially giving some of their ""origins"" without having to explain the motivations of every other X-Men character.What really makes this film work, aside from its relevant plot, is the casting. Not only were these top-tier stars appearing in the film, but they were expertly given roles that fit them incredibly well. In fact, I can almost not imagine anyone else playing Wolverine but Hugh Jackman. The same goes for Halle Berry as Storm, Ian McKellen as Magneto, and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier. I wouldn't have gone with anyone else for those roles, which definitely made casting the prequel trilogy quite the challenge.Probably one of the best comic-to-movie transitions ever made, I give X-Men 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fantastically Cast Superhero Film Bogged Down with a Lacklustre Narrative,"One of the early films that kicked off the superhero wave that has dominated Hollywood for the past 20 years, X-Men is remembered more for its perfectly cast leads and well-executed social commentary than its lacklustre plot and action scenes.The film starts rather well, with a scene in a concentration camp during the Holocaust. While this could have been tasteless, it is deftly handled by director Bryan Singer. Not only does it help to ground a fantastical story on real history, but it also makes the film's villain, Magneto, sympathetic. With this one scene, we completely understand his hatred for humans.From here, we are introduced to our primary characters, including Rogue, Professor X and Wolverine. The casting for this film is pitch-perfect. Both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are fantastic as Professor X and Magneto, respectfully. While they are adversary's, they have mutual respect for one another, a rare quality between heroes and villains in superhero movies. It is a shame that the two legendary actors don't share more scenes together.However, it is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine who completely steals the show. He is vicious and intimidating while also having extreme likability, charm and comedy to the part.However, while the main characters in the film are well drawn, the supporting characters, such as James Marsden's Cyclops and Halle Berry's Storm, feel a bit silly, with the mutant's powers getting more ridiculous as the role gets smaller. The film would work better if the movie had fewer mutants, just focusing on the primary characters.And it is after all the supporting players have been introduced the film begins to go downhill. The movie's second half is quite dull, with several forgettable action sequences that play out just as you would expect. And while the showdown on Ellis Island is adequate, it should have been much more exciting than it was. Many of the action scenes suffer from a lack of intensity and dated CGI.That being said, the final scene between Professor X and Magneto is fantastic. It gets you excited for things to come without feeling like an advertisement for a sequel, as many current comic book movies do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Welcome to the Evolution and a fantastic film.,"I saw the X-Men movie on opening night at around 10:30 at night and the theater was packed. There were so many people there and my friends and I, who are all fans of the comic book, sat with anticipation just waiting for it to begin. I have never been so excited over a movie in a long while and when it was over everyone in the theater applauded and my friends and I were most definitely not disappointed. In fact this film is one of the best comic to film adaptations since the original Batman and is in my top ten list of my favorite films.The plot is fairly basic and if you are not a an avid reader of the comic book you will still understand everything that is going on. I won't give the plot away but here's a basic summary of the characters. Professor Charles Xavier runs a school for gifted youngsters that shows mutants how to use there powers and teaches them to accept what they are in a world that usually doesn't accept things that are different. He believes that humans and mutants can live together peacefully as one. one man on the other hand does not share his views on humans. His name is magneto. He believes that humans be destroyed because they treat mutants so harshly and  that humans should believe that mutants are the superior life forms. Xavier's answer to mutants like magneto are the X-Men, a group of mutants who fight for the benefit of man-kind  and people who also share xavier's view on humans. The X-men consits of Cyclops, Jean Grey, and storm. Caught in the middle of this is Wolverine and Rogue. Wolverine is a very aggressive mutant who is very confussed about his past. Rogue is a young girl who is has just discovered her mutant powers. They seem to share some kind of bound that brings them together. he vows to protect her and watch over her. Magneto has his own answer to people like the X-men, The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. They consits of Mystique, Sabertooth and Toad. Now it becomes a battle between people who don't share similar opinions and the big question is who's right about the people mutants live amongst?The acting in the film is good all around. they all fit there parts to perfection. The stnadout performance comes from Hugh Jackman who is a star in the making. he brings wolverine form the comic books staright onto the screen. Anna Paquin is also good as Rogue and the relationship between her and wolverine is very well written. she's vulnerable without being too annoying. The one problem with the acting is halle berry as storm. not that she's bad but i feel that they should've given her more to do. hopefully in the next film they will expand on that. One other good performance is famke janssen as Jean. she's plays the part with smarts and sex appeal.The action and special effects are great too. the fight between Mystique(played pretty well by Rebecca romyn stamos) is so awesome and very well put together. i liked the fight between wolverine and sabertooth on the statue of liberty but i felt it was a bit anti-climatic. Toad vs cyclops, storm, and jean is gret too. Ray park dazzles us with his great stunt and martial art skills and storm fans will lovre the outcome of this fight.A great movie and director bryan singer you have put together a solid film. kudos to you. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Dated but Important Superhero Entry,"The gulf that exists between this film and where superhero movies are now is so vast that X-Men feels quaint by comparison. But there's something to be said for a plot that mostly keeps a strong focus on character and a compact running time. The resources for large-scale spectacle just wasn't there yet, which may have benefited the end result in some aspects, but it leaves you feeling like there's something missing. There are some clunky action scenes, which does add a bit to the old-fashioned charm, but it does also make it feel quite dated.I like X-Men more than most superhero stuff just by the nature of the world in which they occupy. Their problems and sufferings are easy to relate, and the antagonist's perspective is clear and understandable. The conflicts are driven by character choices that remain consistent. The varied abilities of the mutants has endless potential for the screen. Plus, they really feel like a team, where each character serves a useful purpose and is given real personality.I'm not always the biggest fan of where superhero movies have gone, but this was clearly an important piece in getting the ball rolling. It's too bad that the genre's progress has made this more of a historical artifact than an enjoyable movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Simple story, perfect runtime and entertaining as a cine-comic should be.","The first X-Men is a pretty solid cine-comic that introduced for the first time Charles Xavier and his team of gifted individuals to a larger audience. The runtime is just perfect: in one hour and forty minutes the director highlighted the big political and moral conflict between mutants and humans. It develops characters; I have especially enjoyed the friendship between Wolverine and Rogue, maybe a bit clich√©, but it works for me. He made entertaining and overall well made fighting scenes. I wish that prequel films made in recent years took an example from ""X-Men"", instead of being so long and tedious. CGI is pretty bad, even for the year 2000, especially if we consider that in 2002 Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" was released, and it just looks so much better. I watched this film so many times when I was a child and it is a good memory for sure. Back in the day I was just astonished by the superheroes. Right now, as a young adult, I have to say that the acting is really bad, except for Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin have gone a long mile since then and they are now class-A actors. However in this case they are just robotic and emotionless, therefore I had a hard time caring about their characters, which were important for the plot.""X-Men"" is not perfect, but it will always hold a special space in my heart, in the end it was the beginning of a cinematic universe that they bring on for 20 years, and for sure contributed to start the MCU, which is the most important franchise in the western cinema culture of the latest years. You may like it or not, but it is still a remarkable achievement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Mankind has always feared what is doesn't understand""","I would love to say X-Men grips me into watching all the sequels and develops great character depth, however, truth be told both times I've watched this film it just is so flat and lifeless.Firstly, the film is very slowly paced. The action is few and far between, there are no genuine plot twists, and we are only introduced to a handful of good and bad Mutants most of whom lack personality.Even with Anna Paquin (Rogue) and Hugh Jackman's (Wolverine) performances being standouts, they just had poor, cheesy dialogue. There is nothing that evolves the characters beyond one-dimensional beings, so I personally never felt a deep connection with them.Patrick Stewart (Professor X), and Ian McKellan (Magento) were full of authority, but made to look weak, and didn't feel threatening in the slightest.It was like they were desperately trying to pass the baton for someone else to stand up and make this film their own.Even when Charles Xavier was poisoned by Mystique you don't have much compassion, and it never feels like the bad guys are the ones that will come out on top.The CGI hasn't aged well but could have been groundbreaking back in the day so I won't disparage it too much. But when Sabretooth was electrocuted and blown across the snow by Storm, I quite literally burst into laughter.The Statue of Liberty finale was extremely clich√© and doesn't do any favors in trying to make you want to see future installments.Sabretooth was probably the most enjoyable, and funny character apart from Wolverine. I think it's because he had such little dialogue, as there were a lot of cringe-worthy lines to come out of this film.Unfortunately for me, X-Men was full of holes, and whilst it did try to establish a brief history, It lacks substance. It is a bit of a snoozefest and it doesn't inspire me to watch any follow-up films but maybe if I feel desperate and Netflix were to go under then you never know.5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Comic Book Marvel!,"The real standout are Wolverine and Rogue. The story is simply about mutants getting along with humans. Professor X is trying to make a better world with humans and mutants. Magneto wants no parts of this! He wants everyone to turn mutant and be on his brotherhood of mutants! I really loved this movie and I thought every actor gave it all to there character. Especially Hugh Jackman(Logan(Wolverine). I really thought they went to far off base with the actor but Hugh fit Wolverine perfectly! I really mean that. The movie is colorful and full of action! The fight sceens are flawless, and when Wolverine put outs his claws I was very impressed! The movie is funny at times and very real to the comic book. Real life actors on the big screen protraying comic characters. It's really great. Bryan Singer is the only one I know that could keep this francise going. I really love this movie! Maybe because i'm a big X-men fan but i'm telling you it works! You will not be dissapointed. A must watch! Out of 4 stars I give it 4 stars. Really entertaining!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Slightly disappointing but yet an entertaining movie that is worth watching.,"The movie was not what I had hoped to be. although I'm not a die-hard ""X-Men"" fan, I still grew watching the 1992 cartoon and consider myself fairly familiar with the ""X-Men"" franchise. Having that said I must concluded that this movie was not what I had hoped and expected it to be.There are several things which I didn't liked about the movie. One of them is the visual style, I don't know but it was just all to dark for me, it didn't had a comic book feeling like movies as ""Spider-Man"", ""Hulk"" and ""Batman"" all had. The X-Men uniforms also bothered me, yes I would had preferred yellow spandex! (inside movie joke). The movie also wasted too much time on character development and some characters are highly underused, mainly Storm and Jean Grey.I must say that let the movie mainly focus on Wolverine/Logan was brilliant. For me Wolverine always was the most interesting character in the cartoon. It's too bad that they changed Rogue's character so intensely, it's not that it's not a good character it's just that I preferred the cartoon Rogue.One last thing that disappointed me was the musical score by Michael Kamen. It lacked a good main theme and while it is a fairly good score on it's own, it is not really fitting the movie.But yet again I make it sound like this is a bad movie. No, it's not a bad movie, it's far from it. The special effects are great and never overused. There are some spectacular fights and action sequences although the entire end fight was slightly disappointing for me. The movie in general is also too short.The entire movie was very well casted. Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman were all brilliantly cast! It was especially Hugh Jackman who was simply perfect in his role. Hugh Jackman = Wolverine!All in all it was not what I had hoped it to be but it still is a very entertaining well cast movie with some spectacular moments. Very well worth watching.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X Hits the spot,"After months of anticipation the X-men movie has finally arrived. Now, as a big fan of the X-men comic book i was worried that it wouldn't live up to it, but not only is it the best movie of the summer, it is the best comic to movie adaptation since the first Batman movie. This film is action packed, but it also makes you feel for most of the characters and takes the time to tell a story. In fact for kids it's a story that teaches them about intolerence and being different.i won't give away the plot but here's the basics. Professor Xavier leads a band of mutants known as X-men who serve his purpose to unite humans and mutants peacefully. He is in charged of a school for gifted youngsters who are young kids that are learning to control their mutant powers. The X-men include Cyclops, who can shot laser beams from his eyes, Storm, who can control the weather and Jean Grey, who possess telekenisis and mild telepathic powers. On the opposing side we have Magneto, who can manipulate anytihng metallic. He believes that mutants are the superior race and that the humans that fear and hate them should be destroyed. On his side is Mystique, a shape-changer, Toad, who possess incredible agility and a very trippy 15 ft long tongue that he shoots out of his mouth and sabertooth, who possess fast healing factor and super human strength. Both sides are very dedicated to the people who lead them but who's right or wrong about how humans accept them is yet to be determined. Caught in the middle is Wolverine and Rogue. wolverine possess fast healing factor and adamantium that was put into his body over 15 years ago and allows his retract claws from his hands. Rogue has the ability to drain a persons life force, making it impossible to have skin to skin contact with anyone. Professor X wants to train Wloverine and help him find his pass but Magneto wants something from Rouge that will help him with his plan.First off the acting is great form everyone. Patrick Stewart is great as Professor X. i loved his performance and Ian Mckellan is perfect as magneto. he may not look the part but he plays the part well. Famke Janseen plays jean grey really well too. combining smarts and Sex appeal. i wish they would've gave her more to do but she was still good. Halle Berry is good as Storm. she looks the part and she gives storm a soul. i hope they expand on her part in the sequel becuase there's a lot there in the character thayt is waiting to come out. James Marsden, who has minimal screen time is cyclops, is still very good. hope they expand on his relationship with jean in the sequel becuase it isn't too apparent in this film. You can tell he has grown though as an actor after been in not so good teen films such as Gossip and Disturbing Behavior. Hugh Jackman and anna Paquin are the best performers in the film. he brings the chracter of Wolverine righ tof the comic books and unto the screen. he's funny, especially his frequent banter with Cyclops, he's emotional, his father/daughter relationship with Rogue is very well played in the film, and he's a loner who is searching for answers to his past. Anna Paquin plays the Rogue chracter as a vulnerable confused teenaged girl who is just learning about her mutant powers. This is a far cry from the strong southern belle in the comic but it will be interesting to see her grow in each film. The villians are a real treat. Rebecca Romjn stamos, has only one line as Mystique but she knows how to come off as simply evil. she knows how to work her body and the trippy make-up helps too. Ray Park is awesome as Toad. he's very funny and he brings his skills to the part such as he did in Star wars episode I. Tyler mane, who is a former pro wrestler is good as sabertooth. he basically just growls and grunts but he also knows how to come off as evil.The action is fantastic in this film. From the fight between Wolverine and Mystique which is beautifully executed to the fight between storm, cyclops, jean and toad. When storm comes face to face with toad the special effects used here are great. The fight between Wolverine and Sabertooth on the Statue of Liberty is a bit anti-climatic but is still good.One last point i would like to make is Bryan singer thanks for putting together a wonderful film. i'm a big fan of the comic book and i can honestly say you and everyone involved put together a great film. it leaves you wanting more and i think that's a good sign of a successful movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Most stupid sentence ever!,"I just watched X-men for the 10th time or so. I think it's a great movie and I'm a huge fan of Bryan Singer's work. However, this film contains some of the most stupid sentences I've ever heard in a film! For instance, in the scene where the X-men are captured by Magneto in the Statue of Liberty. Storm says that she saw senator Kelly die. Magneto answers: ""Are you sure you saw what you saw?"" I mean.. What were they thinking???!!! Another major one is at the point, when storm is about to fry Toad (it's so idiotic, you probably all remember!!): ""Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightening? The same thing that happens to everything else!""

surprisingly profound comic book derivation,"In the world of movies, profundity often creeps up in the most unexpected and unlikely of places.  Let's face it; one does not instinctively turn to the super-hero genre if one is searching for films with great thematic meaning and philosophical depth.  Yet, `X-Men' provides just those qualities in the context of a thought provoking, intelligently written and superbly executed tale of `mutants' searching for acceptance, tolerance and affirmation in a world filled with frightened and often even hostile inhabitants.Much more than just a mere action film, `X- Men' broadens into a study of the effects of prejudice, done in almost allegorical terms.  Often when a theme has become played out through over exposure, it takes a fresh approach to make it come alive again.  Yet another movie chronicling the injustices done to blacks, Native Americans, Jews, gays, the handicapped and a host of other routinely aggrieved groups probably would not have the same impact as this film does.  By creating an entirely fictional group to serve as the target of intolerance, the filmmakers allow us see the issue from a novel perspective, stripped down to its barest essentials as it were.  Since none of us brings to the film an innate prejudice against a group that doesn't exist in real life, we are all free to see the irrationality, fear and idiocy that serve as the basis for bigotry in any of its forms.  How many movies of any genre can one say THAT about?The film begins, appropriately, with a scene recreating a factual example of bigotry in one of its most recent and darkest forms ¬ñ as a family of Jews in 1944 Poland is marched to its doom in a Nazi concentration camp.  We discover later on that the young lad has survived the experience and that he is actually one of the first of a new breed of `mutants' being caused by a sudden leap in the human evolutionary cycle.  It seems that these mutants begin manifesting their various differences around the time of puberty, and that as the 21st Century progresses and more and more of these special people begin to reveal themselves, the world finds itself grappling with the issue of whether or not they should be denied equal rights and equal citizenship and even whether or not they should be allowed to remain integrated with the rest of society.   In many ways, I imagine that this film speaks with particular significance to the gay community, since in contemporary terms, that seems to be the group most often targeted with the kind of ignorant, vitriolic claptrap we hear coming from the outraged `normal' citizens and opportunistic politicians in the film.  The X-Men are a group of mutants (women included, by the way) with super-human powers whose twofold mission it is to prevent the world's lawmakers from passing legislation against them and to simultaneously fight off some renegade mutants who have decided to take matters into their own, less diplomatic hands.  Kudos to writer David Hayder and director Bryan Singer for daring to explore such a profound theme in such an entertaining format.For make no mistake about it:  `X-Men,' for all its profundity and thematic richness, is, first and foremost, a stylish and enthralling comic book action thriller.  Even though the mutant heroes are essentially two-dimensional characters, at least they don't undercut the seriousness of their purpose by indulging in the customary wisecracking, adolescent antics that have diminished so many earlier super hero characters in previous films of this nature.  Most impressive is that the `villain' possesses not only a credible motive for his actions, but even the seeds of some long dormant goodness that allow for the possibility of his redemption somewhere down the road.  (And it is indeed obvious that this film provides a dandy setup for a potentially lucrative series of films to follow).  The first-rate action stunt sequences and state-of-the-art special effects contribute greatly to the entertainment level of the film.  Of the actors, the standout is Patrick Stewart who, as the mutant dedicated to building a bridge of tolerance and understanding between the mutants and the outside world, brings just the right note of comforting civility and rationality to the role.Yet, for all its technical virtues as an action film, it is the depth and breadth of its vision that separates `X-Men' from so many other films of its genre and makes it truly worthwhile viewing.  As grateful moviegoers, our appetite is whetted ¬ñ and we eagerly await our next serving.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school... looking for trouble.""","FILM: 7.5
Rewatching X-Men, I'm reminded of its significance in the superhero film landscape. X-Men came at a time when superhero films had suffered damage from projects like Batman & Robin. It arrived a bit after Blade had dropped, two years before Spider-Man would show up, and well before Batman Begins was going to become a reality. Considering this, the film does a good job of taking the subject matter seriously... mostly.The casting is one of the film's strongest points. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen are perfectly cast, and I thoroughly enjoy their performances. They bring a sense of gravitas and authenticity to their roles. Famke Janssen and James Marsden are decent as well, and Anna Paquin works well with Jackman, creating a believable and compelling dynamic.However, there's no denying the cheesy moments, particularly with Halle Berry and Tyler Mane. Berry's acting is flat, and the writing for her character is terrible. That infamous Toad line still makes me cringe. These elements detract from the film's overall quality but don't completely overshadow its strengths.Michael Kamen's score is a mixed bag. While it can feel like sonic wallpaper at times, he really nails it with the track ""Logan and Rogue,"" even if it does borrow a bit from his work on Mr. Holland's Opus. The music adds an emotional layer to the film, enhancing some of its more poignant moments.X-Men sets up the universe well and is plenty entertaining with some nice set pieces and a brisk runtime. It's a film that knows how to balance action with character development, even if it doesn't always hit the right notes. The groundwork laid here would be built upon in X2, which would refine the writing and find a better mix of drama and comedy.Overall, X-Men is a solid rewatch. It's a film that reminds me of the potential of superhero movies, even if it has its flaws. It's a solid pioneering effort for the latest era of superhero films, and it still holds up nearly a quarter of a century later.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

What¬¥s so good about this film?,"First I must say that I have never read an ""X-Men"" comic, so my critics refer only on the film...At the beginning, the entrance sequence in the concentration camp, I though I was in ""Schindler¬¥s List"", but not in a Sci-fi movie and I waited in vain for an explanation for that phenomenon. And there are some more problems that ran through the whole film: ""X-Men"" is no typical popcorn movie, because the suspense is too low, there is too less action and there were better special F/X in other films. It is also no final speech for more tolerance towards minorities, because this aspect stays surface, and although there is always the talk about war between humans and mutations the plot stays empty. And finally, this film takes itself much to serious: there are no jokes, no gags, no sense for dark humor as we have seen it in ""Blade"", for example. And then the so-called GREAT cast... Well, the actors do a solid job, but great..? Patrick Steward performing the leader of the bunch is nothing else but playing Captain Picard in a wheelchair. Ian McKellen is a great actor, that¬¥s right. But if you wanna see great performances watch his other films! I don¬¥t know why Halle Berry stays in the background with her role and otherwise why Wolverine¬¥s part is so important, although Hugh Jackman is a much better actor then Russell Crowe! From the rest of the cast - Famke Jansen, James Mardsen, Anna Paquin... - you get the usual quality you would expect, but none of them has deserved an Oscar for their roles!Now, there are also some good points about ""X-Men"": it¬¥s very difficult to make good comic adaptations without compromising yourself to much and being ridiculous. Director Bryan Singer has definitely made one of the better comic adaptations, although this film is still too overrated in my opinion. (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A new benchmark for films on comics...,"I needed something to take the foul taste that Mission Impossible II left in my mouth and glory be to Bryan Singer for doing all that and more.Beautifully crafted, and shined oh-so-close to perfection this is surely as good as they get. Fans of the story will catch the odd inside joke here and there but with it's great CG, and intense (but not overdone) action sequences this a film for one and for all.However, where this movie really made my cup of tea was the interaction between the characters. All are woven into the story so appropriately and so well that the director seems to rarely miss a hit with the audience with the emotion he seeks to draw.Though this isn't possible without the talent to carry it off, there's no evidence of miscasts here. Special mention to Hugh Jackman as Logan, making what may have just been a good show a great one. Along with none other than Dune's Gurney Halleck, Star Trek's Jean Luc, who else more appropriate to cast as the charismatic, noble and fatherly Charles Francis Xavier than Patrick Stewart. A sin it would be not to mention the gorgeous icing upon the cake in the form of Netherlands's Famke Janssen as Dr Jean Grey, combining a sense of professionalism and underlying vulnerability (with those sultry eyes) to ooze femininity over the screen. (Angelina Jolie has a lot of work to do in Tomb Raider to top this act).The only drawback of this film? It makes you scream for more, more, particularly between the characters, though sequels have tainted reputations of being unable to live up to their predecessors.

X-Men fans will not be ExX-Men fans,"I read some of these post and thought that I had to write something. Cyclops is my favorite character in the comic and in the movie.  He was stiff in the movie, yes.  Why?  Because that is the way he is in the comic books.Wolviren was not watered down because that is the way he is when he is with the X-Men.  He always takes a likin' to the younger person.There were ten characters.  It is hard enough to come up with enough for each.  They did a great job.There really isn't a lot about Cyclops to know other then he is stiff. Unless they wanted to tell about how he hit his head when he was yonger and that is why he has to wear a visor to keep from blasting everywhere.Wolviern is only human, partly, because he doesn't always act like a ravge beast.  He has a loving side to him.Rouge is not sassy.  She wasn't when she first found out about her powers. Now she became that way, and people who have read the comic books would know that.This movie was a start and it was a very good start.  It could have been better if they had the Beast and Gambit and Pyro, like they wanted, but the money was not put up by Fox.  Just like they wanted the Danger room in there too.As for comparing it to the Batman stuff, you cannot.  Batman was one character it was easier to make it and make it where you understand him and where he is coming from.  X-Men is based on many characters and therefore take longer to developed when they have to share the screen with others. Batman movies were good up to two.  Then they lost out.  So I hope it never compares to Batman since Batman droped after the second one.  X-Men, if handled right, will never drop.The X-Men in this movie stay with the charters that are true to the X-Men. I am a big fan and I see it.  There was not enough development but no one seems to understand how long the movie was and how many people were in the movie.  You barely got to know Magneto.  They didn't tell you that he has two children and that a mob killed his wife.  That his two children grow up to be against their father.  One being on the Advengers, Scarlet Witch, and one on one of the X-Teams, Quicksilver.  They didn't tell you that Profesor X has a step brother who is very strong and named the Juggernaut.  They didn't tell you that Cyclops has a brother and they were split in the adoption process.  That the person over the Adoption place Cyclops was at was owned by Mr. Sinister his nemises in years to come.  They didn't tell you that Storm was a Goddess and that she is claustrophobic.  They didn't tell you that Wolviren was an experiment and that Sabertooth was a part of that experiment but when Wolviren escaped he made Sabertooth lose out on it. They didn't tell you that Mystique had a real child and his name was Nightcrawler.  That she has a best friend named Destany.  There is so much that could have been said to make you care for them but that is too much in the time that was alloted.This movie was, as I said, a great start.

Can't... take it... must... stop... hype...,"This has been my first time in a few weeks to check out this page. Last time I was here, the ratings were at a ridiculously high level. To my dismay, they still are.Yup, I'm one of the seemingly few who felt cheated on this movie (for those wanting a little backgrounder, I used to read comics, I was a follower of the X-Men post Inferno until Claremont took his long sabbatical from the series)Okay, so what disappointed me: The characters. Apart from the fact that a few of these complex personalities are reduced to cardboard cut outs (like Cyclops, man. He is not a teacher's pet like they've portrayed him.), there's something REALLY ironic about it all: Notice how all the GOOD guys are young, sexy, pretty-boys and -girls, and the BAD guys are disfigured freaks of nature (ok, Mystique was darn sexy, but she's BLUE, yah?) And this is a film that's supposed to attack prejudice! Make a little switcheroo - make the good guys pug ugly and the bad guys DiCaprio look a likes, and see what difference that will make. Aside from one brief paragraph from Mystique, none of Magneto's lackeys uses prejudice as a motivation to join the other side. In effect, they just seem like horrible monsters bent on destruction. C'mon, people, give them some more human, realistic motivation.I also didn't like the action. Not once did my adrenal gland have to start pumping. Ho Hum. In general, the artistic direction was sub-par. I absolutely loved Singer's ""Fight Club"" which had cinematic deviations galore. In ""X-Men"", it was all formula stuff, and very flat formula stuff.And the script. Ok, you can't do much for two hours, but... but: ""DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO A TOAD WHEN IT'S STRUCK BY LIGHTNING? JUST THE SAME THING AS EVERYTHING ELSE""????

Entertainment for kids...Complete waste of time for fans,"I am and have always been a true X-men fan. I made it through three of the x-men movies before I vowed to never watch another one again as they completely destroyed one of my best childhood memories of checking the comic store week after week waiting for the newest issues to be released. If you have never read the comic books or even watched the X-men cartoon series you will probably find it entertaining. The fans of Stan Lee's finest work should be able to empower him to rip X-men away from FOX as they have completely slaughtered the X-men saga. Just a few of the problems: mutants that are related don't even recognize each other, missing integral parts of story line, mutant powers are ""changed, lessened, missing"", actors/actresses did not grasp the characters virtues. Bryan Singer took people that could look the part but did not ensure the actors knew how to play the role and I don't believe he ever actually read the original X-men comics.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Missed a Chance,"One nice thing about this is the casting of McKellan and Stewart. Despite the latter's adventures with the stupid StarTrek, he is an intelligent actor, as is McKellan. They tower over the amateurs in this film as their characters should. About bad acting, can we be spared from Ms. Berry in the future?The photography is overloaded on face supercloseups, and the tone is suitably dark. None of the sets thrill.What's awkward about this attempt is how muddled all the conspiracies are. Thrown into the same blender are Nazi mass murder, Nazi experimentation, radioactive fallout, mind control, US war-time mutant experiments (to come more explicitly when we find out about Wolverine), religious righteousness in the Senate, one-world governments, the hidden x-men, and the evil mutants-who-are-sometimes-merely-mistaken. Are there supposed to be bad guys? What's the central struggle? There's not enough intelligence here to put shades on the real driver. It's paranoia in the comix, which are far more intelligent and nuanced than this film. How can that be?The ultimate Marvel film should come from Dr Strange.

Loved it,"X-Men, a cinematic voyage into the extraordinary! The actors breathed life into iconic mutants, delivering performances that felt like a comic book come to life. The film editing was a mutant power in itself, seamlessly stringing together the complex threads of the X-Men universe. The film's strength lies in its exploration of diversity and acceptance, mirroring the very essence of the X-Men ethos. The weaknesses were like minor speed bumps, occasional pacing issues that didn't quite hinder the overall mutant journey.

Nice Start to the Series,"X-Men (2000)** 1/2 (out of 4)Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) builds a safe haven where mutants from around the world can feel normal among one another. Soon Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) must come together when Magneto (Ian McKellen) plans to use some mutants for bad reasons. I don't see why any comic book fan will be disappointed with this film from Bryan Singer as the director manages to make it look extremely good and we're given a nice cast of actors for these parts. If you're looking for action you're certainly going to find plenty of it here and you're even going to get a few laughs along the way. To me this here was a fairly good movie that at least didn't run too long but at the same time it just seemed that the majority of the running time was just letting you get to know the characters as if the filmmakers were just using this here as an introduction film and then the real stuff would take place with the sequels. While this film has quite a bit of stuff going on, the majority of it is just scattered out as the characters try to come to terms with being mutants and of course we're introduced to them and what it's like being someone with special powers. All of this is well and good but I think there's a bit too much time spent on this because after a while you get it. I will say that I enjoyed the cast in their roles with Jackman clearly stealing the film with the angered up Wolverine. Berry was also quite impressive in her costumes if you know what I mean and Rebecca Romijn was extremely good as Mystique. The visuals in the film were quite impressive as well and there's no question that director Singer knows how to stage an action scene including a terrific one early on in the snowy woods.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pass the Popcorn! review,"Undoubtedly, we live in the golden age of superhero movies ‚Äì in the last several years, there have been more superhero movies than ever and the majority of them were big box office successes. And the movie which is almost solely responsible for this current situation ‚Äì the movie because of which the superhero movie fad reemerged, after it nearly died in the 90s ‚Äì is Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' (2000). In spite of being considered a low budget movie in the summer blockbuster season, 'X-Men' managed to earn almost $300 million world wide, thus spawning more movies in the franchise and making way for other superhero movies. In its own way, 'X-Men' played an important role in cinematic history.Set in the near future, 'X-Men' follows mutants (extraordinary individuals with superhuman powers) in their plight to be accepted by the human race. There are two notable fractions among the mutants: The X-Men, led by the peaceful, intelligent Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the Brotherhood of Mutants, who operate as terrorists, and are led by the brilliant, but vengeful Magneto (Ian McKellen). Two mutants ‚Äì Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a former military personnel who can't remember his past, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a confused teenager ‚Äì get caught up in the rivalry between the fractions.'X-Men' works both as a decent action-drama movie and a superhero movie. What differentiates 'X-Men' from other superhero movies is how seriously it deals with its source materials and topics ‚Äì the topics of homosexuality, racism and even America's fear of communism. In the hands of another director, 'X-Men' could have been nothing more than a generic mindless action movie, but in the hands of Bryan Singer (himself a homosexual), who also worked on the movie as a writer, 'X-Men' definitely stands out among other superhero movies/franchises. Although it deals with serious topics, 'X-Men' never comes off as preachy; it equally portrays two legitimate, opposing views ‚Äì that of Charles Xavier and that of Magneto. In spite of Magneto being the movie's bad guy, he makes some interesting remarks about the nature of humans, and the audience can easily side with him morally (which is unquestionably a sign of a well written villain). Casting Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in their respective roles of Charles Xavier and Magneto was a genius move, since both of them give magnificent, memorable performances. The then actor newcomer, Hugh Jackman, doesn't fall behind in his most iconic role to date ‚Äì that of Logan aka Wolverine.Unfortunately, not everyone in the movie was on the same acting level as McKellen/Stewart. Especially not Halle Berry, whose acting was clingy and awkward, and created a very unnatural Storm. To her defense, she did have possibly the worst lines of dialogue in the movie (especially the infamous 'you know what happens when a toad gets struck by lightning' line), but she still was the weakest link in the acting crew. And speaking of dialogue, it seemed like throughout the movie the dialogue slowly started deteriorating, with the dialogue in the movie's third act being sub par to the rest of the dialogue in the movie. In addition to that, 'X-Men' clearly could have benefited from a bigger budget since some of the action sequences in the movie were oddly executed. Luckily for the audience, the sequel, X2, learned from its predecessor's mistakes and was an even better movie.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, not great","One thing that impressed me about this movie is that it explained the history of the X-Men without slowing down the movie. Visually, it's wonderful, with some tremendous special effects from the get go. And there's some great dialogue, too (especially Wolverine's comment to Cyclops when asked to prove he was Wolverine).

The start of something special,"Hugh Jackman made the X-Men franchise, and it all started here. Many might say this movie doesn't hold up well with time, especially with the backdrop of the Infinity Saga now alive. However, I'd disagree with that. Before The Avengers first suited up, before Captain America and Iron Man, came Marvel's first notable movie (to my knowledge): X-Men.The movie definitely doesn't compare to the performance, tone, and general excitement and anticipation of the aforementioned movies, but that doesn't make it any less fun. It clearly should be viewed, and rated, on its own merits absent comparison to the more successful superhero movies of recent times.

Also rogue was nothing like the sassy suthern ¬ëgal' of the animated series, rather she was a whimpering puppy.

An Honest Review,"I remember Wizard Magazine and a couple of other comic book publications speculating on who would be case for which roles when the film was greenlit...Danzig was recommended for Wolverine and instead they cast Hugh Jackman a man who, in 2000 no one ever heard of. Time proved that to be a near perfect choice. I mean 17 years on and he's still loyal to the role.Danzig likely would have been flighty, but at the time a comic book movie franchise was unheard of. James Bond got a movie franchise. Slashers got a franchise. Everything else, at the most you could expect one, maybe two sequels.But then the X-Men sort of started it all didn't it? Sure Blade came out in '98, but no one ever thought of Blade as a franchise film. The X-Men was really innovative in that way, here they are still making the movies.Mark-Paul Gosselaar I remember was suggested for Cyclopes and instead we got James Marsden and again that was a good choice, Marsden looks like a prig and that is exactly what Cyclopes should be...a jerk with a false sense or moral superiority.Again it was a great casting call. You disliked him from the start and he is the boss that knows how to get the job down and no one really likes...save Jean Grey who again was an awesome choice of casting.Halle Berry as Storm...hmmm, that one I question. But the recommendations I remember reading cast an SI Swimsuit model and that I would question even more.It's not that I don't think Berry can act, but Storm is a kick-butt goddess and, well, in 2000 you didn't have the feeling that Berry was tough enough. As a result, you only got that one shining moment of the character Storm was supposed to be and that moment she delivered a line that was clearly Joss's contribution.Singer did do a great job. He has carved a name for himself in X-History...but serious fan boys still wonder what could have been if they kept Joss on, or even if they only kept his script.Wolverine gets all the attention, but the X-Women are arguably the most powerful women on any super hero team. Joss Whedon knows how to write strong women, he knows how to make them work. He knows how to make them the tough hombres they are in the comic.It's evident by that one Storm line that could only have been his.And there alone is the singular fault of the movie. The women aren't as powerful, aren't as tough as they are in the comic books. The series was reliant on the men in it more than the women. It was a disappointment, but it worked.Ian McKellen was cast as Magneto...great choice. The Comic reviews were recommending Clint Eastwood and, well he's a far better director than he ever was an actor McKellen can act and he did a stellar job.So can Stewart and even now, bald head aside, it's hard to imagine anyone else as Professor X.There were so many good choices, so many turns it made that could have gone wrong that the few mistakes they made seem overshadowed by the great decisions of all involved.There is a reason why X-Men really introduced us to the cinematic age of comic books.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprised like everyone else,"X Men was surprisingly a quality film, though top 250 of all time it is not.  Hyped up is the term that comes to mind.  Great special effects, true to the original comic book for the most part, and some great acting.  It was painfully obvious however that a good chuck of the film was setting up for sequels to come, a process done less blatantly in the past with such greats as Star Wars, and The God Father.

I'd be as well just playing the game of the film, over and over and over and...Compare with the gorgeously stylish and daring Batman (1989), which spawned a series of increasingly mundane and lack lustre sequels.

Panel Work,"*Sigh*  It's at times like this after two years of writing reviews that I wish I could go back and rewrite some of the old reviews just to punch them up a bit.  Oh, well, how times change...American society loves comic books or graphic novels or even just the daily strips in the newspaper.  We love the bizarre notions of reality that can be created with the pen and watercolors.  Heck, just about every culture loves them.  Names like ""Dark Horse"", ""DC"", and ""Marvel"" are thrown around to the cult following around them.With film we have a more fluid medium.  Ang Lee had a chance with 'Hulk' since he already had made a visually sound film, but that project had mixed results.  Tim Burton had the visual look accomplished by the time he made 'Batman Returns', but then let Schumacher destroy the series.  Raimi's 'Spider-Man' lacked his usual visual flair, probably brought on by studio executives who didn't want him to expand like in 'Darkman'.  'Superman' was pure Donner, but Donner's problem was that he didn't have a model to follow other than the prior cheesy series.  Stephen Norrington is atrocious and Guillermo Del Toro is questionable at the moment (I'm waiting to see how 'Hellboy' comes out).  I won't even mention the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' or 'Men in Black'.Despite all these branches, the genre really boils down to two camps.  There is the light-hearted fare of 'Spider-Man' and 'Superman', reliant on truth, justice, blah blah blah.  Then there are the pessimist, ""dark"" films. 'Blade' and 'Spawn' fall into the ""wannabe"" sections of this genre.  'Batman Returns' marks the high (low?) point.It's as though the studios think they can't make a truly pessimistic ""graphic novel"" and be successful.  So, as in the case of the first X-Men movie here, we get everything to us at 50% power.  More emphasis is given towards what we know of film rather than the comic books themselves.  How else do you explain the X-Men's costumes or Professor X as a weaker Dr. Treves?Perhaps one reason why so many of these latest installments don't work is that they don't create the right environment.  The Batman movies, though they boiled down to pure idiocy by the 'Robin', still created a world both detailed and ugly and reminded you that the world was real fake and not pure fake.  That's another nail against these X-Men movies.What do I consider to be the best ""comic book"" movies?  Mystery Men, Darkman, Batman Returns, RoboCop, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  They annotate the genre (except Returns) with their own styles.Singer did better the second time.  There he used the characters as themselves, much like Kerschner did with 'Empire'.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty nice,This was the first time I watched this film to my knowledge and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a great start to the whole X men series. That being said it had highs and lows. I love hugh jackman so him as wolverine was really good.It served as a good introduction to most of the characters as well as an introduction to the whole universe as a whole. However I do think it could have been done in a better way as at times this movie kind of dragged. Obviously some of it sounds and looks kind of silly but I suppose it was quite good for its time.

Hope there's a sequel.. cause they got some X-plaining to do,"""X-Men"" was one of the films I was excited to see this summer.  After having been assaulted by the previews and promotion, I went to see this adaptation of the Marvel Comics classic.  As the titles came up, my heart beat rose with fevered anticipation. At the end, all I could say to myself was ""Man! That was totally non-climactic!""  ""X-Men"" was such a disappointment. Something was severely lacking... a plot!!!  The film relied too heavily on explaining the superpowers of the X-Men.  Dull!!!  I mean, sure, we have to understand such things to get the complete picture, but couldn't they have done it in a more interesting manner?  The action sequences in this film were average at best.  The big finale at the Statue of Liberty was, well, not that great.  Bryan Singer is not an action director and it shows. I wish he'd go back to making great films like ""The Usual Suspects"".  Still, I have to say Hugh Jackman was the perfect Wolverine (although X-Men purists complain he is too tall... get over it).  I wish that they had worked as hard on establishing the other characters as they did with Wolverine.  All in all, X-Men was o.k.  I hope they make a sequel to explain everything that was left unanswered.  It's so obvious the studio planned for a sequel, which is why the ending of this film ends as a first chapter rather than as complete movie.

Fictional but real at the same time,"How can we describe things we don't know, things we have no idea about? What is the symbol of things that have no definition? ""X"" can be the answer to this. It is is the third least frequently used letter in English, with a frequency of about 0.15% in words.
It stands for the other, the different and the unknown. It is a minority very much indeed. And what is it about those things? These are the things we sometimes fear the most because we can't tell what's behind it? The rustling in the bush - is it a cat or a sabre-toothed tiger?So the mutants in the X-Men stand for a minority of life forms, pretty much look alike as humans, but still different. As they have different powers, some of them quite dangerous for humans, and since they are just different, not necesseraly worse or better than humans, they become marginalized by the majority population of humans.
Many mutants find themselves excluded from the society, running away, living on their own and trying to avoid any contact due to fear of being punished. This
raises not only anxiety but also rage and aggression.There are the good and the bad on both sides, the humans and the mutans. The ones who want war and the ones who seek for peace. This is one of the most outstanding metaphores in the X-Men series and in this first movie. Therefore this movie is a great depiction and may - unfortunately - always be representing current events and how humans treat each other.Understood this way, this movie shows that it is not about our gender, religion, origin, sexual orientation, nationality, etc. but about if we can live together in peace and freedom.

Goated, one of the best CBM castings of all time.The opening scene in this movie is haunting and set the tone for all of it, it's a really great story and Magneto is an incredible villain, I will say Anna Paquin was pretty awful at times though, but Rebecca Romijn as Mystique was so much better than Jennifer LawrenceX-Men is an iconic, revolutionary movie, and it gets an A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best superhero movie to date!,"Growing up with comic books, I never really became a fan of X-Men until the cartoon came out. The movie has a simplistic story so non-fans, fans, children , and adults alike will understand it. The casting was good. Patrick Stewart had to be Pro. X. Halle Berry was the only disapointment. She had few lines and when she did, they were bad. (""Do you know what happens to a toad struck by lightning?"") The biggest surprise was Hugh Jackman. I didn't expect much from Jackman but now I think he will be the next big actor. I just can't wait for the sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One the best comic-book adaptions to date!,"I was really counting down the days before X-Men was going to be released in Malaysia, downloaded all the trailers and even read every preview I could get my hands on.When it finally got released, I went to watch it on the first day with my whole family.And amazing as it would seem, it was better than I had ever anticipated! The pacing, the story, the special effects and most of all Hugh Jackman!From its opening in World War II Poland to the climatic final fight on top the Statue of Liberty, this movie had me in its vice-like grip and just wouldn't let go!Far from being an action film, director Bryan Singer has done a great job in recreating the world of the X-Men on the big screen.Best of all, the movie wasn't just about some special effects thrill ride with unbelievable action scenes but rather an intelligent film which we can all relate to.The world of X-Men is not entirely unlike our own. Prejudice towards mutants in the movie echoes the racial problems of our own world.Mutants are made to feel like outcasts in the movie, something most people would be able to relate to since one time or another, we have all had the feeling of not fitting in.The movie also excelled in its realistic portrayal of human relationship. Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan all gave superb performances as mutants with human feelings, frustrations and convictions.The big brother-small sister relationship between Wolverine and Rogue was perhaps the emotional strongpoint of the movie. Great acting indeed.The on-screen relationship between Magneto and Professor Xavier too was another high-point of the film. Here are two equally brilliant minds who could have had the strongest of friendships had it not been for their opposing views on humanity's prejudice towards mutantkind.Magneto himself was not portrayed as your average I-wanna-rule-the-world villain, but rather a product of Nazi brutality towards Jewish people. Magneto is on a personal war to prevent what he sees is the beginnings of another Holocoust, this time not against Jews, but against mutants everywhere.All in all, this movie is a must see, not for its special effects (though excellent) or action (very good), but rather for the human drama. And that is what X-Men succeeds in. In being a movie that is directed against racism, bigotry and prejudice. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The first film to start a whole franchise,"The first film to start a whole franchise. Now of course X-Men looks outdated after Marvel movies.

"A plodding, wasteful film","How can the same man who directed the taut and surprising ""The Usual Suspects"" have been involved in a film this banal? ""X-Men"" is a plodding, pointless, unexciting, and wasteful film. Wasteful, because the excellent cast is given absolutely nothing to do. Plodding and pointless because, well, it is. Every scene is a few seconds too long, every plot point telegraphed a few minutes in advance. There is simply nothing fresh in ""X-Men,"" nothing to distinguish it from any B-grade action movie, except for the special effects; and the film leans on so heavily on effects that I don't doubt that the plot was an afterthought.I was never a reader of the comic book series, so I can't compare it to that, but I can recall around 1988 when Terry Gilliam was attached to this film and my comic-reading friends were beside themselves in anticipation of how Gilliam's visual sense would bring the world of the X-Men to the screen. Well, 12 years later, this is the flat, unimaginative film we got instead.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Paradoxically a big leap forward for comic-to-film adaptations and, one of the biggest let-downs ever","First off, Patrick Stuart acquits himself well and(though his costume design lacks the menace of his comic book counterpart)Ian McAllen is a good villain. The rest of the actors are suitable. The story begins well, untill you realize the exposition will go on for quite awhile and, your feet start doing the double cross shuffle. The first scene is a prime example of how a backstory should be handled: concise; dynamic- it sets up Magneto's internal conflict skillfully (sadly given the conflicting writing styles of the script's MANY collaborators, the opening is in a much better class than the remainder of the feature. Whoever wrote it  should have been allowed to do all of it), but the rest is leaden stuff they wouldn't play on Lifetime. It's a waste of one of comicdom's richest mines.  This problem could have been solved by going back to very beginning of the comic, when the only members were Cyclops, Angel, Beast, Ice-Man (portrayed as an apprentice here!), and Marvel Girl(Jean Grey). This not only eliminates the amount of origin stories, but also allows for better character development(a wasted Halle Berry as Storm for instance, serves no purpose other than as convenient vehicle for cool lightning effects). This in addition to allowing for a greater number of sequels to play out over the next decade! Only Professor X, Wolverine, and Magneto are done any justice (Rouge, who's strength and infectious sense of humor are absent, is portrayed even more poorly than Storm). The movie also lets you down in the critical action department. The trailers promised an adrenaline rush on par with the Matrix; a kick in the pants; the most fun you could have legally. Well, it turned out to be no more than a cock tease , to borrow a crude, but apt expression. The film boasts only one (ONE!) truly kick ass fight between Wolverine and Mystique. If the story was well written, this would have been excusable, but it AIN'T. I hate to keep hammering a movie I wanted to like so much, but the costume designers made a grave misstep as well, in sapping the flare out of the X-Mens's famous costumes. Since most of the characters were  written as mentioned, only their ethnicities (and gimmick of course) distinguish them by the end in which they all don identical leather uniforms. Not that such a monotonous color scheme would have worked anyway, but this just made everything worse. On the plus side the film also has one genuinely funny exchange between rivals Cyclops and Wolverine(C:How do I know you're the real Wolverine? W:You're a dick. C: Okay!), and treats the material with a degree of seriousness not seen since the Tim Burton's Batman movies. For all of its manifold failings, the movie remains a hopeful sign of better things to come.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Mutants among us,"I remember well how Bryan Singer's film ""X-Men"" appeared to me for the first time. It was the year 2000, the era of superheroics and the dominance of Marvel with its approach were still far ahead. Behind him were Blade and a couple of unsuccessful Batman movies, and somewhere in this whirlpool, mutants appeared to the world. And they did it well enough.We are shown the world of the near future, where mutants live among people, those whose DNA, as a rule, compares favorably with the genetic code of ordinary people. And now, for some time, mutants are becoming more and more manifest, and people are beginning to consider them a threat. And the growing conflict promises to become a dangerous point of no return when two species clash with each other for the right to dominate the planet. There is a debate about what to do.The film revealed Hugh Jackman's acting talents to the world. The Australian embodied on the screen Wolverine, one of the most famous and beloved characters from comics. The actor takes charisma, endows his character with a bestial beginning, turning him, it seems, into an uncontrollable mutant. Despite this, Logan, as Wolverine is also called, is called upon to become a positive hero who will play one of the key roles in this story.The film has assembled a good cast. In addition to Jackman, the heroes of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen stand apart here. The first played the leader of, let's say, positive mutants, Professor Charles Xavier, and the second embodied on the screen the mentor of negative mutants, Eric Lansher (Magneto), who want to deal with humanity and take power into their own hands. Friends in the past, today Magneto and Xavier have become opponents, but they cannot be called enemies. However, already in this film, the chemistry between the characters develops in such a way that I, as a viewer, really want to see what kind of friends the two were, and what caused their quarrel and the transition to different sides. Well, all this will be possible to see, but only after a decade and of course in another film. But that's another story.This same picture introduces the mass of mutants from the X-Men universe. Positive characters are well spelled out, and they are given the main time of the narrative. The villains sometimes even act as unnamed rivals. The exception, of course, is the Mystic, who became Magneto's right-hand man.The film was released more than 20 years ago. During this time, viewers could see dozens of other comic book projects and compare the paintings and their tonality. I noticed for myself that this film tends to the classics of superheroics. The director's work, the work of screenwriters, cameramen, composer - everything is designed in the spirit of a comic book. On the one hand, this is good: there is a clear understanding of good and evil, a beautiful bright picture, a good scale. On the other hand, you realize that with all the attempts to weave events into the real world, this is not crowned with success. The plot is linear, without any claims to unexpected turns of events. However, the script is still good, it allows you to enjoy a full-fledged story and get acquainted with a whole squad of superheroes in two hours, see the confrontation of mutants and be sure to enjoy epic scenes in the finale.""X-Men"" is a good comic fiction. Good humor, high-quality shooting, an interesting story. All this makes it possible to talk about the success of the project, which promises to continue. Given the huge base on the pages of comics, there are a lot of stories for film adaptations. The beginning was laid, and the film really turned out to be watchable and memorable.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Disappointing and slow,"I went into the theatre expecting to fall in love with this film. I had read and heard good things about it, and I like my superhero films a bit dark. And while I am not a die-hard X-Fan, I looked forward to seeing Storm, one of my favourite super-heroines, on screen and larger than life.I was disappointed by the film, in the end. I needn't tell you what a washout performance Halle Berry gave as Storm. A strange imbalance in this crowded movie was too much character background for some characters, none for others. I assume they will work this out in sequels, but isn't assuming that there will be sequels a bit pretentious? It certainly isn't a good excuse for making a lame first film, which should be able to stand alone. I submit Star Wars for your edification.I think that what really hurt the film, (aside from the fact that for long stretches, nothing happened) is the lack of humour.

"A huge crossover hit with claws... I mean, legs!","Finally, a comic book to movie transplant that survived the operation!

From a Big Summer Movie perspective, it provides a tight story, efficient character setups, dazzling visual effects, creepy villains, a lean (but sufficiently packed) running time, even the odd spot of sharp dialogue!  From the fans' perspective, it hits the mark in every dramatic area: the characters all have small but extremely telling moments to display personalities completely consistent with those you've known and loved all these years.

Fun and exciting but it has it's problems.,"To be completely truthful I though this movie was going to be lousy, I mean really lousy. I saw the preview and thought ""oh boy, another cheesy comic to film adaptation."" I had no intentions on seeing it but decided to give it a shot because I loved the comics (and had already seen everything else). I'm happy to say that I was very pleasently surprised.X-Men really stays true to the comics with well developed characters that act like they did in the comics. The casting was good in that aspect but I though everyone, except Xavior and Magneto looked too young. In the comics Storm is supposed to be a very old woman but she was cast with Halle Berry who is in her early 30s. But this is only a small let down.The effects are wonderful, big, exciting and flashy. If you can I would definatly recommend seeing this film in a THX certified theater as it really adds to the sound quality.The plot is good, making it feel like a long comic. Very satisfying.My biggest complaint was the absence of my favorite of all the X-Men. Gambit!!! Who's idea was it to leave him out? That guy really kicked some serious ass. Also I though it was too compact, they should have extended it into a 2+ hour movie.All in all it was a very nice change from all the poorly made comic to film adaptations.

"Special effects galore, but where's everything else? *1/2 (out of four)","X-MEN / (2000) *1/2 (out of four)It is never a good sign when a movie features a theatrical trailer more entertaining than the movie itself, but Bryan Singer's ""X-Men,"" the live action version of the outdated cartoon, is as disposable and lightweight as its characters on helium. The film brings new meaning to the art of science fiction, where it attempts to portray futuristic ideas in human evolution without drastically changing the world around them. There is no explanation behind the movie's concepts, that become lost in an overzealous and dramatically disappointing script.The story takes place in ""the not so distant future,"" where the government considers mutants, people with extraordinary powers, a threat to society. U.S. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), is proposing a plan to expose these individuals to the public. Although most mutants are decent, ordinary, law-abiding citizens, Kelly feels others have the right to be informed about their powers and potential dangers.Humanity has greater concerns, however, like continuing their ordinary existence. Magneto (Ian McKellen), the aging but magnetism controlling madman who believes humans are mutant's nemesis and his gang, including Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), fierce and beast-like, Toad (Ray Park), who has abilities similar to his namesake species, and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can transform into anyone, plan on conquering the planet with complex technology.There is the good hearted professor, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the handicapped but telepathic leader of the X-Men, a group of mutants bent on peace between humans and themselves. He owns a school for the mutants and among his longtime students is Cyclops (James Marsden), a young man with laser-firing eyes, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who has telekinetic powers, and Storm (Halle Berry) who is able to control the weather. Newcomers Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a man with retractable claws and the ability to heal himself quickly, and Rouge (Anna Paquin), a young, confused teenage girl that drains the power from anyone she touches, are quickly woke up to the dangers of their counterparts and his plan to seek total denomination. 	 As in all superhero movies, we expect big, explosive special effects, heart-pounding action, and a final confrontation between the head honchos of both good and bad sides. ""X Men"" adequately provides all but the later, which ultimately leads to the film's horrible conclusion, naturally setting up for a sequel. However, where can the story go from where this one leads off. The filmmakers have no choice but to place the variety of diabolical characters in a world-threatening situation for our succeeding heroes to return to duty.  I dread the day ""X-Men II"" hits theaters, surely only to spark quick commercial success in the box office, but then efficiently be flushed through the drain of forgotten Hollywood cinema.""X-Men"" opened to sensational success in the box office (well over 50 million) undoubtedly due to the big time summer anticipation of the film. With such a star-studded cast, including hot young stars James Marsden and Anna Paquin, as well as older, more sophisticated performers like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, how can audiences expect little of the production. Bryan Singer, who so vividly directed ""The Usual Suspects,"" also precedes to undividedly disappoint us with unfocused direction and a style not even die hard ""X Men"" fans will enjoy. Not coincidentally, the very expensive production quickly lost interest with audiences (plummeting over fifty percent in its second weekend in release). As this movie proves, American audiences can continue to confidently rely on word of mouth.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"With a much darker tone and more emphasis on story, X-Men is a pretty good start after 20 years of it's release","During the 1990s, comic book movies were becoming financial flops like Batman & Robin, Tank Girl, and Steel. However, during the beginning of the 2000s, everything changed. During the summer of 2000, 20th Century Fox released X-Men to critical acclaim and paved the way for more comic book movies while starting a franchise of movies.In a modern era where mutants are made and are discriminated against, two groups were formed. One group is the Brotherhood led by Magneto and the other known as the X-Men. A girl named Marie, known as Rogue, runs away from home and hitches a ride with Logan (AKA Wolverine). After an encounter, Logan find himself at a school for young mutants led by Professor Charles Xavier, who is preparing his group of X-Men for war against Magneto, who plans to use Rogue to create a new era of homo superior.Now that it's been 20 years, this is a pretty good movie. It's not exactly perfect or anything, but considering it's status as the one who paved the way for more comic book films, it's still worth admiring. There are some problems I do have with the film. The Statue of Liberty climax of the movie, while filmed perfectly and a lot of fun, did feel a bit silly and some of the actors particularly James Marsden, Halle Berry, and Ray Park, had material that wasn't exactly terrible, but not good either.That being said, there's a lot of good elements that really worked. The story has a good premise and is told in a very compelling way while not taking itself too seriously. The writing is also thought-provoking with some good relationships between the characters, mostly with Wolverine and Rogue. We even get to learn Magneto's motives of why he's trying to create an era of mutants which gives the villain some depth. The music score from the late Michael Kamen (who scored Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and The Iron Giant) gives a very haunting beautiful and intense melody which compliments the film's darker tone very well. And the actions sequences are well choreographed to the point that a lot of effort was put into them.And last, but not least, the rest of the actors and they did a great job with their roles. Hugh Jackman brings some charisma and intensity to Wolverine, Anna Pacquin (from Fly Away Home) brought feistiness as Rogue, Famke Janssen did fine, and Rebecca Romijin-Stamos brought sexy iciness to her role as Mystique while Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen excel in their roles. Professor Charles Xavier has a cool commanding presence while Magneto, while menacing, has a sympathetic edge to him.Overall, X-Men is a good start to the franchise. It has a compelling story, some good performances, and great cinematography. This deserves a thumbs up from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

X-Men - In-depth Comment!,"I have always liked the movie X-Men! Its a serious movie with a deep story and a dark nature! Ithas a very different cast and some incredible action! The special effects are top notch! The movie also has a unique score by Michael Kamen that fits this film perfectly! Below in a small but In-depth look at the characters of the film.The X-MenHugh Jackman as Wolverine - There is not much information that is known about Logan or as he is called by another name which is Wolverine because of his hair and his raw fighting skills and not to mention his great sense of smell and like his arch nemesis Sabertooth, he too has an incredible healing rate! He also has the outstanding ability to have three steel claws in each hand that comes through the knuckle area. He uses these thick blades for weapons and they do the task well! What kind of mutant is Wolverine? How can he possibly have this painful but yet great advantage that literally shoots out of his hands? Will Professor X and his X-Men help Logan find out or will Wolverine have to find out on his own?Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier - Professor X, The head of the School For Gifted Youngsters. He helps mutants with their powers by teaching them many things. He is a kind man and he seems to be more of a father or parent than a mentor. He is a very intelligent mutant and he can do many things with his mind! In fact he just may have the most powerful mind on Earth. Unlike Magneto, Charles Xavier believes in peace!James Marsden as Cyclops - Scott Summers has such powerful eyes he needs a special visor to control it. What causes this red beam is unknown and his visor helps him maintain this dangerous red light but he can control the beam with the help of a knob as he can adjust this to help him whenever he needs to use it however but without the special visor look out for an incredible blast! He is also a skilled pilot!Famke Janssen as Jean Grey - She also has a very powerful mind though she needs more time on how to master it with the help Professor X! She likes Cyclops but she also cares about Logan.Halle Berry as Storm - This Egyptian beauty has the power to create all kinds of storms! Ororo Munroe has long white hair and whenever she uses her great power her eyes turn white as well!Anna Paquin as Rogue - She has the unusual power to drain the life out of anyone she touches! She must wear gloves to prevent this from happening!The BrotherhoodIan McKellen as Magneto. A very intelligent man that is Erik Magnus Lehnsherr. Where he hails from is unknown but what is known he has an extraordinary power that he can magnetize anything that is metal! Whether its as small as a key or as large as a car it becomes no problem for Magneto!Tyler Mane as Sabertooth - The huge maniac that is known as Sabertooth has incredible senses and is able to heal from injuries faster than anyone except Wolverine! This giant lunatic loves to hear women scream and he has a passion to hear the scream or none other than Storm! Victor Creed is a psychopath and with his long claws and razor sharp teeth he is out for blood!Ray Park as Toad - The green skinned Mortimer Toynbee has a real long tongue and can grab a hold of an animal for lunch and also can use it to grab and use to swing out of danger. He has great leaping ability and fighting skills!Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique - Though her real name is Raven Darkholme, she prefers to be called Mystique due to her mysterious shape shifting. The blue skinned woman can change exactly into anyone and even duplicate the clothes they wear! She is incredibly agile and She has excellent fighting skills and she'll give the greatest fighters the planet has to offer a great challenge!Other CharactersBruce Davison as Senator Robert Kelly - Unlike some people he is a believer in mutants and knows what they can do. He is captured by the lovely Mystique as it was a mission to her. Magneto shows the Senator what its like to be a mutant!I really like the X-Men movie and I think Bryan Singer did a good job on the characters. Though X-2 is arguably better than this and I would love to have the X-Men franchise to spawn more than a trilogy. Though it may never happen but I think about this a lot that wouldn't it be awesome if they would have these great comic book characters together with other Marvel characters from movies like The Hulk, Spider-Man, Blade, The Punisher, & Daredevil? Think of the epicness and possibilities! I hope you have enjoyed this In-depth look at The X-Men!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kinda stupid but highly entertaining. X-men is a paradox.,"This is an intriguing movie.The adaptation from the X-men series is disrespectful, the script is poor, the production awkward at times...

How the hell??Well it's another demonstration that good direction (Bryan Singer is definitely an excellent filmmaker) with a good cast may compensate for poorly written movies. Think about the line ""America was going to be a land of tolerance, of peace"" - a stupid ""cliche"", that would have sounded dumb in many mouths, but then... in Ian McKellen's mouth, it sounds... great. What an actor. And the rest of the cast is brilliant too. With the exception of Hale Berry, portraiting a very little convincing Tornade.

The movie is very consistent, no uneven material it has at all, it is very stylish and very enjoyable also. The tone, the atmosphere of the movie are so different from the comic book or/and the animation, it is like Bryan Singer creates his own X-Men world, but somehow, it does not turn into a flaw or disappointment. Visually, it looks like a thriller rather than a (colorful) fantastic super hero movie, but this works somehow. Personally, I did not complain about it. Instead, it makes the movie eccentric, idiosyncratic. I like the snowy shots and despite it is short, one of the best action scenes of the movie, the fight after the accident. As for Magneto, Ian McKellen was made for Magneto (and of course for Gandalf too) As I know, some people complained about Sabretooth, but may be even if he was not made for the character like McKellen, Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Halle Berry as Storm, Tyler Mane looks great as Sabretooth. I saw the original character, I watched the animation, but I don't know why they were not satisfied with Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, what was wrong? He is as harsh as the original character too. Halle Berry is so cute by the way. There are a few smart moments like the steel balls or the metal floors related to Magneto by the way, I liked it. The action scene takes place in the station is my second favorite. Just a note: there is a shot with a weird angle, it was amazing. Visually, X-Men is one of the most stark, plain movies ever made probably. The last parts are amazing too, we see some cool fight scenes, everyone encounters with each other. Every time it is so fun to watch thanks to Singer's stark, eccentric direction and the colorful characters. The Wolverine Sabretooth clash is not the focus of the movie, but better than X-Men Origins Wolverine. On the Statue of Liberty, there is a spiral camera shot, loved! And X-Men has much more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thoroughly Entertaining,"I enjoyed this movie even though my knowledge of the comic book version is very limited.  Usually comic books don't translate well to movies (due to incompetent directing and scriptwriting) but I have to give this one a thumbs up.  They did the right thing to introduce only a few mutants, because there are too many mutant characters in the X-Men comic.  To put them all in the movie would be silly.  With a few central characters, we can focus more on the storyline than mere mutant-plethora eye-candy.  Filmmaking is different from comics, after all.The cast delivered satisfying performances.  Professor X is just spot on and looks like the actual comic character.  Wolverine is very convincing, and Magneto has presence.  The other characters are also played very well, like Jean Grey, and Rogue who is given a sensitive performance.  My only minor quibble is Storm. Halle Berry is very good-looking, but somehow her acting is wooden and is made obvious that she is just play acting.  It's no big deal though.But the real goody comes at the end.  I just LOVE how open-ended the ending was!  It screams out that a sequel is in the making, which made me to look forward as how the story continues ... just like 'Back To The Future' trilogy.  The possibilities of bringing more new mutants are exhilirating.A very well done movie with great casts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
special effects wasted due to lack of progressive plot,"X-men has some decent special effects and directing, but it is wasted due to a lack of a progressive plot.  Movie goers want to see a movie that moves along, in the X-men's case the movie moves at a snails pace and the only character the audience genuinely cares about is Wolverine.  They should call this movie Wolverine and friends.They should have kept this one in comic book format.  Lets hope X-Men 2 has a more exciting and explosive plot.  Isn't that what comic books are for???",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I lost interest about half way into it,"I won't waste time on this movie review. I just found that I did not care about any of the characters in the film.When the Pyro character decided to not sit at the kids table, that was the point I felt it was just too much. Too many heros and if you do not follow them, you have no idea what each can do and why.It started off badly for me when another immature person, thought it was ok to in danger people to make a political statement. It went down hill from there.I am not fond of characters that have what appears to be no limits to what they can do, it was in a word childish.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Exciting,"I know more about nuclear fission than I do about this comic book series so I can't comment on how well it captures its source material but I can say it is one of the most exciting movies I've seen in a long time, and despite several jump out of the seat action sequences, it also slows down frequently enough to get to know and like the heroes.  A lot of plot strands are left unresolved for the inevitable sequel, and for a change, I look forward to it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Start to the Trilogy,"This film has everything you need to start off a movie series on the right foot. The action is tremendous, and the characters were great. the casting choices were just so on par, with James Marsden as Cyclops, Famke Janssen as the sexy yet timid Jean Grey and oh my lord Ian McKellen as Magneto. Not enough for you? the very awesome Patrick Stewart stars, and Halle Berry who I usually find dismal was pretty decent in this movie. Hugh Jackman looks pretty bad ass as Wolverine, and he can carry the role quite well too.I believe Bryan Singer did a really good job with this film. And the score by the deceased Michael Kamen was simply riveting through out.Nuff said!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very good comic adaptation, but not great","I enjoyed X-Men more than I thought I would, especially after some of the leaked reviews that tore the rough cuts to shreds.  My only prior knowledge of the X-Men came from the Fox cartoon, but I was very pleased to see most of the characters make it into the first installment of the movie franchise. Standout performances from Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen anchored the movie, along with very cool SFX.Basically, there were a few key problems with the movie, but nothing that stopped me from enjoying it thoroughly.  For one thing, the film is at least 20 minutes too short.  We could have gone more in-depth with a lot of the background, or the focus of the story, or pretty much anything--the movie was very condensed.  Also, the fight scenes, while interesting, were not very impressive on a Matrix/Episode I level.  I have to give the film-makers credit, because it's hard to choreograph for somebody who has claws coming out of his hands, making it pretty difficult for an opponent to block realistically.  The movie was also definitely PG-13; some of the humor could have been much more adult, but I guess it's nice that the mom sitting next to me with her 9-year old didn't have to worry.  James Marsden, Famke Janssen, and Halle Berry all turned in fair performances.Overall, a good movie worth the price of admission.  I look forward to the sequel(s), in which we should get to see the Sentinels, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Colossus...  Should be cool. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still One of the Best Superhero Movies,"X-Men may have come out fairly early in the recent superhero renaissance, but it still holds up as one of the genre's best. Blade was the first serious modern superhero film, but X-Men was the one that made them popular. For the first time since they stopped making Superman films, audiences got to see heroes using superpowers fighting others with superpowers.The film was also one of the first to deal with some deep themes. It is in no way a simple good guy versus bad guy story that usually populates the genre. Magneto is every bit as developed, interesting, and sympathetic as the heroes. Possibly, more so. And Singer is able to use his own experiences being a homosexual to enhance the mutant problems so that it becomes an excellent allegory for current events that still remains true to the vast comic book history.The story is presented as an origin story, but it's not like the numerous other origin stories. Like Blade and Tim Burton's Batman, they're already heroes and can start with the action right away. The Wolverine-Rogue relationship works wonderfully. I don't quite know why they didn't just use Jubilee as it is in the comics, but Rogue works just fine. The Logan-Jean-Scott love triangle starts off great, though I wish they went further with it in the sequels. Though the really terrific relationship is the Xavier-Magneto friendship-turned-rivalry which out shines everyone else. It really added a whole other dimension to the movie that, quite honestly, no other superhero movie has been able to match.The movie does have a bit too much exposition. Sure there is a lot needed to be explained, but there are a few too many sections of the movie where it's just long speeches by Jean, Xavier, etc. There is plenty of action, more than many other origin movies, and they all work well that you can forgive the long exposition.The movie is nearly perfectly cast. Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto, Jean, Rogue, and Senator Kelly are exactly like they are in the comics. Now, I can hardly read the comics without thinking of their voices to match the dialogue. Mystique is good, but she is better in the sequel. I liked Cyclops, though he has progressively less to do in the sequels which is disappointing since he is such an interesting character. Storm is fine here, but Berry's subsequent rise to fame and insistence on more screen time drags down later movies. I loved Mane as Sabretooth, but the character is given so little to do and honestly he was portrayed more interestingly and faithfully in the Wolverine movie.The movie isn't just a terrific superhero movie, but a great movie in general. Singer really goes above in beyond in his two X-Men movie, that it's a real shame the next two had to be so overstuffed with characters that everyone became uninteresting. There's a faithfulness and intelligence that's missing from too many other superheroes. X2: X-Men United may do everything this movie did better, but it's still a wonderful movie that I'll happily watch any time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Mankind has always feared what it doesn't understand""","I don't really know if X-Men is the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the coolest.The comic series was the ultimate in style over substance, and very chic it was too. It originally stiffed as a Stan Lee/Jack Kirby alternative to Marvel's own range of Fantastic Four/Avengers/Spiderman, et al., almost coming close to cancellation. An idea of how relatively unsophisticated these early issues were reveal that the ""X"" in X-Men originally stood for ""Xtra"". A five-strong team, only two of them really make it through to the movie. Angel, a winged playboy, is wholly absent, while plans to include the acrobatic beast were dropped after his later transformation into a blue-furred creature proved too extensive an undertaking. Bobby Drake as the Iceman does get a small role in the form of Shawn Ashmore, though this is as a young student, and not the same age group as Cyclops or Jean Grey. Jean Grey (codenamed ""Marvel Girl"" in the comics, one of the series' less inspired inventions, and absent here) appears with James Marsden as the guy who can shoot lasers from his eyes.When the comic became cool was when it's allegorical issues (mutated humans as oppressed minorities) were scripted by Chris Claremont in the mid-seventies onwards. He totally reworked the team into largely what it is on screen. (Though the popular Nightcrawler is missing, and I didn't spot Colossus, played as a bit part by Donald Mackinnon). Debatably the most popular superhero of the Marvel range, Wolverine was also arguably the first short superhero, his 5'3 frame here being transformed into the 6'2 build of Hugh Jackman. Jackman is magnificent, his cynical, taciturn view emerging from the seedy bars and fighting clubs he frequents, later being used to prick the more absurd elements of the plot. His adamantium claws are truly impressive on screen (the special effects being used, as elsewhere, to serve the plot, rather than being the plot. George Lucas, please take note), and he even gets to use them on Cyclops as a new form of ""giving the finger"". His sniping, macho relationship with Cyclops provides some of the better sequences, and Jackman's timing means that these elements always seem spontaneous, not bog-standard retorts written to order. Best line? After emerging from a battle with the shapechanging Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who assumed his form, he finds Cyclops ready to blast him, just in case. ""Wait, it's really me"" he urges. ""Prove it"", he's told. ""You're a dick"" comes the reply. Cyclops can only nod in agreement. Perhaps less successful is his love for Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) which, while again being true to the comic, isn't that well developed on screen.Wolverine gets all the best lines, all the coolest things to do, and is one of the three main characters involved, the rest just peripheral to greater or lesser extents. Patrick Stewart gets a fair chunk of the earlier part of the film, doling out exposition as Captain Jean-Luc, er, Professor Charles Xavier. It must be disheartening for some of the cast that Stewart is such a good actor without having really to try, and there is evidence here that's he going through the motions. Halle Berry gives a great effort as Storm, yet doesn't really impress. Maybe she's miscast, as I always imagined Storm with a bit more attitude, sort of a Grace Jones type.Then there's Ian McKellen as Magneto, unused to the SF franchise lark, and so managing to outact Stewart by a considerable margin. His character is still fraught with the odd problem, mainly, his origins. The X-Men series is, of course, foolproof, as no real ""origin"" is needed. There are no cosmic rays, no gamma blasts, and no getting bitten by arachnids of radioactive properties. They've got the powers from birth/puberty and that's all there is to it. Yet the film casts McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr, Jewish victim of the holocaust. This is still reasonably true to the comics, and the sequence is brilliantly shot, lashings of rain making it look like a Kurosawa wet dream, yet this does take something away. The whole idea about the X-Men is that it's allegorical (later sequences allude to, but do not directly represent, the McCarthy witch trials), yet the idea of the lead villain being a persecuted Jew is spelling it out. This comes across as similar to a scene in ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" where we are shown chimpanzee war protesters. Allegory and literalism are two separate elements, and should not be mixed. Again, McKellen is ideally suited towards this sort of thing, being homosexual in real life, though it's all-encompassing reference to persecution of minorities is somewhat offset by the generic good looks of the cast.Characters are reasonably well drawn, the script is literate, and there's a real sense that the people involved cared about what they were making. There's nice little in-jokes (a reference to Wolverine's comic book ""yellow spandex"", whereas here the group wear cool black leather) and cameos from mutants that don't have a real part to play, though not introduced to casual audience distraction (Ariel/Shadowcat in particular getting a nice throwaway appearance). There's even a great explanation of how Rogue (Anna Paquin) gets the white streak in her hair.But this isn't a film for comic book fans, it's based purely towards casual audiences who may never have even picked up an issue. Some argue that it's too short, but for a superhero movie it sensibly neglects the dragging two-hours plus duration and goes for the 104 minutes slot. It has three clear acts and leaves you wanting more. Note how Wolverine's mysterious origins are not revealed, but left hanging, rather than the neat sewing up of loose ends that left Batman with nowhere to go after he avenged his parents' death in the first Tim Burton movie. Also notable (if not necessarily commendable) is that the X-Men kill their enemies, and it's not just Wolverine doing the slaying.I don't know if this film will stand up to repeated viewings. In five years' time it might be hopelessly outdated, or it's funky, slick style and stylish - though not ostentatious - direction might be lost on me. I suspect it really contains very little substance at all, but it's snappy, yet realistic dialogue and ""wow"" super-powered fight scenes are clouding my reasoning. Who needs one Batman when you can have a whole army of mutants? No, in just a few years' time I might wake up and see this for what it really is. But for now, X-Men is the best summer blockbuster film of the last ten years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rated: 7/10 why?...,"When i learned that X-men was in-production i was looking forward to seeing that Big-bucks-and-quality movie, but when i watched it i was pleased at the begging then i started thinking: Why storm and cyclops have so small roles? Why some scenes that were on the first draft were wiped out in the shooting script? And finally why the romance between Wolverine and Jane Grey, i mean just tell us were will it leads? Oh, yeah i forgot there is going be a sequel! So the result is that X-men are not a self-containted movie, because Singer was strugling to make this a franchise! So, there is no point in making this film without a sequel. But this is a very well directed movie, it has the greatest art direction since the Terminator 2 film. Wolverine is played very nice by Hugh Jackman. Magneto is played very good and Professor-X too, but Singer is strangely very attracted by Magneto, so in all the movie although Magneto Kicks Asses, he is consider to be a sociopath! That's just not what Magneto must be considered to be! Anyway despite of these weaknesses X-men is a well made, thank God it is no Batman & Robin crap and i hope the sequel is a better movie... P.S_Cyclops and Storm must have bigger parts in the sequel! P.S2_Natalie Portman would look nicer in the part of Rogue!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Mankind is not evil, just uninformed.""","That's what Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart, Captain Picard of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" fame) said of human beings in a scene ultimately deleted from the theatrical film but used in one of the trailers.Based on the popular Marvel Comic book, this somewhat overlong, surprisingly un-action packed but not completely uninteresting film chronicles the exploits of runaway misfit Rogue (a miscast Anna Paquin) before she acquires the powers of flight and super strength and brawling loner Logan, AKA: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, in the role that made him a star) and their crossing paths with the X-Men and joining them to help thwart magnet master Magneto's (Ian McKellan, Gandalf of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) evil scheme to mutate human beings so that all life on Earth can be united in commonly being mutants. Then again, unification doesn't sound quite so bad after all. Magneto's reasoning, of course, is that there can no longer be prejudice against mutants if everyone is a mutant. Ironically, as this film depicts it, mutants will eventually inherit the Earth anyway because they are, after all, the next step in human evolution.And in real life, the mutants probably would have taken over the world by now, but for the sake of drama, mutants are made just slightly less powerful enough to keep them from completely taking over the world.Now this isn't a bad film, but as a comic book fan, I'm not sure I like it as a comic book adaptation. Hugh Jackman is a capable albeit less bad ass and less gruff Wolverine, and Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellan are well cast and well matched as Professor X & Magneto, but the film is too tightly focused on the overly popular Wolverine character to give enough space for character development for the other X-Men. James Marsden is already too young to be an effective Cyclops but it's even harder to gage his acting ability when he has so little to say and do. Halle Berry and Famke Janssen make the most of their roles as Storm & Jean Grey, respectively. Tyler Mane is an imposing Saber Tooth and Rebecca R-Stamos is hard to ignore as the blue shape shifter Mystique. Ray Park (Darth Maul of ""Phantom Menace""), is just annoying as Toad.The special effects are bright and colorful, but there isn't enough action to go along with it. The X-Men are also made down right pathetic during their fight with the obnoxious Toad character. That is, when Storm isn't blowing stuff at him and zapping him with lightning.All in all, I preferred the animated series Fox had back in 1992. The sequel is an improvement of sorts.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"X-MEN has brains, but it is terribly RUSHED...","Here we are... 1 year before the franchise, waiting to see the un-answered questions, the plot gaps and the under-developed characters to be fulfilled. Well... you see X-MEN's BASIC problem is that it so keen on to be a franchise, that forgets to be a decent, fulfilling and self-contained 100mins feature film! But let's take things from the begging...Firstly Brian Singer isn't Joel Schumacher(THANK GOD!) and so X-Men isn't a garish, nightmarish BATMAN & ROBIN s***e. But it is not a slick and stylish Batman either, it has a magic but it has flaws that after a certain point(e.g. thinking about the movie!) became really obvious. So what is it? Singer said this ain't gonna be a brain-less action-packed superheroes in tights et la, he proves it when we actually see the opening Auschwitz sequence, with the very emotionally powerfull scene of the young Magneto. The message is obvious Mutants are like the Jews, chased and hated by normal people. They live in prejudice and in Terror, a Terror which is leading the humans against the mutants. In a  nutshell: They are hated by the people they are trying to save and who themselves must deal with their own fears and emotions!A very powerfull story-line(for whom director B. Singer receives a credit), a set of very strong characters(Rogue,a very good Anna Paquin, a teen misfit who is doomed to a life where skin touch must be avoided-a character that best embodies the sense of the mutant dislocation-/ Magneto, kick-ass Ian McKellen who does GREAT, although he is notoriously atracted by Brian Singer's direction!/ and WOLVERINE-with the almost famous(now) Hugh Jackman. He kinda pretty and TOO TALL for Wolvie but he kicks some serious but there!) and some subplots(the romance between Wolverine and Jean Gray, the mystery behind the ""mask"" of Wolverine et la) who are never really answered and are left hanging there like a ""poop on a stick""! And what about the UNDER-DEVELOPED Cyclops(a cold-ass Madsen!), Storm(a coooooool Halle-white haired- Berry!) and the evil GUYS characters who are like something more of cameos and bit less than bit-parts and forgetting that the ALTHOUGH EXCELLENT Patrick Stewart is serving the duties of an on-screen narrator!Except all these we also get the feeling that we are missing something, maybe some set-pieces or something like that! We got some very good inside jokes-Don't you people just DIE!- or ""Would you prefer tights and yellow suits?"" hillarius but the shows is not good. We have great fight sequences(the big-tongue/the claws/the thunders/the touch-my-head-bullet etc) but the climactic sequences is disappointing to say the least because instead of a jaw-dropping moments we get rutine stuff, lacking of nerve and no feeling of impact!At the end, what we see is a VERY GOOD 35 say 40 mins of a different BLOCKBUSTER but the rest is low-life action and plot gaps, under-developed characters, a feeling of rush and less excitment than expected... we get nearly nothing new! But it is very entairtaining... and i can't wait to see the sequel(although i now, know what to expect!)....I gave it a 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
just a good movie at best,"After watching this movie, i remembered writing a review i deleted on how biased it was do to the comic book devotion. Yes, its biased but at the same time i forgot that the story was actually good. Following the first appearance of the X-men, you get superheroes who look act and dress like the 1960s comic counterparts. The short intro of the films and its origins were spot on. Sure, magneto's helmet looks funny from the traditional Romanesque one, sure the origin of wolverine doesn't portray him as the beastly one we all love but the tame trimmed down wolvie from the pages of 1970s alpha flight. Jean grey was probably the best portrayal here. Revamped X-men characters are a must but not required although some like the mystique, works for the better. Sure saber-tooth was a good portrayal but without costume, while rogue was just a little girl with powers, or a makeshift jubilee, devoid of the past incarnations and southern roots but with a few of these changes the characters and movie would have been perfect. The mutants though, really were mutants in this film and not superheroes. Cyclops is spot on, storm is okay too yet clearly a line between mutants, and superheroes are drawn here. Maybe even throw in juggernaut? Magneto's assault on the mansion? Overall good movie with no overplay. Like how casting for a Russian black widow as scarlet johansson in the iron man film and other minute details, marvel films in general will be entertaining but never perfect to their comic book counterpart yet will come close. But then again I haven't read the ultimate marvel series line yet. The cartoon of Deadpool was revised accurately wasn't it? It seems that the DC and Marvel film industry should just stick to cartoons but nobody's perfect. To see the movie from a 90s perspective in growing up with comic reading is a must but the traditional 60s story lines work well too. The sci-fi fantasy shakespearean aspect worked well but not too well. A good cast and great scene distribution will be overlooked by fans yet characters may not be. With a little biasm, I give this along with every marvel film a ""meh"", nuff' said.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A difficult task well done.,"The X-Men have one of the richer history in comic books. When someone took the decision of made an X-Men saga they were playing with fire. Anyway this first installment in the X-Men series turned out great. We have a rooster formed by some of the founding members (in Marvel universe continuity) along with more modern characters (this ""modern"" characters have appeared in the comics for more than 25 years!).The decision of have superheroes without their individual uniforms could be controversial but the need of simplify the costumes is logical: 10 superheroes and villains fighting each other all wearing different uniforms it would turn out been a big confusion for standard movie goers. The uniforms of the cinematic version are adequate and eye-catchy. Of course there were more things changed. Magneto is not a Charles Atlas 60 years old-man because it is almost impossible to find someone that could fit that 'psych√© du rol' Ian McKellen as Magneto wipe out the doubts using all his talent as actor. Patrick Stewart IS Charles Xavier. The Brotherhood (Magneto's team) even seem to be fugitives from the panels of X-Men comics, examples? Tyler Mane as Sabretooth, Rebecca Romjin Stamos as Mystique and everyone else. It is unfair don't speak about the rest of the cast, because everyone has something interesting to offer.This heroes and villains are deeply motivated even bad guys have serious motivations that lead them to act on the edge. One of the reasons that make the mutants so charismatic is that they are not adventurers, they fight for their ideals, for what they think could change the world for the better besides the moral side they choose. The team behind the adaptation respected that aspect, a quintessential aspect that made the X-Men succeed all these years. The drama is unavoidable because we need to understand what make each X-Man stood for fight. This time the center stage of the story is focused on Wolverine and Rogue two mutants that are not sure about which side choose.Visually this is not a mix of cinema and video-clip like many others blockbusters, it has many moments of drama and suspense. In all the transcendental good films the star is the director. Bryan Singer made a superb work presenting clearly difficult scenes (an example would be how Charles Xavier uses his power against Magneto and the Brotherhood). Singer can be satisfied because he achieved the hard work of create something that stands strong in both the commercial and artistic fields.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
its dated now but its still a brilliant introduction for the series,"When x men came out in 2000 it was the first of the new batch of marvel comic book movies. The x men series of comic books is apparently the highest selling series in the world (according to creator Stan Lee) and as such a movie was inevitable. Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) has delivered a movie that pleases the fans while bringing newcomers a lot of joy.When a US senator decides that all mutants in the USA should come forward and be registered Magneto (playesd impressively by Ian Mckellen) realises that it would spell doom for mutants everywhere and so he decides that now is the time to fight back. Kidnapping the Senator, he builds a machine that can give any human mutant powers. His plan is to use the machine on the upcoming world summit meeting and inflict mutancy on every world leader so that they can no longer distance themselves from the mutant population. Meanwhile Magneto's old friend Charles Xaviar (played wonderfully by Patrick Stewart) and his loyal band of mutants the X-men learn of the plan and set out to stop him. Joining them are young girl Rogue who can kill anyone she touches and angry Wolverine who has incredible regenerative powers and sharp claws that shoot out from his knuckles.What is a mutant? Well, every few thousand years evolution comes on leaps and bounds and a select group of humans experience changes around puberty. Some of the afflictions seen in this movie are the ability to control the weather, laser beams emanating from a mans eyes and telepathy.As an introduction to what would eventually become a trilogy, this is a perfect film. It has a lot of exposition because the makers obviously realised that it would be followed by more films in the series, and as such it lacks any grandstanding action scenes. The effects are top notch, and the acting by the impressive cast (Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen) is as it should be. Indeed, Hugh Jackman takes centre stage as the sceptical Wolverine and his brand of hard edged charisma is pivotal to the films success.The action (a train station bust up, a fight on top of the Statue of Liberty) is entertaining and at the time was amazing eye candy, but since then the amazing action scenes of the last few years (city wide destruction in War of the Worlds, huge battles in the LOTR trilogy) have pushed these rather meagre conflicts back a bit. In essence, X men seems simply like a teaser for its sequel and the upcoming X men 3.In short, this is a great film that has brilliant characters and a good dose of controlled humour (Wolverine tells Cyclops to 'keep his eye open') as well as solid foundations laid out by ever reliable pairing Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen. Bryan Singer delivered a film that entertained and amused us all, but looking back its clear that this was merely a film where Marvel tested their products and waited to see if their comic book characters could work on celluloid.A great origin movie, and remember that if this film hadn't been a success we'd never have had Spiderman or any of the other Marvel films that have been produced.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men far superior to its sequels,"I just watched the first x-men film again (just felt like it) and I have to say it far outweighs the other two. The film has an enormous amount of exposition, several key characters to introduce and this is expertly executed by Bryan Singer. The characters are in no way unbelievable and from the opening scene, which depicts a young Magneto arriving at Auschwitz in 1944, the film grounds itself in reality. It is for this reason alone that I prefer the first of the trilogy.Too much in cinema now we have directors and fans alike sharing the belief that for a sequel to exceed its predecessor, it must be louder bigger and ultimately have 'more'! But so often this 'more' amounts to a detrimental effect on the realism and impact of the original. Is this the reason why so few sequels exceed their prequel? I believe so. We've seen it in films like Matrix Revolutions, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, the disastrous Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and more recently The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers.It could be argued that The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King was superior to The Two Towers, but neither one had the same impact on me as The Fellowship of The Ring. This ultimately amounts to the fact that Fellowship, like the original X-men film, were films that were made with the intention to tell a story not with the intention to thrill an audience. When a story is told well, when invigorating and believable, relatable characters are properly introduced it's very difficult to fail. It feels as if the first of these films has one singular voice that gets the message across whereas the others have several voices all shouting at the top of their lungs hoping to be heard.Essentially my hope is that one day filmmakers will realise that not everyone wants to see more explosions or have more meaningless characters paraded in front of them in order to appreciate a film.Simply tell the story well and the rest will fall into place, after all, it did in the first one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
i don't know why people think this movie is better than it really is,"I don't think x men was done very well. Especially when i think about how good it could have been.

Instead of using a good x-men plot such as days of future past, pheonix saga, etc etc, they went ahead and made up their own. A mutant ray that will turn everyone in NY into mutants? Puh lease.However though i didnt like most of it, some of it was alright. Like the scene with mystique and senator kelly in the helicopter when she's telling him about her childhood while flash kicking him in the face. IF only the rest of the movie had the kind of deep seeded tension that this scene had instead of breaking down into less than exhilirating action sequences filled with lazy cgi.

Not enough character development,"Five more minutes with each character would have made this movie a 9. Rogue and Wolverine were developed, as were Magnus and Xavier, but we never got a feel for Cyclops, Jean, Storm, or any of the bad guys.For example, the sexual tension between Jean and Wolverine wasn't fully developed, and so the conflict between Cyclops and Wolverine was superficial. Mystique, Toad and Sabertooth were basic thugs--we saw their abilities, but not their personalities. Worst, Storm was nothing more than a pretty statue. What motivated her? Why was she there?Those of us who followed the characters' exploits in the comic books may have taken our knowledge of the characters for granted. I know I did--I loved the film! My wife, however, had no idea who those people were before she sat down in the theater, so while she enjoyed the action and the special effects, the characters were little more than trained monkeys to her. I was ready to give it a 9, but she thought it was a 5.So, after seeing the amazing way Singer developed the divers characters in the Usual Suspects, I'm deeply disappointed in his treatment of the X-Men's heroes and villains. Maybe X-Men 2 will do better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Top-notch comic book adaptation,"X-MEN (2000) *** Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Tyler Mane, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ray Park, Bruce Davison. Slickly produced silver screen adaptation of the cult Marvel Comic Book series of reluctant mutant superheroes united to defend humanity from a rogue element of mutants from taking over the world.Excellent production values and crafty camerawork by Newton Thomas Sigel are equally impressive with the state of the art special effects and a game ensemble particularly Jackman in a star-making role as the lone Wolverine and Paquin as his kindred spirit, Rogue. The plot only suffers in its choppiness and constant 'explaining' who's who and what's happening; still not bad with some much welcome comic relief in the dialogue between rival good guys Wolverine and Cyclops (Marsden).

X-Citing Movie That Changed Cinema Forever,"Thanks to the trend started by Marvel Comics' first movie, the comic book-movie genre has become the dominant force in the cinema. Marvel has planned four more movies leading to ""The Avengers,"" ""Spider-Man 4"" has been announced and a new Daredevil movie is rumored to be in the works. Christopher Nolan rocked the summer with ""The Dark Knight."" All of these movies are possible because of the legitimacy ""X-Men"" brought to the genre.Patrick Stewart's opening statement explains that new mutations are causing the evolutionary process to take a giant leap. Members of the new species, derisively called ""mutants,"" possess supernatural powers that cause some ""regular"" humans to hate them. Congress, led by Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), is considering a law that would require every mutant to register with the government as do sex offenders.A mutant named Magneto (Ian McKellen) survived Hitler's holocaust and worries that the Mutant Registration Act will begin a new one. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) believes in taking every step needed to avoid violent conflict. Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Barry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who is also a physician, stand with Xavier. Magneto's followers are Sabertooth (Tyler Mane); who seems to hate Wolverine; Mystique (the lovely Rebecca Romijn) and Toad (Ray Park, who also played Darth Maul). Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and runaway teenager Rogue (Anna Paquin) are the newcomers to Xavier's School for the Gifted.Whereas movies such as ""Spider-Man"" and ""Daredevil"" contain two or fewer characters with supernatural powers, it can be easy for a script to grow excessive with the legion of characters in the ""X-Men"" universe. Writer David Hayter, best known as the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video games, demonstrates good self-discipline. He and director Brian Singer limit the mutant count to ten. Although each possesses a unique look, ""X-Men"" does not differentiate the characters on that trait alone. Only two wield similar powers, and the script includes a conversation distinguishing the two. The introduction of these powers provides much of the entertainment early. I watched the television show as a child yet was not familiar with some characters' capabilities.Some of the personalities are poorly realized, but Hayter and Singer compensate with small details such as Toad's quirky attitude and Mystique's sultry body language. Some have complained that Cyclops is boring. Judging by what I hear from the comic book enthusiasts, Marsden's character is translated on target. Cyclops' ""Mr. Morality"" personality is much like Superman's. Unlike in the two sequels which totally cheated him, Cyclops plays a pivotal role in the story. Magneto is the most effectively developed character. His horrific childhood motivates him. He does not desire power or wish to exterminate all of humanity. He takes drastic action only when he cannot see better options.With the future of comic book movies in serious trouble after ""Batman and Robin,"" 20th Century Fox allotted the production team only 75 million dollars. Some of the visual effects look shoddy and occasionally the timing is wrong such as during the incident where Wolverine is hurled backwards. That said, the fights utilize the mutants' abilities inventively and the choreography is above average. The only problem is the use of the hang-time error. The hang-time error occurs when a character flies threw the air, but does not fall closer to the ground. Thankfully, it appears only twice. The two outstanding scenes are Magneto's answer to a police siege and the Wolverine fights during the climax. The X-Men display good teamwork in their missions, especially at the end. Sadly, neither of the sequels comes close to matching it.Acting-wise, Halle Barry drew disapproval from the X-Men nation. She is not great, but not bad either. Apparently I am not familiar enough with the drawn character to know what causes the uproar. McKellen, Stewart, Jackman and Paquin perform the best. Paquin has the most demanding role. Most people seemingly do not realize how tough it is to show the depth of emotion she does in the climax without being corny. Wolverine is an angry and independent person. At times it looks like Jackman is readying himself to bite somebody. Stewart inhabits Professor X as well as he does Captain Picard and no other actor has the combination of appearance and acting specialty to better Ian McKellen's Magneto.Movies based on comic books had a bad name when ""X-Men"" was released in 2000. Batman and Superman were the two franchises to come before it. Both eventually jumped the shark and into unfunny wackiness. ""X-Men"" had to convince the public that comic book inspired films can still take their subject matter seriously. It did, and I assign the most credit to David Hayter. Although the series eventually jumped the shark itself, ""X-Men"" stabilized the comic book movie with its skillful construction and sober but not somber atmosphere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastically entertaining,"I'm too young to have ever read, or even had a glimpse at, any marvel comic, so I watched this movie having no clue about the X-men or their story. I only had other super hero movies to compare to, such as Spider-man and Fantastic Four.X-men, in my opinion, doesn't compare to the other marvel films out there. Its a film on its own, not your average comic book adaption. It has more action than you could wish for, a brilliant cast of actors, and seems to have everything and more.Other super-hero movies out there have a very 'power rangers' feel to them I feel, which make them too young and they hold back from the hardcore action we want to see, but X-men doesn't shy away from the violence, the occasional swearing, and the pure emotion and sense of actual danger and mystery that other super hero movies miss out on.There is a real sense of threat throughout, which makes it so much more enticing and entertaining.I thoroughly enjoyed it, from start to finish, each character was given their own part to play, their own meaning and given pretty much an equal amount of screen time, which I know the sequels ever so slightly lacked.For the first in the trilogy, an excellent movie that I can easily watch again and again and not tire of. Its quick, full of action and funny one liners, really good acting... there't not one fault.It's a movie to see and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A pleasant surprise!,"I did not look at the reviews before I watched this DVD.  I came to the conclusion that it was f a r better than I anticipated it to be.For a start, it was well-paced, and not crash-bang-wollop from the start, as some ""super hero"" movies tend to be.  Neither was it tedious or dialogue-bound (like Mission to Mars).  Overall, there was a quite serious feel to it, but it was well tempered by tongue-in-cheek moments and the unavoidable camp overlay.Wolverine was by far the best character - a sort of old fashioned, no-nonesense, cowboy character.  He echoed my view of Cyclops, who appeared glib and overconfident.  Talking of Cyclops, we could have done with seeing more of his special ability.  This was my favourite character in the 60s comic mags, but was more mature and aloof than the slick college-type we saw in this film.  Storm's effects were more a sort of ""storm in a teacup"", and as for Rogue...pleeeeze! (a sort of wild-card, and handy for the plot).The ""baddies"" had some interesting characters.  So Magneto was a survivor of a WW2 concentration camp?  An interesting, if not obvious analogy between Jews/undesirables, and modern day mutants.  Didn't think much of the snarling dude, but Toad was brilliant!!  I'm not sure how he could have a stereotyped London accent when brought up/hatched in North America, but what the hey.  His demeanour (and accent) made him a sort of Dickensian villain - almost loveable.  The part where he did a little jig during a piece of naughtiness, was excellent.  The way he was dispatched was pathetic.Yes - not a bad film.  Get the popcorn in, some nice cold pop/beer, sit back, mutate and enjoy...       7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel Comics Beyond the Page,"I remember lining up along fellow Marvel fans in dire anticipation of the spectacle that was ""X-Men."" Finally, a Marvel movie was brought to the big screen with intensity and storyline that would drive the Hollywood film industry for the next decade. With the exception of the ""Blade"" franchise, which represents more of a minor character's appearance on the big screen, Marvel fans had only witnessed the disastrous and preposterous films based upon: Nick Fury, Captain America, Fantastic Four, and The Punisher.In 1989, Tim Burton demonstrated to the world how comic book movies could be adapted, revolutionized, and modernized with his creation of ""Batman."" Marvel fans had to wait 11 years to experience this same sensation.From the futuristic opening credits, director Bryan Singer plunges his audience into the mutant world of the X-Men.A solid plot which explores the idea of eliminating the mutant problem, uncovering Wolverine's origin, and the comparative yet dissimilar perspectives of friends yet enemies, Magneto and Professor X.Magneto (Ian McKellen) assembles a modern-day ""Brotherhood"" consisting of a crafty and sinister Mystique,a too dumb for his own good Sabertoothed, and a surprisingly productive Toad.Professor X relies on his typical entourage: Cyclops, Rogue (Anna Paquin), Jean Grey, Storm (Hale Berry), and ideally cast newcomer Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who begins the movie living on the outskirts of society making ends meat as an unbeatable cage fighter.Hank McCoy (The Beast) is noticeably missing from the team, but is still mentioned within the human world, as he attempts to fight for mutant equality.Overall, the movie delivers. Don't expect the special effects of 2012, but this movie was certainly ahead of its time. Solid plot. Good pace. Well cast. Excellent re-watch-ability factor for comic book fans. Don't expect the same climactic thunder packed into ""Avengers"" or the complexity of the more tightly written ""X-Men: First Class""; X-Men is a good film, not a great one.Primarily, I recommend this movie basically because of its groundbreaking affect in terms of beginning the dictation of the Marvel Universe on the silver screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The comic book film that re-started this generation.,"Mutants are feared and hated, they have special abilities that humans don't. Magneto is a mutant who believes a war is brewing between mutants and mankind, so he sets out to turn everyone into a mutant. Professor Xavier and his team of X-Men believe mankind is good and can live peacefully with mutants, they must stop him.There have been many comic book films before X-Men, the most notable ones are Superman and Batman, yet there have even been lesser known comic book characters getting their big screen debut before the mutants. Tank Girl, Blade and The Crow all got their chance and they did pretty well (well, maybe not tank girl) but I think it was X-Men that kick started this wave of comic book films that we have today. 2 years later we got Spider-Man and then every other film coming out was based on a comic book. X-Men, ten years later, still remains to be one of the better adaptations.The key role in the success of this film was the casting choices. Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier is not only a stroke of genius, but the most obvious choice. Newcomer Hugh Jackman gives us a dead on portrayal of Logan aka Wolverine and since this film has become a superstar in Hollywood, even getting his own film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Ian McKellen plays the villain Magneto and even though his physical appears make him appear fragile, his use of speech and demeanor make him terrifying in a unique way, you believe that he is as dangerous as they say.Being a big fan of the comics, I was anticipating this film with a big smile on my face. I liked it then and as I mentioned earlier, it still holds up today. There are some shoddy special effects that jump out at you more now than ever, but as a whole, this comic book adaptation hits the right notes. Bryan Singer uses homosexuality as a comparing theme for mutants. Being a homosexual himself, he seemed to be able to portray the issues of separation and isolation that mutants feel. This is further explored in the sequel.I can help but feel that by the film's conclusion, they could have gone a little bigger. The conflict between Sabretooth and Wolverine is not as engaging as a fan of the comics would want and the changing of Rogue into the Jubliee character from the animated series might rub some people the wrong way. Sabretooth is not as vicious as he could be and Rogue is an annoying teenage girl.X-Men is a good film that is shy of being great. Everything that was mishandled here was made right in the sequel. X-Men proved that comic book films can be smart and not just for fans/geeks who collect comics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""A New Hope"" for Comic Book Movies","When this movie came out, comic book movies were down on their @$$es. The last big comic book movie until then was ""Batman and Robin"", so basically: the genre was dead and killed. It was no other movie than X-Men that re-ignited the genre and proved that a comic fantasy world does not have to be corny, goofy and cheesy at all.Bryan Singer created a suspenseful story, in which the characters had to deal with being different - and the conflict that rises from bigotry.""In the not too distant future"", Prof. Charles Xavier has a school for so-called mutants: people who are different. Generally, these mutants possess abilities that normal people do not have - which causes fear and hate in the hearts of the American people. Hence, Senator Robert Kelly proposes a law that calls for mutants to register themselves. Xaviers frenemy, Erik ""Magneto"" Lensherr, is appalled by this law and plots to spread mutancy among world leaders at a UN summit. Xavier's X-Men Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey struggle to stop Magneto. In the middle of these conflicts runaway mutants Rogue and Wolverine take refuge at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters...It's a brilliant movie, with tons of easter eggs and nods to the fans. While not lacking action or fantastic elements, the movie plays the brain card. It is clever, slightly dark. Remember how recently, the second installment of Captain America (The Winter Soldier) was described as a political thriller? Well, X-Men did it first.But what really excels X-Men is how it captures the emotional impact of being different. How the daily struggle of minorities is portrayed through the metaphor of Mutancy. It is what sets X-Men apart from other super hero / comic book movies; it is their Trump Card. Therefor, it's a shame that this element is being shoved more and more to the background as the X-Movie franchise expands. I hope in the future, they will look back at this first one from time to time, if only to remember what the ""X-Gene"" of this series is.All in all, X-Men brought back comic book movies. It did for the genre what Star Wars (A New Hope) did for Space Movies. So, maybe there are comic book movies you enjoy more than this... they would not be here if it wasn't for the X-Men and their first movie. I have never granted a 10/10 to a movie before, but this one deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, but left me feeling not quite right","I was an early reader of the X-Men, and stopped pretty early on.  I've been surprised by all of the hype about them in the past several years.  I also don't understand the trend of turning the characters (in this and other comics) into muscle-bound creatures full of angst.In any case, I decided to see the movie because I figured that if nothing else, it'd be a fun action movie.  In that respect, I wasn't disappointed. I also like the interplay between the characters.However, one things left me feeling not quite right about it.  If I recall correctly, Cyclops and Jean Gray were two of the original X-Men, appearing in issue 1.  Another original was Iceman.  He and Cyclops should be basically the same age, and if they are young, the school should be empty except for them and a couple of others.  Yet we've got a child Iceman, a young-ish Cyclops, and a very well-established school.  Call me nitpicky, but I *hate* it when movies muck around with established timelines.  That definitely detracted from my experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unforgettable- NOT!,"First of all, I like COmic books, I've been a fan of the X-men. Not a very big fan, but I've always found the story extremely fascinating. Heck, I found the 30 minute animated episodes better than this film. I understand that its a challenge turning the X-men into a live feature film, with real characters, and I shouldn't compare the animated series with the movie too much. With that being said, here's why I think this movie is awful? 1. The saying goes, its better to be the only country with a nuclear bomb in the world, then to have a thousand nuclear bombs,in a world where everybody else has one. what do I mean? Too many mutants with super powers isn't as impressive as having a few super-powered mutants. That was a very big let down, they shouldn't have used the whole mutant school angle, I don't really care about a bunch of kids, who don't contribute anything to the story, who have powers. 2. The fight sequences. Mystique being a kung-fu master. That just doesn't seem right. Its not about mystique, the collision between the bad guys and good guys seems very bad, I wasn't impressed at all by the battles, they needed better fighting scenes. 3. Like some other reviewer has suggested by saying that a movie focusing on just wolverine could have been more successful. I agree, that the story of a FEW key mutant characters could have been the better way to go. Character development, the story could have gone deeper. 4. Love triangles. Haven't they been overdone by now. They really annoy me, for heavens sake, choose someone and get it over with. The route taken in Cinderella man is better. A love affair between a husband and wife for a change. 5. I didn't want to mention the plot, but I've seen the first two movies, the plot is DREADFUL.In conclusion...Very disappointing, I expected more, I know its a challenge, but hasn't Hollywood had enough experience experimenting with comic book heroes. This is unacceptable quality.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not great","There's little I can really say about ""X-Men"". Everything is done well enough, and yet nothing stands out. Patrick Stewart is perfect as Professor X, opposed by Ian ""Gandalf"" McKellen. Everyone else is adequate but there's no outstanding performances.What of the script? Again *shrug*. Essentially terrorists trying to sabotage a political conference - not exactly innovative thinking. There's little in the way of surprises.How does it look? Director Bryan Singer decides not to make this movie into a tongue-in-cheek affair, which is perhaps wise considering how the Batman series fared from that approach. The movie is fairly dark, a fact struck home by the bleak visuals in the opening. There's an almost sombre feel to the picture, with the humorous moments delivered dryly.  And yet Singer never got me caught up in the movie - the visuals, the sound, the characters - nothing dragged me and made me think ""X-Men"" was really good. As these action block-busters go it was certainly better made than most, and looked nice, et cetera. And yet it was missing that .. X.. factor that makes a movie great. Perhaps the sequel will do better but I can only give it a 6/10. Somewhat disappointing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Good X-Men Introduction,This movie was Really good.

But also Patrick stewart as Charles Xavier was also a really amazing Casting.Somthing many people does not like is that Wolverine kinda takes the spotlight and pushes the real X-men team leader Cyclops away.The visuals are meh.

Comic Book Characters Come to Life,"Bruce Wayne Vocal Diary:""Having just seen the X-Men movie, I feel as if I have a deeper understanding of these controversial public figures and their dangerous terrorist antagonists. Couldn't get Professor X's opinion on the movie fictionalized from their battle with peace, bigotry and equal rights, but needless to say, some of the actors used aren't very flattering to the actual members as I know them. Per se, Halle Berry- she's a very beautiful actress but the real Storm is a little exotic looking, kind of like Vanessa Williams. I suppose it's the African blood. The only actress I know who comes close to the beautiful Jean Grey is Nicole Kidman, and Rogue is flattered by Anne Paquin's portrayal, but the Rogue I know looks more like a cross between Brooke Shields and Carmen Electra. Toad and Mystique are a lot more sinister looking in the movie than their truer counterparts, but the Mystique I know isn't quite that sexy. Otherwise, the similarities are rather precise. There I go rambling,,,but then I'm still irked at those Val Kilmer and George Clooney movies.  Continuing,,,, the movie is a very dark and sometimes light-hearted adventure somewhat patterned after the style of the recent Batman films of recent so I'm sure they'll be some sort of sequel. This Bryan Singer seems to display the same artful repertoire of Joel Schumacher and Tim Burton. The violence is played down for a more action feel,,,,,I wonder how the video store clerks are going to label this movie,,,action? fantasy? The masses who go to these movies have predominantly declared views that are mixed on the exemplary special effects and the less than satisfactory script. The true stars of the movie are the costumes and less so the actors in them; the television's ""Flash"" and ""Lois and Clark"" being good examples of when the costumes carry the entertainment. Still,the movie is a big departure from when all heroes wore spandex. That Adam West television show still gives me nightmares to this day; yet,the Hulk still speaks fondly of Lou Ferrigno. The movie fortunately has a very realistic feel unlike the campy atmosphere seen in the Generation X television pilot and the Spiderman television series.

A Very Good Movie,"I used to collect X-Men comics when I was younger, so as a former ""hard core"" fan I was a bit skeptical as to how good a live action movie on the subject would be. I am happy to say that the X-Men movie is wonderful entertainment. I liked Bryan Singer's take on the story, a moody, introspective tale that's closer in spirit to ""Unforgiven"" or ""The Wild Bunch"" than ""Batman."" Watching Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen inhabit their roles and play off each other was a treat, although should we expect anything less from these two actors? Especially impressive is Hugh Jackman's dead-on interpretation of Wolverine - this man is a very talented and charismatic actor who will hopefully go far in the business.The reason I did not rate this movie higher is because of the not quite air tight construction of the overall work. Also, many of the characters (Storm, Mystique, and Toad in particular) have only a few lines, and we never really get to know them beyond the action sequences. This is not to take anything away from what the film has accomplished, however. This is easily one of the best super hero films ever made. Is there a cinematic franchise in the making?

Decent superhero offering,"X-Men is a pretty decent superhero action flick. It benefits from some good performances from stalwarts Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart ‚Äì who both lend the necessary gravitas to their respective roles ‚Äì while Hugh Jackman is charismatic as the central character Wolverine. The story itself is not all that good though. The origins of the X-Men aren't really detailed and maybe could have been, while Magneto's villainous plan at the centre of the story is quite mediocre at best. Like a great many action films X-Men gets bogged down in its final third; the big showdown being not terribly interesting. However, I admire the fact that the film was short. Many similar productions are overlong without any real excuse. A movie like X-Men benefits from this fast approach, and didn't as a result, wear this viewer's patience thin. Overall it was an enjoyable enough ride with decent acting and some welcome humour.

Absolutely Awesome!,"All through the 90s, there was hype for an X-Men movie to be made, but every time one was supposed to be released, it didn't come to fruition. So, when I heard about one that was to be released in 2000, I was thrilled. That thrill had somewhat abated when I read an article in ""Entertainment Magazine,"" that went into details about the movie and Brian Singer's vision for it. It was so different from the comics, and I was worried that it would end up sucking, like so many comic book movies made to that point had (with precious few exceptions). So, when I saw it in theatres, I was blown away with how amazing it was, even with the artistic liberties taken. My only real issue was with how they wrote Rogue. They made her pretty weak emotionally-speaking in this franchise. She is so much cooler in the comics, and because of that, she was always one of my favorite characters.

A great action film,This is a great action movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. 7.4 is a good ratting. But this is such a good movie 7.4 is underrating it. X men united is better. X men last stand is better. X men origins wolverine is also better. X men first class is also better. Wolverine is also better. X men day of further past is also better. X men apocalypse is also better. This is one of the best action movie from 2000. See it. It is a great movie. It is better then The dark knight ans that is not easy to do. This movie is a must see. I give it 9. 7.4 is underrating it. This a great movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"For a summer blockbuster, X-men is a nice little movie","If I could describe 'X-men' in one word I would call it 'surprising'. Having gotten used to the overblown and bloated 'Batman' films, I was expecting another bombastic, pointless, neon filled, superhero movie replete with dumb illogical villains and heroes who are seemingly an afterthought in the plot.Well what do you know?For an expected 'summer blockbuster', X-men is a nice little movie. Fans of the X-men comic are treated to a remarkably faithful adaptation of the characters they know and love. The casual movie goer is treated to a summer movie that has an easy to understand and not needlessly convoluted plot, good but not over the top action, and no mindless smirking quipster villains to groan at.The villain, Magneto, is very essential to the plot, but is not made the core of the film as the Joker was (successfully) in the original Batman movie and the likes of Catwoman, Riddler, and Mr. Freeze were in the subsequent (not so successful) sequels. Even better, the supporting villains are just that; supporting. It is obvious that Magneto is the main man and he does not compete for screen time with his henchmen. It is also an extra bonus, that Magneto is played as an intelligent villain with purpose and not just some loony guy in a colorful suit.   The film is filled with special effects, but does not depend on them to carry the proceedings. The special effects are necessary to the plot and are never overused (they may even be underused, but read on).The only complaint would be that the story really centers on two main characters (Wolverine and Rogue) and to a great degree the other characters (though perfectly cast) are defined but not truly developed. Also at an extremely manageable hour and a half running time, you leave the theater thinking the film could have benefited from another 10 to 15 minutes to come to a satisfactory conclusion (the ultimate final battle is a bit anti-climatic.) Somehow Xmen seems to conclude with a whimper and not a bang.Still I'd rather leave a film being pleased but wanting more than feeling like I just threw my money down the drain. I hope all the stars are signed to a multiple movie deal, because I look forward to a sequel.Kudos to Fox for putting a superhero movie together that does not play for laughs or cornball antics but instead attempts to find a way to take the essence of their subject (which makes them successful in their own genre) and communicate it on the big screen for the mainstream audience. I can only hope that this message resonates with the non-comic book based audience and X-men brings the super hero genre back from it's current doldrums. Who knows? If X-men is a hit, we just might get a Batman film with a decent plot that is ABOUT Batman someday soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The first step in superhero movie evolution...,"X-Men is a very good, stylish, exciting comic-book movie. Which is a positive thing, considering the last ""big"" superhero flick released before this one was, uh, Batman & Robin. This first movie featuring Stan Lee's ""Children of the Atom"" is not based on a particular story (with the exception of the characters' origins), as director Bryan Singer uses a plot almost entirely made from scratch to introduce us to a new world: the mutant one.The setting is the United States, in a soon-to-come future: mutants, people born with a genetic alteration (the so called ""X-gene"") which gives them superhuman abilities, are becoming more and more common. Unfortunately, the rest of humanity fears them and some even try to destroy them. This brings us to the current situation: Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his students, the X-Men, which include Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), think peace is possible; his old friend Magneto (Ian McKellen), on the other hand, is firmly convinced war is inevitable, since he already has witnessed genocide (he's Jewish and his parents were killed in Auschwitz). As such, he and his allies, the Brotherhood of Mutants, will not allow US Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) to pass the Mutant Registration Act, and the only thing that can stop them is Xavier's students, plus two new mutants, the claw-wearing, virtually invincible Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the power-stealing Rogue (Anna Paquin).The X-Men comic books have always been an interesting sci-fi oriented reflection on such concepts as racism and alienation, a theme that emerges quite vividly throughout Singer's filmography (his previous movie, Apt Pupil, dealt with a lonely kid who forms a morbid bond with a former Nazi). In particular, Xavier and Magneto are seen as the mutant versions of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X - two people who respect each other, but choose to respectfully disagree on how to deal with specific problems. The movie takes this one step further by highlighting the philosophical and moral contradiction of Magneto, an Auschwitz survivor, trying to prevent a new extermination by causing another one himself (the role is made even more ironic by the fact that McKellen played the Nazi in Apt Pupil).Alongside the thematic relevance, Singer also has to deliver in terms of action, and deliver he does, thanks to a spectacular third act which features the kind of iconic moments fans will love instantly. That being said, the film does have a defect, and that's the plot being structured as if it were the pilot episode of a TV show (in fairness, though, several first installments are written that way, but less directly) or, as Patrick Stewart put it, an extended trailer, in which all the main characters (except for a couple of villains) are thoroughly introduced so that the audience will understand who they are and what they do. Then again, such a move is justified by the solid cast the director has assembled: Stewart and McKellen were a quality guarantee from the get-go, and everyone else complies as well, particularly Jackman and Paquin, the outsiders who act as our guides in this new, exciting cinematic universe.So, entirely satisfying it may not be, but the first X-Men is the film that effectively started the new wave of intelligent, above-average comic book movies. And that can only be considered a good thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
There is something coming,"Like ""First Class"", there is a little prologue where one of the main characters is just a kid, only here, there aren't as many elements at work, and they form a clear picture rather than raise questions and confusion. And once that prologue is done, the film does not jump to a later date in our real history, it jumps to a time that hasn't yet come. No exact date this time but ""the not too distant future"" is something to think about. On the one hand, this hasn't happened yet. On the other, there isn't much time left. The movie looks and sounds good. As for the contents, things like evolution and mutation belong in science fiction, but here they border on magic. What's good is there are clear teams of heroes and villains with histories and motivations behind them. And though a sense of humor is present, the story told here is no laughing matter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Less than stellar , but still nice","""X-men"" offers the viewer good special effects , nice action and decent story . The movie suffers from the fact that this is kinda origin story, yet there is too little time to explore the X-men universe . In comic books there is endless time to explore characters and introduce them to reader . Here we get to know only about the few of them ‚Äì Xavier , Magneto , Wolverine and Rogue. Others like Cyclops or Jean Grey are barely introduced . Some are just instrumental characters like Sabertooth or Storm . The characters aren't too complex , because time doesn't allows for that . Yet , thanks to the actors their likable and memorable. With the exception of Halle Berry as Storm (she seems too young and not too charismatic ) the casting is top notch . Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen seem to be born to play Wolverine , Xavier and Magneto.There is nice love triangle here and good friendship/rivalry relationship between Wolverine/Cyclops/Jean Grey . Some things were changed here compared to the comic books. Still , the changes were good and logical (such as with the costumes).The special effects are unfortunately quite outdated by today standards. The whole movie feels like a TV episode - pilot for a TV series instead of epic science fiction action movie. The action is nice , but nothing really spectacular. It feels like Bryan Singer (famous for ""Usual suspects"") doesn't feels confident with them. The story is rather thin and the whole movie really feels more like an introduction to the world of Xmen than anything else. Thankfully , in the sequel the action , story and special effects were improved.It's one of the first of new wave of comic book movies. It's not one of the best , but not one of the worst either. I give it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Became unsatisfying towards the end,"It was disappointing that I didn't like the movie in the end because I thought the plot was decent up until around the 1 hour mark, but the last 30 or so minutes of the movie were not as thrilling as I expected. I felt like the members of the x-men should've had a bigger role in the movie as they barely spoke, especially Halle Berry's character. This made me not really like the x-men and I wasn't really rooting for them as I felt I had no real connection with them. On a positive note I thought the action scenes were decent for their time and I thought Hugh Jackman portrayed his character well.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Dull, Proselytyzing Drivel","Fantasy and science fiction films (and literature) are a personal favourite, but this film isn't.My dissatisfaction derives from three sources.First, the film is very dull. There is a great deal of philosophising; indeed, a great deal of talk of all kinds. Then when the action finally arrives, it is distressingly predictable. One can hear the minds of the writers ticking over (their minds obviously never ran faster than idle ¬ñ pun intended). 'Well, let's see¬Ö this mutant has this set of powers¬Ö so let's invent a situation that allows him to save the day. OK, that's him done¬Ö now let's invent a different situation for the next mutant to solve¬Ö and the next¬Ö and the next¬Öand the next¬Ö' (Oh no, even writing these words makes the film live - or rather die - again in my mind.)The second problem is the central premise. The mutants are going to replace us? And I am supposed to be happy about this, to cheer for them? Forget it.Finally, there is the problem of the constant promotion of liberal doctrine. Thou shalt be tolerant, thou shalt not be racist, thou shalt worship diversity ¬ñ and on, and on, and on, and on¬Ö (Hey, with that kind of repetition I could be a scriptwriter ¬ñ well, for the X-Men films, anyway.) Yes, we get it ¬ñ the mutants and their situation are a metaphor for 'racism' in our society, and they represent what we are told will be the future - the (supposedly) desirable mixing of races into an eventual universal racial homogeneity.This repetitive political message has no place in a popular entertainment movie, and can only detract from the enjoyment of the audience. Alright, there isn't much entertainment in this film anyway, but this propaganda just makes it worse. It's not the message that's the problem specifically ¬ñ it's the endless, dull repetition and the fundamental objection to indoctrination in entertainment. I would have the same objection regardless of the nature of the message being promoted.Watching such films only makes me more aware of the increasing similarities between 'Western' societies and those of such countries as Saudi Arabian, China or North Korea. Very different countries, very different beliefs ¬ñ yet they all have a lack of individual freedom in common, and a media that knows its place; a media that only creates productions that promote the politically correct doctrine of the homeland. You doubt the similarities? Well, when was the last time you saw a production from Western media that promoted the idea that homosexuality is undesirable, that immigration is bad, that racial interbreeding should be avoided, that women should have more children instead of pursuing a career - or even that women are not as strong or physically able as men? It's not that I agree with these ideas ¬ñ or disagree with them. My views are irrelevant. The point is that many people, both inside and outside the 'Western' world, do hold some or all of these views. Indeed, at least one of these views (women are not as strong or physically able as men) is held almost universally. Yet how often is the exact opposite view portrayed in the western media, with women out-muscling (and outfighting) men? My concern is that ideas that do not conform to politically correct doctrine are not allowed to be portrayed. This is not freedom ¬ñ it is totalitarianism. We are on a dangerous path, and X-Men is one of the signposts pointing the way.OK, rant over. You get the point ¬ñ I really don't like this film. With more imagination, less proselytizing, and a storyline that didn't contain the central premise that we should cheer for our own destruction, X-Men could have been so much more.An opportunity lost.Rating ¬ñ 2.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""What would you prefer, Yellow Spandex?""","Every once in a while Hollywood gets the Superhero genre right. They did in the first two Supes films, Batman #3, and now here in the X-Men. I liked most of the performances, thought the costuming and characters were played straight and remained true to their source material, and felt that director Singer respected the genre most of all. He had some $$ to work with and didn't waste a penny.I enjoyed Wolverine most of all, as seems to be the consensus, but will also say that I Liked Halle Berry as Storm. She didn't have many lines sure(and in fact had a real tongue tier in one scene--oh sorry)but you hadda like how they showed Ororo in all her lightning bolt hurling glory.Rogue and Cyclops were good too. So were the villains. As I stopped reading the Xmen in the early 80s, I can't say that I remembered Mystique or Sabretooth that much, but the rest I sure did. The XMen are a part of our culture, its nice to see that Bryan Singer has done them justice.McKellan and Stewart were quite good too, by the way, I agree that Stewart's scenes seemed to be a little truncated, but what he does have, works.Hopefully the next one will be longer and include likely villains ala the Sentinels or into more of the classic characters-but I agree with some here, you don't wanna jam in TOO many people, it's hard enough to get the ones already included straight or introed properly to the novice fans out there as it is.So...I give this one *** outta ****, its good and they should be congratulated for turning in a solid effort which could easily have been Really awful.Want proof?

True to its comic book origins,"I've not seen a comic hero from my childhood brought to the screen with this kind of devotion to the original since Superman (1978).Making the X-Men real was equally difficult, more so in many ways. It's darker, edgier, and certainly more political. They had to handle the balance between reality and potential without getting lost on either side. All this, while injecting the sense of human issues that were at the heart of many X-Men sagas. The series was never black and white; it was all about shades of gray.The film creates a believable present day (or near future) controversy on which to hang an 'us versus them' battle. It introduces the characters in a way that people who don't know the stories can get swept into things while leaving those with some background information confused about what, where and why (it's a comic book, within three minutes everyone knows the who and has some idea of the how).It was very well cast with the exception of Halle Berry. As Storm she is just not sufficiently emotional. Unfortunately, she's also left to handle a big ""let's make a point"" scene of the issue... err movie. We're left not really feeling her pain about being an outcast mutant which makes it impossible to feel much one way or another from Senator Kelly's apology. I also had a feeling in a couple places that Patrick Stewart might have suggested some changes, making the dialog a bit forced at times.Many people have commented in a negative fashion about the ending. All I can say is, they don't know or appreciate comic books. It's a comic book picture and has a true comic book ending.Comic books have served as Philosophy 101 for our nations youth for many, many years and this film does justice to this series and its values. Comic series based on Superhero's were nearly always about the conflict of 'good versus evil', and while the battle was nearly always won, the war was far from over. That meant that most (or all) of the high echelon bad guys were dealt with, but the progeny of evil often skipped away (most often hurt in some way) to surface again in a later issue (or against some other hero). Occasionally, the hero suffered a serious setback, just to keep the whole game appearing honest. The ending wrapped up this battle in a rather tidy way, leaving the war far from decided.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fast Paced, High-Tech Action-Thriller: X-Men!","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!""X-Men"" is one of those films where you wonder how anyone couldn't like it. It is really one of my favourites. The director, Bryan Singer is perfect for the job. He creates a darker version of the comics perfectly. Even though it's pretty dark, there are lots of great humorous moments. My favourite line of the film is:Wolverine: You actually go out in these things? Cyclops: Well, what would you prefer? Yellow spandex?Anyone who is a fan of the comics would get the joke.The visual effects are awesome. They're even more awesome when you think about the budget of this film. $75 million, which is certainly a lot, but in Hollywood, not so much. That's also half the budget of ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".Veteran actors Patrick Stewart (of ""Star Trek TNG"" fame) and Ian McKellen (of ""Lord of the Rings"" fame) each deliver great roles, while (at that time) newcomers Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, and James Marsden each bring tons of charisma.

A pretty good action film,"X-Men (2000) is of course the first film in the X-Men franchise. Of course, Hugh Jackman was amazing in this film, as he is in everything else. Hugh just really fits the role of Wolverine, it's almost the role he was born to play, he was rugged, sexy, tough and very likable. Also Anna Paquin was perfect for her role, and her and Hugh have awesome chemistry together. The script was pretty well written too. Also the action sequences were entertaining and fun to watch and enjoy. What I do like about this movie is that it's pretty intelligently written and filmed, it's not just one of those mindless run of the mill action romps.

A great movie!,"In the future, a race of humanoids called Mutants born with unique powers or looks when reached adulthood but the human race misunderstands them and mistreats them badly. So a good and powerful mutant named Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who has telepathic/telekinetic abilities has formed a school for the gifted or mutants to control their powers and help mankind however there are some terrorist mutants who are hellbent on destroying the human race such as Magneto (Ian Mckellen) who thinks mankind would never accept mutants as he leads some mutants to kill off humans. A runaway mutant girl with the power to temporarily absorb people's energies and mutants's powers named Rogue (Anna Paquin) meets up with a Canadian mutant named Logan a.k.a.

Pretty good comic book film.,"X-Men is based off the famous Marvel comic about the conflict between average human beings and mutants. Charles Xavier is a mutant who runs a school where mutants can go to learn and be safe. However, underneath the cover of the school, he has a strike force he calls the X-Men, sworn to protect humanity from any threat. The X-Men consist of Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey. On the other side of the spectrum is Magneto, an evil mutant who believes in mutant superiority and leads his own team, the Brotherhood, consisting of Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth. When Magneto attacks two mutants named Wolverine and Rogue, Xavier must find out what his old friend wants with them. X-Men is a good movie for anyone who is a fan of the comics or the 90's cartoon series, but people who just want to sit down and enjoy a movie might not like it.The acting is really good. All of the actors involved bring their characters to life with good results. Hugh Jackman made a surprisingly good Wolverine even though he was a complete unknown at the time. Halle Berry is a great actress and she made a really good Storm, even though her screen time was a little under what it could have been. By far the best acting job in the movie is Ian McKellan who tackles the role of the evil Magneto. His voice is ice cold and it makes Magneto seem even more threatening that he already is.The action scenes are great, especially the climactic battle at the end. Bryan Singer breathes a new life into the X-Men and makes their cinematic adventures look as if they're taking place in the real world rather than the comic book world. The only problem with this first movie is that it's basically a two hour introduction to all the characters. If you think about it, not a whole lot happens in this film. The plot isn't that deep, but instead it focuses on establishing the characters and where they stand. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad thing, the movie is still good, but like I said, it's more appreciated among fans of the source material.So, X-Men is a good comic book/action film albeit a little underdeveloped, and should be viewed by all X-Men fans.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Utter Crapola,What a waste of a great comic book series.  There hasn't been a great film made about a comic book superhero since Chris Reeve's Superman films. These guys needed a better script and a better director.  Bryan Singer doesn't know how to direct big budget action special effects pictures.  The casting isn't the best and the plot is dull as can be.  The dude who plays Wolverine has some good one liners but that's about it.

Mutants are not the ones mankind should fear.,"X-Men is directed by Bryan Singer and based on Marvel Comics characters. The screenplay is by David Hayler and based around Uncanny X-Men written by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby. It stars Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Jansen, James Marsden & Anna Paquin.It's a future world where mutants with special powers co-exist with humans. Congress wants to ""out"" all mutants, Magneto wants to form an army of mutants to take over the world, but Professor Xavier wants mutants to only use their powers to do good. Something's got to give! Long in gestation (1989 was when it was first mooted), X-Men finally made it to the big screen in 2000 with much anticipation and apprehension. Cast and director changes occurred, as did rewrites & re-shoots, while the film was considerably lean with a running time of just over an hour and half. Throw into the equation that early in proceedings Bryan Singer had declared he wasn't really a fan of the source material, and the apprehension of Marvel fans was understandable. Nice, then, that the final product has actually ended up rather good.Singer had been turned around by the comics due to its thematics of prejudice and assimilation (the comic was born out of the civil rights movement), in fact it was this that also got McKellen on board with the project. Substitute Magneto & Xavier with Martin Luther King & Malcolm X and you get the picture. The whole theme of the outsiders trying to get onto a level playing field of acceptance is what gives X-Men its serious heartbeat. Sure it's fun, and you got to have some silliness in a superhero picture, but thankfully Singer has managed to marry up all the threads to keep it accessible to film watchers of all ages.Where X-Men falls down is with its needy reliance on being the first film of a franchise. Come the mid-point of the film, one can't help thinking about the sequel that was always going to come. Problem number two comes with too many characters purely existing within a short running time. The film is dependent on Stewart and McKellen's battle of wills and Jackman's Wolverine carrying the weight of the movie. That all three men are great softens the blow of knowing next to nothing about the other X-Men and their foes. Credit to Singer and his team, tho, for cloaking a very simple story with an impressive production. The sets, effects and set-pieces are treats for the eyes, even if the finale is not as jaw dropping as one reasonably expects of a well budgeted super hero picture.But maybe the point is that the finale is merely a bridge to a second film?

The First One is Fine and the Series Only Got Better,"The X-Men Franchise Got Better and Better, but this, the First in the Series is a Fine Beginning. There is very Little Origin to the Story.This was probably done because many in the Audience Not Familiar with the Long and Deep History of the X-Men Comics wouldn't have the Patience for the Complex Back Story and Wildly Amazing Lineage for all of those Characters and Subplots.So, We Jump Right into the Action and there Is enough Dialog and Exposition for it all to Work well. The Casting is Good too. Patrick Stewart's Professor-X, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, and Ian McKellen's Magneto are the Standouts, but the rest Fit Nicely into Their Characters and Costumes (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, fits quite nicely).The CGI looks Flat at times as does the overall Template of the Movie which is Strange for a Comic-Book Film. But there are some Outstanding Set Pieces, like Magneto's Standoff with the Police, and the Train Sequence. The Ending Statue of Liberty Battle comes off rather Lackluster.The Mutant vs Human Confrontation can obviously be Analogous to Real Life Prejudices, as Magneto Says ""Humans always fear what they don't understand."" On a Comic Book Level this is Fine and is the Story that the Franchise will Exploit for the most of the Series and why not?That's exactly what the Comics are About. The Struggle has been going on in the Pages of the Stan Lee and Jack Kirby Creation since 1963 in its many and Varied Mutations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Awesome MARVEL comic book superhero film ever!,"X-Men (2000) is MARVEL comic book superhero Action Science Fiction Flick. It is the first and Original film in the ""X-Men"" movies and an awesome film I ever saw. It is my favorite film of the franchise series!!! X-Men was the first movie I saw it back than in 2001 in the summer on the tape, I rent it a VHS video in the video store. That time I did not like the movie because I did not got it and I did read a lot of critics about this movie, that it was bad etc... That suits weren't like were in the comic books. So for Spider-Man they tried to make his suits more by comic books. My favorite and best one is X-Men (2000) the original film. It is a good conclusion to end of the first movie. I love the fight scenes in Liberty Island,that took place in Statue of Liberty in New York.2.mutants in Canada Wolverine and Rouge are traveling together but Magneto order to attack them, he need it one of them, to used her/him to lunch an attack on the humans. Because he believes the war is coming. Yes Wolverine and Sabretooth does fight each other in this movie, but in X-Men Origins: Wolverine they were both brothers and they don't know who they are, In this one is a hug error put hole I. I like Toad when he spit a powerful toxic goo in Jean Phoenix's face. X-Men is a great superhero comic book movie but it isn't an origin story of how they met each other. The origin story would be X-Men: First Class here is more in the middle class. My favorite movie of the trilogy is X-Men (2000) I considering as best one and I enjoyed this movie a lot. I love it and I love all three of them.Actor Ian Mckellen is great, he played Magneto once again in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). X-men is a very good comic book to film story. It has a lot of solid 'superhero-esque' mutants that band together under the hospices of Mr Xavier (Stewart) and with lead protagonist (Jackman) in Wolverine...a lot of ass kicking and taking names going on here. I actually like this series pretty well. Mutants vs Humans vs Bad Mutants...a lot of treachery and twists here and overall, a solid picture for young and old alike.I think this is a good superhero movie, with a lot of fights, and twist, I just love this film to death! Bryan Singer did an excellent job Directing the most awesome Action superhero film! I love this film much better than X-Men: Days of Future past! I love this film, I love Wolverine, Magneto, Phoenix, Rogue, Storm, Cylops and Mystique. The actors portraying the mutants and battle were great. CGI and special effects were also great, they weren't annoying, they were great.""Mutation. It is the key to our evolution.""The basic plot about this film is In the near future, ""mutants"" are the next link in the chain of evolution. Each are born with a genetic mutation that manifests into extraordinary powers. Under the tutelage of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the world's most powerful telepath, these ""gifted"" students have learned to control and direct their respective powers for the greater good of mankind. But when the Professor's former colleague and friend, Erik Lehnsherr a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellen) wages war against them and society, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called ""X-Men"" to protect the world that fears them.I love this film and it is one of my favorite comic book superhero films!

"A very good film; it surprised me very much when I saw it in the theater, even if it is inferior to the 2003 sequel...","I'm not a huge comic book fan, so I went to see ""X-Men"" in 2000 with hesitation. I was blown away. Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"") introduces non-fans to the world of the X-Men extraordinarily, while still implementing references to the series for the die hard fans.What separates this from a lot of other comic book films is that the mix of fantasy and reality makes the film more than what it could have been -- a corny remake of a comic book/television show. Singer's choice to make the X-Men part of this world, and his decision to have a backdrop of anti-mutation rallies, is really what makes this film great. And Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is pitch-perfect! Never would have guessed he was an Aussie! And he seems like a genuinely nice guy in person, too!Inferior to the 2003 sequel, ""X2,"" but a must-see for an introduction to a world within our world. Re-launched the comic book films we've been seeing lately (""Spider-Man,"" ""Daredevil"") and is the rare series that is almost guaranteed to have better sequels as it comes along.

"Even if you don't know who the X-Men are, You will enjoy this one!","You don't even have to be a hard-core X-Men fan to enjoy this action packed, eye-popping sci-fi picture.  A cast of virtually unknowns, with the exception of Patrick Stewart, add to the overall luster to the whole film. Patrick Stewart (Prof. Xavier), is excellent in the role that he admittingly never heard of. Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), a former Bond beauty, is perfect in her role as a woman with telekinetic abilities.  Relatively new to the seen, Hugh Jackman explodes onto the screen as Wolverine, definitely the best of all X-Men. Ian McKellen is great as the misunderstood Magneto. Sure this movie is full of eye-candy, but there is a very well written story there.  The X-Men are a group of mutants that together try to put an end to the war between humans and mutants.

Good?  Yes.  Uncanny?  Not so much...,"I have never been more excited to see a movie than when I first heard that they were going to release a film based on my favorite comic book characters, the X-Men. I remember I watched the trailer online twice a day for the last two weeks before its nationwide release. I was there opening night with my friends and was blown away. They brought these fantastic characters to the big screen, and they did it well. And it was this movie that opened the floodgates for more comic book movies to come forth.One thing I had to overcome when watching the movie was that it's not the X-Men as I know them, per se. They're a Bryan Singer-ized version. Keep in mind, that's not entirely a bad thing. Singer and the writers kept a majority of the comic intact when translating it to film, but there are differences. If you can look past some inconsistencies, as with any book-to-movie conversion, then the movie is definitely good fun. The visual effects were spectacular, from Wolverine's claws to Cyclops's optic blasts, and the fight scenes were great. The cast is near perfect and some seem born for the roles (i.e. Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier or Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto).I don't really have too much that bothered me about the movie (aside from the minor changes mentioned above). I thought the majority of the movie was too dark (I'm referring to light, not subject matter). There were a lot of scenes at night or in dimly-lit rooms/caves and I felt like it gave the movie a very heavy, serious feel. While I believe the movie should be serious, I also think that it should have some more exuberant lighting to keep with that extraordinary, comic-feel (Note, I said ""extraordinary"", not ""over-the-top"" or ""campy""). The X-Men may tackle some serious subject matter at times, but they still had their lighter moments.My only other problem was that it felt the movie tended to drag on, despite it's short running time (barely 100 minutes). It seemed at times as if the story was slowing down to a crawl. Another action sequence may have given it the kick it needs to keep its pace, but the movie never fully stalls. It stills keeps you engaged until the finale.Overall, Bryan Singer did a good job. This is an awesome way to kick off the X-Men franchise and open the doors for future comic book-based films. I was completely satisfied when I walked out of the theater in 2000 and I'm still satisfied when I watch it today. Now that Singer has a feel for the characters and actors, things will only get better as the X-Men continue into the future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The day of the mutants is upon us,"First of all I'd like to note that I'm a huge fan of the X-Men so I went into the movie with a perspective unlike most.  I was looking for every bit of anything that could be wrong with this film.  Despite this, I loved this movie.  I'm sure not too many people can boast of seeing it twice on opening night.  That's how excellent I thought this movie was.  All of the characters were protrayed remarkably.  And the cameos of certain undergrad mutants were cool also.  Stunts and special effects were perfect also.  I don't think they could have done a better job.  Although I do have to admit the chronology of it was quite off.  But it definately made for a better story line.  If you like the X-Men, if you LOVE the X-Men,  if you've never heard of the X-Men, go see this movie.  It is definately worth the wait in line (although i was first in line) and it's worth every penny.  True believers unite!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than x2 ?,"I know I'm probably in the minority with this view, but I found the original X-Men movie more enjoyable than the second outing. I find it better because of the introduction to all the characters and a more rounded storyline. When one of the lead characters bites the dust at the end of the second movie I couldn't help thinking that they'll be back in X3 so why should I really care.Anyway back to X-Men which is set in the present day and focuses on a new breed of humans who have mutant powers. The mutations take various forms which means the mutants have just about every power you could imagine. The ""normal"" humans are somewhat uncomfortable and take the forlorn decision to marginalise the mutants. The mutants themselves are split into two bands the goodies being led by Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the baddies led by Magneto (Ian McKellen). Most of the action is focussed on Wolverine (Weaving) and the film is good fun. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good,"While this movie lacked a bit in story and has an ending that very easily allows a sequel, isn't that what we all expected? I think this movie was mainly to introduce most of the characters and the story will be better in the sequel, which i am sure will come soon. The action scenes were very good and i'm glad they didn't cut on special effects. The movie is also very true the comic books, which is a good thing. It is also very funny at some moments and even makes fun of their own cartoons. One little point i have to add... i think it's too bad Rogue was just a teenager. She seems so much cooler in the comics...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A pretty good start to a big franchise,"Rating-7/10X-Men is a comic book film that makes the transition well and comes out in the end being one of the most memorable superhero welcomes. With a fine cast and some crazy super powers, X-Men manages to mould together some of the best elements we want to see to engage us in a way not seen before this very much. I felt the movie to be solidly a pretty good film and here below is why I thought so.The story is exciting yet allows a certain amount of calm moments that create tension throughout. The whole plot does seem to ride a long well and the ending doesn't come too fast nor are we bored of one scene that goes on too long because well, no scenes are too long. It has great action and although the effects don't do great justice to the awesome things going on, it still puts you on a bit of a thrill ride.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is good in this and really introduces his character in a gritty and angry way. Patrick Stewart is good as Professor X and along with Ian McKellen brings in two completely different roles but both acted to the same great way. I wasn't too keen on Halle Berry as Storm, she felt awkward and over dramatic at times, even at times feeling like she had only one liners which were just badly timed.Bryan Singer is the real mastermind behind this and really impresses with his first X-Men, he directs it fairly well although could have been better, it is written very well and this for me was one the major highlights. I said about the effects before and I know they weren't great in reflection on the time this movie was made but they don't enhance this movies reputation, if anything at times it drags it just a slight bit.My main criticism is the lack of true action, quite a bit of talking which can be good at times but too much throughout the middle and even the end feels like it needs a little injection of fighting. The acting is good although there are some people in it I would have liked to have seen more, mostly the students or teachers who although seen are never quite explored in depth like those such as Wolverine.If you want a good old comic book superhero film then this is by far for you, it isn't quite similar to many others but still manages that great thing where the characters are well represented and the budget is used very well. I think if you want a lot of fighting and I mean a lot then avoid this, there is some but as previously said, it isn't abundant and even sometimes the effects can take away the adrenaline rush.Overall I give this a 7/10 and felt it to be Solidly a Kind of Good movie that never quite gets too near to being good well to be good but far outreaches just being ""OK"". The X-Men franchise starts well here and seeing this as if I were in 2000 would definitely fill me with some hope for the future with the X-Men. Marvel seemed to have really hit the major big time much later than when this film came out and so I feel that this movie really represents the beginnings of what Marvel had and have to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

So this is the one...,"This is the one that influenced so many superhero films like Spider-Man 1 and 2, Iron Man 1 and 3, and Captain America. Thank you very much, Bryan Singer.No really. This movie is quite entertaining. The special effects are a little old and cheesy for this day and age, but this is still a landmark film nonetheless. It not only started a whole genre of superhero films, but also started Hugh Jackman's mainstream cinema career before Les Mis totally fancified him. Plus. the thought of Captain Picard working with all the X-Men was entertaining.The dialogue faltered in some places, like the infamous scene where Storm asks Toad ""You know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else."" Otherwise this movie was a hugely immense success since it succeeded while the superhero industry was butchered by Superman IV, Captain America (the 1990 one.

"a surprising, action packed film that remains true to the heart of the comic books, while adding modern resonance","I had never read the x-men comic books, so the only thing drawing me to this movie was the chance to see Patrick Stewart as Professor X.  I was neither disappointed nor confused.  The characters were well-delineated, the script was both funny, surprising, and serious.  The theme of intolerance was handled superbly.  The action scenes were amazing--you really felt like these characters could do all these amazing things.  But the film really benefitted from some wonderful performances.  After this, Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine.  His performance still makes me think, two days after seeing the film.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen(Magneto) spar admirably, and although you know who is good and who is bad, the line between satisfyingly hazy, as it should be with such a complex issue.  The best part of the film was the relationship between Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Wolverine.    The rest of the actors do very well with their characters, and you just know that the sequels will be even better, as long as Bryan Singer is the director, and the scripts are kept to such exacting perfection.  I recommend it highly as the best action film this summer, not to mention in a long time--both exciting and intelligent.  GO SEE IT NOW!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-troduction,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorAs a fan of the X-Men I was joyed to see these characters up on the big screen but as a movie fan I was disappointed. What disappointed me is that this film is only an introduction to the characters and the X-Men world. Nothing more! The plot is good for Magneto's first scheme but the film really has no moments. The only moments are it's characters. There is no moment that captures the imagination of it's audience. All that the film is, is an introduction.

Way too overhyped but OK film,"Directed by  Brian Singer Written by  David Hayter , Tom DeSanto and Bryan SingerStarring  Hugh Jackman , Patrick Stewart , Anna Paquin , Ian McKellen and Famke JanssenBefore I begin I should say that I am quite unrelated with the X-men universe . I have never read comics and the only character I knew apart from the celebrated worldwide Wolverine , was Cyclops . I can understand that the film by Brian Singer followed accurately the story and the origin of the characters so the fans liked the movie . Unfortunately the film hasn't got much to offer to the rest of the sci-fi and comics - transferred - to - celluloid aficionados . The 7.3 (!!!) rating is too much and I don't care about how much some X-men fans will protest , but comparing X-men to classics like Superman or Batman is an insult . I have already written in my Mortal Kombat Annihilation review (read it if you like) that it is strictly for well knowing fans of the video game and the rest are advised to keep away because most probably they will be lost . X-men 's fatal flaw is the same : too many characters in one short movie . But where at least MK:A had wonderful fight scenes and some decent SFX , X-Men fails miserably not only action-wise but the character development is also a letdown . Now , I would like to think that the deleted scenes which are included in the DVD will improve the unfinished elements but only time will tell . For now , the official cut is disappointing . Don't believe the hype : X-Men is an OK film but really nothing special . The critics for once again are proven to be wrong . There is actually nothing that differentiates the film from other ones . The comments about `adult' themes and `futuristic' imagery make me want to laugh . Batman (1989) had much more adult atmosphere and movies like `Dark City' or even `Demolition Man' deal much better with social and political issues than this latest cinematic adaptation of the famous characters . X-Men cannot hide its comics origins and it is not as dark as the official critics alleged . It DEFINITELY doesn't reach an intellectual level .PLOT SYNOPSIS :  The not so distant future . In the USA there is a great number of mutants . Although it is never explained how the mutations occurred , it is probably due to perturbations of D.N.A. The mutants have some amazing super-powers which have caused people to be afraid of them . The mutants cannot live ordinary lives and try to hide their secret because they now that a disclosure will ostracize them from society for good . As if this wasn't enough , a Senator called Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) has started a campaign against mutants and wants to confine them so their super-powers will not be a threaten to society . Unbeknownst to his plans , there is a powerful mutant who is also a wise scientist , Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) with enhanced telekinetic and telepathic abilities (ironically he is stuck in a wheelchair) . Professor Xavier (a.k.a. Professor X) has founded an occluded academy for mutant children . He teaches them how to use the powers they have and learn how to control them . He is an idealist and believes that some day the mutants will be incorporated as a healthy tissue of the society along `normal' humans . There is also another equally powerful mutant scientist Eric Lensherr (a.k.a. Magneto) with the ability to manipulate metal objects within a remarkable range and scale with exceptional timing and synchrony . Magneto (Ian McKellen) believes that a war is coming and he wants to exterminate humans before they get the chance to strike first . Professor X and Magneto were old friends  but now their philosophies are bound to clash . Professor X's key assistants in the academy are Scott Summers (James Marsden) alias Cyclops whose eyes emit deadly energy blasts , Orore Munroe (Halle Berry) alias Storm with the ability to control thunders and air and Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) a skilled scientist with limited telekinetic and telepathetic powers . The basic star of the film is actually Wolverine (a brilliant Hugh Jackman) a mysterious man with amnesia who has the power to heal himself rapidly from serious injuries. He meets with a mutant girl called Mari D' Ancanto (Anna Paquin) alias Rogue who has an energy-draining ability and her touch can be deadly . When the two of them are attacked by Magneto 's henchmen they are rescued by Cyclops and Storm and are taken in the Academy for security . Rogue is adjusted easily and makes new friends but Wolverine doesn't want to stay despite Professor X's warnings that Magneto is after him . Predictably more fights among the X-Men and Magneto 's gang will ensue .This is the so-called `plot' of the movie . The first half hour before we enter the Academy is extremely weak and boring . If you are not familiar with X-Men you will not understand much . Towards the end there is a `master plan' by Magneto but it is a desperate and futile attempt to create a plot where there isn't there any . So what happens in between ? First of all Magneto is not evil and his henchmen are ugly and repelling freaks with lousy make-up . Mystique 's blue body is cheaply made and disgusting . The villains are not interesting . On the X-Men side things are not better . Storm (a woefully underdeveloped Halle Berry) and Cyclops hardly ever use their powers . Even worse they are decorative . The entire movie looks cheap. I don 't care how much money it cost but it looks cheap . Most of the SFX are nothing special and I was expecting better from a 2000 new-tech film . I have seen better SFX from older movies (Superman) or TV shows . Mystique 's shape-shifting , Cyclops 's red rays or even Magneto 's white light-emitting device are cheap and could be included in a 1970 's B-movie . What I liked was Storm 's abilities to fly and control the weather but as I already said she hardly uses them . Most of the fight scenes are also disappointing . As for character development forget it . Patrick Stewart was an ideal choice for the role but even he is not given much to do except from reciting his history to Wolverine . The interesting characters are Dr Jean Grey and Rogue. Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin try valiantly but suffer from a shallow script . There are also cameos from Pyro (a young man with pyrokinetic abilities) , the well known Iceman and Kitty Pride ,  a girl who can pass through walls with momentary dematerialization , who are all students at the Academy . I guess we will have to wait for the next film to see their characters stretched out . Professor X , Storm , Cyclops , Dr Jean Grey and Rogue have great potential and worth more screen time . This is another great problem of the film apart from the cheap SFX : the leads are never given origin or motives . They simply are there and act mechanistically . X-Men is clearly an introductory film and it leaves you wanting for more . As for the messages about racism and the obvious parallelism to Mac Carthy's politics ? Cute and welcomed but haven't we really seen it all over again in other films ? So this is not an innovation .There is one thing I liked and of course this is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine . The man was born for to play this role . Wolverine is the lead of the movie . His claws is the most convincing SFX and he is the most developed character . In the future we will probably dig up more information about his past and how he obtained his powers . Hugh Jackman gives a great performance and survives the script 's flaws . On the acting side Famke Janssen , Anna Paquin and the ever reliable Patrick Stewart give solid appearances despite the one-dimensional roles . Has this film any other virtues ? Quite a few I am afraid . The academy 's scenery is quite psychedelic and who can forget the scene with Wolverine walking through the corridor with the mirrors . Some of the costumes are also nice . Jackman and Paquin share an interesting quasi-erotic chemistry . I also liked Bruce Davison as the Congressman and I believe he should be used more . And no matter how cheaply directed and unoriginal , the final showdown between X-Men and Magneto 's mutants succeeds in being memorable.In conclusion X-Men is not a great movie . Brian Singer is definitely an overrated director (Usual Suspects was also OK but nothing great) but I have sincere hopes that the sequel will be better . If however you are sucker for comics - movies (like I am) see it . It is not Batman but it is not Howard the Duck either .X - MEN        7 / 10P.S    In case you wonder about the corny line ` Do you know what happens to a toad when it is hit by a thunder ? ....... What happens to everything else' . This wasn't in the script . The rational explanation comes from the original version . The plausible answer is ` It croaks'.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Where were the Canadian token X-people?,"I am one of the mild fans of this Bryan Singer film; it is amazing and amusing but I have a question for the diehard fans:  where are the Canadian folks in this movie that dashes around Northern America?  The two Mutants at the top of the Good versus Bad pyramids: Dr. X versus Magneto were portrayed by British Shakespearean veterans who sort of look age 60 + or so.  However, if the setting of the storyline is supposed to be distinctly in the ""near"" future, wouldn't such a hero and villain (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, respectively) both be 70-75 years old to have survived the 1944 Concentration camps and the immigration past Miss Liberty in 1949 as adolescents in full bloom of their mutant psychic powers?  Those two talented actors' pronunciation and diction still isn't quite generic to most people's ears but both veterans have carried major Studio/TV credits so we can understand that casting.  However,  Australian Anna Paquin and Brit Hugh Jackman as well as the actor portraying Toad are also a bit heavy on the accents in my opinion.  The trucker and the Canadian bar patrons in early scenes seemed to me mere ""generic"" gladiator/WWF crowd versus any representative inclusions of those ""north"" of the US border. In other USER COMMENTS previous to mine, several are asking about sequels and omission of favorite characters.  For me, the germane question isn't about who'll be featured next, why Singer or executive producer Stan Lee chose these particular X-persons (good and evil), or was enough attention to believable special effects equipment/fight scenes paid.  I want to know if and when the U.S. Senate bans mutants or herds them into Konzentration-Kamps, will they flock to the Canadian Rockies where Wolverine seems to have been shifted?

Soon the X-Men find themselves locked in combat with the other group in order to stop the terrorist attacks on innocent people. Anyway, rather than divulge the rest of the story let me just say that this is a fun and exciting movie which should appeal to most fans of the ""comic book"" genre. I liked the performances of both Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart and it didn't hurt to have several attractive actresses like Halle Berry (as ""Storm""), Famke Janssen (""Dr. Jean Grey"") and Rebecca Romjin (""Mystique) also appearing in the movie. Likewise, I appreciated the fact that this movie consisted of more than just mindless action and CGI. It was a refreshing change-of-pace considering that's all Hollywood seems capable of lately. Be that as it may, I rate this movie as above average and recommend it to those who might be interested in something of this nature.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Over rated above average action movie.,Clearly the makers were afraid of going all the way but played it safe to please Hollywood and to make enough money to get the green light for a sequel.Maybe in the up coming x-men sequel they'll go to the darker side of the comic steering away from the main steam candy coating.X-men is true to the comic but is lacking soul or EDGE.

Finally... The Summer of 2000's ass has officially been KICKED!,"X-Men is truly what happens when you combine the genius of a creative team which cares for the history behind a legacy, yet had the creativity and insight to bring this to the 'real world' and the big screen.Bryan Singer, Tom DeSanto and everyone else on the X-Team delivered.  Big time.  Against all odds (rushed release date, limited budget, hordes of nay-sayers), they delivered a film which will not only appease fans of the comic, but the general public as well.The theme, this is the real world-and this is 'tomorrow' (sometime in the near future).  This takes place in the real world (not a Gotham City, fictional locale), and deals with real issues.  Bryan Singer's move to take this movie, its characters and the viewing public ""seriously"" is what makes this movie stellar.  This isn't watered down, silly and insulting like other comic book to movie translations as of late.Go and see it.  Go and see it twice (at least).  For the comic book fans that complain about how their beloved characters have been altered (age or costume)-wake up.  The premise of this movie was to make it real.  A story, drama even, with action it it.  For those not familiar with the X-Men history, nor do not like ""comic book"" movies--definitely go and see it. Its NOT 'just a comic book' movie.  I don't collect comics.  I just loved seeing this movie, a number of times.  Its entertaining, and then some.I hope we the powers that be decide on doing a sequel.. yes, its that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very, very good.",First I must say that a special hats off to Hugh Jackman for his impassioned performance of Wolverine. Next I got the feeling that Bryan Singer desperately wanted this movie to be great. He was obviously a little out of his element here but he succeeded in making a stark realization of this wildly complex comic. I collected X-Men and Wolverine up until Onslaught and I have to say that waiting for this film was only second to waiting for Episode I. Sadly I have to say that this film out did Star Wars from start to finish. I was not disappointed.  Some of the character development on characters needed to be fleshed out but on the whole I loved it.  I left the theater with a big smile on my face and a warm spot in my heart.  I was excited and proud of everyone attached to the film. Hats off guys.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Understated and very very good. THE summer movie,"Even if you don't read the comic, go see this movie. Bryan Singer has crafted a movie about *people* not characters. The acting is heartfelt and reverent, the story is engaging, and there is plenty to whet the appetite for what's to come.A must see! This could be the film that redeems comics after the BATMAN AND ROBIN fiasco.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Holy mutants Batman!  A good comic book movie.,"X-Men:  The next phase in human evolution has given rise to a select group who possesses a wide range of unusual abilities: telekinesis, super-healing, and morphing are only a few examples.  Unfortunately, there is a movement among the ""normal"" people - afraid of what they do not understand - to have these ""mutants"" register so they can be identified, tracked and their powers documented.  Two mutants emerge as leaders with radically different agendas - one seeks peaceful coexistence with the rest of humanity - the other domination.Whenever a book is adapted for the big screen there is bound to be controversy over casting or content - legions of fan were livid with the choice of Tom Cruise for the role of Lestat in ""Interview With a Vampire"". To a lesser degree, this has also applied to comic book adaptations (""Spiderman"", ""Superman"", we won't even touch ""Batman""¬Ö), but none approaching the level of debate which raged over ""X-Men"".  It was not just a question of who would be cast, but which characters should be included, what they should wear (people were livid that the characters would not be clad in body hugging spandex), how close they should be to the comic book characters, etc.  Consequently, I would be stunned if anyone is totally happy with all the characters - I know I wasn't.Toad gets far too much screen time and his prehensile tongue schtick quickly grows tiresome, Sabretooth isn't very menacing (they couldn't find a bulked up Behemoth with a little more screen presence? Kane (?) from the WWF comes to mind¬Ö) and the May/December relationship between Jean Grey and Cyclops doesn't jibe.  I did however think Hugh Jackman was superb as Wolverine, delivering the right balance of pathos and rage.  Patrick Stewart's Xavier is a cool as ice (he got a lot of practice as Captain Picard on Star Trek), soft-spoken diplomat.  Finally, Sir Ian McKellen is almost regal in his portrayal as Magneto the wonderful gentleman villain with a nasty disposition (but couldn't they have given him a better hat?  I bet that's why he has such an attitude problem).  But you're probably wondering ""What about the movie itself?""  All in good timeRather than go for a gaudy ""comic book"" look (""Dick Tracy""), or a decaying and depressing landscape (""Batman""), ""X-men"" has a realistic feel: it takes place a few years in the future in a recognizable New York.  The story is engaging and accessible, examining the concept of intolerance - although here it is not skin color (in most cases) or religion that is the focus - which captures headlines everyday, and is quite simple to grasp.   Just to ensure that the movie doesn't get too heavy, there are quite a few clever puns and one-liners sprinkled throughout to provide some levity.   And let's not forget the action.There are several excellently choreographed action sequences, most notably the battle between Mystique and Wolverine.  The experience is heightened by excellent cinematography, stop motion and slow motion photography, and impressive special effects (morphing technology continues to improve).X-Men will not satisfy everyone, but it does deliver a finely crafted story, good acting and is without a doubt one of the best comic-book-to-screen translations to date.And there will be a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Adequate I suppose, but really, I was expecting a LOT more!","I'm not an 'X-Men' buff by any means, but I do read comics (though I prefer Vertigo to Marvel), and I love Bryan Singer's 'The Usual Suspects', so I was expecting a lot from this movie. I really hoped that this would finally be THE movie that takes comics seriously and takes them to the next level. Sadly it isn't. As comic adaptations go it's one of the better ones, but that's not high praise as most of them stink. Not being a fan I didn't mind that some details were played around with, but I did think that the script left a bit to be desired. The Bruce Davidson character and the McCarthy witchhunt aspects of the plot were heavy-handed and obvious, and basically all the potentially interesting ideas raised throughout the movie were never explored. Maybe if Singer had asked his talented former collaborator Christopher McQuarrie to write the script things would have been meatier and less predictable, I don't know. I did like the way the movie didn't get bogged down in origin stories or flashbacks, something that usually drags these kinds of movies down, but 'X-Men' really runs out of steam in the last third with an anti-climatic finale that fails to satisfy. Plus the movie is blatantly left open for the inevitable sequels, and this comes across as a very cynical move. The best thing about the film is the casting of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magento respectively, both are much better than the weak material they have to work with. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Famke Janssen as Dr.Jean Grey were both good, but the rest of the cast were pretty dull, especially Halle Berry as Storm who might as well not have been in it.  So, a missed opportunity all round that is adequate but not much more. I hope the sequel is a big improvement but I'm not holding my breath.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pleasantly Surprised.,"I went in expecting a bad movie. I was surprised. It was actually good. Not great. But it had this feeling of not wanting to be great. Or at least not trying to be great, just fun and tightly done. Which it was. The movie is really focused on Wolverine, which is good; I guess they recognized that Wolverine is most people's favorite X-Man. Rogue would be the second banana I guess. She doesn't get to do much but she is the key everyone is after.Some very well-done super hero fight scenes. The strong point of the movie. They are really handled well. Some good special effects. Although they don't make a movie they are used well here.The story trucks along at a brisk pace. A little too brisk in some points. But you are never left too long to think about how silly it all is.Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great together. Hugh Jackman carries the movie.It's greatest fault is it feels like it has been over-edited. It is very streamlined and it leaves with the feeling that they could have taken another half an hour and it would of been great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Im not a big fan of X-Men but yes its a pretty good superhero film,"Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence.I think X-Men was the film that brought back the popularity of superhero films.Batman and Robin was a big disappointment and it seemed to stop people from making superhero films.When this came out, it was a box office hit and them the superhero trend of films started again.I have this film on VHS and I haven't seen it in a while.What I remember however is that it had great action scenes which is all you really need for a superhero film.I was never really a big fan of X-Men but I enjoyed this movie.If you are a fan of x-men or superhero films in general, I suggest checking this one out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

No Real Complaints,"When I first heard of this movie and seen the previews I was excited to go see it.  After a few weeks though, I began to wander.  Would it be as horrible as most (but not all!) movies based on super heros and comics? Would the acting be below average?  Would the running time be enough to tell the story?Even with my doubts I went to see it, and I'm glad I did.  I can't think of a single real complaint aside from little picky things.  This movie is filled with great action, story, and humor.  There was at least 4 to 5 times where the whole audience got a good laugh going, and many chuckling moments here and there.  The story was good and really gets you interested, and the action was great enough to cause cheering!I'll be glad to see a sequel, and as long as most of this cast is in the next I'll probably see it!

Best Super-Hero film ever,"The ""super-hero"" film is a much maligned genre.  In most cases, this reputation is well deserved.  Face it.  Most super-hero films stink.  Above the usual duds, there are a few that stand out as adequate or slightly better, such as Superman or Batman(1), but even these miss the mark.  The common failure with these films is that they do not capture the essence of the heroes involved in the stories.  They too often ignore anywhere from 10-50 years of history, and they simply cover a typical story with a hero's insignia, or they parody what is wrongly regarded as only a ""kids"" genre. They miss the comic book.  X-Men does not.  More than any super-hero film ever, it stays true to its source.  It captures the spirit of 30+ years of ""The Uncanny X-Men.""  It treats its characters and subject matter seriously and makes it easy to believe that Super-Heroes do exist in the world of this film.  They are not campy parodies or distant icons, but real heroes.  The genre has always held tremendous potential.  It's nice to see someone finally capture some of that lightning.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the weakest Super Hero Movies,"A good Director and good Actors, even Oscar Winners, cannot help this weak plot. I find it almost boring. I just watched it for a second time on DVD, and I had difficulties finishing it (which hardly ever happens even with movies I have seen lots of times...).There is absolutely nothing special about this movie, even the last Batman sequel was more entertaining. I was told this is the first in a series, and special care was taken to build up all the individual characters. What characters? Except Wolverine and Mystique, who have some depth and are admittedly cool, all the other superheroes are pathetic (Cyclops, Storm), or just ridiculous (Toad). Even Mr Xavier himself is not much of a superhero, and Patrick Stewart bends backwards to give him some life. Waste of an actor!The story line is utterly predictable, silly, and one more time a waste of resources, like so many other movie versions of comic heroes. (Why not just take some of the original comic story lines and turn them into a movie. Frank Miller's Return of the Dark Knight outclasses the combined production of all the screenplays for the Batman movies. Where is the daring genius to turn Neil Gaiman's Sandman into a decent movie?)I like comics, I like movies, and sometimes I like them both put together, but X men is one of these movies I would like to unwatch and get back my money, and more important my time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another Bryan Singer coup,"Singer is probably the best Hollywood director when it comes to films with lots of characters, as he proved with The Usual Suspects. Here again he weaves an exciting tapestry of character interaction, origin stories, plot points and allegories.Viewers expecting to see a blockbuster action movie such as ""Terminator 2"" or ""Die Hard"" may be let down. The movie is more about character interaction and plot twists. Additionally, the budget for this film was something like 75 million (a fraction of what most big action movies cost these days), which was no doubt significantly doled out to the likes of Patrick Stewart and Ian McClellan. But it's a terrific film, the kind of movie that has the viewer remembering scenes and quotable lines long after seeing it.I have talked to comic book fans and those who never read a comic book and everyone I polled (except many critics, go figure) thoroughly enjoyed the film.The success of the movie should also be credited to Ian McClellan's masterful Magneto, and to a slightly lesser degree, Patrick Stewart's endearing Professor Xavier.If you're like me, you'll wind up watching it 2 or 3 times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"In hindsight, a tame, yet very entertaining movie","It's hard to believe that back in 2000, Marvel's first crack at creating a superhero universe on the big screen, X-Men, was a near perfect summer movie. 14 years on, and the cracks are as clear as day in Bryan Singer's hesitant and rather tame blockbuster. Don't get me wrong, X-Men still has plenty to enjoy, but the meatier, more confident recent efforts such as Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and Marvel's own Iron Man (2008) and Thor (2011), as well as the vastly superior sequel two years later, form a rather large shadow over Professor X and his pupils' first outing.In the near future, evolution has taken a huge leap forward, creating 'mutants' - humans with special powers and abilities that defy anything science has seen before. Tensions between humans and mutants is at an all-time high, with the idea of mutant cataloguing being passed around by Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), despite the efforts of telepaths Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor with the ability to control anything magnetic, has different ideas, and plans to induce mutation on world leaders gathering on Ellis Island.As the machine, powered by magnetics, could easily kill him, Magneto seeks Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young girl with the ability to temporarily steal a mutant's power. Having just met Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a beast of a man with a skeleton covered in an indestructible metal, which he can shoot out like claws, and an uncanny healing ability, Rogue's abduction fails and is foiled by Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden). They end up in Professor Xavier's school for gifted children, where Wolverine learns about mutant struggle and falls in love with the powerful Jean Grey.With a film this packed with personalities and powers, it's only natural that it loses it's grip on a lot of its characters. Sensibly, the main focus is on Wolverine, who has always been the most interesting X-Man, and is perfectly played by Jackman, a performance that made him a huge star. The rest of the characters, with the exception of Professor X and Magneto, do little but fall flat. They either suffer because their powers aren't particularly interesting, or spend the duration of the film using what little dialogue they have to explain who they are and what they can do. The movie also has one of the worst lines in cinema history, uttered by Storm. You'll know it when you hear it.For all its lack of ambition and absence of any real set-pieces, X-Men is still the first of its kind. Refusing to give in to the idea of comic books being light, colourful and mainly for kids (which was still the general idea back in 2000), the opening scene depicting a young Magneto in a concentration camp ensures this is something that should be taken seriously, yet still enjoyed. Singer grew in confidence and made X2 two years later, which is still considered by myself and many others to be one of the best superhero movies ever made. X2 showed that the vast ensemble can be given room to breathe, and had the set-pieces to match, and in hindsight, makes X-Men a much tamer, yet still very entertaining, animal.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Muties Go Commercial,"As an action movie, this more or less works. As an accurate cinematic portrayal of the X-Men, there are more than a few flaws. Does it detract from the experience? Not entirely. A few nagging points constantly scratch at your brain.First, the casting is somewhat mixed. I think the only dead-on casting was of Cyclops (PERFECT match!), Magneto and Professor X (who else BUT Patrick Stewart could play him?). The rest is alright, but nothing special. Hugh Jackman can handle the Wolverine attitude (""Later, bub"" would not sound wrong coming out of his lips), but he's just a little too tall. And a few decisions really get you: Halle Berry as Storm? I say, if you don't see Storm as anything more than Halle Berry in a platinum wig, don't put her in the movie. Even at the climax, when she rises from the elevator shaft, eyes glossed over, hair and cape flowing, I still wasn't seeing her as Storm.Rogue deserves her own paragraph: where is the tall, striking, Southern brawler we all know and love? Gone, replaced by Anna Paquin, who is about half the size and has none of the bravado, fire, and spirit of Rogue. In fact, she looks like a whiny kid. Sorry, Anna, but that travesty of a Southern accent (which rapidly disappears anyway) does not Rogue make.The chronology of what mutants join when is a little confused. They attempted to make it a cross between a historical account of the forming of the team and a ""hit parade"" of mutants.If they want a historical account, then it should start with Angel, Iceman, Cyclops, Jean Grey (Marvel Girl) and Beast. The rest (Rogue, Storm, Wolverine) would join later in the film. No Angel, barely any Iceman, and Beast was canned due to makeup restraints. So much for that idea.The ""hit parade"" idea holds a little more water, but not much. Where the heck is Gambit? And what is Colossus doing painting when the team is in desperate need of muscle? Betsy Braddock, a.k.a. Psylocke?And the villains: Magneto, Mystique, Sabretooth and Toad. That's it. Some army. When will the Cytorak gem turn Cain Marko into the Juggernaut? Where are the Sentinels? Omega Red?When will we see the Danger Room in all of its might? The Savage-Land? Sure, the ""yellow spandex"" line gets a few laughs, but why are the costumes so generic? This film asks more questions than it answers, but if you take it on its own terms it's an alright movie, but nothing more.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It doesnt take any risks and at moments can be boring but the movie compensates this minor inconvenients with tons of good things.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great fun - all flaws small,"I have never in my life read an X-men comic book. I had never heard of them before the film came and David Letterman started to make jokes about them. My knowledge of comic books stretches as far as Wonderwoman and Green Lantern, but my own superheroes were more in the line of Pippi Longstocking and Bamse (the strongest teddybear in the world).I had three reasons to see the film: 1. Bryan Singer directed 2. Patrick Stewart was in it 3. There was absolutely NOTHING worthwile showing in theatres. Guess what? I liked it. I liked it a lot. As long as you accept the premises - superheroes, saving the day, yada yada yada - it's a great film. Not ""The Seventh Seal"", obviously, but possibly the best adventure I've seen since ""The Princess Bride"". (And Star Wars, but the good films are older than TPB.)Granted, expectations aren't so high for this kind of film. We're lucky if they have a storyline. This one did. Also some fantastic characters, directing and. okay, special effects, but I'm a girlie, I'm not supposed to care. I loved how the mutations were both a gift and a curse - three of the heroes (Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops) get into situations were they risk killing someone they care for because they can't control their powers. The social aspect could have been used better, it was a little obvious at times (I for one have seen to many Nazis in popular movies), but again, just having one was great.Main characters Wolverine and Rogue were well done and acted, you really came to care for them. Although, I must admit, I have had it with broody rebels with no past, I didn't mind so much when it came to Wolverine, because he was simply great. Also, he was funny. (""Sabretooth? Storm. What do they call you, Wheels?"") Rogue was endearing facing the fear she had for herself. Good/Bad leaders Xavier and Magneto were exactly as well done as one could expect when acted by a couple of long time pros like Stewart and McKellen. Also, I was taken in by Cyclops. (Those of you who question my motives can please think over your own motives for liking Mystique.) Sure, he was a total 90210 preppie, but he was *recognized* and dissed as a such in the film, causing some grins from yours truly, and there was more to the character than that. For one thing, if this had been 90210,Cyclops would have been the popular hunky guy and Wolverine would have been the badass that mothers tell their daughters to stay away from. In this film, Wolverine can sit in a train full of people comforting Rogue, and nobody raises an eyebrow. Cyclops smiles at a kid and its mother hurries to take it away. Preppie is the *only* one of the heroes who can never pass for ""normal"". Sadly, they never develop his character much, and this cocky-but-insecure control freak disappears into the background. Same goes for the last two heroes Jean Grey and Storm - the latter is so underdeveloped I can't even tell whether she was well acted or not.One thing that really bugged me, though: While the good guys are all cool and have fantastic abilities, Magneto is stuck with a pair of unbelievably lame animal people called Sabretooth and Toad. Sabretooth makes me long for good ol' ""Beauty and the Beast""-Vincent who was a philosopher between the ass-kicking. I doubt that Sabretooth is even housebroke. On the other hand, there's Mystique, the shapeshifter, and her powers are so interesting I'm willing to overlook that her real shape looks like a wet Playboy dream.The other main flaw is that the film is not enough to satisfy, it leaves you hungry for more. Not only is the storyline set up for a sequel, but it hints lot of things characterwise (Wolverine's past for one thing) that it never shows. I don't mind seeing a sequel, but I don't want to be *forced* into seeing it. X-men is a little bit too much like the first book in a fantasy series where you have to read the rest. Only, all books in a series tend to be made by the same author. What if they replace the director and the next film turns out bad? That could happen. It's not like 15 more minutes would have spoiled the film. So, big :-( for that and the henchmen, big :-D for the rest of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Suprisingly Strong,"As a devoted fan of the comic book when I was younger, I expected this movie to be a real flop.  I expected my critical eye to be overworked spotting flaws and unnecessary deviations from character.  I've seen other comic book adaptations and they never translate well.  The best was the first Batman movie, and it could hardly be said to have been particularly true to the comic.X-Men was MOSTLY true to the comic.  Obviously any movie is going to have time limits and as such cannot portray hundreds of issues of story in that time.  Given these limits, the essence of the characters and origins were all as sound as they could be.  In fact, a few of the changes made were improvements over the comic book.The only thing I expected this movie to be good in was effects.  Given the high bar set by movies like the Matrix, I expected a strong effects and stunts show.  This was really the one place where X-Men was average.  Many of the stunts flopped, failing to capture the speed or essence of what they were trying to portray.  You could tell which stunts were done with wires, and which were cgi.  It was very transparent, which in this day and age is unacceptable.There also were no particularly stunning camera angles during the stunts like Matrix had.  They tried once or twice, but none really came off as they should have.  It may seem unfair to compare ANY movie to the effects wizardry shown in Matrix, but this movie and subject matter was perfect to exploit such dazzling effects work, and it was very disappointing to see how poorly many were done.By no means do I want to imply that the stunt work was BAD overall, nor that is substantially detracted from the overall strength of the movie.  It was primarily a minority of the action that had these problems.  This one is worth seeing.  I was merely disappointed by the missed opportunities to do something truly spectacular when the movie opted for simpler, less dazzling effects, and on the rare occasions when it reached for the stars, it was executed poorly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Cool, cool, cool","This movie is the achievement all comicbook movies should look up to. The casting is perfect. None of the performances are forced or cheesy. Every character is treated respectfully by Singer and their respective actor. Hugh Jackman brings a unique and different aspect to the character of Wolverine, but he still holds true to the original essence of the character. Certain aspects could use touch-ups. Halle Berry's wig just makes her character comical and distracts from what was a good performance. And, the story leaves Cyclops, Scott Summers, out in the dust as far as things to do. As the leader of the team his role needed to be bigger. More action and drama. Length and timing are perfect and the writing is to die for in this film. Despite its length, only an hour and forty some minutes, everything is taken to its conclusion without rushing. Singer brought the X-Men to film in the best way possible. Kudos.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent for what it's trying to accomplish,"I think that the problem with making a feature-length feature of the X-Men is that the X-Men are an ensemble cast.  Instead of only really having one or two main protagonists to develop, as is the case with most comic-book movies like Batman and Superman, this film has to develop an enormous number of characters.  For the 1 1/2 hours that the movie runs, I think it does as good a job as it could in developing the characters that it chooses to depict from the comic book series.  The adaptations of the characters are well placed into ""the real world"" of live-action film; they're not these spandex-clad commandos where every one of them knows some sort of martial art and has bulging muscles.  In fact, they're more or less normal people who are different from us only because of their mutant abilities.  That makes them much easier to relate to for a live-action film and also makes the premise of the X-Men much more believable in a real-world context.Altogether, I do wish I could have gotten to know the characters a little better, but there's only so much you can tell about so many characters in just an hour and a half; I guess I wish the film was a bit longer and had a little more character development.  As it is, though, the movie is one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen; the action is good, the characters well-done, and the dialogue is very effective, funny, and doesn't insult the intelligence.  Also, the issue of Mutant persecution, particularly its relationship with the Holocaust, is executed very well, although it would've been nice if Magneto wasn't so vilified and if his side of the story was sympathized with a little more.All in all, this was a very enjoyable movie.

The anwser for all of my questions - eXpetacular!,"X-men is the kind of movie that takes you in journey you will never forget. X-Men is the kind of movie takes it's cause very serious. And for that reasons i think X-Men is one of the best films i ever seen. First of all, this film takes a 30 years of comic book title, into a little more than 1 hour and 30 minutes. That was a challenge, that only a serious, competent and talented director will ever accept. In other words Bryan Singer. Bryan does a hell of a job in this masterpiece of cinema. He introduces you into a very particular universe, and makes you really ENJOY it! The first two scenes are impressive! He takes you into a very dramatic and complex world. And you like it. Then he takes you into a school, that is full of mutant teenagers, and you enjoy it. He takes into a very actioned, FX and fun world, and you Like it! Thanks to a very competent crew, that knew how to shoot the scenes, the light, the actors, the director of photography really knew, and understood the X-Men. For the Direction, the Acting, the Cinemathography i think X-MEN - THE MOVIE whorts 10 out of 10.

Not just about special effects...,"I'm a big fan of everything Marvel, so I had high hopes for the X-Men. Needless to say, it live up to my expectations, though apparently not to those of many critics.It had its strong points. I always enjoy when there's a strong verisimilitude, that is, the integration of fictional elements into a very real feeling world. These were particularly strong with the opening scene, as well as Senator Kelly's speech. And the special effects were perfectly satisfactory for the film.One issue people may have had was how much more there was of a story and less usage of their powers, etc. Well, I feel that the X-Men is really more about the human element, and the powers are not so much gifts, but curses that they have to learn to live with, just as the people who are anti-mutant have to learn to live with mutants.If there was one weak point, it was the running time. But for a potential Saga-starter, it seems almost perfect. Not too long, just enough to give us a taste and leave us wanting more, then swoop in with an exceptional sequel and fulfill our desires. I highly recommend this to comic fans and movie fans alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An adult approach...,"Bryan Singer's straightforward, adult approach to X-MEN is to be commended: like Tim Burton's treatment of BATMAN, Singer's approach to the subject of super heroes is as dramatic as it is super-heroic- the perfect blend. (Both BATMAN and X-MEN have humorous moments, but the humor is not out of context- and it's certainly not the kind of goofiness that we find in, say, the BATMAN TV series of the 1960s and all too many of the subsequent attempts to bring superheroes to The Big Screen.) Both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen lend the proceedings a gravitas lesser lights could NOT have. In fact, the cast from top to bottom is solid. The black leather look that has been de rigeur since Burton's BATMAN is on display here, as well- and it works, in this world of mutants with extraordinary powers (like many of the characters on THE X-FILES, the characters in X-MEN are all treated realistically- despite some truly Comic Bookish SUPER super powers). The cgi are beautifully integrated, as well. (Note: the cgi actually looked better on The Big Screen than they do on television...) In an age when Genocide has become the Norm (the death toll in Gaza has today passed 1100), it's genuinely sad to see Magneto staring up at the Statue of Liberty and musing, ""America was going to be the land of tolerance...""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good Introduction That Lays the Groundwork for Bigger Things,"Energetic, surprisingly loyal action / adventure with some brilliant casting choices and a tight, cohesive visual style. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are brilliant choices as Xavier and Magneto, dueling civil rights figureheads on opposite sides of the moral spectrum, but don't get nearly enough scenes together. Of course, Hugh Jackman absolutely defines the role of Wolverine, playing a very clearly defined, potentially cheesy character and pulling it off with vigor. The film's not entirely confident in itself, evidenced by a few hokey plot devices and a handful of godawful lines of comic relief (basically anything that comes out of Halle Berry's mouth), but considering its age and status as the make-or-break point for comic book properties (spoiler: it made) I can overlook a few missteps. Light fun with the kernel of a deeper message nestled beneath several layers of black leather, titanium veneer and bright, colorful effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bluffing Itself,"This was far busier than it needed to be, stuffing in drama, morality and comedy relief. Since neither of the former two motifs can be taken seriously, we have to look at this as a comedy.The way this is centered on Jackman and way he is directed to play this puts me in mind of Eastwood in ""Coogan's Bluff""...the attempt is to insert a smart aleck into a fish out of water situation and just let him crack wise at every opportunity.The problem is, Singer didn't understand ""Coogan's"" structure...in addition to the defined jokester, that movie had defined targets (remember the ludicrous 'Pigeon Toed Orange Peel'?) and both were at a distance from the audience. This movie can't distinguish the targets from the audience: the moral is ""we all have to get along with each others' differences"" and the audience is expected to empathize.The morality play propped up by Stewart and McKellan is a sort-of MLK versus Malcolm X philosophical debate. It's not offensive, but it is unnecessary. The whole point of it dissolves like the erstwhile senator.One item of interest is the camera's movement around Jackman during the Statue of Liberty fight; it rotates through 360 degrees in slow motion and only at the end of the shot do we find our perspective again...if only there had been more of these *film* ideas and less comic book flatness and penny-ante moralizing, we'd have had something to remember.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty flat really,"I'm a reasonably loyal fan of the comic, so I went in wanting to like this a lot. But it came off as not quite translating the X-men's actual appeal. To be fair the film is burdened with setting up the groundwork for the characters and their factions. Though in truth the conflict between Xavier and Magneto isn't the most compelling aspect of the X-Men story, and didn't seem particularly engaging in its depiction here. I would have liked to see a little more character interaction and a little less Matrix-lite action. Some of the casting choices could have been given more thought as well. If you were underwhelmed by the movie but are still interested in the X-men story I'd recommend the Graphic Novels ""God Loves,Man Kills"" and ""The Dark Phoenix Saga"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but I'm biased.","I loved the film, but there were few circumstances under which I wouldn't. I grew up glued to X-Men books, (not the show - don't talk to me about the show) and have awaited this cinematic moment all my life.I think it was a really decent portrayal of what I, and many geeks like me, already loved.  In that respect it made the cut.  I don't think anyone expected it to be a brilliant take on an action comic, albeit an action comic with a little depth.Most importantly, the acting was good.  Seeing Halle Berry, Ray Park, and Rebecca Romijn Stamos in the cast scared my pants off, but Patrick Stewart, (a dry performance, but adequate) Ian McKellan (a charming villain, I thought) and especially Hugh Jackman (great job, but a little more grit) made up for the somewhat below par cast.I loved that Brian Singer was able to lend a tad of his dark and realism based style to this fantasy epic.  I thought he saw in the story what X-Men fans saw when reading the books: X-Men is real!  I wanted as sincere a treatment of the tale, and Singer did his best to provide it.As a true blue fan, I am also not offended by editorial changes made to the characters and their powers.  Rogue went from a voluptious flying vixen to a tool in telling a good story.  Cyclops and Storm became minor characters to focus the movie on its most interesting parts.  I'm glad it wasn't bogged down with elements present only to satisfy those who prefer comics to movies, because it was a movie, after all.I thought the little bit of humour near the end (Wolverine calling Cyclops a bad name) was needed and too rare, although the yellow spandex joke was a little too obvious a wink at the audience.  Oh, and by the way; did everyone notice Ray Park's stick twirling salute to Darth Maul?Overall?  Go see it if you like sci-fi/fantasy/action and are not short on imagination.  If you read the comic or watched the show, go see it NOW!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Comic to Movie ever!,"I just got back from a sneak preview midnight screening of this movie and I just had to comment on this.  This was hands down the best comic made into a movie ever!  I have been a fan of the comics for years, starting reading comics at a very young age, and X-Men has always been one of my favorites. Now, as a ""hardcore fan"" I feel that we tend to be the most critical to a movie, and I feel they did a spectacular job making it.  The special effects are great, there is action, there is drama,  even some humor, and there is actually a cool story.  I thought some things could have been explained a little better for people who weren't familiar with the comics, but it was still good, and had plenty of in-jokes that the comic book fans would get. I feel that everyone looking for a good super-hero movie, or a good action/drama should go out and see this now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent Effects, disappointing plot.","I was a big X-Men fan and was excited to see the movie being released (especially with Patrick Stewart).  I was underimpressed with the storyline (there were many better ones to choose from in the comic), although there were some good plot twists.  I liked the effects and makeup (costumes), but felt that they should have been more true to the comic.  Overall, I would recommend this movie to sci-fi lovers, but warn X-Men fans that they will be slightly disappointed. I am not sure yet whether I want to have this movie in my collection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Having never read the X-Men comics, I can't say whether this movie was faithful to the comic, but as a movie, I thought it turned out to be pretty good.","Unlike other recent comic/film crossovers like Mystery Men, this latest foray into turning a popular comic into a movie had a nice balance between being an action movie and being a comic book movie.Taking place in the not so distant future, the movie follows the exploits of a group of mutants known as the X-Men. Mutants are people who have evolved over time and have special powers. One group of mutants, the X-Men, led by Professor X (Patrick Stewart), believe that they can co-exist with the human race. Another group of mutants, led by Magneto (Ian McKellen) believes that a war between humans and mutants is imminent. He has an evil plan to rid the Earth of humans, and let the mutants dominate the world. It is up to the X-Men to stop him.Along with Professor X, who has the ability to read and control peoples minds, there is Dr. Jean Grey, who has telekinetic powers; Storm, who has the power to control the weather; and Cyclops, a man who has the power of energy in his eyes. On the side of Magneto, who has the power of magnetism, there is the barbarian Sabertooth; Toad, a man with, well, a large tongue and the ability to hop really far; and Mystique, who has the power to shape-shift into anyone. We also meet Rogue, a girl who takes the energy of any person who touches her skin, and Wolverine, a man with amazing regenerative powers, and claws that come out of his hands. Professor X believes that Magneto wants to kidnap Wolverine, but can't figure out why. But he soon realizes that it's not Wolverine that Magneto wants, it's Rogue that Magneto needs, in order to carry out his plan to rid the Earth of the humans.Like I said earlier, the movie has a nice balance between being too cartoony, and being a solid action film. Obviously this is no ordinary group of people, so making it into a regular action movie wouldn't work. And if it's too cartoonish, you end up making a movie that seems really cheesy (thank god they didn't have Wolverine in his yellow and black spandex). So I applaud Bryan Singer on his ability to mesh both worlds. I found the story to be simple, but I think that was necessary. This movie is more about the characters than the story. For those of us un-initiated in the ways of the X-Men, it was a good way to get to know who these people were, and what they could do, rather than throw them into a convoluted story line that would have had to make you think and not pay attention to the heart of the people on screen. I had heard of Wolverine before, but I really didn't know much about any of the other characters, so it was nice to get a little background on them, and see what powers they had, and not have to be worried about some strange plot that would take away from the movie.I thought the special effects were good, but that is the one thing I was expecting from this movie. I thought that the special effects would be good, that there would be some cool hard-core type music, but that's it. What I found was a movie with characters I cared for, and music that was actually kept to a minimum. Generally I find that in these types of movies, whenever there is a big fight scene, or something cool happening, there is always loud music punctuating the scene. Here I found a few scenes where there was silence in the background, which actually punctuated the scene more than any piece of music could. I thought the sets were nice, especially the giant room that Professor X used to try and track down mutants. And I thought the actors did a good job with the characters. I had my doubts about Hugh Jackman playing the brooding Wolverine, but he won me over with his performance. So overall I thought X-Men was a pretty good movie. Not as good as the original Batman, but a whole lot better than most, if not all, of the other comic book movies made in the last 10 years. It had a lot of cool scenes, very cool characters, great special effects, and some good fight scenes. It kept a very even tone throughout, not too serious, not too funny, and the story was there to help the audience get to know the characters, so that we will all go back and see the inevitable sequels in the years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Great Original Comic Book Film,"So with New Mutants hopefully hitting the cinemas soon I have decided to go back and watch all of the previous X-Men films and here is my review for the original film that started the franchise. The premise of the film sees two groups of super powered people called Mutants clash - the militant Brotherhood and the peaceful X-Men and how their two ideologies force opposition.Main Character
It always amazes me that Hugh Jackman was never supposed to be Wolverine, he got the role due to Dougray Scott dropping out and the rest is history. So this is his first time as the character and he is fantastic here, he has the right mix of gruff and humour that makes him such a great character. He owns the screen with his charm and charisma and it is easy to end up rooting for him and wanting to find out more about him as he is shrouded in mystery for the majority of the movie.Supporting Characters
Possibly as iconic is Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian Mckellen as Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto. These two's relationship is one of the most fascinating that there is and I love how the film treats it, yes Magneto is the villain here but the film gives him logical motivations and you truly understand where both characters are coming from even though it is clear Magneto's is more drastic. Both actors nail there performances and it would lead to many films together in the future. Famke Janssen plays Jean Grey and I thought she did a good job here, her chemistry with Jackman is good here and is a nice addition here. Also high credit to Rebecca Romijn for her performance as Mystique, first the makeup is great here and in the action scenes she does a fantastic job. But there are some performances that don't work for me, Anna Paquin has a big role here as Rogue and honestly watching it back it is pretty weak, there is just no real character development and her southern accent felt really forced as well. James Marsden as Cyclops is just a pretty boring character and Halle Berry as Storm has this awful accent that comes across poorly which does affect her character.Story
The story here is really good, seeing this world where mutants exist but are discriminated against hits a lot of real world themes and it creates plenty of interesting character dynamics. As I said you understand both Xavier and Magneto's ideologies and it is handled really well. Seeing Wolverine finding out about X-Men is like he is the window for us and it is a good story device that works well here.Script
The script here is really good, there is a great mix of humour and drama. Jackman has some really funny lines here and with the drama involving Xavier & Magneto it is a great script. Though it has to be mentioned this film includes possibly one of the worst lines in film history, if you have seen this film you know which line I am talking about, but it is a great script regardless.Style
The style is good here, there is some decent action scenes, particularly one involving Wolverine and Mystique which was well handled. Also this film is paced really well, it is shorter then I remember but it fits everything it needs in it and doesn't include any pointless scenes. But this film is now 20 years old and it shows a bit, some of the wirework and CGI is really noticeable and makes it seem dated, it is a criticism but also a bit of a harsh one considering when the film was made.Overall
Overall, this film was really the first mainstream Marvel film and is a great film, if you are a fan of these characters then you will know how enjoyable a film this is. But if you haven't got on the X-Men train then I would say this will be a great time for you to give it a go.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An excellent movie that surpasses expectations.,"This is possibly the best movie to come out this summer.  I was waiting for it just like everyone else, but I was skeptical after seeing Mission: Impossible 2.  I had thought they would take out the team aspect of the X-Men and focus on Wolverine, but the movie was put together very well. While Wolverine played a large part in the plot, he wasn't the focus, and the entire cast worked together as a team.The casting was excellent, and the special effects were mixed in beautifully.  The actors seemed comfortable with their ""mutant"" powers and used them very well.  The story is well written, but I feel that there were some things that didn't follow the comic or the cartoon, such as Wolverine being a little too soft, but that is easily overlooked due to the good chemistry of the whole cast.I was disappointed in Ray Park's role in the movie, but he portrayed Toad very well.  The rest of the actors captured their respective characters well, and you could feel the tension building between Wolverine, Jean Grey and Cyclops from the start.Overall, it was an awesome movie, definitely the best one I've seen yet. I'm definitely going to go see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"XMen-Mutants, Mutations Just Awful 1/2*","Ridiculous Hugh Jackman vehicle. You can't laugh or cry. That's how bad this one is.Aren't Oscar winners Halle Berry and Anna Paquin able to find better material than this? I thought that Famke Johnson had promise. If she keeps up with trite like this, forget it. At the end, she flies in the air as if she is Mary Poppins. Miss Johnson, you are no Mary.This off-the-wall film deals with mutants who supposedly have been accepted by society. Nonetheless, a pharmaceutical concern had come up with a cure. Of course, the owner of the concern has a mutant for a son. Naturally, there is divisiveness in the mutant group. Part of the group, led by Patrick Stewart, want accommodation with the rest of the world. Stewart leads students in a gifted program. No gifted student would participate in a film as awful as this. Ian McKellen is up to his old tricks as the evil mutant with quite a ghastly crew.The special effects here are great. See a house torn up and the Golden Gate Bridge demolished as Alcatraz is invaded.

Hogwarts meets Heroes,"This movie got me thinking about who is today stealing (ok, borrowing) ideas from whom and why are original movies so scarce. I really don't know (am not willing to investigate)who came up first with the idea of a ""special school for 'gifted'"" and why is everybody so obsessed with supernatural powers. In today's world being simply a bit more intelligent compared to average population makes one very, very special. Of course, only a few (rich) get the chance to develop their intelligence and contribute to the ""rest of the society"", basically packed with idiots. Nevertheless, the movie is pretty well done, considering ""the template"". Good directing, appropriate ""acting"" (casting could be better, though, at least for the supporting roles), sfx and the rest of technical aspects. As well as the other movies in the series (2 and Last Stand), it's a good entertainment. Don't expect too much (if you do, watch the ""prequel"": First Class) and have fun.

Surprise; It Does Not Suck.,"You know, there are a great many things that could easily have wrecked this movie completely.  Marvel Comics adaptations have a pretty poor track record of coming across in live-action to either TV or the movies, especially when compared against their competition from DC.  Witness The Punisher, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and a good handful more.  Balance these with the successes of the old 70's Spider Man series (cheesy, but not a bad effort at all for its time), the majority of The Incredible Hulk series and the recent Blade, and you can imagine how terrified I was that X-Men simply wasn't going to cut it.I mean, bring in the biggest overall franchise Marvel has had in the last 20 years, throw in ""that guy from Star Trek"", ""that guy from Apt Pupil"" and several supermodels, and everything points to an expensive disaster that would kill the credibility of what used to be a really good comic book. Granted, I'm talking 15-20 years ago, but I am, after all, at least that old, and it was, after all, really that good for a while.I was worried, to say the least.But then, I noticed who was directing.  Bryan Singer most assuredly did not screw up with The Usual Suspects.  Not a bad pedigree, that.  Also, one of the aforementioned supermodels, Famke Janssen, proved she can actually act a while back when she bloody well held her own against that very same guy from Star Trek -- IN Star Trek, no less.  She also added a great deal to GoldenEye, and I'm not just talking about visuals, either.""Onotopp?""""Onotopp.""Sorry -- where was I?  Oh, yes.  Then there's this whole Hugh Jackman guy. Never heard of him, and he gets to play what is potentially the pivotal role in the (contracted) trilogy?  Granted, I was pulling for Robin Williams or Gary Sinise, but that just goes to show what an idiot I can be when I put my mind to it.  So Wolverine was a big question mark.I went to see it the Friday night it opened.  You know what? It Does Not Suck.  Not only does it Not Suck, but it's actually Pretty Good.Remember, I'm from Minnesota.  Up here, winning the lottery is considered ""Pretty Good"", too.You know what?  It was such a solid Pretty Good that I went back on Saturday and paid to see it again, this time with my friends. They came out saying the same thing -- ""You know what?  That Did Not Suck.  In fact, It was Pretty Good"".This, of course, led to the many details underlying the concept of Pretty Goodness, including Hugh Jackman's absolute nailing of his part, the rest of the cast doing their jobs and then some without trying to take over, and, most of all, Bryan Singer showing that rarest of qualities in a Hollywood director, restraint.  Not one shot stood out as being bigger/badder/bloodier than it needed to be, and that is saying something these days.Bottom line -- go see it.  Comic book movies are very rarely this good, and one like this deserves to make enough money so that we might actually SEE the other two for which the cast has been contracted.If we're lucky, we'll get Bryan Singer back, too.IMDB rating = 9",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
failed to capture the heart of a X-Men Story,"X-Men almost did it.  It started out perfectly, but then it failed to reach what it needed to reach for fans and non-fans.  Most likely because it was thinking more about making sequels then making the best first X-Men movie that could be made.I've been a fan of the comic book for awhile and I know of the potential great X-Men story telling that, if done right, can even be considered for oscars and golden globes.  The potential was not reached in X-Men the movie. What did not work especially was Magneto's plan to turn the world leaders into mutants.  It was uncharacteristic for the type of character who whole heartedly hates humans (why would you invest your powers in people you hate?).  From a X-Men fan's point of view it's just something Magneto wouldn't do... from a non-fan view point, it's just stupid.  And the fact the the philosophies of both Xavier and Magneto wasn't heavily explored upon cause a lack of great dialogue.  As great as it was to hear Wolverine call Cyclops a ""D*ck,""  I would much more rather hear a vocal debate on the two view points, then leading to physical confrontations with emotional content. The fighting in X-Men was there for little reason but to have an action sequence.  More human interactions would help exploring the different issues X-Men the movie should've addressed.  Instead the movie focuses mostly on joining the team, introducing characters and powers.  Although that's all good, it doesn't pay off in the end because of Magneto's stupid plan, and lack of purpose.The X-Men, more than it is about really cool characters, is about prejudice and finding out what is right and wrong by stepping in other people's shoes. In the human shoes, we can easily relate because we don't understand mutants and are afraid that these mutants will be like Magneto and want us dead.  As Magneto, we understand his anger because humans hate mutants, they want mutants dead so why not kill them first.  In Xavier's shoes however, there's the hope that we can all live in peace.  That yes, they might want us dead, but we shouldn't have to kill them first in order to stop them from wanting to kill us, we should invest our time in trying to get them to understand.  And that's why the X-Men are the heroes.  However, X-Men the movie is too much just about cool characters, when it needed to be more about great story telling.Now that the characters are introduced, let's hope the sequel will reach the potential a X-Men story can become.****** out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Zowie! They did it!,"When I first heard that there was to be a full length feature film of The X-men, I was skeptical.  When I read the cast list, and saw only 1 name I recognized (Patrick Stewart), I was more skeptical still.  But... my whole family loved this movie.  It had villains and heroes, and loyalty, and just a tinge of love and romance on the edges.  My husband usually doesn't like ""kiddie"" adventure shows, but he liked this one, and said it had great special effects.  The scenes between Wolverine and Rogue were my personal favorites, because I like to see the gentle side of a rough character exposed.  But there were plenty of other good parts, and the casting was very good.  My husband also said that Hugh Jackman was really too young to have been cast as Wolverine, and strictly speaking, that may be so.  But he ""did what he does"" pretty enough that it stole my heart, and that's not an easy thing for an actor to do in these days of ""pretty boys"" like Brad Pitt and Leonardo Di Caprio.

Very good... almost great in places...,"As far as comic book adaptations go, there seem to be two kinds of film: the good ones (Tim Burton's Batmans) and the hideously bad ones (Superman IV, Batman Returns, Batman Forever etc). The 2000 adaptation of X-Men belongs in the former category, thanks to some excellent casting and a well thought-out story.People have criticised the film as deviating too much from the official X-Men canon. I kind of suspect these people are the same ""geniuses"" who levelled the same criticism at Batman, so I will run the following question by you all: suppose that you had some kind of trait that made you extremely different from the rest of the populace. Would you be running around in multi-coloured spandex, parading around like a hero, or would you be having deep crises about how you react to other people's fear. As a sufferer of a present-day equivalent of the mutations shown in this film, I know what my answer is.The modification of the story to show Rogue as a young woman who has only just discovered that everyone she touches is severely wounded by it was a master stroke. Not only was it great to see how human the mutants really are (more so than the normies in this film, as a matter of fact), but casting a delicate, intelligent young woman like Anna Paquin in the role was a perfect capitalisation on the writing. Coupling this with the way Wolverine is shown as the result of a horrid military experiement who is now just trying to survive as best he can was a brilliant idea, too. Hugh Jackman was a perfect choice for the role. As a man whose past combines pieces of these two characters' histories in a more figurative sense, I found these two actors utterly believeable in all respects.The only thing wrong with the movie, in my view, is that the think tank which made these excellent moves with the good guys ran out of steam when the bad guys were written. Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth just don't have the same level of character development allocated to them as Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops, and Storm. Mystique gets one line in the whole film (the rest are her pretending to be someone else), and Toad is merely there to provide excuses for gratuitous special effects shots. Capping that off is the fact that Magneto is shown as a survivor of the holocaust who takes on the same kind of attitude as the Nazis. Granted, he is being somewhat provoked by the section of humanity that is afraid of mutants, but once again my experience as part of a small percentile of the populace that has had outright lies told about it by the rest tells me that more motivation would have been required for Magneto to become so like his real enemy.Aside from the uneven development of the characters, however, this is another near-great modern adaptation of a comic book. It works on numerous levels and is extremely pleasant to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good,"I m not a fan of X-Men but I did enjoy this film. It was pretty good and VERY entertaining.

"Not bad, but the top 250?  Surely not.","Hmmm, I haven't been hanging around this site much lately, but I must admit some surprise at how highly this film is rated.  I mean, I thought I'd have a higher opinion of it than most people because I used to read the comic book (which probably gives me a slight prejudice on the matter).  Well, anyway, that said...X-Men is not a bad film, but man, they could have done a lot more with it. I mean, here you have a movie that's basically guaranteed a profit, yet it's only a little longer than an hour and a half.  I mean, there's not much character development here - for the most part at least; Wolverine and Rogue fans are in luck.  However, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (as Mystique) has one line and Ray Park (as Toad) has two.  Couldn't they do better than that?  And Tyler Mane (Sabretooth) doesn't speak much either.  In fact, outside of Wolverine and Rogue, Professor Xavier and Magneto are the only characters with much of a personality (flat as they might be), and yet Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen seem underused in the parts (especially Stewart).  By the way, don't think that means there's lots of action because there isn't.Which isn't to say that I didn't like the film.  What action scenes it has are fairly good and the plot is passable enough.  There simply didn't seem to be much to X-Men.  When it ends, you feel like you've watched the first episode of a new TV series.  And you have, basically, because you can pretty safely bet they'll be at least one sequel.  7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the best comic book adaption ever made!,"exceptional!! X-Men is perhaps one of the best comic book adaption's ever made It has the style and humor the comic did, plus a little more just for your entertainment. X-men is a very well made, and exceptionally well acted film that will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. And you will also get a good dose of humor too, this film delivers what most comic book films don't, a sturdy well made film that allot of recent comic book films have followed. Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Spider Man, the Fantastic Four. They all follow the example that X-men set up, it's a film that you can look back twenty years from now and still call it the best. It doesn't matter how old you are, or if you even read the comic books or watch the original animated show. X-men is the movie that you'll want to see over and over again.

"Not great, but fun.","X-Men (2000) X-Men is an entertaining flick. This is not you typical ""comic book"" flick. X-Men is an energy romp that also sends a message. The X-Men, led by Charles Xavier stand to fight against the Brotherhood led by Magneto to save mankind, despite being oppressed by normal humans. The X-Men want to allow humans to understand that this is mere evolution and that mutants despite the obvious powers are no different than humans and were born humans. The Brotherhood wish to wipe out the humans who believe that humans will never understand and will always oppress mutants.The performances are nearly great. Hugh Jackman nailed Wolverine. From the look all the way down to the personality. As Logan, who has no idea who he is, has a rough personality hiding the fact that he is alone. Another great performance is Patrick Stewart as Professor X. He acts with great conviction. Solid casting here.There are drawbacks also. Halle Berry camps it up. Not the best performance here. Not terrible but campy. Another drawback is the lack of character development for X-Men: Storm and Cyclops. Cyclops is the leader with storm in second in command. A little back story would be nice.A few more drawbacks: The Brotherhood. The only one who actually has a character is Magneto. Toad has no lines, Sabertooth barely says anything same with Mystique. As if all except Magneto are just pawns. A little background would be great.Despite that, The movie is entertaining. A group of heroes who fight for the world despite being oppressed. Humans fear what they do not understand.The Last Word: A fun movie. X-Men is filled with a solid plot, lots of energy and stylish battles. Lack of character development brought that rating down a few notches. I would like to know more about the heroes and villains. Makes them interesting. Otherwise they seem like nothing more than pawns.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
why did they make this movie anyway?,"i have seen lots and lots of bad movies in my short life (i'm 16) but this is surely one of the worst. everything in this picture is out of order. the plot is totally idiotic and it's not even original. when i was younger watched the tv series from time to time and they were at least interesting. but this movie seems it wasn't based on the tv serie but on a trash can. i have seen the movie almost two years ago, so i don't remember exactly what the plot was (i only remember it was awful), i only remember that here we have wolverine as the lead character and that we learn how he got into the academy of mutant (or whatever it was).performances are indeed bad. hugh jackman gaves a ridiculous and boring performance as wolveine, and the others such as halle berry, anna paquin and james marsden. ian mckellen dissapointed me , he did very good movies (like ""the lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring"" that was excellent compared to the sequel ""TTT"" that sucks, and he also did ""gods and monsters"") i don't know why he is so bad in this one. another dissapointment was famke janssen, who was excellent in ""goldeneye"" and good in ""rounders"", here she's plain bad.the most irracional thing for me is that the guy who directed one of my favorite movie (""the usual suspects"") has directed this crap, and oh no !!!!!!!!! he has also directed the sequel of this so-called movie. yucks!!!!!!.good stunts and the ok performance of patrick stewart can't make up for all it's flaws. i warn you: don't see this movie, in fact try to avoid any contact with it. 1/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

X-traordinary!,"First off, I'll apologize right now for the cheesy summary line.  I couldn't help myself :)As for the movie, I was quite impressed with what, in my humble opinion, has to be the best comic book adaptation yet.  Many fans of the comics were understandably worried about this movie.  After all, we've waited a long time through rumours of it's production, stories about setbacks, even the occasional rumour that the attempt was being cancelled altogether (why does it seem so difficult to make a movie of a Stan Lee comic while DC comics are turning into movies left right and center?).However, after seeing the first teaser trailers several months ago, the X-citement (sorry again) began to build.  Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier? Ian McKellan as Magneto?  How can you go wrong with that?After seeing the movie, I was very impressed.  After all, it's often difficult to adapt such larger-than-life comic book heroes and their trials and tribulations to the big screen.  In comics and cartoons you can get away with much more, in the movies it seems to be much more difficult to suspend disbelief and yet retain the flavour of the comic.  The movie did an admirable job by taking one of the older stories of the X-Men's fight against Senator Kelly's attempted pogrom against mutants and adapting it to reflect today's current woes of racism and prejudice.The casting was terrific, from the aforementioned Stewart and McKellan roles to that of newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  He was spot-on as the surly, short-tempered maverick of the X-Men and he even looked the part, although with those sideburns, almost anyone can look the part.  We even got a look at how Magneto came to be and why he'd be so twisted by the plight of mutants.  It's a shame we couldn't see more character development for the other X-Men, but it's difficult to do when you've only got 2 hours to work with when the comic had several years to develop the history of these people.  Perhaps the inevitable sequels will give us a better glimpse at how each X-Man came to be.In all, I found the movie to be very enjoyable, I was even able to ignore for a little while the fact that it was shown in what has to be Prince George's worst theatre, worn-out seats, stained screens, overly salty popcorn, and an outdated sound system.If you're a fan of the X-Men, go see it (although, I don't really have to tell you that do I?), if you're not a fan, you just may become one afterwards.  I'm already looking forward to a sequel where we may meet some of the other X-Men, Hank McCoy (The Beast), Gambit, Morph, maybe even a cameo from Spidey himself.  That is unless the Spiderman movie gets a shot in the arm from this release and swings its way into the theatres a little sooner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Strangers to the Comic Book series (as I am) were left with the feeling of trying to catch up all through the film(sic). By the time Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops, and Storm all met, I decided that perhaps I hadn't wasted my money on the DVD. This, with the addition of perhaps 10-15 minutes of more material, plus a less DARK look would have made this an outstanding movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty darn tasty ... but too short,"This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, if a bit too short.  Hugh Jackman was excellent as Wolverine, as everyone else has noticed, but I was most impressed with Sir Ian McKellen as Magneto.  LOTR fans who are anxious to see his portrayal of Gandalf must be encouraged.Elsewhere, I thought Marsden was channelling the spirit of Cary Elwes, which isn't necessarily a bad thing (e.g., The Princess Bride).  Dr. Jean Grey (I don't want to embarrass myself by misspelling Ms. Famke's last name) was fine, on many different levels, and I was impressed by Anna Paquin.  She is quite a young actress.Patrick Stewart was terrific, as always, and I think he and Sir Ian lent this film its gravitas.The script was efficient, and the director did a fine job of meshing the live action with the pretty good special effects.  Here's hoping that the next time, the studio green lights a bigger budget for a longer film and more eye-popping SFX.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The evolution of the superhero movie begins,"If there's anything 90s movies did wrong, it's that they botched the superhero genre, namely with the slew of bad Batman sequels. ""X-Men,"" however, closes out the 20th century with hope that between special effects and renewed focus on characters, the genre is on the way up.While 2002's ""Spider-Man"" was the film that really transformed the genre by use of the origin story, ""X-Men"" wasn't far off with its choice to tell the story with emphasis on a few of the characters. A comic book like ""X-Men,"" where there are multiple heroes on a team instead of one masked crusader, could have been adopted horribly with too many different characters trying to share the spotlight.Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"") picks fan favorite Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as the focus and a vehicle by which to introduce the viewer to the X-Men world. He also chooses Rogue (Anna Paquin) to demonstrate that teenage feeling of being different and hiding from the world that makes X-Men such a human story. Lastly, he develops only Magneto (Ian McKellen) of all the villains to set the stage for the greater conflict between humans and mutants that will carry over into the sequels. The other mutants are used for visual fluff, to further the story, or to please comic fans. While you'd like to see all the mutants get attention, this is a concession Singer knows he must make to avoid his film crashing and burning.The film's weak point is the general plot or evil scheme. While the movie is mostly based around scenes that are revealing of character and show how each mutant deals with his or her abilities, this element of the film remains ""take-over-the-world"" focused. With a bill on the verge of being passed that could force all mutants to register with the government, Magneto and the Brotherhood of Mutants (villains Sabertooth, Toad and the shape-shifting Mystique) plot to launch a radiation attack on a UN assembly in New York that would turn all the world's leaders into mutants. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his X-Men plan to stop them, believing peaceful cooperation with humans is the only way to get things done.There's not a ton of action in the film. The fight scenes are short and far from exhilarating. Instead, ""X-Men"" hopes that a few scant special effects and mutants demonstrating their powers will be enough to entertain you. It does, but not in an exciting way. This is not a full- throttle blockbuster, it's a movie about characters with special abilities that affect their lives.Singer does a great job bringing this franchise to the screen. While moviegoers love great action, it's nice to see a superhero film handled with sensitivity and being about what makes the X-Men so likable, not simply about bringing them to life and having them fight each other. That's where his camera-work, like when Rogue notices Wolverine's knuckles on the steering wheel and asks him if it hurts, makes an impact. His goal is to get you in touch with the characters--the stylish suits are secondary.While you'd like to see characters like Halle Berry's Storm or James Marsden's Cyclops be more than just a suit with a special power, the specific character focus is still good enough. This movie essentially prioritizes characters and good storytelling over the action number of villains that Hollywood once thought was the most important aspect. That alone is something superhero movie fans can't ever be too thankful for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A pleasant surprise,"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  I'd seen all the hype, and despite the abysmal track record of comics-based movies, I had allowed myself to get excited about the movie.

A second look: X-MEN.,"My Take: Forgettble but a lot of fun.I'm not a fan of the Marvel Comics series. Suffice to say I wasn't really wild with the big-budget big-screen series. I've seen all of them on the big-screen and enjoyed them (especially X2), and I've seen the repeatedly on television, but I didn't have much to talk about them. Their great entertainment but little else. Still, after seeing the original X-MEN a few nights ago, my original opinion has been improved. While I still won't have anything to talk about it the next day, I'm giving it more credit than the one i gave it.I enjoyed the special effects and the action the first time, but looking back, there's actually much more going for it. The characters were given enough depth. And that director Bryan Singer wasn't exactly the biggest fanboy of the comic book series makes his job in X-MEN much more impressive. Performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and a young Anna Paquin are great, which is much to say considering that there's a lot of things going on with the action and effects. I may not be wild about it but, for what its worth, X-MEN is still fine entertainment.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Erases the nightmare of Batman and Robin,"Comic book movies in Hollywood generally mean: nice guys with superpowers versus evil guys with superpowers, lots of special effects and overdone settings and some very one-dimensional characters. Well, X-Men changes all that. At last Hollywood has dared to deliver a comic book film with depth and some real issues to discuss. And  we actually have a villain with layers and complexity, who could be any one of us who has been persecuted and decided to strike back.The story tells of children born with genetic mutations and how they learn to cope with their abilities once they grow up and society turns against them. Some decide to use their powers for beneficial means, others decide to live alone, eking out an existence and raising a finger to those who scorn them, and some decide to hit back against prejudice and persecution. The conflict is between the mutants themselves ¬ñ in particular Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), a telepath who has established a school for mutant children ¬ñ he calls them ¬ëgifted', and Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Nazi victim who wages war against anti-mutant sentiment. Both are fighting for the same cause ¬ñ acceptance of mutations ¬ñ but both take different paths and end up on opposite sides.Into this conflict is drawn Logan (Hugh Jackman) an angry savage loner with some interesting physical mutations and a past he can only remember in nightmares. He joins up with Rogue (Anna Paquin) a teenage runaway who finds her touch drains the life from her boyfriends. They become crucial pawns in the chess battle between Xavier's and Magneto's opposing teams of mutants.What I like about the film is that it has faith in its universe and stands up for the premise and the characters it portrays.  There are no gimmicky features to distract you from the story. Colours are muted and realistic ¬ñ no garish costumes or noirish black shadows and Gothic settings. The film focuses on its characters and lets them stand on their own. No hokey villains. Magneto is just a man with a different agenda, and his solution to anti-mutant sentiment actually makes you think a bit. Remember the Romans and the Christians?Overall this is a really good film that can match it with the best of 2000 releases. As a comic book film it's different and Bryan Singer (director) has created something new which raises the bar for others to follow. The casting is excellent as are the performances, the standouts being McKellen and Jackman, whose Logan/Wolverine is complex and brilliantly portrayed.The script is very good and the dialogue is superb. There are some very funny lines. The characters get laughs from the lines, not from their costumes or their over-the-top mannerisms. The effects are excellent but the film does not rely on them, just uses them when the story demands it. The mutants' powers really blow you away though.It's well paced although a little short, but a good introduction to the X-Universe for those who don't know it. If you've never heard of X-Men you will still enjoy and follow the film's storyline. If you're a long X-fan or comic fan, well this is the movie you've been waiting for. Hats off to everybody involved.The only disappointment is the score. It's pretty average.Overall 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The basic premise is mutant humans who each possess unique and incredible powers are in a struggle to save themselves and regular humans (who are threatened by and afraid of the mutants) from evil mutants.

Would be better as a TV series.,"X-Men was entertaining, yes. But the one thing that was claimed made it into more than the average comic adaptation was the character development that, in my opinion, doesn't exist. There are simply too many potentially interesting characters here to explore them all in 95 minutes. Hence, except for Hugh Jackman's and Anna Paquin's characters, all others get short shrift.As opposed to many other (made from comic) movies, the characters here leave you stunningly detached. No wonder- with this little time, one might say. But that also seemed to be the case with the actors. None of them seems to take great interest in differentiating their roles through their portrayal. But how could they? The narrative squanders aimlessly, the dialogue is probably as bad as it gets, and a little irony towards the material (as displayed in the Superman features) would have gone a long way towards preventing ""X-Men"" from total cheesiness. Well, it's not cheesy throughout, mind you, but at least once too often.Besides, as I expected, the film is nowhere near as clever or important as it has often been claimed: the message of tolerance is a good one as a concept, but because of the script (which is less than stellar, I might add. Couldn't Christopher McQuarrie have done it?) and foremost the sheer haste with which Bryan Singer sweeps through the story and past any REAL drama, the film ultimately sabotages its own point. The heroes are heroes. The villains are villains. Good is good. Bad is bad. But please, live together peacefully! Any shades of gray get lost somewhere between the ten or so main characters. Pity. This really could have had a point to make.That said, I must, however, admit, that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. As popcorn entertainment, it's great, and certainly more worthwhile than any of the latest Bruckheimer action flicks. And I'd personally embrace any movie featuring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Anna Paquin altogether. But somehow, it all left me a bit disappointed considering the hype about how different from other comic adaptations this was supposed to be. As a result, X-Men might have been a lot better as a TV series pilot. With that cast, those FX, and that huge pool of characters and story possibilities, don't you think it'd do great on a weekly basis? I sure do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This Movie Is Intended For X Men Fans,"I enjoy certain comic book characters on film, notably the Batman Begins film because I like the way it comes close to being realistic.

I knew the characters had powers due to genetic mutations and they lived in a school for such 'mutants' but not much else.To me, there were too many characters and the story was fairly typical and what you would expect. There wasn't any elements of this film that made me say ""WOW""! The story was predictable.If you are a fan of the X Men comic books or if you like a good popcorn movie, you will probably enjoy this.

"Been there, done that...","It was no doubt daunting to the makers of ""X-Men"" that there were hundreds of thousands of X-MEN fanatics who were as likely to vilify it's latest incarnation as embrace it. Fans of the comic book need not have worried; this flick will not disappoint. But those countless millions who don't know an X-man from a Y-chromosome may feel otherwise. For all its earnestness and technical competence, ""X-Men"" is a classic case of cinematic 'deja vu'. Whatever vivacity Tim Burton was able to inject into 1989's wildly popular ""Batman"" has long since dissipated--witness the disappointing reception to its last sequel and the recently cancelled resurrection of the ""Superman"" franchise. ""X-Men"" does little, if anything, to raise the bar for the genre--it's little more than a 'good mutants versus bad mutants' tale with a little quasi-racism thrown in for flavor. Plus, too little is made of the oppression suffered by mutants in a mortal's world, just as too little is made of the too-few characters in this plotline. Yet even after apparently distilling the ""X-Men"" pantheon of mutants into a handful of characters for the movie version, scant use is made of the many serviceable actors hired. It's seems ironic to see so much one-dimensionality in a movie based on a minimally two-dimensional source. But the in-bred success of ""X-Men"" will no doubt beg a sequel, not to mention inspiring even more comic-borne adaptations. Come to think of it, ""Spider-Man"" starts production this Fall.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men,"""Marie"" (aka ""Rogue"" - Anna Paquin) really does know how to suck the joy out of the relationship with her boyfriend, so runs away and hooks up with ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman). Both of them are on the radar of the evil ""Magneto"" (Sir Ian McKellen) so the benign ""Dr. Xavier"" (Patrick Stewart) dispatches ""Storm"" (Halle Berry) and ""Cyclops"" (James Marsden) to fetch them back to his school for the gifted. Here, he is able to train these powerful mutants so they are prepared to take on the megalomanic baddie. ""Magneto"", in turn, is intent on dealing once and for all with humanity, and it's intolerance of the whole of mutant-kind. This is very much an establishing film for a series yet to come. The backstories and identities are built up so we understand who is who, and why they are behaving as they do - and that includes the nervous humans led by ""Sen. Kelly"" (Bruce Davison). I'm not sure if it's search for mass appeal (it's rated 12) compromised it too much, but for the most part this is all just a rather procedural excuse for some long combat scenes and some special effects based around some handsome people in the cast. To be fair, there are a few fun rivalry scenes between Jackman and Marsden (though luckily no yellow spandex) but Stewart is just ""Picard"" in a wheelchair and though Sir Ian offers a more substantial effort as ""Magneto"", even he doesn't really have much by way of decent dialogue to get his teeth into. Indeed, the writing is really pretty lame throughout. It is a good film to watch, especially on a big screen, but let's hope the series storylines mature a bit for the next one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic!!  Very true to Marvel's characters!,"A definite must for those who like movies with big, brash heroes with foibles.

A GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!,When i first went to see this movie i knew lots about the X-men and i thought that the movie would ruin it. i found out that i was wrong.

Honest entertainment,"It is a good thing when you don't walk disappointed from the theater. I guess X-Men succeeds at this, giving the audience thrill, visual/sound effects and beautiful people (this applies much more to the male audience, having cast Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). At no point it underestimates the viewer's intelligence, keeping a somewhat coherent plot for such a genre. The ""unbelievability"" factor is not that high. Pure entertainment which doesn't require a complete cerebral turn-off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hmm...,"This isn't exactly my type of film, but I thought I'd watch it anyway.I thought it was an alright film, I don't want to use the word 'cheesy' but... a few of the bits got me thinking... ""O-kay then..."". I must add I thought all the acting was good, Jackman was good, better than Van Helsing, Stewart and McKellan are both good as the two leaders, and the rest behind them.The standout thing I'll remember from the film was a great performance by Anna Paquin. I thought she reminded me of someone, but turns out I haven't seen any of her other films... but she was good.A 5/10 for me I'm afraid... but 9/10 for Anna!Dave",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Solid film, but needed more action.","The action sequences, particularly those involving Wolverine, could have benefitted greatly from a director and choreographer more focused on making those scenes shine.

X-Men is X-cellent!,"Stan Lee's adaptation of the famous comic book series has come to life in bigger ways than ever imagine. Throughout the years, the X-Men, like any of the Marvel comics have touched people in a way that we recognized: Discrimination. As mutants, they are discriminated for who they are without people giving them a chance to live in society.The film starts in Poland of 1942, the beginning of the holocaust where as many of the Jews are being sentenced to live in concentration camps to die, a young boy by the name of Eric discovers that he can control metallic objects with his own hands as he tries to reunite with his parents but after years of being torture and escaping the holocaust, he grows up to be Magneto (an older Eric played by Ian McKellan) who wants to tell his old friend and rival Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) that he wants to destroy mankind after what humanity has down to him and those of generations.Later on through the film fans are introduced through the following characters: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); Storm (Halle Berry); Cyclops (James Marsden); Jean Gray (Famke Janssen); Rogue (Anna Paquin); Sabertooth (Tyler Mane); Mystique (Rebecca Rojimn Stamos); and Todd (Ray Park).The film itself plays true to the comic book where mutants are fighting to survive in a world of prejudice and anger. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the head of Westchester Academy, a school for the gifted and talented, but a school for the young who have special mutant powers; from a girl who can walk through walls, a boy who can manipulate with fire, and another student who can turn objects into ice. His former students (Storm, Cyclops and Jean Gray) assist Professor Xavier in teaching those kids who can't afford to be taught by normal people. Professor Xavier also takes in a new student, Rogue (Paquin) who was abandoned and taken in by Wolverine (newcomer Hugh Jackman) who was attacked by one of Magneto's own mutant named Sabertooth (Mane). Yet, Xavier makes a promise to Wolverine that he will do whatever it can to find out what Magneto wants with him.Magneto (McKellan) has his own team called ""The Brotherhood"" consisting of evil mutants (Mystique, Toad and Sabertooth) where he wants to kill all those who treated humanity evil, especially Sen. Kelly (Bruce Davidson) who wants to run the registration on mutants where they would be targeted down to death.The film itself is incredible, the cast is hot, and I was glad to see that somebody brought the idea of X-Men to live and with all of the actors being true to the characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Could have been great, but instead was OK.","As the movie began, I thought ""oh good, they're keeping the more serious tone of the X-men instead of sinking to the just say a cool one-liner and then blow something up action flick.""  However, the intelligent villains and emotional depth of the characters quickly gave way to ""Hasta la vista, Baby"".  The plot quickly started to rely on intelligent characters suddenly acting stupid.  Imagine something on par with Mystery Men, only this wasn't a comedy.  The action sequences had some brilliant moments (Wolverine vs. Mystique), but the bulk of them just didn't convey the pace and intensity of super-heros battling super-villains.  The majority of the combat sequences were just how many times can someone get sent flying (obviously on a digitally removed wire) through a wall.  You get hit by lightning... fly through a wall, you get blasted by cyclops' eye beams... fly through a wall. Maybe I've just seen too many good combat sequences in Kung-Fu movies, but I was left less than impressed by the directing during most of the fight sequences.  On top of the statue of Liberty there's about 1-2 seconds in a fight sequence where Wolverine and Sabertooth are both obscured by Lady Liberty's crown!  I left the theater feeling like this movie came so close, but fell short so many times.  If you're going to theater, see something else and wait for this to come out on video.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Embodies the spirit of the comics almost perfectly.,"I gotta give my props to Brian Singer. Man, what a fantastic job he did in bringing my favorite mutant superhero team to the big screen. The X-men comics have decades of established treasured mythology and this film does it justice almost perfectly. Some story elements have been altered here and there but it never undermined the finished product significantly as to throw off die-hard fans, although I was disappointed that Gambit wasn't included. But the film superbly makes up for that with action, special effects (and what MARVELOUS EFFECTS they are!!!) and a plot that's intellectually stimulating actually. It's a shame that most action films today don't have that kind of pizazz and gravitas to keep it from being mindlessly entertaining. Not so here as X-Men challenges its viewers to ponder the nature of acceptance , fear, and prejudice. My one main complaint is that the villains such as Sabertooth wasn't fleshed out more and similar to his vicious comic book counterpart. I will purchase the director's cut for any bells and whistles not in the theatrical cut but for the most part ""X-Men"" is an exciting and exhilarating experience with something more beneath the surface even more so than action films today and I can say with all authority it embodies the spirit of the comics nearly spot on.Great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as bad as I thought it would be.......,"I was dragging my feet, rolling my eyes, and dreading this movie--my friends were pushing me into the theater.  And, surprisingly, it was quite enjoyable.Patrick Stewart is, of course, the only possible choice for Xavier.  Even though his part is comparatively small, he still commands every moment he's on the screen.  His scenes against Ian McKellan were absolutely brilliant.Hugh Jackman was excellent as Wolverine, but WAY TOO TALL!!!!  Wolvie is always supposed to be the LITTLE psycho!!!  Famke Janssen was surprisingly good as Jean Grey, but underused.  James Marsden was adequate but bland as Cyclops.  Anna Paquin was quite nice as Rogue.  But Halle Berry......Please, Goddess, if you love me, get Thandie Newton or Vanessa Williams in the role next time.  Berry was terrible.  Awful, horrible, ugsome.I was struck by how faithful the characterizations were.  Wolverine and Cyclops butted heads quite a bit during Logan's early days with the team, and the Cyclops-Jean-Wolverine triangle was a major part of it.  Some other things, however, didn't work.  The Toad, for example, was way more powerful in this flick than he should have been.  And why didn't we get a taste of Storm's claustrophobia in the elevator (granted, it saved us watching Berry try to act).All in all, a decent flick.  I might actually see the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best movie you will see this year,"The X-men  is a movie that will please both Comic readers and contemporary audiences alike. At first i had my doubts like the millions of other fans worldwide, over things that have been discussed over and again [The dark costumes being the major player in this]. This, quite simply is probably down to the fact that most people not too fondly remember Batman and Robin [1997], and dont want to see a similar movie. Well, if you havent seen the X-men yet, i can tell you to rest assured this movie topples the entire Batman franchise tenfold. I went to see the movie at a special preview 17/8/00, and as soon as i entered the cinema i knew the movie was going to be a hit. We had previously been refused access to a different cinema because it had sold out on X-men tickets. We got the last two at this cinema and it was a huge relief. As i looked around i saw what i believed to be a non X-men audience. Normal people wanting a slice of something different, and i didn't see one disappointed sole. Everyone loved it. Cheered the heroes and booed the villains. At the end everyone stood up and applauded, and i felt proud. At last a Comic Book movie had delivered, at last i was satisfied. The whole thing looks slick and fantastic. Special Effects can sometimes swamp a movie, but these endeared it. The SFX were eye popping from the word Go, and the whole cinema was thrilled. In the three main characters in Professor X, Magneto and Wolverine, we are treated to spot on characterization and acting. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan were relishing there chances and done superbly. Hugh Jackman, well, after seeing him i couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Surely a good candidate for the role of James Bond when Pierce Brosnan hand up his holsten? Jackman IS Wolverine. Everything from his caring for Rogue [excellently played by Anna Paquin] to his at odds nature with Cyclops, Marvel Girl and Storm [again a top notch cast] is how the comics make it fell. Bryan Singer gets it right with his direction. And the Music was wonderfull too. In Michael Kamen there is surely one of the most under-rated American composers. O.K. there isnt a theme tune but were is the need for one with all the special effects, good acting and marvellous action? Mr Kamen does well and deserves special praise. So go see this, you will LOVE it. Before this, i used to think wouldn't it have been great to have seen Star Wars when it first came out? It must have been special. Well now i know what it was like because i have seen X-men.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You gotta see this!,"I give this film a 10! It had everything.  Most of the characters were developed enough for you to understand what was going on even if you have never read the comics or watched the animated series.  The best parts for me were the funny exchanges between the characters Cyclops and Wolverine.  I also thought it was wonderful that characters were chosen that looked somewhat like the comic book characters (e.g. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm, etc.)Most of all, the special effects were out of this world.

"Could Have Been Better, But Enjoyable None The Less","At first, I did not really care for this film because it was not true to the comic book story. But an old friend of mine gave me some advice: ""Just take it as a story from a different point of view."" Once I did that I really found this movie to be quite enjoyable.The overall story is probably a little sub par. In comparison to ""X2"" and ""The Last Stand"" it is by far the weakest of the three.Where there are now four X-Men titles out, we are accustom to the actors in the roles that they play, but when this originally came out I was astounded at the near spot-on job that they did with the cast. From Wolverine to Professor X to Magneto, I feel as though they did a wonderful job getting the characters to look like who they are supposed to be. And then there are new renditions such and the visually interesting Mystique.However, that being said, I feel that they really missed the boat on Sabertooth, and to a lesser extent, Rogue. There could have been better actors to play each part and the character of Sabertooth could have definitely been more interesting. On a side note, they didn't get it right in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" either.The action was cool and had they not had to spend time with character introductions they might have had more time to develop a better story, but for what it is it's a good movie to see to get you amped up for the superior sequels that follow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A really solid start to the Fox X-Men franchise.,"While Spider-Man (2002) was more popular, it cannot be denied that this movie deserves credit for opening floodgates for the possibilities of live-action Marvel in cinema.The cold open of Erik in the Holocaust shows how real and serious Marvel can be. This transitions straight to Rouge's terror at nearly killing her boyfriend, followed by Jean arguing with senators over the danger of mutants.These scenes immediately and fantastically convey the core concepts of this film and the idea of mutants.Admittedly, the movie's own conflict is rather basic for the series, but what makes it interesting is simply being a part of the introduction of the X-Men. They are adapted great. A big part of this is thanks to the unbelievably spot-on casting. Patrick Stewart, Ian McClellan, and Hugh Jackman are still contenders for the best comic character castings of all time.First Class fleshes it out more, but we get some epic scenes here between Xavier and Magneto that showcase their rich history. And whether you watch in the timeline or release order, this is the first true introduction to just how awesome Jackman's Wolverine is. There's a reason nearly the whole franchise is about him. It's beautiful how through his relationship with Rouge they show the heart behind his cold persona. My favorite part of the movie.Sadly, the rest of the X-Men and villains are really just here for the fights. Storm and Jean don't have much of a story, Cyclops has a good rivalry with Logan but that's it, and Sabretooth and Toad aren't fleshed out at all. Even Mystique doesn't get much here compared to her awesome arc in First Class.This is all kinda understandable when you consider this was just the start of the franchise. Most of what holds this movie back comes from its age. I don't think this is completely fair to judge it on. Still, the effects are pretty awful and it makes a lot of the aforementioned fight scenes come off goofy. It even makes part of the movie hard to take seriously, creating a tonal conflict between the action and the plot.We still get some awesome scenes like Magneto turning the guns on the cops and Logan's introduction. The movie also reeks of the wacky early 2000s comic book movie feel - complete with making fun of the source material. Honestly, it's mostly harmless, and considering big Marvel films were unheard of at the time, this movie's issues are easier to forgive.At the very least, X-Men is to thank for putting Marvel on track to be as popular as it is today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid comic adaptation; Jackman steals the show,"The film that brought comic book adaptations back into the Hollywood forefront, director Bryan Singer's X-MEN works for many reasons, but mainly because Singer and company take the entire premise and characters with the utmost seriousness and respect. This film does not exist merely to wow audiences with effects and set-piece or bombard them with zinging one-liners (both of which are present, of course), but Singer also wants to elicit an emotional response form his viewers, and he succeeds. Although Singer perhaps crams too many characters into a film with such a short runtime (which leaves the movie a bit top-heavy), he has effectively laid the groundwork for a likable assortment of characters. This is also aided, of course, by the terrific cast that Singer has tapped.The real casting ace is then-unknown Australian actor Hugh Jackman, who delivers a fierce and emotive performance that justifiably turned him into a major Hollywood star. When asked if his metallic claws hurt when they tear through the knuckles of his hands, Jackman replies, ""Every time,"" and his somber delivery perfectly captures all of the physical and psychological pain that comes from being different. Singer also pulls memorable work from Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, although it must be pointed out that both Anna Paquin and Halle Berry are terrible, inflicting completely unlistenable attempts at character accents upon us. The film has so many characters and set-ups that the whole picture is a bit top-heavy, however, X-MEN is still one of the few film blockbusters of the 21st century to dig below surface-level aesthetics, and it proved that audiences still respond to heroes at the box office.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"As far as action and special effects, X-Men was spectacular, but there were a few holes that were really difficult to overlook.","X-Men definitely delivered in the action and special effects departments. The acting, make-up, and cinematography were all excellent as well. In that sense, it was a great movie.However, the thing that I really had a problem with was the fact that there were a few holes left in the plot that could very easily have been prevented. For example, from what financial base did Dr. Xavier start this spectacular school for mutants? Clearly it would require a huge amount of money just to build the ""big round room"" alone. And even more than that, is it just me or does it seem very unlikely that every mutant with these amazing powers somehow winds up in this school and not in some secret government institution somewhere? Is it a coincidence that the only people who ever witness these peoples' powers are the people who just want to turn them over to this school and not to the scientific community to see how they work? Not likely. And what about those powers themselves? The narration at the beginning of the film talks about how these 'mutants' have skipped a step in evolution, so that their genetic structure is in various ways superior to that of the rest of the human race. That's great, but does the ability to shoot lasers out of your eyes or, even more, the ability to walk through walls have anything to do with your DNA? I don't think so. It doesn't seem that there was a lot of thought put into these aspects of the film, and it really bothers me when the filmmakers do things like that.Overall, X-Men was a very good film, and it is definitely worth seeing, but only as a special effects and action extravaganza. It seems to be aimed mostly at younger male audiences, because of the absence of a solid amorous subplot, and also because of Mystique's outfit (!). Besides all that, at least a basic knowledge of the X-Men comics (which I personally don't have, I'm into movies, not comic books) would probably be beneficial in understanding the story a little bit better. If you haven't seen X-Men, go out and check it out.

It has a good plot to match the actors and special effects. Best of all, it leaves oom for a sequel or two. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are magnificent, fleshing out the characters to a realistic level. Hugh Jackman and Tyler Mane are also great, but for different reasons.

I just know it. His portrayal of Logan was superb... good job... good job.Anna Paquin - I was a bit weary of the casting decision with her being Rogue, but it makes sense now. She's supposed to be young, inexperience and not has ""voluptuous"". Just get over it, purists. Her brotherly/sisterly relationship with Logan was very touching.Patrick Stewart - he was born to play this role. nuff said.Ian McKellen - ditto.Now, the three other X-Men, Storm, Cyke and Jean Grey werent given as much screentime, and their characters werent that signifigant. But - they all did a good job. Especially Famke Jannsen, who's charismatic and penetrating personality made her stand out in what could have been a forgetable role.The Brotherhood - Now, I thought Toad, Mystique and Sabretooth were a weird ensemble, but it was a rather well thought out choice. Ray Park, who had, like, one line ""Hey, quit playin around!"", was fantastic as his Spider-man esque amphibious mutant.Mystique also had one line ""You're the reason why I was afraid to go school as a girl!"", did remarkably well. She's X-Men's Darth Maul - a totally cool villain who doesnt have much to do.Sabretooth... blah. Pure movie-menace. Wasn't as personified as Toad and Mystique.All in all.. this movie is great.

A Landmark in the Superhero Genre,"X-Men is directed by Bryan Singer and is the origin story of the X- Men, a team of mutants that turn superheroes in order to stop a mutant named Magneto that is preparing, and attempting to start, a full on war between mutants and humans. When Magneto, and a few other mutants, threaten civil society as we know it, the X-Men must put aside their differences and fight to stop an all out war between the two classes of people, mutant, and human.X-Men is the first successful Marvel film, and it's easy to see why. Although Marvel films have been better, X-Men, in a way, paved the way for every other Marvel movie to come, from Spiderman (2002) to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). With likable characters, great direction, and fantastic special effects, X-Men is a very enjoyable film in whole, and works in every genre of film it was going for, be it action, superhero, and even a sci-fi.X-Men offers some amazingly relatable characters that the audience immediately feels for in each and every situation. Although this was my favorite feature of the film, I feel this is where its biggest weakness lies as well. Although characters like Wolverine, Professor X, Rogue, and Magneto are very well-rounded, most of the others aren't. We get to know a little bit about Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Storm, but not too much all in all. We know that Jean Grey hopes to be much like Professor X when older, but that's about it. We also know that there is conflict between Cyclops and Wolverine due to their mutual affection for Jean Grey, but nothing else about their characters.The characters of Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad, who are the mutants working with Magneto, aren't given much depth to either. Although it's cool to see Mystique transform into other people, but we aren't given much, if any, information about her character on a personal level. Sabretooth and Toad are both characters that have special powers, but no personalities. They both feel as if they are basically the ""grunts"" of Magneto's team, and don't really serve that large of a purpose in the movie.The direction, by Bryan Singer, is actually quite amazing. Every action scene, as well as exposition scene, is so nicely filmed in every way. All of the action looks very nice, with no quick cuts or shaky cam to be found. Bryan Singer did an excellent job with the camera, and made X-Men look very good. The special effects are probably the best thing I could say about X-Men. The CGI throughout the entire movie is revolutionary, from Mystique shapeshifting to Wolverine's metal claws coming straight out of his knuckles. There's not a single shot in which the audience might call out ""fake,"" due to the amazingly impressive special effects littered all throughout X-Men.The acting is also very impressive. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, as we all know, is a perfect casting choice, and he does fantastic in his role. Both Ian McKellan and Sir Patrick Stewart as Magneto and Professor X play two age old rivals magnificently, and are very believable as life long friends. All of the other smaller casting choices, such as Anna Paquin as Rogue, are also chosen very well. I must say, however, that I didn't like Sabretooth's character or the actor who played him, Tyler Mane. Although he was a good casting choice for the character, Mane didn't really impress me with his acting abilities.Another complaint I have, which may be small, is a small portion in the film in which a couple different characters do certain actions that don't fit their personalities, but solely to advance the plot. Their actions are necessary, as called for by the script, but their nature and deeds don't match up. This only occurs at a specific time that's tough to talk in depth about without spoilers, but it's still present, and stands out as a negative on the script's part.Comprehensively, X-Men is a great film. It stands out as a landmark in the superhero genre of film, and contains much enjoyment in it. Despite it being flawed, I would recommend X-Men to anyone who enjoys superhero, or action, movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun but not great,"I was looking forward to seeing X-Men not because I expected an excellent movie.  In fact, I wasn't sure and didn't really care either way as to whether it was good or bad; it just looked fun.  I've never been a huge X-Men fan, but I'm familiar with most of the characters and major plot points since I used to read American Comics a while back.  With most comic book movies being really bad, I didn't have very high expectations for X-Men.  I'm glad I didn't.  Otherwise I might have been disappointed.As far as just being a ton of fun to watch, X-Men doesn't disappoint. There's some great visuals and direction, and then there's also some cheesy stuff.  I supposed I'll talk about visuals first.  The special fx weren't too bad, but it looked like they needed a higher budget.  Some of them were really cool.  The wind effects of Storm and Cyclops's optic blast were cool, as well as some of the other mutant power stuff. I was skeptical of Mystique's look at first, but I found that I really liked it in the movie. But any scene with characters flying just looked cheesy and rigged, and the statue of liberty fight scene was just...weird.  The slo mo just didn't work in that context.As far as the characters go, the ones that were focused on were in character and looked pretty good.  Wolverine was great, and I ended up liking him more than I ever did in the comics for some reason.  Cyclops was the dork that he is, and of course Professor X and Magneto were well done.  Rogue was ok, despite the fact that she was much younger than X-Men fans are used to.  But Storm just....did nothing.  She looked scared most of the movie, and she was way too much of a background character. (Although if they had concentrated too much on every character it would have been too loaded with complicated details and would clutter the story.) And she had the worst line of dialogue I've ever heard, which many people have already complained about.  That line was trying so hard to be cool that it just came out all wrong.  Sabertooth was pretty bad as well.  I'd have to say he was the worst.  I hated the lion roars and the fact that he barely spoke.  He wasn't all that savage either, and the whole Wolverine/Sabertooth rivalry thing was ignored in the movie. I realize that the movie was made for the masses and not just for X-Men and comic book fans, so they did a commendable job translating it even if it's missing details.Oh, the soundtrack was just bad.There's not much more I can think to say about this movie.  It was good for a comic book live action movie.

X-Men delivers!,"Being a fan of comic books, I wasn't sure whether or not I would like a movie based on the best-selling comic of all time.  X-Men also received a lot of hype, causing movie-goers to expect a movie to be better than it actually is.  However, X-Men was a very good film.  Not only is the movie teeming with eye-popping visual effects, but it also has intelligence, emotion, and humor.  Most of the characters are portrayed with great attention to the conflicts between them (Professor X vs. Magneto; Wolverine vs. Cyclops).  The only things that stop me from giving X-Men a rating of 10 are that Wolverine's past could have been revealed in more detail and that Storm has very little personality (let's work on her more in the sequel). Overall, a very good movie.  X-Men delivers!  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More action and less sweetness would go a long way.,"Unfortunately X-MEN suffers from the same fault that all comic book movies suffer from and that is the dreaded origin plot line.  Just once I would want to see something that begins its story some ten years into the super-heroes lives.Having said that, I will say that there is hope and lots of it for future sequels, where these characters will be already defined and we all can get down to some serious action, which there is not nearly enough here.Also there seems to be an abundance of sweetness.  Rouge is sweet, her classmates are sweet, hell, even Wolverine is sweet, Wolverine? Isn't he a maniacal, deranged, psychopath? YES HE IS.  But not here.  (for future consideration)My final vote is a generous 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great movie for its type,"No, this isn't meant to be a complex character study. But what it tries to do it does very well.This is a comic book turned into movie. The movie had to do these things: 1) Establish the concept. What are the X-men? It did that. 2) Establish the characters in a manner that didn't take away from progressing the plot. It did that for the most part 3) Have enough action. It did that for the most part. 4) Get a person to want to see it again. It did that for me. 5) Make you want to see the sequel. It did that. 6) Get the audience into it. Sure did that where I went to see it.Again, just because this movie wasn't too cerebral is not a fault.

"Surprise! A blockbuster with brains, beauty, heart and soul...","X-MENAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSAgainst a backdrop of social exclusion and intolerance, a new breed of superhuman 'mutants' - ordinary people with extraordinary powers - are forced into a confrontation with supervillain Magneto (Ian McKellen), who plans to launch a devastating assault on the world's non-mutant population.Bryan Singer's magnificent film (based on the Marvel comic book) transcends genre expectations without skimping on the spectacle and melodrama inherent in modern blockbusters. David Hayter's clever script provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, and Singer is able to convey a wealth of information at high speed without obscuring the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.).The performances, too, are uniformly excellent: Stewart and McKellen are unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors add real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team (including Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden) look suitably spectacular, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen. Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Hugh Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of the film's rushed production schedule: Newton Thomas Sigel's scope photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins.While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia: Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protesters gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? This interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it provides plenty of food for thought. Followed by X2 (2003).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I know that the events of the movie are different to the true origins of the Xmen but to try and condense the entire comic 25 year plus Xmen history with all its diverse characters into a 90 minute believable movie is impossible. Thankfully this movie has portrayed as closely to the origins as I think they possibly can with the characters that have been used. It was totally enthralling to see other comic book characters like Shadowcat, Iceman, Moonstar, Jubilee and was that Johnny Storm of the fantastic four (all in professor X's office when Wolverine bursts in), come to life and look positively ""Human"".

A mutant of a superhero movie.,"Why people are so glad the X Men movie didn't screw up?Because there was so much room to screw up. Thankfullythe screenwriters and the director avoided it.X Men used to be my favorite comic book when I was a kid.Then Marvel Comics started milking the franchise, comingup with a new mutant comic every couple of months or so.By the last time I read it, there were so many mutantsscattered in so many different titles, I lost count, and myinterest in them.So, as almost everyone else, I was a skeptic when the reelstarted. My skepticism didn't last long. The movie deliveredto both readers and non-readers. I was impressed the character development -with the exception of Cyclops andStorm- and the action were so well balanced. There was areal good story brewing beneath it all.  Seeing how thesepeople are feared and rejected because of who they are, ismaterial enough to leave us thinking how is this happeningin reality. But the thinking was left behind for summerthrills.This movie had a lot of unexplored potential, but thenagain, it had a lot of chances of being just a silly fanboyflick. Bring on the Sequel!

"Well Done, though it starts a little slow","Comics often don't come to ""real life"" all that gracefully, but after the several years that it took to get this one to the big screen, Singer has, by and large, made the most of it.You need to be patient while they set background information up, but, if you are, you are rewarded with some decent suspense and some positively wonderful comedy. Add in some action and a few good special effects, and you've got yourself a comic book come to life in quite respectable fashion.This one is definitely worth seeing on the big screen.NOTE: Knowledge of the comic series before seeing the film is *NOT* required (though, if you know the comic, you'll get a few more laughs than everyone else <w>). It is also, generally speaking, an ok flick for children down to perhaps as young as 9 or so. The blood is there, but is minimal. There is virutally no swearing (only one instance I can think of, and one could seriously question whether that is even a swear word in this day and age). A little romantic tension exists, but zero sex.Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A pleasant surprise !,"I really had no expectations that this film would be even be modestly good, so it was a pleasant surprise to see a very well made film unfold. Perhaps some fans of the comic strip  may find too many variables, however as cinema entertainment it hits the spot. With inevitable comparison, to some of the Batman offerings, I tend to like X-Men better. The Batman offerings seem more ponderous and overblown compared to X-Men, and somehow despite it's comic-strip origin X-Men seems to appeal on a more adult level. Much of this is due to the deftness and light touch of the Director. Great C-G work ( this is one genre where C-G really works well ) alongside very good ""real"" sets makes for an excellent looking film. Patrick Stewart at last gets a chance for once to unleash his screen presence ( shamefully squandered by the Star Trek folks ) and does a great job. Teamed against the awesome Ian McKellen these two add the sinister darker aspect of the film. Hugh Jackman (looking eerily like a young Clint Eastwood in many shots) and the rest of the cast very ably fill the young cast roles. Oddly I had heard very little about X-men and it would seem it has been greatly underrated. From the look of things, it appears that this was intended to be the first in a series of X-Men films. I hope this team gets a chance to bring us some more good fare. Enjoy !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mutation is the key to adequacy,"Now I know it's quite an unpopular opinion for someone to think that the first installment in the X-Men franchise isn't that great, but I don't feel much for this film. It's short but feels long, it's dated but feels modern, and it's poorly written but strongly structured. What is this film? This movie is so out of the map, but it's just... another film starring Hugh Jackman that's just adequate! What is this strange pattern?What's the story? They are children of the atom, homo superior, the next link in the chain of evolution. Each was born with a unique genetic mutation, which at puberty manifested itself in extraordinary powers. In a world filled with hate and prejudice, they are feared by those who cannot accept their differences. Led by Xavier the X-Men fight to protect a world that fears them. They are locked in a battle with former colleague and friend, Magneto who believes humans and mutants should never co-exist.Okay, let's start this review with a good aspect: the special effects. Although the opening credits look really dated and cheap, the rest of the effects are surprisingly really good, especially for its time. This was back in 2000, where CGI was in its early stage and still developing, but for early CGI this is very nice to look at. It also makes the action scenes look very exciting and amps up the fun aspect of the film. The story itself is pretty bland, like an Avengers-before-Avengers story, but as far as those stories go, despite being pretty short, this makes a pretty decent crossover film. Not that it's the best or anything, but it does give us enough background knowledge on all the characters before pursuing into the climax of the film. As for the acting, the only performance that legitimately stood out for me was Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine, and even HE could sound pretty bland sometimes. This isn't really a movie known for its good acting or anything, but more to admire the technical aspect.In conclusion, X-Men is a nice kickoff to the franchise, but as a standalone film, it's okay. The action and effects are good, but the acting (excluding Hugh Jackman) and the writing can be done a bit better. If you like X-Men, maybe you'll like this, even though I don't make any promises. Overall, it didn't quite mutate perfectly, but at the very least, it's fine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The special effects and storyline were both very good.  However, there is one part of this movie that could have been improved.  That is the character development.  They tried to cram a two and a half hour movie into a hour and a half and it shows.  Hugh (Wolverine) had the main part in the flick (probably because he is the most popular X-Man) and all the others had to share the time that was left.Overall though, this movie was very worthwhile to see.

Marvel finally doesn't drop the ball,"Its about time for a Marvel movie to be great.  Blade was good but X-Men is a great film.

Not Enough Character Development.,"I saw X Men for the first time yesterday. I thought it was OK but it could have been much better. For one thing the only character who really is developed and explained how he came to be is Wolverine for the most part. The other mutants (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm) really get no explanation at all as to why they are mutants. THis film was not very long either so they could have taken a minute or two to explain how each mutant got their powers. Did they just expect everyone to know each of their back stories? I knew a little about X Men before seeing this film because I have read some of the comics and also watched the show back in the day but what if someone who had no prior knowledge watched the film? They would be lost a little. ALso there are not nearly enough action scenes. The fight at the end is quick and not spectacular. ALso Wolverine is on screen way more than any of the other X Men, this really is a wolverine film. The scenes with him are nice but they could have shown some other X Men as well, like Cyclops. Cyclops does not have enough dialogue. But I liked the scenes with Wolverine, those were well done. But this is not a film about Just wolverine, it is titled X men and they do not show enough about each X Men. Maybe they will in the sequel which I will see soon. But for the most part this film is too short and should have made more scenes to describe each X Men members back story and the action scenes are OK but there are not enough of them. Not strongly recommended but it is OK. Five out of ten.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable.,"Overal a statisfying movie.  They did a good job.Good points:Very real to life in making the characters exactly like their comic book counterparts. Wolverine was done so well that he stole the show and it was good that this movie focused on him. Fantastic looking and perfect casting for the characters Magneto, Xavier, Logan, Storm, Sabertooth and Cyclops. When Xavier (P Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan - God and Monsters) get together it is pure magic. Well done fight scenes that make the superheros show off their 'talents' excellently.Bad points:Xavier and Magneto feed off each other so brilliantly and I only wish the movie had more of them together on the screen. There could have been a little more on the human fear factor how everyone was scared of all the mutant business, at least they covered it in the movie. I did not like Ana Paquins acting ability as Rogue.  She started off well but seemed to go downhill as the film progressed.Overall the good more than outweighs the bad probably cause I was so taken with Logan (after all he is my fav X men character).  Is it true that apparantly 45 minutes of this film went on the CHOPPING BLOC!  I wonder what those scenes would have been like to the movie??  Maybe it could of had more dialogue and story explanation..  Me thinks though that they totaly went for the simple adventure-action-effects film.  Although that succeded I wonder what the other 45 minutes would have done.Rating 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Still waiting for the payoff,"Let me say up front, that I'm not a devotee of the X-Men comic book series, and knew very little about the story prior to watching the film. However, I was anxious to see ""X-Men"" the movie, as it had received a lot of publicity during it's theatrical release, and the trailers for it looked enticing. After watching the movie on DVD, I was impressed with the special effects, and the surround sound employed, but the story left much to be desired. The idea of a race of mutants living amongst us, and possessing extraordinary powers has a lot of potential. I felt however, that a much of that potential was wasted by the seemingly lacklustre story. It certainly seemed as though the premise of this film was simply to introduce the characters and then create the setting for a (hopefully better) sequel. For me, the lack of resolution in this movie, made it seem too much like a 'part1', rather than a movie capable of standing on it's own merits. Watch it and see for yourself.

"Flick is nice, but classic comics are better","Bryan Singer said that this movie was driven by characters rather than by action.  With that in mind, I was surprised to discovered that the film was more impressive and faithful to the original comics in regard to the action scenes than it was in regard to characterization.  Despite the modest budget (by blockbuster standards), X-Men manages to deliver well choreographed action scenes reminiscent of the comic book. It is often visually impressive, though the score is pretty weak.The characterization ranges from great to poor.  Ian McKellen performance is the best and truest to his character (Magneto). Berry's Storm is uninteresting.  Stewart's Xavier and Paquin's Rogue are two-dimensional compared to their complex comic counterparts. Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Wolverine are at times as multi-faceted as in the comics.  Ray Park is surprisingly good as Toad.My advice: if you like the movie, buy some reprints of the X-Men comics of the 70s and 80s to see the X-Men at their best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good start to the X-Men films!,"I am doing a superhero franchise review and it is X-MEN.In 1994, 20th Century Fox and producer Prawan Singh bought the film rights to the X-Men. Andrew Kevin Walker was hired to write and James Cameron expressed interest in directing. Eventually, Bryan Singer signed on to direct in July 1996. Thought not a fan of the comic-books, Singer was fascinated by the analogies of prejudice and discrimination it offered.John Logan, Joss Whedon, Ed Solomon, Christopher McQuarrie and David Hayter wrote the script, with Hayter receiving sole credit. Production began in September 1999 in Toronto, Canado and ended in March 2000.The film was released on July 14, 2000 to positive reviews and critical success and spawned a reemergence of superhero films and it would prove to movie studios that superhero films could succeed.The film introduces us to Wolverine and Rogue into the conflict between Professor Xavier's X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto. Magneto intends to mutate world leaders at a United Nations summit with a machine he has built, to bring about acceptance of mutant kind, but Xavoer realizes this forced mutation will only result in their deaths.Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice of Wolverine and this film would lead him into being in the sequels and two spin-offs and other movies including Van Helsing and Prisoners. Patrick Stewart plays Professor X and Ian McKellen plays Magneto and they were also really good casting choices.Anna Paquin was the perfect choice to play Rogue / Marie and this would lead her into playing in ""True Blood"" as the main character, which ended in 2014 and my 25-year-old sister watches the show, but I don't. Famke Janssen and the rest of the cast were all cast perfectly in this film as their roles.The action sequences were amazing and there is less CGI in this film because some of the visual effects are really amazing and this film only had a $75 million dollar budget and I really liked the way this movie turned out and the story is not action-packed, but I will say it is really amazing, but there is just one major flaw: This was 2000 and it did not make me feel any emotion for the characters, except for Wolverine and Rogue.The musical score is really good and I think Michael Kamen did a really good job with his X-Men theme. But, I like John Ottman's X-MEN theme in the next film.Overall, I like X-MEN, but the one thing that had me confused is that the story is not action-packed enough and it does not make me feel any emotion for the characters, except for Wolverine and Rogue. X-MEN is the reason why we have superhero films today like Batman Begins, Spider-Man, Iron Man, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel, 300, Blade, Watchmen and of course, both The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wolverine and Bryan Singer,"Hugh Jackman did a wonderful job of bringing life to the lost sole of Logan (Wolverine). Logan has been my favorite character for years and Hugh did it masterfully.

The movie didn't have the goofy comic book feel that to many have when they go from paper to film. The film made it appear life-like, mutants could exist, and it wasn't far fetched. This is clearly the best movie of the summer. This is a wonderful film for all ages to enjoy. I saw with my wife and she liked it. I'm looking forward to the sequels.

An uncomfortably solid beginning,"The very beginning of the modern comic book boom in movies was an awkward time. There was this great wealth of material begging to be tapped, but after the ludicrous direction the Batman films had taken under Joel Schumaker, studios were unsure of how to actually handle the material. The source material was bright and colorful, but had the bright colors of Batman & Robin been the reason for its failure? It's campy tone? As William Goldman had said about Hollywood, nobody knows anything, so there was no real knowing how comic book movies needed to be approached differently. Combined with the success of The Matrix the year before, and it seemed like financial success for fantastical movie lied with muted colors and a serious tone. Also, who actually knows about all this comic book stuff? Gotta make sure the audience understands what a mutant is.In walks Bryan Singer, fresh off Apt Pupil and The Usual Suspects, to try to bring one of the most popular comics to the screen in the X-Men. There was a huge cast of characters to pull from, and I think he largely did a good job focusing down on a solid handful. Most predominantly is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, a mutant with healing powers and sharp metal claws that extend from between his knuckles. He has no memory of his past and is completely new to the whole mutant community and larger conflicts, allowing him to be the receptor of exposition required by the audience. Along the ride with him, but less prominently, is Rogue, a young girl from Louisiana who absorbs the life force of those she touches, adopting mutant powers in the process.The larger world is torn between those who see the emerging mutants, with their weird collection of powers that includes walking through walls, telekinesis, and psychic abilities, as a threat and those who want to integrate these mutants into society at large. It's easy to see the civil rights origins of the comics. The two sides of the mutant faction are represented by Dr. Charles Xavier, the owner of a school for mutants, who wants to see integration and peace, and Eric Lehnsherr, also known as Magneto who leads a brotherhood of mutants and sees a war brewing between man and mutant that he's readying for.What ends up dragging the movie down, especially in its first half, is just how much needs to get explained to the audience. If this movie had been made a decade later the filmmakers would have realized just how much of this would have been unnecessary. Audiences have grown able to accept superheroes pretty easily, so watching this after a decade long superhero bombardment, the amount of explanation about powers, genetics, and the Xavier School really drags down the first two-thirds of the movie. As pieces move for the final showdown, we just get endless talk that just explains things. I've also discovered that creating a fictional political structure is pretty much a guaranteed way of boring your audience. People barely care about politics in real life, and inserting a bunch of fake politics into your movie about super humans who can shoot beams out of their eyes is fodder for boredom. Too much of the movie's first two acts are dominated by a committee hearing (in a room that seemed to be designed to be impressive with a big screen in the back hidden by a large mural but ends up feeling like wasted money in the production budget) and talk of a bill in Congress, explaining what the stakes are but also just too many details of the bill.That's not all that's going on in the first couple of acts, though. We have about a dozen characters to go through from the aforementioned quartet to Cyclops, Storm, Jean Grey, Mystique, Toad, Sabertooth, and Senator Kelly. The movie intelligently keeps most of these to the background, offering up little but support for plot mechanics here and there, so as to help offer some focus to the film, however that is a whole lot of characters with some prominence. The ""romance"" that pops up between Wolverine and Jean Grey feels out of place in particular.And that touches on the movie's issues in the first two-thirds: there's very little focus. We're introduced to the world, characters, relationships, and overall conflicts in about an hour, and nothing really seems to be the central point. Is it Rogue's desire for belonging? Is it Wolverine's desire to learn about his past? Is it the brewing war between mutant and human? Is it Wolverine's desire to get with the hot redhead doctor lady?Eventually the actual plot of Magneto's plan takes over the film, and the movie really gains the focus it needs to work. It's final act is a strong display of spectacle and payoffs as all the powers come together for a showdown on Liberty Island where Magneto is planning on using his experimental device to turn all of the world's leaders into mutants as they congregate on nearby Ellis Island. It's effective stuff with the small emotional work done on Wolverine and Rogue's paternal relationship playing out. Oh, and it also houses one of the single worst one-liners from a character in an action movie ever written, given to Storm. I cannot believe that someone wrote that, thinking it was good enough, another person read it, thinking it was good enough, Halle Berry said it, thinking it was good enough, Bryan Singer decided to include it in the final cut, thinking it was good enough. It's so laughably bad. Just the worst.Anyway, the movie's hampered by a need to overexplain everything, overstuff the movie with characters and ideas, but it manages to bring it all together for a largely successful third act set piece. I can envision a more artistically successful first X-Men movie with a smaller scale, especially in terms of characters, that treats the universe as something to unveil over time instead of needing to introduce as much all at once, but that's not how they made superhero movies back in the day of the early 00s. It was all or nothing, essentially. Oh well, it's a decent first step in a franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-crementitious,"Well, not really, but a disappointment nevertheless. The film's dialog was absolutely pitiful (""You know what happens when lightning strikes a toad...? Same as anything else!"") and the undignified promotion of it's own sequel during the last 10 minutes was embarrassing. Great cast, but Stewart and McKellan were criminally misused. Janssen was pretty good, as per usual, Berry sucked, Paquin was excellent. The ending was silly and pretty unexciting. When Magneto put that hulking dumba** solely in charge of keeping him safe from the X-Men, I felt as if the last vestiges of excitement had evaporated.So, in summary, style without substance (a la Mummy) and a shameless sequel plug (a la Back to the Future II) annoyed me, but damn it I like SciFi even when it's irritating. 6 ex 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Heck of a killer Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well I went in expecting good things and I was not disappointed.  As with any comic the main plot was weak, but there was reason behind it.  They took the time to really get into the characters, not all of them mind you, but it was still very well done.  Bryan Singer is an excellent director and I think I will continue to be impressed by his work.

Possibly among the 3 best Marvel/DC movies ever (with Spidey and Batman 2),"This is really a fun film, much better than I had expected it to be when I first saw previews at theatres.

Unbelievable that this was done by the same director who also made ""Trainspotting"". The characters were very believable (for comic characters) and the story was quite thrilling.

"Even for its time, it's just not that good","You have your great things: the excellent cast; the visual huge improvement over what came before; the ideological/philosophical ideas that it touches upon; Hugh Jackman.But the plot is too simple and the over use of exposition to overexplain everything before it happens and the emotion and thoughts of the characters takes a lot of excitment of a movie that already suffers from the lack of action sequences and quality on the few that it actually contains, and gets bogged down by the melodrama brought by the two melancholic protagonists (Wolverine and Rogue).",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hallmark movie,"X-Men can be said to be the movie that by itself launched the modern superhero film madness. There had been superhero movies before, some of them even somewhat successful, but this was the film that defined the new style. It paid homage to the comics, taking its inspiration from them, but it took liberties with its characters, story lines and most importantly the visuals, transforming and translating them to the silver screen.It also helped that it had an amazing ensemble cast behind its characters. Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Halle Berry were already well-known by this point, but the film also helped to put several people on the map, most prominently Hugh Jackman. And their newfound fame is well-deserved as they all give fantastic performances, breathing life into their characters. Sure, some of their lines... okay, about half their lines were very cheesy, but that's the fault of the script which, while revolutionary in its own way, was still looking its way and thus contained a significant amount of silliness from the previous decades, which had made those previous films so hard to sell to the larger audiences.Another minor problem is the story. And don't get me wrong, I like the story. But right now, fifteen years and an impressive amount of superhero films later, I can say that it's a bit juvenile. And, to the film's credit, it shies away from pure black-n-white morality with its villain Magneto (McKellen), as well as it should, but overall the tone and the events don't reach that same magnitude and epicness that later movies would.In the end this makes X-Men very important for the whole superhero genre, but keeps it from being more than an average film. With some very impressive features.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spectacular form with little substance,"Though highly imaginative with astounding visual effects, `X-Men' explodes onto celluloid much the same way as most of the other comic book films, with a weak and predictable plot and characters as two dimensional as their paper counterparts.  This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it is. It is very high on filmmaking `coolness' and the action is intense and impressive.  However, it suffers from excessive form and very little substance.The science in this so-called science fiction story is laughable.  If we are to accept the premise presented here, suddenly, over a period of about 50 years, man takes a quantum leap in evolution and dozens of people develop superhuman powers with none of powers duplicated in any two mutants.  There is no explanation as to what triggered so many drastic mutations; it is just a sudden acceleration of evolution.  Well, evolution doesn't work that way, not even close.  Major evolutionary changes are generally separated by thousands or millions of years and it will usually be a single change in a species that elevates the whole species.  So the concept is really more fantasy than science fiction.`Lighten up', you say.  `Who cares if it is science fiction or fantasy anyway?  It is just an awesome movie!'  That's a good point.  However, even fantasy films need a plot.  `X-Men' trots out the same tired storyline; good superheroes battle to save the world from bad superheroes as mere mortals helplessly look on.  There is nothing remotely novel or interesting about the story.The film tries to make itself socially relevant with platitudinous comparisons between social injustice in human history and the persecution of the poor superhuman mutants.  However, the comparison is inapt since true persecution always flows from the strong to the weak and not vice-versa as depicted here.  Feeling sorry for the mutants is like pitying wealthy corporate executives because everyone fears and despises them.  They have the power.  How much sympathy can we have for them?At the risk of inducing a lot of impassioned e-mail, I have to diverge from popular opinion about how great this film was.  This film was all sizzle and no steak.  There was only one character with a shred of substance and that was Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).  The rest were just cardboard cutouts.In 1995, at the age of 29, wunderkind director Bryan Singer directed a brilliant and exquisitely complex film called `The Usual Suspects'.  He then burst into flames with `Apt Pupil', a dreadful film about a boy who became enamored with an elderly Nazi war criminal who was trying to live out his life quietly in the U.S.  After that disaster, he went underground until `X-Men'.  This film showed that Singer is a stickler for detail and he knows how to make a stupendously vacuous action flick, but it shows not a shred of nuance that would earn it the right to stand in the shadow of `Suspects'. That film showed that he has a certain directorial genius, but we are not likely to see it emerge again if he keeps taking lucrative, but shallow projects like this.The acting; well, there wasn't much acting to be done.  Anna Pacquin and Hugh Jackman had the only parts that weren't utterly superficial.  Both of them did a good job, actually conjuring up some emotions other than resolute righteousness.  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos looked about as sexy as a human being could when covered in reptilian body armor, and she said all six of her lines like a true professional.I'm being overly hard on the film.  It wasn't bad.  It was very enjoyable. It just didn't deserve the raves that were doted on it.  I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the visual effects and the action sequences.  These areas were an easy 10/10.  The screenplay was about a 3/10.  It's definitely worth seeing, but leave your brain at the door.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hmmmm, not too disappointing...","Well, I have waited, and it has come.  And, in my opinion, it's somewhere in the middle of the road.  Not the most amazing film of the new year, which I had hoped for, nor the phenomenal let-down that I had been expecting. Many of you will believe that I am grading the movie too harshly, but to all the hardcore fans out there, you will uderstand where I am coming from.Wolverine was definitely good.  Even though he did not have as much, shall I say, grittiness and general tough guy attitude as the comics portray him, I believe that Hugh Jackman did an impressive job filling in his role's big shoes.  Patrick Stewart also did a great job, truly portraying Professor X. Magneto was a bit harder, as Ian McKellen did a good job of displaying the emotions and motivations behind Magneto, but he does lack the bit of muscle that the real Magneto possessed, making his costume make him appear as a somewhat frail old man in a rather unflattering suit.  I mean, the real Magneto was pretty jacked, but that is one detail I can do without.  Jean Grey, portrayed by Famke Janssen, was more or less nondescript, although she does look somewhat like what I would expect Jean Grey to appear as. Cyclops, on the other hand, was more or less cheesy.  Storm was the same, although at times Halle Berry was able to make her a bit less disappointing. Toad was a hit, even though he is WAY too strong for the little shrimp that he is (anyone who has read the comics knows).  I guess the choices of Sabertooth and Mystique were more or less based completely on looks, because the 2 didnt require any acting whatsoever.  It makes me wonder why they picked Rebecca Romijn Stamos...I feel that the biggest problem was definitely the shortness of plot and the lack of characters.  To the Xmen newbie, this movie does seem great. However, it misses out on a lot of key characters.  Where is Gambit, Nightcrawler, Beast, Colossus, and Angel?  Rogue and Iceman are just teens, and will hopefully be able to appear in the coming sequel (if there is one...).  And the real lack of supervillains was definitely a let-down. They could've thrown in some more, even if they weren't part of the original story (I mean, it already is somewhat distorted as it is).  I don't think anyone would mind if the producers and writers tossed in Mr Sinister and his Nasty Boys, or the rest of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Pyro (who is a kid in Prof X's school), Blob, Phantasm, etc).  And this movie should've been made to be around 3 hours long.  In fact, this could've rivaled Star Wars.  But the shortness of the film, around an hour and a half, didn't go for the character development and taggled plot lines that were usually found in the comics.  All that can be said is, pray for a sequel...Even though I spent all this time lamenting about what this movie lacks, it is definitely a film to go see.  Good effects that dont turn the movie into a cyberjunkie's euphoria and some better than decent acting make this film overall a good choice.  For the fans, see it for the heck of it.  For the newcomers, see it because you will like it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent -- they could have done a lot worse,"A lot of credit is due to Bryan Singer:When the X-Men became the most popular comic book in the 80s, it did so through the balance of teamwork and amazing characters, many of which had complicated, tormented backgrounds. Any movie adaptation which didn't capture these elements would have been an abject failure of interpretation. Singer being able to make compelling Wolverine's and Rogue's story, the tension between Logan/Scott/Jean, and demonstrate the team play, is a big part of making this a ""good movie"" for those outside of the Geek/Fanboy crowd.It's a shame, then, that the dialogue wasn't particularly interesting, and that delivery of one-liners during the fight scenes was disappointing.Ahhh, High Wit was never the X-Men's strong point. They caught the look and feel, and that is good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This mutant-fest is that rare beast, a classic piece of summer cinema.","While Bryan Singer's X-MEN has received what can only be described as a thumbs up among critics and a slightly more wavering response by the audiences I feel most have missed out on it importance. Leaving the cinema on a hot summer night, I recognised a strange smile amongst the males that exited with their satisfied but less than impressed girlfriends, the kids, boy or girl did not have this almost uniform smirk either. The men, who have grown up on STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES and BOND, seemed to recognise something they'd long been missing. I can only describe it as akin to the feeling explicated at the end of FIELD OF DREAMS by James Earl Jones. It may not of had the John Woo inspired chaos, or the Bruckenhiemer orange filtered cool, it lacked the set in stone star power machismo of a Mel, Bruce or Nic, and it wasn't plagued with a critical case of referential irony. While I certainly enjoy all these in a movie (except the latter as you might have guessed) X-Men had something the blockbusters of late had lost in the brew or just plain didn't care about. It had a story, it had characters, it had ideas and best of all it wanted to present them as well and as intelligently as the summer action seat filler would allow. This was the reason we went to see JAWS all those years before high concept was branded on the arse of every piece of cinematic entertainment. Sure the shark was cool, we went to see the effects and the action and jokes, but what made us buy another ticket, what made us recommend it to our friends, what made us queue around the block for a third viewing, what made us hum the theme tune in the local lido, what made us watch it on TV, video and DVD year in, year out? I'll tell you what; an incredible piece of story telling with characters who actually seem like people as opposed to archetypes from other films. And in recent years the most we could hope for is the star gets some choice wisecracks and the action is half as exciting as it was in the trailer. Comparing and contrasting with recent examples is a futile exercise. The two most successful blockbusters of last summer, THE MATRIX and THE PHANTOM MENACE, don't deserve as near as much the adulation they received and continue to gain. They both suffer from the same problems that the X-MEN miraculously lacks. They both set up over-complicated plots. The essential premise is understandable from the trailer but they still find it necessary to bog the section after the opening action sequence down with an hour of exposition. THE MATRIX for all it camera tricks and location changes essentially has Lawrence Fishburne lay down the plot for over forty minute of cleverly shot talking heads. Where is the spectacle in that? STAR WARS I is crippled by even worse pacing and expositional problems. It needs to set up all the characters for the next two films but also have a story within this one. So while all the future relationships get their first meeting scene, it's hard to feel excited about any of the paths joining as that's all that happens. For a film that opens with standard rolling introduction titles to brining us up to date, all we basically chalk up for the following two hours is movie of scene setting for later installments. Yes, Obi Wan and Annakin do meet but little occurs between them, the same can be said for the mother of his future children. As Andrew O'Hehir concluded in his report at the time of its release, ` ¬ÖThis installment feels less like an opening chapter than a stammering, parenthetical preface.' X-MEN should ail with same defect. It is the opening part of a franchise and worse still has thirty years worth of idolised comics to condense into two hours. Unlike BATMAN which not only had huge audience recognition from non-comic readers due to the camp TV series and only one lead to introduce, X-MEN has a diverse cast to acquaint as well as a world that is obviously different from ours despite parallels. To deal with the huge roll call of introductions the scripting team of Tom De Santo, Singer and credited writer, David Hayter, have gone for what I'll call the Star Wars approach (A New Hope, that is.) Establish one character and then have them promptly meet up with everyone needed on his quest. In the same way Luke Skywalker briskly picks up the droids, the sage, the pirate, the muscle and the plucky heroine on his journey he also has plenty of adventures on the way, culminating in one big d√©nouement. This way the plot is peppered with action that effects the proceedings and all the characters are introduced both in time to have purpose in the last act but also for future episodes. The mission still propels the story but it also requires that the whole gang is assembled. X-MEN follows Rouge and Wolverine as they discover who they are, what their powers are and what their place in society is. Like the hierarchy set up in Star Wars where the characters understanding of the mystical force sets the characters social standing, here the more control a character has of their mutation the higher their ranking in the group. Clasical actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen take the roles of leaders of each side but also the Alec Guinness' role in Star Wars of swiftly explaining the complicated mythology in simple but legendary sounding terms. Here mythology is replaced with political import. The science introduction that hears Stewart booming about evolution and mutation should, if the producers have any sense become the regular opening for all entry in the series but apart from that most of the old hands speechifying is used to show their strange relation. Singer far prefers to show everything visually. Whether it be Wolverine's ability to smell danger, Cyclops' power, people prejudices of mutants or what Magneto's doom machine does. By keeping dialouge for character as opposed to signaling plot changes we have a far quicker, fluid reality created.In nearly all press interviews Singer has explained what drew him to the project he knew little about was the comparison to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. We sense that Magneto and Xaiver have history merely from the casting. When Magneto, says `By any means necessary,' this doesn't seem like clumsy misuse of a historical slogan or tacking on importance via historical events. Taking events were people lost lives to add verisimilitude is probably the hardest (and half-witted) thing to achieve as a director, Spielberg can be hit and miss and James Cameron's focus on a pair of stroppy teen in TITANIC was insulting. X-MEN uses it's history deftly; Ellis Island, Civil Rights, Gun Control, McCarthyism and most risky of all Nazi concentration camps work together as evidence to supports the reality these mutants live in. X-MEN is probably the most distinct cinematic allegory since HIGH NOON. It's subject is political intolerance. It's brave and skillful inclusion of a tragedy like the holocaust to open the film, setting out its stall not as merely popcorn fodder but as a piece more interested in a human side than car chases. It wants to show how these characters developed their ideals not their powers. Magneto is presented as someone so obsessed with equality he's willing to turn everyone into someone like him. Interestingly, the starting point to this particular battle is a vote grabbing Senator who is riding on people's fears to pass a witch hunt law against mutants. After Magneto's plan fails, one of his hench mutants actually disguises herself as the now dead Senator and turns the vote around. How's that for two opposing side causing moderation? The bad guys actually stop the bill because the good guys stopped their far more nefarious scheme. It's a more pertinent message on modern living than `We need guns. Lots of guns.' Nearly every blockbuster of the last decade has been as flawed, so it really is unfair to pick on the Wachowskis' and Lucas's successes to this extent apart from the fact they've had such special treatment compared to everyone else. X-MEN earned a favourable review and an in depth article by Kim Newman in film magazine of record Sight and Sound. Newman's piece however was concerned with the process it took to get the film from the funny-book into the can and the review still felt like it was selling tickets as opposed actually judging whether the film would have any after life apart from sequels. This is the cackhanded way all Hollywood summer juggernauts are brushed aside by the university degree press, and Sight and Sound is more than guilty of this. Perhaps this will go some way to redressing the balance. These movies are the most watched, have the most effect on the economics of the movie business and really do make or break careers. The fact that Singer has once again proven himself to be the master storyteller, as he did with The USUAL SUSPECTS, and made a movie that displays all the merits of big budget entertainment should be of note enough. The fact that it could have more import than a thousand worthy documentaries on modern day prejudices should be celebrated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Amazing next generation effects-- plus a superb movie all 'round!,"A marvelous, spectacular movie!!! Very un-Batmanny, un-cartoony.

I know that may sound trite, and maybe not appealing, but that's one of the reasons the effects here are sooooo good. They are so smooth and integrated into the story that at no time did I think: ""Oh, a special effect.""

Dazzling depth for a comic book movie,"I love this series of comic books, and I was not disappointed with the movie, although the character development I had hoped would be rich, was almost nonexistent, and there wasn't enough movie here to satisfy. It is 104 minutes long and needed to be at least two hours to enable some decent character development. While they tried, they fell short of what I would deem acceptable in this area.Other than that, this movie was very well done. The action sequences were rousing, the portrayals given were a good start in the right direction. The direction itself proved to be inspired, and the sets were creative.This whole production was executed in a manner which lent the darkling feel of mystery captured in the comic book, and some awe-inspiring CG-Eye Candy sequences made this film appear to be more than it should have been.The casting is one element which gave this movie its incredible success, but the effects and story were the products of a great and loving care devoted to the production of this movie, and it shows with each and every scene.

Has aged well,"I've been rewatching a lot of superhero movies from the 2000s over the last week and it stuns me how they don't feel nearly as corporate as the current crop of bloated cinematic universe fare does. X-MEN feels like an actual movie and not some bland set-up for a dozen other projects.Comparing it to other superhero films of the time, it is less campy, going for a more serious approach to xenophobia and bigotry, but it never foregoes a sense of pulpy fun. The characters are all interesting and I enjoyed watching their interactions. The CG had also aged pretty well, which is more than can be said for the likes of the Raimi Spiderman from 2002 (which I adore, just so that's made clear).Overall, this is a fine popcorn film that's weathered two decades well.

The best thing is the great characters of Wolverine and Rogue.  The worst thing is the characters of... every one else.  Patrick Stewart is great as Charles Xavier, and Ian McKellen is great as Magnito, but their characters are not as developed as they should be.  The other characters suck.  Storm, Cyclops, Toad?  Jean Gray is the best secondary character. Some people have complained that the X-MEN have human looking mutants, and the Brotherhood of Mutants are all physically mutated.  But if you think about it, the reason the mutants in the Brotherhood hate humans is that humans have rejected them, hate them, and fear them.  It is easier to hate someone who looks different.  Each character looks great and are very true to the comic book.

I really liked the cast of the movie, Halle Berry is not that bad as Storm as she is in other movies, but even so, Storm was a very easy role she took. Special effects add a lot to her performance, as she stroked Toad (Ray Park) with a thunder while her face was built on glowing white eyes and wind blowing through her hair. In this movie, we may say that Berry is not that bad, but it's not that great. The others are much greater. Starting with Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen), these two really perform seriously like they were the same characters from the novel. Magneto may not be looking physically the same way as in the comic books or the animated series, but still, the performance was what count the most. And the special effects and costumes a lot also. Oh, I almost forgot about Rogue (Anna Panquin). The screams she was known for to win the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role in The Piano (1993) are here in this movie too, in the beginning of it, when she first meet with her special powers. Wolwerine (Hugh Jackman) is great also, but I still think that his hair in the movie is horrible. It was a great hair for the animated series, but for the movie, it just seems a little weird and ugly. The only time his hair is actually good (or as we may say, natural) is when he wakes up from the bed in the scene where Jean Grey (Fanke Janssen) is about to give him a shot. She's also great in the movie and beautiful the same way she is in GoldenEye (1995).Well, all performances were great, special effects and all too. So, what am I complaining about? Well, I liked the plot and the school introduction too, even so, the plot seems to have been a little simple and the action is not that great. Maybe it was, but I really guess that the second movie was much greater. There are many more action sequences, the movie is longer, and more characters are introduced. It was a nice start for a marvel movie. But you should really watch X-Men, maybe if you are an X-Men fan, or maybe if you just want to see the movie, but the main reason in my opinion is that you should watch it just to watch X2 later on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mutants Assemble,"Bryan Singer directed this first film adaptation of the popular comic book series that stars Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, who has assembled various mutants like Cyclops(James Marsden), Storm(Halle Berry)& Jean Grey(Famke Jannsen).

Definitely lives up to the comics!,"X-Men is a great Sci-fi Action film! I am a fan of the comics and I did watch the incredible X-Men cartoon series from 1992-1998. Bryan Singer did a great job at staying true to the comic as best he could, like the fact that he kept in the bitterness between Scott ""Cyclops"" Summers and Logan ""Wolverine"" over Jean Grey. There were a few things I didn't like, like how Rogue was a teenager with just the ability to absorb others memories and powers, instead of the voluptuous women with also super strength, invulnerability, and the ability to fly, which I hope they solve in a sequel because Rogue is my favorite super hero out of them all besides just X-Men. I also think they could have chosen a better set of villains besides like Toad. But that's really minor and I don't care to much. Nonetheless I thought the casting was incredible, Patrick Stewart is the spitting image of Professor X, so was Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halle Berry as Storm, basically everybody was. Besides the minor things I didn't like, overall It was an incredible film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Extremely Mediocre,"The pondersome task for the folks at Marvel and 20th Century Fox, is to produce a movie that will satisfy the fans of the comic, and those that haven't the foggiest notion of what the story is about. This made for long and protracted explaining all throughout the screenplay. This also meant that a lot a times, the action came to a deadening stop, more often than not. Movies have to give the audience breathing room, but this film gave too much, to the point where things started getting...well...dull. The performances were okay, with Halle Berry being the standout as ""Storm."" Patrick Stewart underplayed his role to the point of casting a wooden pall over the character. Ian Mckellan was good in his role as ""Magneto."" He showed wonderfully sublime self-control, as his character could have beened hammed up badly. They made a wise choice using Sir Ian in this role.A mention might go out to parents, who are contemplating bringing the kids. There's a few scenes that are more than slighty graphic in their violent content. I was frankly astonished to see parents with toddlers in their arms, in the same theater. Some scenes could be a tad unsettling.Overall, while the film did not live up to its far-flung hype (which ones do?), it isn't terrible either.

A 96 minute tour of 37 years of comics.,"Bryan Singer has certainly succeeded in making a comic book movie that captures the flavor of the beloved Uncanny X-Men.  All of the actors capture the personalities of their comic book counter-parts (with the exception of Mystique, who in the comics was the second leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants).  The story line does not follow to an overly predictable conclusion.  A special treat was cameos by X-Men standards like Kitty Pryde and Bobby Drake.  This is a very good movie, but it does suffer from one flaw.  Its way too short.  Certainly I would hope that more time could have been spent developing Prof. Xavier, Storm, and Cyclops, without taking away from the obvious stars of the film, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman is AWESOME), Rogue, and Magneto.  And, for a comic book movie, it was a little light on the action. It is well written, and Wolverine is the natural choice to be the center of the film.  Overall, a good film.  Certainly worth the time of any fan of comics, action movies, or science fiction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Effective Set Up for the Inevitable Sequels,"I have never read an X Men comic nor even heard them referred to in any medium until this ""X Men"" movie came out.So I was really involved in the background exposition, which is most of the movie and is mostly a set up for the sequels. It was a bit much to start with the real environment of Nazi concentration camps in '44 and then somehow leap to the ""near future"" rather than making the whole thing futuristic, but I'm sure other folks know if that's based in the comics.Hugh Jackman took over the whole movie in a star-making turn. Halle Berry surely won't be able to use this as an audition tape; I hope she at least made big bucks because she had zero to do. James Marsden fans will be similarly disappointed, though Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan get to sleepwalk and still emote.The sibling-like relationship between Jackman's Wolverine and Anna Paquin's Rogue is surprisingly touching, marred by an unnecessary ending comment that now she has a thing for him that he has to condescendingly put down. Hey, what's the matter with familial affection these days as a motivator?The fight scenes were a bit ho hum - - it was like a Sesame Street lesson in cooperation as each set of mutants gangs up on enemies to use their super mutant powers together. I kept thinking how much more intense and scary was the Statue of Liberty scene in Hitchock's ""The Saboteur"" compared to this climax.The music was bombastic but effective.

Then I, in turn, went to see it expecting greatness.  What an awful movie.

Where, pray tell, does a ""school for the gifted"" turn out the kind of money necessary for all the insanely high-tech crap involved here?

Better than I expected,"I have collected X-Men comics for many years and was not expecting too much from the movie but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was pretty good.  Based in reality and more science fiction than fantasy I believed such a future could exist just around the corner.  Unlike many comic book adapted movies X-Men is not cartoony.  The spirit of the characters has been preserved although comic book continuity has not.  Although Anna Paquin (Rogue) could not sustain a Southern accent I sympathised with her ordeal as a confused young woman.  Hugh Jackman won me over as Wolverine (although he was not gruff enough or hairy enough) but I was disappointed with Sabretooth. What a wimp!!  Not vicious enough and to see him as Magneto's lapdog was embarrassing.  Mystique was pretty good but I do have one criticism here. Mystique is a shape shifter.  She takes on the appearance of something or someone else including their clothes etc.  When she becomes Wolverine and mimics his claws, the claws are still part of her flesh therefore when she battles the real Wolverine they would not break off as portrayed but would be sliced off an she would bleed.  It was interesting to see Toad as a major baddie.  I actually thought that he seemed the most powerful of the villains, quite the opposite of his rather lame comic book persona.  On the whole I recommend this movie both to the general public and to the fanboy, although I did think the action sequences were a bit weak by comic book standards.  Watch for the cameo and background appearances of a multitude of marvel characters and enjoy the jibes and in-jokes if your a fanboy. Happy viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nothing like the cartoon or game cards,I grew up with the x-men trading cards and every thing and it never onced really interested me. but this movie really jumped at me and i loved it. some of the effects that just show up will push you back in your seat.

Best comic adaptation to date,"Right up there with Superman and Batman, X-Men is a winner. The movie is extremely loyal to the comics, making minor changes but leaving big details (example: origins) intact. The cast is excellent, especially Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin were also good. Of course, like most big budget films, this film has very impressive special effects. I also liked the in jokes (What would you prefer Yellow Spandex?). People who have never read the comics are not going to understand the movie's plot like a fan would. Even fans who did not like the film at least understand it. By the way, there is reason X-Men is on the top 250 list at the time of this writing... it's that good. X-Men will surely bring on sequels (thank you) and inspire other projects (Superman 5) to get made. Hopefully, the sequels will continue to be as good as this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Best Comic Book Movie Since ""Superman""","""X-Men"" does right exactly what Richard Donner's ""Superman"" did right. Neither film goes for camp quality, neither simply tries to put a ""comic book style"" movie - bright colors, large-scale sets - on the screen.  While the movie does contain a lot of impressive visuals, it's doesn't focus on the visuals at the expense of everything else.Like ""Superman"", ""X-Men"" takes time with its story and develops genuine rather than forced conflict.  It isn't simply a matter of ""Here's the villain, here's his master plan, now the hero fights him.""  While there is a villain, and there is a master plan, the actual conflict runs deeper than that.Ultimately, the strength of both ""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" lies in the fact that the real focus lies on the characters.  Just as Donner focused more on the relationships between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane rather than Superman vs. Lex Luthor, director Bryan Singer focuses on the interaction between the X-Men characters.  It works perfectly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good the First Time Around,"Marching orders for the director: Make an entertaining, action-heavy live-action version of the X-Men comic book.  Spend a lot of money on costumes, make-up, and even more on special effects.  Be true to the comic book as much as possible.  And above all, take it seriously.What's really amazing is that director Bryan Singer succeeds, but the movie is still not the A+ adaptation that was possible.  ""Batman"" gave us the kind of re-invented, action-packed movie we were really after.  And X-Men, while a very, very good film, is by no means a GREAT film.  The only reason I can conceive of is just that Singer is no better than his script.  The screenplay for ""The Usual Suspects"" won an Oscar, and it was a great film. The screenplay for ""Apt Pupil"" was amateurish and not at all thought out or researched, and the result was a below average film.  ""Public Access"" made little sense to me, either.Future generations may have their own opinion of this movie (or none at all), but it's nice to see someone made a decent movie out of these historical characters.  Considering the alternative (""Spawn""-- whoops), I've gotta give these guys an A for effort, but their movie's a B.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very enjoyable piece of rubbish...,"Hello, OK so I saw it last night and here's a quick run down on what I thought of it.I'm gonna address many of the points people have made in the many reviews I've read for this film one by one as to whether I agree or disagree with them.  OK, here goes:Q  Is the film enjoyable? A  Yes, I found it very enjoyable, why?  Cos it was nicely directed, had a few funny jokes in it, it had the superbly hot Famke Janssen (or is it 2 Ns, one S) wearing nice night tops, Halle Berry's wonderful breasts (yup, subtlety there) and even little Anna Paquin has grown up to be a rather attractive large breasted young thing.  Top-notch birdage all round.  Oh and of course Mystique has a fantastic body, shame it was blue and scaly.Q  Does it screw up all the X-Men timeline stuff? A  Oh yes, all the storylines the film is based on have been screwed to b****ry.  Examples include the fact that Cyclops and Iceman were supposed to be the same age and should have joined the academy at the same time, however Cyclops is a mid twenties member of the team whilst Iceman is an adolescent school boy in the classroom.  But hey, I didn't actually care much cos I've forgotten almost the entire plot from the comics and it was only Alex that reminded me of most of it.Q  Are the FX nice? A  Oh yes, lovely stuff. Nice CGI, nice Wolverine claws, yeah, t'was good.Q  Is the plot of the film too lightweight and does it think its being all serious and great when its actually not? A  Yup, the plot stank.  Overall premise was fine (after all that's the whole point of the X-Men) but it had a lot of holes in it.  And it all seemed a bit TOO much like the first film of three.  For example, The Matrix knew it was gonna be a trilogy but it answered pretty much most of what it asked.  However this film has dream sequences, underdeveloped characters and whatnot and its handled in blatantly obvious ""we're gonna build on this in the next one"" manner.  OK, so that fine but it was there for everything. Nothing was explained!Q  How well is Wolverine used? A  I thought he was pretty well used.  He was nice and aggressive and didn't really do all that much really but what he did was nice, like the first time you see his claws and he pins this large bloke against a wall with two of them and slowly extends the middle one towards his neck whilst slicing the bartender's rifle in half with the other hand.  Wolverine has the best lines from the film (the best of which I would love to spoil for you but I'll let you hear it for yourself when we go see it :) ) on both the macho front and the humour front.  Oh and there is a beautiful piece of direction when he's swinging round a prong on the Statue of Liberty by his claws and the camera follows his claws round all four sides, spinning slowly until its completely cut off.  OK so I can't explain it but you'll like it when you see it Leigh :)Q  Is Ray Park a gay stank ass? A  NO!  For the first time in cinema history we hear Ray Parks real voice! YAY!  It's just a normal London accent actually, but it suited Toad well enough.  Oh and I did like his character cos his fight scene was very nicely done and he even did a Darth Maul joke by grabbing a metal bar that was holding a lift open, spinning it in the exact same way he did with the light sabre and doing the arm to the side stance, lifted directly from Episode 1. Oh but instead of a snarl he does this really cheeky grin and it was really nicely done.  Could have been a really crap joke but he pulled it off well. He doesn't get to do much martial arts but being able to jump really, really high he does some lovely Blade-esque landings.  :)But anyway, this as turned out to be a far too long review so I'll sum up now.  X-Men is a very lightweight movie, the plot sucks and the timeline it's based on goes completely out of the window.  But it is a very nicely directed film, the acting is mostly very good (and yes, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stuart do add the required gravitas to their roles, any scene with both of them in really did sparkle) and there were a few very funny little jokes in it (like Wolverine using the middle claw to flip off Cyclops). So in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it (Adam and Alex thought it sucked by the way) and will, hopefully, be seeing it again and yes, it shall be DVD'd.Score:  7.5/10  (so I'll give it a 7 on imdb)Oh yeah and it has this one really superb death scene in it where a bloke literally melts away to nothing, it was sweeeeet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Nice and entertaining !,"I remember when this movie came out in France, some ten years ago, my brother was truly a fan of those X-Men and he would regularly talk with me about them, especially ''Wolverine''. Ten years later, I decided solemnly to watch the movie and guess what, I liked it. Though the plot is very simple, the action is far more better, as well as the dialogs, so that you cannot be bored all the film long - which is only 90 min. long ! Besides the FXs are not aging; of course, you can easily pinpoint them in the course of the movie but really, that is no pain in the ... The question that I asked after I saw this movie was : who on earth is Wolverine ? I used to read the comics, but I was surely too young to understand. For what I remember, the characters are pretty close to the comics - except the disguise; I particularly liked the Mystique character who is, to my mind, very well-done knowing that she probably was the most difficult superhuman to release, I mean, physically (you can see the make-up in several shots.) The only criticism that I may add to this review is that the end is too prompt while I hoped to learn what had happened to Mystique, Sabretooth... and Toad; that is probably the reason why I am going to watch the sequel tonight. If you have not seen the movie yet and it turns out that you hesitate to watch it (or buy it for Christmas?), do it, you will be entertained for sure!

www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com,"""We are the future Charles, not them. They no longer matter."" ‚Äì MagnetoBryan Singer's X-men plagued me with a wealth of interest based on my academic involvement in evolutionary science. It also deals with modern social struggles, superiority complexes among intelligent super-minds, quick-witted one liners and some downright incredible haircuts. This is a fond throwback to one of the key comic book films of all time, which I would argue gave faith to film companies to stick with the genre after some poor efforts in the late 90s.The story is very simple: the antagonist, Magneto, has built a machine that can force mutations within human beings, at great cost to the operator's strength. By using the machine, powered by young Marie/Rogue (infused with Magneto's metal controlling abilities), Magneto will transform several world leaders and dignitaries, who are gathered on Ellis Island NYC for a peace summit, into mutants. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey must stop him, as his device is not only deemed immoral by the X-Men, but they have witnessed the potential for it to kill humans who's cells aren't equipped to deal with forced mutation. It is however, the sub-plot of mutant alienation and criminalisation/ victimisation, and how the mutant characters deal with the shackles placed on them by society, which makes X-Men a complex, original Superhero film, and indeed series.X-men takes real life issues, such as homosexuality and disability, and places them in a surreal world, where mutants are feared by mankind because they are deemed unnatural by key figures in society. Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is that divisive figure in this film. Seeking to instill a sense of fear of the unknown in the American populous, he suggests that mutants could be dangerous, and are national security liabilities unless they can be registered. This causes a reaction within one particular mutant named Magneto, who is ready to initiate war against humans under the Darwinian theory that a species must adapt, or be replaced by a stronger, fitter one. Rather than forcing an entity of pure evil upon us in Magneto, Singer opens the film by showing the torment and evil that has befallen him under mankind; as a young boy he is separated from his parents in a concentration camp, triggering a dormant powerful mutation within him, along with a burning hatred for human beings. McKellen is the perfect Magneto. A man who has lived a life as a member of an outcast community understood the role perfectly, and was even able to offer help to Singer and his crew, understanding the more subtle social issues behind mutants. Equally convincing is his role as an ego-maniacal would-be-dictator.Unfortunately, Magneto's crew fall far short of the mark in representing what he stands for. Sabretooth doesn't have any dialogue, but offers nothing in the way of body language or facial expression to compensate. Toad makes an excellent, resilient fighter, and brings some comic relief to the Brotherhood, but his character just lacks the seriousness needed to fill the gap for the mute Sabretooth and the quiet Mystique. Mystique's make up is astounding, and her character is sleek and deadly in and out of combat. Although later X-men films focus on her a great deal more, she just doesn't get enough screen time or dialogue in the original film to have any real impact in the way that the ""lesser"" X-men do.The X-Men, under the calm, yet powerful guidance of Professor X. (expertly portrayed by Patrick Stewart against McKellen's Magneto), seek to prevent all out conflict between Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants and man, with a goal to help the two understand one another and live harmoniously. The X-men are portrayed faithfully, but just seem a little diluted, which is a shame as some sparks of on screen chemistry are quite visible, particularly between Wolverine and Cyclops. Hugh Jackman really is the perfect candidate for Wolverine, forgiving him a 12 inch height difference. His accent, facial expressions delivery of both snappy one liners (""What d' they call you? Wheels?""), and confrontational snarls are all in perfect character. Call it teething problems, but his later performances are more naturally aggressive and cantankerous than in this film, but he's easily forgiven, as Wolverine is probably the strongest character alongside Xavier and Magneto.Cyclops and Jean Grey are both competent on screen, but seem to rely (much like the entire franchise at times) on Jackman's Wolverine to help character development. This also holds true for Storm; her moral deliberation with Wolverine in Xavier's mansion is her most prominent non-battle scene moment in the film.Rogue is the final main X-man, though she doesn't become fully fledged in this film. Her character is portrayed as an innocent, misunderstood teenager who has a mutation which leaves her feeling isolated from others of both human and mutant kind. Again, her character clings to Wolverine, but far more closely than any of the others. Several poignant scenes are shared between Paquin and Jackman's characters; indeed, Wolverine is the only one who can soothe Rogue's troubled mind when she is most vulnerable, though she did inadvertently almost kill him twice. She, along with Magneto, embodies the ideologies behind the film: isolation, suffering, and alienation from normality.X-men was a very good film for a time when mainstream audiences were disenchanted with the Superhero genre. The expertise of actors such as Jackman, Stewart and McKellen, an inventive plot dealing with issues beyond just fighting bad guys and personal feuds, and, flaws aside, a passable gallery of superheros and villains immersed in a world where regular humans are an active component in the battlefield gave Hollywood something new, and arguably gave birth to the 21st century comic book film explosion.X-men (2000)Allan's Score: 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A lot to put into a movie,I love Marvel comics and am pretty much a fan of the X-Men.  This movie does a pretty good job with what they had to work with.  The thing about making a movie based on a comic book is that you have too much to be able to put into a move.  So the next question is what do you cut out.  I think they did a good job with getting Magneto's group together.  I think that most of us fans would have liked a little more origin story line for the X-Men and what about the original X-Men like Angel and ICE - Man.  For this to be truly successful it has to be a series.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An important benchmark in the genre,"This remains one of the most satisfying films in the X-Men franchise. It functions extremely well as an introduction to the cast of characters and the basic beats in their stories. Unlike the later films it doesn't get bogged down with mythos mumble-jumble and it stays rooted in easily applied metaphors to real world concerns. The film wisely leans into Stewart and McKellen to give the proceedings dramatic weight. Indeed, the cast is the best part of this film as each actor selected really fits their character.The technical aspects have aged fairly well and Singer at one point knew how to keep a film moving. The script is good enough to be engaging but it is mostly because it sticks fairly close to the comics. However, I remain extremely puzzled by how ""it croaks"" *wasn't* the completion of the line ""you know what happens to toad when it is struck by lighting?"" That line is the worse in the film but the dialogue is the weak link.While Blade (1998) was a couple of years earlier this film is important to the development of the superhero genre. It was the first massive hit since the early 90's Batman films, it reignited public interest in the genre. And while other superhero films have been *dark* prior to this, this is the first one that was semi-serious in its attempt to tackle long standing political issues. The X-Men have always been stand-ins for any number of marginalized groups, i.e. People of Color, LGBT people, etc.-and this film retains that analogy front and center. The most pleasing part of the film is how Xavier has retained his Martin Luther King vibe while Magneto retained his Malcolm X vibe. The series-like the comics-would eventually become too outlandish and insular to really engage but the introduction is excellent popcorn filmmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

As I Expected,"I`ve never been all that keen on comic strips , the only exception being the strips that appeared in the issues of the Doctor Who Weekly by Marvel comics from over 20 years ago that featured early work from legends like Dave Gibbons , Paul Nearey and Alan Moore , but apart from that I have no interest in what some people pretentiously describe as "" Graphic novels "" . Come to think of it shouldn`t books be called "" literary comics "" in that case ? No ? Well thank gawd for thatMy knowledge of the X-Men strip exactly matches my interest ie zero , so I was surprised when the movie`s opening sequence takes place in a Nazi death camp which led me to think this topic didn`t belong in this movie , but as the story progresses this ties in with the subtext of the movie . Unfortunately this subtext of xenophobia is quickly forgotten about as the movie mutates ( Geddit ? ) into a yawn stifilling battle between good and evil , the only difference being that both the goodies and baddies have superhuman powers . It goes without saying that there`s a lot of make up and special effects involved and both are disappointing especially the CGI . It`s also obvious that before X-MEN was shot it was going to be a franchise movie which means we have a fair amount of exposition which holds up the storyX-MEN is just as I expected it to be for the most part , a Summer blockbuster heavy on FX and light on plotting and characterisation . It`s not the worst Summer blockbuster you`ll ever see but just like a comic strip it lacks substance",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but could've been so much better!,"Good sci-fi drama, yes, you can hardly call it an action movie lookin past some sequences. As expected the effects were brilliant, and cool actors that suited their roles. But Bryan Singer, the talented dirctor behind the critically acclaimed The Usual Suspects, should have done a better job with the action scenes, making more out of the potential. That's this movies weakness",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Movie the X-Men Deserve,"Rated: 7.2/10 Rounded to 7I am a big fan of superhero movies. When I first saw X-men I was excited, and I was right to be. X-Men is a very good movie, it couldn't have been much better. The acting is pretty good, Hugh Jackman makes a great Wolverine and any movie with Halle Berry I believe to be worth watching (except maybe Catwoman). There are more good actors as well including Ian McKellen, who makes a great Magneto, and Patrick Stewart. The directing is good, but nothing to be too excited about. What makes the film good is mostly the special effects and the acting. Not much needs to be explained here, but the effects and the acting are really what make this film great. Definitely a film to watch if you enjoy a fun, action-packed film.Was this review helpful? If so, check out my other reviews.

"Now I'm no Geek, but I know a good film when I see one","I'm not one of those people who eagerly awaited the release of this film. I don't read the comics. I don't play the videogame. I have, I must confess, been known to watch the cartoon, but, I'm no big fan of the X men. Which is why I wasn't expecting to be wildly enamoured with the film when I went to see it at the cinema. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. They could have just churned out another comic book adaptation, knowing that a loyal fanbase would lap it up, regardless of how good a film it was. Thankfully, they did not do this and the X Men is a film with many good points. Hugh Jackman is excellent as the loner, wolverine and he must surely be on the way to become a major Hollywood player. The music is moody and the special effects are what we've come to expect from an action film. But what surprised me the most was the depth given to the characters, and the love triangle between Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey was an element that should have been further explored. The one big disappointment was the frankly abrupt ending, but I suppose that paves the way for a sequel. One that, I for one, will be going to see.Now where's the nearest comic book shop. I think I'm going to become a geek...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More action needed in the sequel,"Don't get me wrong. I liked this movie. Great performances by a cast who could have done much worse with the script. But there just wasn't enough action in this one. I assume the reasoning was that the audience needed some introducing of the characters and that didn't leave much time for special effects. Basically, this movie is a good setup for a kick-butt sequel. Looking forward to X-Men 2.....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Better than I expected.,"I have been a fan of the X-MEN comic and cartoon for years and when I heard they were finally making the movie, I was kinda worried after seeing how disappointing some of the other comic book based movies came out. >Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie turned out overall. I felt that they really got the main point of what X-MEN is about across to the audience.  Hopefully, with the sequel(s), there will be more character background now that the foundation is laid.As for the acting, Hugh Jackman stole the show as Wolverine.  Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen(?) were both awesome as Professor X and Magneto. Famke Jansen and James Marston were pretty good in their roles as Jean Grey and Cyclops even though they had little to work with (although her hair should have been redder).  Anna Paquin was ok as Rogue.  She wasn't very good at a southern accent and it was gone by the end of the movie.I don't know what they were thinking by having Halle Berry play Storm.  Like many other people, I had imagined Angela Bassett in that role. She is a superb actress and could easily convey the inner strength that Storm is supposed to have.  They could have at least had someone who looked a little more like the part like Vivica Fox or maybe Vanessa L. Williams (since Storm does have blue eyes when they are not all white).  And in this day of special effects and makeup, you would think that they could have made her hair look at least somewhat realistic.Another thing I was somewhat disappointed with is how the female X-MEN were always either getting their butts kicked or being rescued, when one of the things that attracted me to the comic was the presence of strong female characters. I wonder how or if Rogue will have her other powers (she gets from Ms. Marvel in the comics) in the sequel.As for the other villains, I felt they were all pretty good at playing their parts.  Although, out of all the villains in the comics, why Toad?Some characters I would like to see in the sequel(s) are Nightcrawler, Psylocke (why not Tia Carrere), Gambit, Beast, and more of Kitty Pryde.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much better than I anticipated,"Generally speaking, translating comics into movies results in some real travesties of filmmaking, either because the comic itself is pretty silly to begin with or the filmmakers create something totally ridiculous with no regard for the potential of the original material.  There are some exceptions however, and ""X-Men"" is one of them: it is a fun, big, splashy, intelligent, well cast (with the notable exception of Halle Berry - she's just wrong for the part), well paced, ""Summer Blockbuster"".  OK so this isn't Hamlet - but it's a damn good adventure movie, best one this year (since Gladiator).Even if you have never heard of the comic, I am sure you'll get a kick out of this movie.  Special kudos to the nearly unknown Hugh Jackman who steals the entire movie as Wolverine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great introduction for the superhero genre,"""X-Men"" is a great superhero film with great characters, a simple plot and great fun. Wolverine is clearly the leading character yet the film allows us to enjoy the other cool X-Men characters such as Storm, Cyclops, Charles Xavier etc. The plot is simple, not in a bad way but it's great the story doesn't overshadow the characters, vise versa. The actors were really good and had some depth. ALso it's great there was no blaspheming, sexual scenes which is great. This film paved the way for future superhero franchises: Spier-Man, Batman, Fantastic Four etc. It's interesting to see that having powers is something which the government is trying to control.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sir Ian and Pat are fantastic in this.,"Another average marvel film. Ive watched this movie 3 times now and each time I start to watch I get into thinking its better than I remember! However it doesn't take long to get into the second act and then become quite slow but fast at the same time. It reminds me of phantom menace, having to explain everything before it can go onto tell the story it wants to tell. Which to be fair is very interesting.Magneto. He wants the world to accept the mutants for who they are but recognises that this is an ideal world, a fantastical scenario. Xavier. He wants the world to accept the mutants, however, he still believes in mankind. He wants to build a world where mutants can have a safe space to live and prosper but amongst the humans. So when magneto proposes to help the mutant kind, you can understand and side with him in a logical way, that lacks empathy. Its still miles better than a majority of the marvel/evil guy plot and perhaps only surpased by thanos, killmonger and ultron.Another great thing about this movie, its 23 years old and still looks and sounds great. Theres hardly any bad cgi, maybe some questionable scenes here and there. The claws look amazing and so too do storm, magneto and cyclops' powers. The themes and overwl Score is great, not quite blade, but it makes up for that in other ways.The talent on screen is great, bar a few questionable performances. (Halle berry's storm for example) and this is what helps keep the movie feeling up to date. Sir Ian and patrick whenever they are on screen, they steal the show. Two great men on the opposite side of the same coin, whether its in a hallway after a government meeting or in a plastic prison over a game of plastic chess, these scenes are the strongest in the entire movie. Its not just these two, but Logan and Rogue have a nice sort of dad, daughter, ellie and joel situation going on, its warm and heartfelt, each inflicting worse than you can imagine on each other but coming together out of a deep bond shared by those experiences.On the otherhand, Sabertooth is a growling ugly mess, nothing more than fodder. Just there to be the brute force. Its boring and everytime hes on screen, it bores me. Same with Toad. Only worse because of the incredible cringe it comes with. The other character that disappoints is storm. Her acting and delivery of lines is so poor.Anything with magneto, not just the talking , but the action scenes are fantastic. The use of metal in these scenarios are intriguing, fun to watch but also leave you realising how many things are made of metal, a scary thought if a man that could control such actually existed. The cgi or practical effect used to gain the illusion of anything moving in this movie, (Jean grey included) looks fantastic. Thats not the only thing, the scenes where the X-men combine, using their powers to fight are well thought out and interesting to watch.That includes each and everyones introduction, something that is very strong for all X-men movies to come in the future. Whether its the traumatic kiss scene with rogue, the bar fight with wolverine or magneto being taking from his parents during the war, they are all great scenes.I cant say the same for the rest of the action scenes. They are close up, choppy, shaky messes of slow and poorly executed melee interactions between actors that dont have as much experience as Wesley snipes did in the previous marvel movie. If you have an action movie and the action is bad, its not a great foundation to lay. Theres a lot good with the movie, it just lacks in the most important aspects. There are a few one liners that caught me ( I laughed 3 times) but the overall banter in the group, is very forced, a far cry from what we eventually get from the avengers and guardians.Overall, its a fine movie, average in the main aspect of action, rescued by clever displays of power and the on screen giants of Sir Pat and Ian. Its. 5 out of ten, plus a whole star for those legends. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Intense action flick.,"This is what has started the comic adaptions of the Twenty-first Century. But what this great comic adaption has done is spanned the existance of the god-awful SPIDER-MAN. And since they are making a sequel, that makes it even worse.But, let's talk about this movie. The cast is great, no one could have portrayed the X-Men better. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, Patrick Stewart is Professor X, Ian McKellan is Magneto, Tyler Mane is Sabretooth, Ray Park is Toad, and Anna Paquin is Rogue. And let us just thank whoever it was that had the idea to make the cast wear black instead of the pathetically designed costumes of the cartoon series. The action sequences are pretty intense and some of the younger fans might want to stay away for a few more years, because for some reason they find it all way too scary. Even with the laughable SPIDER-MAN, some children found Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin somewhat frightening. Hugh Jackman perfectly portrays Wolverine. He looks exactly like the cartoon character. The sequel will probably ruin the great reputation that this film had and so will the sequel to the horrid SPIDER-MAN. But perhaps the greatness of X-MEN will keep it from being dismembered by the sequel in a few months. But until it is, let us all enjoy it while we can. X-MEN gets 5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A good superhero film adaptation, though a below-average movie.","Despite the fact that my days as an avid X-Men devotee finished a half decade ago, I was ecstatic upon being subjected to the reputation that this film was beginning to garner a couple of months prior to its release.  Thus, I patiently awaited for the movie to arrive with the anticipation level rising more and more as the days neared, my long-lost fanboy traits making every single fraction of a second nearly unbearable to experience. Afterall, who could resist seeing the legendary X-Men emerge on the silver screen after so many years of biding?Unfortunately, I allowed my expectations to get the best of me, and as a result walked out of the theater not only slightly disappointed, but ashamed that I had expected this to be one of the best movies of the year.The first factor that disillusioned me was the commercial campaign of the movie--things such as the X-Men television special, which revolved rather heavily on governmental mutant control, and the Mutant Watch website.  Both painted the image that this particular film would not only bring forth the subject of discrimination, but in addition, discuss it to depths which could be deemed unprecedented in the genre of superhero/action films.  Yet alas, the foregoing does not happen to prove true, and the fashion in which the subject emerges and ""thrives"" in the film adds the proverbial, lackluster Hollywood flare that so many of us hold dear.Secondly, it is to be expected that villains in superhero movies should possess a certain degree of superficiality;  but everything up to this point had suggested that at the very least, Magneto and Mystique would be the antagonists who would be most explored, while Toad and Sabretooth would play relatively minor roles.  On the other hand, the reality of the situation is that Magneto is characterized by relatively weak scenes (with the exception of the opening of the movie), whereas all of the other characters utter no more than two or three lines each in the entirety of the film.  A real disappointment indeed, as the major fights in the movie become devoid of any emotion whatsoever due to this.As far as the protagonists of the story are concerned--I'll simply state that this movie should have been called ""The Adventures of Wolverine and Rogue.""  They are the only two characters that are explored to a satisfactory degree (with rather excellent scenes in the beginning and end of the movie, no less), while Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm are simply there to provide a higher number to the group should the need for battle ever arise, with a slightly-explored Charles Xavier serving as mentor.  Honestly, where are the admirable leadership traits of Cyclops, the legendary rivalry between him and Wolverine, the ""Get away from Jean or I'll kill you"" scenes? The rivalry is essentially established by Wolverine demanding that Cyclops move away from a door, and despite the fact that Cyclops at one point mentions for Wolverine to ""Stay away from [his] woman,"" not once do we see the couple together.And, this may seem like a bit of nit-picking, but for such a high-budget movie, there are a number of scenes that really could have afforded to be redone in different techniques.  At one point in the movie Wolverine is flung about, and his body becomes contorted as it slides across the ground to the point where it elicited laughter from the audience in a rather serious moment.  The Blackbird looks like a miniature toy as it lands and moves about half of the time, and the characters, when punched or kicked, fly backwards for yards on wires and arch their way upwards in a -very- unrealistic manner.  And that's not mentioning the preposterous scenes where we see somebody flying about.The common notion for comic book films is that if one is familiar with the comic book and its characters, the film will be better understood.  Perhaps, with X-Men, this proves true to a certain extent, as in understanding where the rivalry between Cyclops and Wolverine comes from.  Yet the one thing to keep in mind is that one-line characters are the order of the day in this movie, even when it comes to some of the larger parts like that of Storm's. For what it's worth, X-Men is indeed one of the better comic-book-to-film adaptations ever (simply read positive reviews to find all that there is to like in this movie), and I did come out feeling that it was not as much of a waste as a Batman film could have been.  But I will forever remain adamant in my conviction that, with thirty more minutes detailing the characters and the world that they live in, this film could have turned out to be a contemporary classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simply the best live-action superhero movie I've ever seen.,"Just when I thought that the only way to make a good movie from a comic was animation (compare BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM with the awful BATMAN AND ROBIN), this film proved me wrong.

"Exciting & fun film, good for the whole family","I must admit, as an 18 female I was a little bit apprehensive about his movie. I had a little knowledge about the comic book characters from listening to hours & hours of my brothers chats about his fave comic book series. I think I even caught a episode or two on video, but I wasn't exactly what'd you'd consider a fan, just hadn't paid very much attention to it and so the idea of going to see this movie didn't exactly thrill me. So I went to see this movie, trying to be as open-minded as possible and guess what? Turns out I really liked the film. It was good, pure action, and not just junky special effects. It had an exceptional story (for an action film), interesting characters, solid acting (Hugh Jackman was THE stand-out), and a very, very original plot (which as you know, is a rarity these days). Above all else, it was a fun and entertaining movie. I watched it very comfortably with my two young cousins and didn't see or hear anything that upset me. There is some sparse profanity and one semi-obscene (but very common) finger gesture, and of course since it's an action flick there was some violence, but nothing too scary gruesome for younger viewers. I'd say this movie is suitable for the average pre-teen, just don't expect the grandparents to enjoy this one, it'll be over their heads. {:o) Bottom line, if you want action, skip MI:2 and check this flick out instead. It's definately worth a rental or two.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
X-Men meets my expectations.,"On Friday morning, July 14th, the X-Men was released nationwide and this is a day that I had awaited with some anticipation.  I had honestly looked forward to this movie more than any other that I can remember.Why?  Well, I'm certainly a fan, and I know that filmmaking has the technology to do justice to the presentation of superheroes without the effects looking cheesy.  If the story is solid, this should be a good film, I thought.  I was disappointed when both of Chicago's daily newspapers' reviewers gave the film a less than stunning review.Roger Ebert of the Sun Times was the more generous, giving it 2 1/2 stars, a lukewarm endorsement, while Michael Wilmington, of the Tribune panned the film with 1 1/2 stars.  Everyone's a critic and I think both these reviewers missed the mark.  Wilmington described the story as being so bad that the script must have been written in crayon.  This from a person who gave ""Titan A. E."" 3 1/2 stars!  (If you enjoyed ""Titan A. E."" please do not take offense.  While I thought that movie was visually appealing, I thought its story was weak in numerous places.  Hey, everyone's a critic, right?)I think Roger Ebert touched on two points that indicate that he failed to follow the story and does not appreciate the feel of the comic, nor the film.  He wondered openly why Magneto would risk empowering his enemies by turning them into mutants.  This was clearly explained in the movie. Magneto's motive in turning everyone into mutants was that he reasoned if everyone were a mutant, the need to persecute persons on the basis of their differences would go away.  (This is arguably a good plan.  I, for one, assume that if the world were all mutants, we would find some other way to discriminate.  Like, we would decide that some types of mutations were better than others.)Later, he allows that he does not understand the appeal of Wolverine and what would make him a major character.  Afterall, he reasons, Storm can control the weather and is the most powerful of the bunch.  Wouldn't that make her more important?  Surely, Mr. Ebert should understand the appeal of the laconic hero, such as Mifune Toshiro's Yojimbo, or Clint Eastwood's the man with no name.  Like Wolverine, these are people who might easily be bad, but choose to fight on the side of good, more or less.  They are ultimately more interesting than well defined good guys and play a pivotal role in the story.  Not that you wouldn't want Storm or Cyclops on your side!But, I'm not here to critique the critics.  I say all this merely to provide the backdrop against which I took Friday afternoon off and went to see the matinee performance of ""X-Men.""  I was not disappointed.  Was I blown away by the movie?  No.  It wasn't like seeing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which left me worn out from its seemingly non-stop action.  Nor was I as impressed as I was with ""The Matrix,"" whose fresh story and astounding special effects caught me unprepared.In the case of ""X-Men,"" I can say simply that my expectations were met.  The effects were good, convincing, but did not dominate the story.  They got Wolverines claws just right, sound and all.  Storm and Magneto both manifested their control over the elements as you might expect and Cyclop's power blast was perfect.  The story was straight from the comics in that it was true to the theme of the X-Men, but it's very basic, just about bad guys versus good guys.  It wasn't Victor Hugo nor Herman Melville, but it was a good enough story for you to care.  And, I thought they did a good job of introducing characters and getting people, who wouldn't know anything about the X-Men, into the framework of the film.  It wasn't an easy job, given that there was a wide ensemble to be introduced.  They had to compress a lot of history into what is just a few minutes.  I thought the sets were good, and the dialog was decent, no speeches, but the few lines were distributed fairly evenly across a number of characters.  Finally, just as the effects did not dominate the story, nor was it all out action.  There was a story in between the fights and the effects.Were there downsides?  I suppose that I was disappointed that we didn't get to see a lot more interaction between mutants and non-mutants, to bolster the sense of the strained relationship between them.  Similarly, we are basically trapped in the Mansion or Magneto's lair for much of the film. What we do see of the outside world indicates that it is not so different from our own and that is a plus for this film versus the comic book worlds of films such as ""Batman"" or ""The Crow.""  All in all, though, I would say they did a credible job in the time alloted to the film.Perhaps this doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement, and it's true that I am not going around telling people that they cannot afford to miss this film.  Rather, I would say that if you think you might like the ""X-Men,"" then you will.  They did a good job on this film, and I'm looking forward to their adventures in the future.P.S.  I took my wife to see the film later that evening and she liked it too!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mediocre at Best..,"How come every summer blockbuster has to be plagued with an awful script? Summer after summer, action packed blockbusters get better and better as far as visual effects and sound go, and worse and worse in the diologue and realism categoty. T2, Jurassic Park, ID-4, Men In Black, Armageddon, Star Wars Ep.1, X-Men. That is what I mean. Those of you reading this have probably seen X-men, and those of you who haven't know the details(plot, characters, etc.) from reading other reviews, so I'm going to skip that part. I'll just   tell you why X-Men will eventually fall into the same category with ID-4 and Armageddon. As of July 26, 2000, X-Men is in the IMDb top 250, and it average vote is about 8.3 or so. When Episode 1 came out, it was in the top 30 movies of all time, and as time passed, the majority spoke and realized that it sucked. Badly. The same will happen to X-Men, so don't be fooled by the good reviews you see. Oh, and while were talking about Episode 1, let me just say that Jar-Jar has just been overtaken as ""most annoying character ever"" by Toad-played by the same who played Darth Maul-small world, eh? Toad is awful. Toad is worse than awful. I can only imagine that Singer(the director) put this character in to appeal to 5 year olds, though I'm sure most 5 year olds were rolling their eyes too at this corny jack-ass dancing around like a clown on screen (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). The story is far-fetched, but fine. I have no problem with imagination as long as it is done right, and X-Men does a good job explaining mutants, etc., even though it is a pretty ridiculous plot. It explains it enough to where you can forget about the problems with it, accept that there are mutants, and enjoy what they are doing on screen. Aside from 1 or 2, the characters are fine, the story is acceptable and to tell you the truth, they set it up well at the end for the imminent sequels. But, the script is too cliche' and actually takes away from what could have been a very good film. I wont discourage people from seeing it, afterall, we sat through basically the same stuff the past few summers, and probably will do it again in '01.

Great Summer Flick,"When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I collected X-Men cards, comics, and toys.  I even watched the cartoon.  I loved it because it was such a great original idea.  Therefore when I saw the first preview of the movie, I was thrilled.  Everyone was perfectly cast in their parts.  The acting was great because everyone was their parts.  I mostly enjoyed Famke Janssen as Dr. Jean Grey and James Marsden as Scott Summers(Cyclops).  Famke is just a great actress whom I admire for her ability to play people of all trades. You may remember her as Evelyn Price in House on Haunted Hill.  She does great in all of her movies.  And for James, this movie is a great stretch for him.  He has almost the fewest lines, I believe Ray Park takes the fewest, but even without lines his acting is great.  He too can play many different types of characters.The movie is about a young girl, Rogue(Paquin), who, after discovering her powers, runs away from home.  While on the road, she meets a drifter, Logan/Wolverine(Jackman), with similar problems as her.  They are alike in the fact that they are gifted.  So after getting on the road and after having a proper aquaintance, they run into some trouble.  They are taken to a safe place where they meet many people with gifts.  While there, Rogue comes familiar with Robert Drake/Iceman(Ashmore).  Logan meets the creator, Professor Charles Xavier(Stewart), and his ""task force"", including, Scott Summers/Cyclops(Marsden), Jean Grey(Janssen), and Ororo Munroe/Storm(Berry). It is explained to him that their nemesis; Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto(McKellen) and his confidants Raven Darkholme/Mystique(Romijn-Stamos), Mortimer Toynbee/Toad(Park), and Victor Creed/Sabretooth(Mane); believe that there is a war brewing between mutants and humans and it is there duty to keep balance with humans and mutants and stop Magneto.Overall it's a great movie.  Perfect acting, perfect casting, everything was perfect.  All of my expectations were met and even conquered.  There are a few in-jokes that relate back to the comics.  Hilarious.

It may not be the best Hollywood movie but for a summer blockbuster it is very entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiffy Adaptation,"While it was accessible to general audiences, it was merely adequate for fans. Though I'm no comic freak I did wait for 2 1/2 years to see this and I was impressed with Singer(who ironically never read the comic)for visualizing a movie he had no idea where to begin. That fact shows itself to serious fans but I did not feel I wasted money. Simply put there are just too many characters and not enough time. Action sequences are pretty fine but I kept recalling Joel Schumacher's silly Batman sequels. It's obvious the special FX were a bit shoestring but it was more or less better than average. I wish they could have fleshed out Magneto a bit more and explained his and Prof. X's previous friendship. ""Wolvie"" was cool and they even made his hair look cool.

"A Competent, Easy to Watch, but Largely Uninteresting Introduction to X-Men","X-Men struggles with its first thirty minutes with a sense of slow churning coldness that feels unexciting and a bit menacing. This is made worse by underlit and badly designed sets, especially for the villains.However once the needlessly long introductions are done the film slowly comes alive. There is a large degree of thrill, however it's played far too straight forwardly and feels like a pilot episode for a series rather than a fully engaging and fleshed out theatrical experience.However the acting is amazing. Hugh Jackman is sensational and Ian McKellen is a joy to behold even if his script is not perfect.The costumes and some of the CGI effects are marvellous and the film does try to display a degree of sophistication in its visuals. The end result is a watchable and enjoyable experience but let down by unremarkable overuse of dull greys and underwhelming screenplay.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable even today...,"Of course I have watched the 2000 movie ""X-Men"" before, two or three times actually. So it wasn't unexplored territory as I sat down to watch the movie again here in 2024.The storyline in the movie, as written by Tom DeSanto, Bryan Singer and David Hayter, is good and well-written. It is a storyline that is easy to get submerged into, and it does have something for just about everyone in the audience. And that makes sitting through ""X-Men"" an easy and enjoyable task. I like how the writers managed to put together a script and storyline that was driven by the narrative, as well as leaving room for individual characters to shine and grow throughout the course of the narrative.Something that always impressed me about this 2000 movie is the cast ensemble. Wow, just wow. The cast ensemble for this movie is off the charts. There are so many great talents on the cast list. And it is no secret that it is Hugh Jackman, playing Logan/Wolverine, that is my personal favorite of the characters and the acting performances; he is just simply phenomenal in that role throughout the various movies. ""X-Men"" has a great list of actors and actresses, with the likes of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Tyler Mane, Ray Park and Bruce Davison.Visually then ""X-Men"" is great, and the CGI effects definitely help to set the stage in which this movie takes place. The effects look good and realistic, and for a movie such as this, then having believable and great CGI effects is a make or break deal.If you enjoy superhero movies then director Bryan Singer's 2000 movie ""X-Men"" is well worth sitting down and watch. And it is a movie that has enough contents to the storyline that it can be watched over and over. I've thoroughly enjoyed it each time I've sat through it.My rating of ""X-Men"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite good... for its time,"'X-men' was the long-awaited 'comic book to film' adaptation of the popular superheroes of the same name. For years fanboys debated who should play the iconic roles of the mutants (superheroes), therefore, when it finally came to production, casting was always going to be an issue. As a so-so fan of the source material, I can't really say how well ALL the mutants were transferred, but most of them seemed pretty faithful ‚Äì most.However, what let it down for me was the fact that it's called 'X-men' ‚Äì i.e. plural. There are numerous mutants ‚Äì some fighting for the noble Charles Xavier (the X-men themselves) and those fighting for the dastardly Magneto, known as the 'Brotherhood.' Therefore, because there are multiple stars in a ninety minute movie, you can't really give them all the screen time they deserve. 'Wolverine' (Hugh Jackman) is arguably the fans' favourite, so he gets much of the screen time. The others are just kind of there for him to bounce off of.Basically, it's good superheroes versus bad superheroes. So if you generally like your superhero movies then you should get something out of this.Of course it was made a fair few years before 'Marvel' superhero movies really took off, therefore it does feel a little dated compared to today's modern Thor, Iron Man and Avengers films.I have my own grips with X-men ‚Äì I never approved as Sir Ian McKellen as the villain 'Magneto.' I always thought the baddie should have the body of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the face/temperament of Al Pacino's Scarface. Having an 'English nobleman' as the supervillian just didn't seem to work for me ‚Äì he wasn't physically intimidating for me (sorry, Sir Ian!).But, overall, most people liked it and it spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs. I can watch it every now and again. It's not too long and it fills a void if I'm in the mood for something light.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good action, but for die-hard fans","X-Men provided its share of action, and plot true to the the comics, but was hard to equal on film. First of all, the X-Men comics have too many heroes to put on the screen. It seems we could only see glimpses of each character and really only knowing the background behind Magneto and Wolverine.

X-Men claws it way as the catalyst for superhero mania.,"""Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else."". Iconic. Simply groundbreaking. One could say it ""kicked up a storm""..., I'm here all day, honestly. The 90s were not particularly kind to the superhero genre, so naturally many watched the start to this franchise with trepidation. Fortunately, this was the seed for the superhero supernova that followed, and it's pretty good. Dated and slightly unfocused, but enjoyable nonetheless. Mutants are in hiding from the rest of humanity, where a school of mutants must stop a maniacal mutant from turning the rest of humanity into mutants. It's all very mutant. There's plenty of imaginative powers that are replicated from its source material. Storm can manipulate the weather, Cyclops harnesses a powerful laser beam and Wolverine has a skeleton made from an invulnerable metal. Oh, and Toad with his long tongue. Useless in combat, but I'm sure that comes in handy in other departments (bow-chika-wow-wow). It makes for some exciting spectacles, particularly the third act, that adds variety to the action. However it's the social commentary that powers the narrative. Humans debating to give equal rights to mutants can be metaphorically transferred to modern society, especially in racial context. It's a shame that this theme is underdeveloped and put aside for the action, but there is an underlying sense of justification for both sides of the argument. The acting is decent, particularly Jackman with his brutal physicality (my God...) and McKellen with his epic voice, although Paquin was considerably weaker in comparison. She's unable to express her emotions well, as she whimpers everything. But, ehh, she was young I guess. There's so much information to take in as the script builds a world filled with turmoil and superpowers, that assimilating everything is quite an achievement. It's a building block for the sequel, but this first instalment is entertaining enough to bypass the dated flaws.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"good, but not great","After all the reviews and the hype I was expecting something fantastic from this movie.  Unfortunately it seems to be let down in several major respects.  I will confess now to knowing next to nothing about the X-men, so a lot of the things I would have liked purists will probably hate.My biggest complaint is the way that the whole film seems to play like an introduction.  All the time we are expecting something climatic to happen, and it never does.  The film doesn't so much leave potential for a sequel, it leaves the plot completely unresolved.  Also, the subtext is a little too sub for my liking.When we do finally get to a fight scene it looks so completely unnatural that it just doesn't carry the drama that it should, The action seems so broken that it is almost feels like frames in a comic book.  I would have said this was really clever, and a good thing (it is a comic adaptation, after all) if it weren't for the fact the it is so pronounced you are expecting 60's Batman style ""POW""s to appear when someone throws a punch.My other gripe is about the characters.  Superheroes should radiate cool (see Burton's Batman, The Crow or The Matrix) but these just don't seem to. Possibly Wolverine was a bad choice for a lead, he seems that he should be a much darker character than he appears, and he talks to much.  Rogue was a big wet, but hopefully this will change in the sequel when she has got over the shock of being a mutant.  The only character who seems to have this innate coolness is Storm (probably something to do with those white eyes), but she is let down by Halle Berry's poor delivery of every line she speaks.Overall, it's fun for ninety minutes, with good effects, good sets and at least a vague idea of saying something worthwhile.  It's just not what I had hoped.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Nonstop action, but I wish it had slowed down just a bit.","The special effects were amazing and the movie was exciting from beginning to end, but I never found out what these mutants were all fighting for...There's obviously a lot going on beneath the surface between Professor X and Magneto - this is the central conflict in the original comic books, but this movie chooses not to delve in there at all.  Instead, it sticks with its laser blasts and shapeshifting.  There is a brief attempt to convince us to sympathize with Wolverine, but that ends up being too rushed and too shrouded in mystery to make any sense to anybody.With its arsenal of fine actors, X-Men could've paused a second to let someone say something meaningful.  I don't think I was allowed to blink for the full 104 minutes.  Visually stunning and very entertaining, but it could have been more of a movie and less of a laser-light show...Hopefully they're planning to follow in the footsteps to make X2:Judgment Day - well, you get my drift.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great Movie, but lacks in some areas","Since 1995, I waited for this movie to come out, and finally it made it's way to the big screen.  My expectations of this movie were high, and I did enjoy every bit of this movie, however, I do have a few bones to pick.First of all, the movie was way too short!  95 mins was the total runtime, and yet 2/3 of the movie was used on developing plot and background.  I mean, there's really nothing wrong with deeply defining the plot, in fact that is good, but when your limited to 95 mins, then there's a problem. There is really only 1 true action seen near the end, the statute of liberty scene.  And before you know it, the movie is over.  They should have had at least 1 more action scene that would involve a few melee combats.  That would have completed the movie and made it a 9 or 9.5, instead you'll just have to wait for the sequel.But other than that, the movie is still entertaining.  The effects are awesome, and it was well acted (very unusual for a comic flick).  I wouldn't go as far as to say that there are any oscar deserving performances, however some come close.  Hugh Jackman was a great Wolverine, and Anna Paquin was adorable as Rogue.I really look forward to the sequel(s).

X-Men:The First Epic,"The first adaptation of the brilliant comic book created by Stan Lee is perfectly translated on screen through the talented hands of Bryan Singer.Not only does X-Men have a stacked cast starring Hugh Jackman,Halle Berry,Famke Janssen,Ian McKellen,and Patrick Stewart but it also has a lot of political and social commentary.X-Men explores intolerance towards racism and homosexuality by using mutation as a metaphor for it and Bryan Singer gets his point across loud and clear.Each and every character with the exception of maybe Rogue is spot on and 100% accurate to the original comic book characters and each actor flawlessly portrays their X-Man.First let's talk cinematography, it is absolutely stunning with a very science fiction, matrix look and feel to it really creating a sense of visual satisfaction.The pacing is sort of slow but the action in the final few scenes is breathtaking and accompanied by great special effects that create the atmosphere that is X-Men.The fight sequences aren't the least bit cheesy of kung phooey they are intense and really get your adrenaline pumping waiting to see whose power will be used next.Thhis was one of the first big budget comic book movies ever produced before this was the first four Batman films, the Superman films, and Spawn making X-Men look even better by comparison.Many argue that Spiderman and Spiderman 2 are Marvel's best films ever made but i disagree I think X-Men is above the first two Spiderman movies,Daredevil,and The Hulk it is truly a work of art perfectly adapted from a work of art.My only few criticisms are the lack of action, and that there weren't many mutants in the film that i wanted to see (Beast,Angel,Gambit,Emma Frost,Jubilee,and Nightcrawler) but my craving for those characters would be satisfied by it's equally brilliant sequel and it's final epic X-Men:The Last Stand.Overall the greatest beginning to any comic book trilogy and perhaps the greatest comic book trilogy to date.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spiffy Adaptation,"While it was accessible to general audiences, it was merely adequate for fans. I'm no comic freak I did wait for 2 1/2 years to see this and I was impressed with Singer(who ironically never read the comic)for visualizing a movie he had no idea where to begin. That fact shows itself to serious fans but I did not feel I wasted money. Simply put there are just too many characters and not enough time. Action sequences are pretty fine but I kept recalling Joel Schumacher's silly Batman sequals. It's obvious the special FX were a bit shoestring but it was more or less better than average. I wish they could have fleshed out Magneto a bit more and explained his and Pros X's previous friendship. ""Wolvie"" was cool and they even made his hair look cool. Sabretooth should not have been as oafish and ass-headed as he was and fans will agree that a big fight b/t certain characters was missing(wink wink). Mystique was too cool for her own good(though I still wanna marry Romijn).Plot left a little to be desired but acting was top notch all around(except James Marsden!) which brings to mind the fact that Jean Grey was not supposed to be considerably older than Cyclops. I guess I could keep nit picking and while I know nothing compared to other people about the comic I still think that while it wasn't bad it could've been better. I do trust that the sequel will be better and I believe Singer will again be up to the challenge. All in all,it missed the mark for serious fans but certainly could've been MUCH worse.

From such humble beginnings,"The X-Men movies have become so big and the characters varied that it's actually kind of a surprise just how effective the first movie is. ""X-Men"" does its job pretty well; it establishes the origins, sets up the world and makes it palatable to the mainstream. It's got a killer opening with Wolverine up North and Senator Kelly's Mutant Registration Act as McCarthy witch hunt. The rest of the movie isn't dull, but it's hard to top that.It's certainly not without its quirks. The blinding error of casting the oddly sedate Halle Berry (who bears none of Storm's regal presence) is only offset by the spot-on choice of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. And there are a few spotty effects due to the low(er) budget, but that's nothing. Although, whoever wrote the ""Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?"" line should be ashamed of themselves.But really, when all is said and done, it makes for both a good comic book movie and solid Summer entertainment.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a good and interesting start to an amazing Marvel series!,"This first part of the series begins with the induction of two new mutants, Wolverine and Rogue, in Professor X's Academy. Intros to these characters are interesting, but the characters could have been developed a little more. The talented actors chosen to play these two characters, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, is an interesting choice, and are utilized quite well. Though Mystique doesn't have much of a character, Rebecca Romijn is exquisitely hot as the seductive shape-changing accomplice of Magneto. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are good as the leads of the two sides. Actors like Halle Berry and James Marsden are quite underutilized, and I hated the way the movie undermines Cyclops' character and pays too much focus on Wolverine's; in the animation series, Cyclops is the formidable and admirable leader. I loved the way they show how Rogue's front white hair came about.Overall, it's a good and interesting start to an amazing Marvel series, which is the most mainstream allegory on the Gay & Lesbian community.

The Starting Point,"The first X-Men is ,at the time of this review ,16 years old. Wow.

But its legacy it is unquestionable for it gave birth to the great superhero flicks of the New Millaia which dominate the Box Office.As for the casting Patrick Sturat as Professor X, Ian MacKellen as Magneto were wish fulfillment to fans around the world. Dispute these great casting Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is the show-steal-er here and his portrait is the reason why most X-men films have him as a center character and he was the only one to get solo films apart from Deadpool. And something mind-blowing is that when he was first announced many disagree ,because he didn't looked the part, but after that film mouths shut.As for the action is well directed and entertaining, though the final plan of Magneto is quit cartoony, which a bit ruins the film for me, but that is my only major drawback.

"A Solid First Film in the X-Men Franchise, but not Great","This in addition to being the start of the ""X-Men"" franchise was also the first superhero film of the 2000s as well as the first major adaption of a Marvel comic. This was a pretty solid movie with plenty going for it, even if there was better to come.Of course, one of the best things about this franchise is Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. He is a tough joker and someone you don't wanna mess with and also very interesting to watch. He was made for the role just like how Christopher Reeve was made for Superman and Robert Downey Jr. was made for Iron Man.Many of the supporting characters are also interesting. Patrick Stewart is great as Professor Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen makes for a great villain in Magneto. Mystique, Storm, Cyclops, and Sabertooth also compliment the film nicely.The film has a solid enough story and some pretty exciting action sequences. I also liked the music score.However, one issue is that a lot of the supporting characters, while cool, weren't developed quite enough. One character I didn't care for was Anna Paquin's Rogue, who was a bit whiny.There isn't really anything to make the film anything more than solid. It really kind of felt like they were holding back some with this film. It isn't surprising that director Bryan Singer considers this to be the ""prologue"" to the ""X-Men"" series.It's still a good, solid movie that laid the groundwork for the ""X-Men"" movies.

Impressive!,"I have to admit I hired this movie purely as part of a Hugh Jackman fan phase, however I think the movie delivered far more than I required of it; a lovely surprise.I've never read a comic strip in my life, so I can't compare the film with the comic series, and to be honest I wouldn't want to. Whatever the comic series may have or have had, the film stands strong enough all on its own.The writing of the Wolverine character was brooding, intriguing, and totally believable, and Hugh Jackman slipped into the part with his usual ease and extraordinary charisma. Anna Paquin, as Rogue, was awkward at times, but seamless at others. Perhaps she has a great deal of natural talent, as long as she can be made to relax and forget about the acting? I expect she will continue to develop into an excellent actress. McKellen and Stewart were perfect in their roles, but I would have liked more screen time with Storm, as I felt her character was under-developed on screen and Halle Berry is capable of great things.As for the special effects, they blended into the background, just as I feel special effects should. Due to the powers of the mutants special effects are crucial to the basic plot, and it was great to see the director and designers creating effects that served the story with complete obedience, rather than dazzling and distracting. The film, after all, is not about the powers but about the choices of the people use or abuse them.The story flowed well, the pacing was just right and the plot was easy to understand but still captivating. The characters were recognisable and the themes were universal. In short, the script had all the compulsory characteristics of a typical pop film, however a fantastic collaborative effort between director, writers, actors and designers has ensured that X Men does not feel stale.

X-Men,"The original X-Men date to 1960s American comic books and were created by the recently deceased Stan Lee along with Jack Kirby. The line-up here is somewhat different but will be more familiar to the younger generation, who will probably miss the joke about yellow spandex.As usual with films of this nature, the plot is both predictable and fairly irrelevant: a supervillain and his henchmen are Hell-bent on either world domination or destruction on a massive scale, and the good guys are here to see this doesn't happen.With this film also it is probably best not to read too much into the origins of the characters and any political allusions, ie about people being alienated, hated or even murdered because they look different or are different.Where ""X-Men"" scores is of course with special effects, and it does so grandiosly, unless of course they really did destroy the Statue Of Liberty in the climatic finale?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finally - a cool comic adaptation,"I'm sure I wasn't the only comic fan wary of the X-Men movie. I couldn't wait for it to come out but half-expected it to disappoint. So imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a very slick, well-produced film.The makers obviously identified the problem of having too many heroes so reduced it five (and did well with their choices). Predictably, Wolverine steals the show. In fact Hugh Jackman turns in a first-rate performance as Logan - making up for my early disappointment when I heard last year that Russel Crowe turned down the role. Scott and Jean were both underused I thought and I didn't really like the dumbing down of Jean's abilities but they can develop. In fact the sequel should be even more impressive. This movie has defined the characters, culture and context very well. The next one can just be an action-packed romp.Can you imagine a Bond-style opening featuring the X-Men? How cool would that be? And a very good way to introduce a new mutant or two (hint hint writers/producers).Special mention for the 'cameo' mutant appearances such as Bobby, Kitty and Jubilee. Hopre to see more of them next time.An X-L-ent film. Nothing too cerebral. Just great fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
get over it,"I saw x-men in Australia and I thought it was great. The movie should of been a bit longer, But other than that it was great.Now i am not a die hard fan like some of you(i have seen it on t.v and read some comic books),but after reading some of your comments about the movie, i just have to say get over it.its silly to think that a movie would be the same as the comic book. You tell me in the history of movie that a book ,t.v series or comic book are dead on with the movie.I'll give you two examples,I used to read 2000 ad and i did enjoy reading Judge Dredd,so when the movie was coming out i couldn't wait to see,But when i did ,i was a bit unhappy in it, but i got over it. Second one was Forest Gump,now i did read the book and saw the movie and they are not the same. So what i am saying is,get over it ,so the movie was not dead on with the comic book,SO WHAT!!!,just to see it made into a movie is just great. One last comment ,the acting was great.i did enjoy Hugh Jackson and Anna Paquin,they were great.and to all of you who thought she was wrong for the part,i just got three words to say to you, GET OVER IT!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A comic book movie with depth,"One of the things that made the Marvel comics special back in the 60s was their quirkiness.  Spider-man agonized about the same stuff that other teenagers did.  Maybe not acne, but problems with fitting in to the adult world. Superheroes with problems.The X-men have problems, too. They may have some phenomenal powers, but they're outsiders.  They look human, but their powers put them on the outside.  Feared and misunderstood, they are targets.Targeted by a Senator as a threat to humanity, they face the sort of persecution that supposed ""Reds"" did at the hands of Senator Joseph McCarthy and HUAC.They are also the targets of the super-villain, Magneto (Ian McKellan).  He feels that there will be a war between humanity and mutantkind.  But he has a plan to swing the tide.  All he needs is one special mutant.Magneto is aided by a trio of mutants: Sabertooth, Toad (""Episode I's Darth Maul: Ray Park) and Mystique.Opposing them are, of course, the X-men. The main group this time are Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops and Dr. Jean Grey. Others make cameos this time around, like Iceman.But what makes this movie more than just a special effects romp is the subtext.  That has to do with fear and prejudice. Magneto feels that the mutants will be treated in the same way that his Jewish mother was during WWII: despised, imprisoned and killed. (Explaining to my six-year-old nephew about concentration camps was one of the toughest and most frustrating things I've ever done)Great performances from Patrick Stewart (Prof. X) and Ian McKellan (Magneto) also lift the film above the usual comic book movie fare.Some of the scenes might be a little intense for youngsters. My nephew had his eyes covered during some of the scenes (like the Senator's final scene), but very little overt bloodshed.Good stuff.  Looking forward to the sequel which they left ample room for.Eight stars.  Uncle Steve says check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much cooler than expected,I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed this movie.  I don't usually like comic book movies even if the special effects are amazing (which they definitely were in this one).  This movie kept me entertained and interested almost the whole way through.  The story line wasn't amazingly intricate but it was plenty there for a movie of this type.  Not too much unnecessary violence but plenty of opportunity for the X-Men to display their powers in entertaining ways.  I hear there's going to be a sequel and honestly can't wait.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

X-Men,"I am in no way a comic-book fan, but X-Men is one of my favorite comics and the movie adaption was incredibly well made.What this film did right was to capture the essence of the original comic, much like Hulk. The maker's already set the mood right with the shot of the concentration camp at the beginning and the film retains this tone all-through-out.The film also has a brilliant cast, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart pull off their roles as the two best recognised figures in the X-Men and Marvel universe. Undoubtedly the actor who always makes my day is Hugh Jackman, who is just perfect for the role of Wolverine. As such it's rather a pity that some of the other characters have a harder time standing out, but ones that definitely do are Rogue and Mystique.The film is not unfortunately flawless. Despite it's brilliant execution I always felt that the film lacked a certain amount of drama. Even though it is an excellent film, I still think that Hulk pulled it off better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The movie that started off a franchise.,"X-Men. The movie that started off a franchise.The 2000 movie with an all-star cast (namely, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Halle Berry) started off a movie revolution, reinventing the X-Men franchise as we knew it forever.Rogue (Anna Paquin) is a young girl whose mutant powers prevent human touch, for fear of harming anyone she touches. On the run from her human family, she meets Logan (Jackman), a mutant with the name of Wolverine. However, Magneto (McKellan) has other plans for the young Rogue, and it's up to Xavier (Stewart) and the X-Men to get them both to safety before it's too late.With CGI ahead of it's time and acting that will stick with you for long afterward, X-Men is definitely a movie to watch. A total of 9/10 for this movie, I recommend this whether you're a Marvel fan, a fan of one of the many talented actors involved, or just a fan of sci-fi, this is an amazing movie that you will want to watch more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best Comic Book Movie Ever Made,"It ROCKED.  No, even more than that.  It REALLY rocked.  I was so happy, it was a fantastic film, with no gaping plot problems, and wonderful acting (especially in Wolverine, Prof. X and Magneto).  Great action sequences, too.  They made the TOAD into a worthwhile villain.  It had superb design sense on sets and costumes, not going overboard like the Batman films while still retaining the essence of the original.

Anyone who has read the 'Tommorow People' arc in Ultimate X Men will know what i mean when I say that is what the movie should have been. Quick introductions fr the characters and then a rollercoaster action pic all the way. What we get is a fairly slow movie, with only a few action scenes. It has a distinct lack of bite, Senator Kelly is underused and should have been accompanied by Sentinals, but that's all my complaints. Except why Toad? Why not Gambit, Colossus, Beast, Iceman (in a real role) or Angel? There aren't nearly enough Mutants used. However the film IS the best comic book movie yet.

Patrick Stewart apparently had a ball as Professor X and Anna Paquin and Ian McKellan played their respective roles to perfection.

(F)X Men: Take a good look at this jewel,"I've seen X Men like ten times on TV and I regret not seeing it on theater. The FX, amazing. The performances are superb, specially for a Sci-Fi/Action/Comic Book film with a shining MacKellen. The cast itself is remarkable, mixing hardcore action performers with award-winning actors. Bryan Singer is a not-that-young talent, I've seen most of his movies (X-Men, Stephen King's Apt Pupil & the best crime movie except for the Godfather of course, Usual Suspects) and he shows his good taste for the visual here.If you don't like the fact that sometimes it doesn't follow the comic book or the beloved cartoon, Screw You. Or don't like the plot, blame Stan Lee. But the plot, while not *intelligent* or *subtile* is very real, after all it's nothing else than Martin Luther King vs Malcolm X; ironic, isn't it, the fact that Magneto is Malcolm and not Professor X. It's a tremendous film that deserves a sequel, oh, right, it'll have one, no surprise, after all it left everything prepared for one.By the way, it DID HAD character development, I can come out with some sort of profile about 'em, those who didn't see it have no perception at all. Screw You Too.And the silver and gray lighting in some parts of the movie are delightful to the eye. Special mention for the X Women: Famke Jansen, Halle Berry & Rebecca Romijn are in my hot list of the hottest chicks. That adds a couple of points to this film's rating.Oh, don't forget to see the sequel so that it becomes a sheer success and we may have X3 & X4; it actually looks darker (not the lights, the plot and violence/action) and will luckily bring us a better prospect 'bout the X World and the X Guys themselves (it'll be great to see more mutants than the first one, shame they still won't bring my favorite, Gambit, yet).Rating: 12/10 (yeah, I gave it a 9 before, but to be faithful to the comments...)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great start to an amazing franchise,"In the world where you have a super hero movie every year or sometimes even up to 4. Deadpool, Batman v Superman, Captain America and X- Men: Apocalypse.X-Men is an instant sci-fi classic, combining impressive special effects with an involving plot to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.Lacking the tongue-in-cheek camp of the later Batman films and other recent comic books-turned movies, X-Men draws the audience into its world of mutants and superpowers, and prevents it from becoming tacky or absurd. Not to say that there isn't any humor in the film, in fact it delivers some of the best one liners in a film this year.It is a rare thing for an action blockbuster to feature great acting, but with a cast that among others involves both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is bound to be above average. Both Stewart (as Professor Charles Xavier) and McKellen (as Magneto)deliver stellar performances, and their on screen chemistry is compelling as they play two old friends turned arch enemies.The rest of the cast deliver solid performances, including Hollywood newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Oscar-winner Anna Paquin as Rogue, and another rising star Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the seductive but deadly Mystique.A classic tale of good versus evil, with heroes, baddies, and great special effects, I don't think it's going too far to say that X-Men is destined to be mentioned in the same breath as Star Wars and other all-time sci-fi greats.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Waited 20 years for this.....,.....And I LOVED IT!!!!  This was everything I have been dreaming about since I was 10 years old and read my first Uncanny X-Men comic book!  For those of you who went to see this movie without knowing a single thing about the X-Men and were confused all I can say is this movie was NOT made for you!  The die-hard fan was clearly the target for this movie and they scored a direct hit.  I loved the opening scene showing Magneto's first use of his powers as an adolescent.  And why didn't they explain all the other X-Men's origins?  That's what the sequels will be for!  This movie clearly focused on Magneto's hatred and fear of humanity and humanity at large's hatred and fear of mutants in general.  The side stories of Jean Grey/Cyclops/Wolverine and Wolverine/Rogue were well handled and really brought the characters to life for me.  I've seen some comments complaining there were 'inside' jokes that only fans of the comic books would get; huh? excuse me? 'Inside' jokes are MEANT to only be understood by true fans of the comics and TV series! Anyway I'm sure there are lots who disagree with me and  that's great BUT I loved this movie and I am positive that anyone who has seen the TV series or read the comics whether in the last year or 30 years ago will love it as well.   10 out of 10 (in case you couldn't figure that out from my review!),10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An excellent start for the franchise, with promises of more and better.","I am not very used to films about comic book characters, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about the characters and films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of films starting with the prequels, in order to better understand what I was seeing. So this film, which was the first in the franchise, was the third film I saw.In this film its revealed how a disoriented Wolverine, meets Marie, who will be called Rogue. Its also shown how both are found and helped by Charles Xavier, who takes them to his school-mansion and integrates them in the X-Men. It is the first film in the franchise and a very solid start, in which we are introduced to some of the most iconic characters in the X-Men universe: Xavier, Wolverine, Rogue, Storm, Cyclops and other mutants that we quickly recognize, not only from comics but also - and particularly in my case - from the TV animated series, which were particularly popular in the Nineties. The film reaches its climax with a great confrontation between the group and the mutants of the Brotherhood, formed and led by Magneto.The script has the characteristic of introducing us to many of the most striking characters in this universe. Despite this, the time given to some characters (Storm, Cyclops etc.) is short. They are not a relevant part of the story told, although they have to appear. Many will find it bad, maybe even because they have a preference for these mutants but I, who am not a particular fan of a specific character, thought it was a sensible option for the director and the screenwriter. There are many mutants and paying attention to everyone would make the film tiring. The film focuses on four characters: Rogue, Wolverine, Magneto and Xavier, with the latter two embodying their usual rivalry and leading their respective teams.The cast is made of safe bets, as it has many actors that we know from other works and that have already proved their talent. This is the case with Hugh Jackman, who proved to be a wise choice for Wolverine. I don't know how far the actor knew he was accepting one of the most striking and popular works of his career, but the truth is that the character sat perfectly on his shoulders. The same can be said of Patrick Stewart, a veteran who has already done other sci-fi works (Jean-Luc in Star Trek). Looking at him, he was the right choice to play Xavier and its now difficult, even for me, to think of an alternative. Another proven veteran is Sir Ian McKellen, who gave his Magneto an elegant wickedness and cynicism, preventing the villain from becoming a clich√© without any depth. Anna Paquin was a less obvious option for Rogue, but the fact is that it worked well, making this character more vulnerable an fragile. In a second line, we still have the good performances of Famke Janssen as Jean Gray, Halle Berry as Storm and Rebecca Romijn as Mystique. Who stands out for the negative is James Marsden, who turned Cyclops into a bland, cold and uninteresting human being.In addition to these merits, the film has excellent production values that should be highlighted. Its a Marvel film and there are millions of dollars involved, which is quite evident from the beginning. Visually, its a show in itself, with great visual effects and the best CGI that money could buy. The action scenes and sequences never leave aside a certain soft and subtle humor that makes everything more fun. The climax is a great and eye-catching action sequence at the Statue of Liberty, an American icon that always looks good in the movies. The film makes good use of urban landscapes, especially New York, and has excellent sets and luxurious and detailed costumes. Cinematography is excellent and makes good use of color, light and shadow. Editing was also well accomplished, which results in a perfect pace, with no dead moments or scenes that we feel left in the film. I think its fair to greet the makeup department and the very epic soundtrack by Michael Kamen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
wonderful adaptation,"Evolution has created the next link in the chain, people who have special powers. They have been classified as mutants by the 'normal' population, who fear these different people, greeting them with trepidation. Rogue has only realised she is a mutant after she place her boyfriend into a coma; she takes peoples' energy. On the run she runs into Wolverine; another mutant with fast healing abilities and three retractable blades on each hand. The two are attack by an mutant Sabertooth on unknown intentions, Rogue and Wolverine are saved and taken into the care of Professor Xavier; with his prot√©g√©s Storm, Cyclops and Jean. Xavier has been fighting for equality between mutants and people, but a former friend Magneto has the opposite idea. Magneto want superiority over the human race; believing mutants are the next ruler of earth. Magneto has devised a plan with his henchmen Sabertooth; Toad and Mystique that will make people think differently about mutants.X-Men is a faithful adaptation of the comic book series, without ever falling into the pit of over the top sensibilities. Bryan Singer has played it on the lower keys where the characters come to the fore front; instead of the action. There are a lot of character in X-Men, yet it doesn't over load you. They may not be fleshed out a lot, but your still are able to understand them and attach yourself to them. The most developed is Wolverine who has a lot of past to uncover, yet it still would have been nice to have more depth on the other characters.The action is kept on the low down, there isn't a lot of it, and it soars in that respect. With action and special effects kept to the minimum, they have been able to develop the characters and the story. As the special effects are used a lot, it allows the scenery to come forward, and the scenery is visually rich and detailed. X-Men has a real quiet tone, but from this the subtexts really are uncovered. There are a lot of ideas and morals beneath the surface; acceptance, tolerance, bigotry,social stature, and that fear that everyone has when they don't understand the unknown. There are some great scenes between Rogue and Wolverine that elevate this from just am action film and really humanise the story. There is a sense of realism to the story, reflecting a lot of the racial intolerance in humanity at our current times.X-Men shows what great casting can lead to. All the actors perfectly fit their roles, with a lot of unknown actors showing some great talent. Hugh Jackman is great as the rugged Wolverine, Famke Janssen wonderful as Jean, same with Halle Berry as Storm, Anna Paquin shines as Rogue, James Marsden also great as Cyclops. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart both are great in their roles, Ian as the determined Magneto and Patrick as the humble Xavier.X-Men is one of the better comic book adaptations as it goes beyond the action and delves deeper to bring a very deep and meaningful story, with so much subtext to explore.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Wow!  Knowing little about X-Men didn't matter --Excellent!,"More movies should be made with this much care.  It certainly did everything that movies are supposed to do:  It was entertaining, it held my attention throughout, I was able to suspend my belief, and I was drawn in by the story and kept ""inside"" the movie's reality with engaging and well-drawn characters.This is truly a rarity -- a Summer Blockbuster with a real story (most are analogous to porn -- in that there is no plot but manages to do what it is supposed to do at the basest and fleeting of ways).  The effects were made for the story, not the other way around.  I am not an ""X-Men"" fan but I know who they are.  I am sure there are fans who don't like the movie; just like people who have read the book first -- it can never be the same.I was especially taken with the underlying story of prejudice and how the down-trodden feel and react to their oppressors.  This is a scary view into the history of man.  It explores one of our potentially harmful traits -- wanting to judge and blame certain peoples for our troubles.  Fear and a feeling of a lack of control is something you can see as a motivating force for some of the main characters  With this, you get a really good idea of Magneto not simply as ""main-villain-we-are-supposed-to-hate"" to more of a man with his own ideas of how best to deal with the prejudice against him and his kind.The acting was very good, especially with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. The man who plays Wolverine was especially into his role and very effective. It was great to see Anna Paquin again.  I doubt she will get a nod for this role from the Academy, but she played it as it was supposed to be played -- as a sad young innocent just trying to find her place in the world. The relationship between Rogue and Wolverine was well written and grew as the picture played.Above all, it is the best Summer Blockbuster I have seen in a long time! The action sequences were engaging and cool!   There are a lot of details to see, I think this is a movie worth paying for to see more than once!  The great thing about it is that there isn't just one or two things that work in this film.  The whole thing works!  I am sure I can find its weakness after more viewings, but I still think its strengths far outweigh any mistakes. I am 31, and I really enjoyed it!  My brother went with me, and he said that he believed that at least it would be nominated for an Oscar (TM) for Makeup -- I agree.Bryon Singer surrounded himself with credited and uncredited talent, and it shows.  Fortunately the movie did not drown in this pool of talent.  Of course, there seemed that some things were left out (the only ""anti-human"" mutant's background we know about is Magneto's); but that just means I was interested enough in what I WAS told to want to know more.  Besides, no-one wants to see a ten hour movie; and there are always sequels.  This movie does promise a sequel, but not with a cheesy cliffhanger.  It offers enough to stand on its own, while making you care enough about the characters and their situation to WANT to see more.And that is the greatest compliment I can give this movie:  It left me satisfied, but at the same time it ended making me want more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Non-stop Action-packed Blockbuster,"When I sat down in the theatre and waited for the movie to begin, I thought, ""Oh man, this is gonna be so cheesy.""  I honestly believed it would be a movie with no plotline, no character development, just a bunch of guys beating on each other with super powers thrown into the mix.Not so.X-Men is a well-written, beautifully acted film.  The characters have substance (some more than others) and the plotline is sound.  Of course, the incredible special effects helped make the movie what it was supposed to be. Hugh Jackman is hilarious as the cynical Logan, and the rivalry between him and Cyclops (James Marsden) adds more humor. Toad (Ray Park) fills in the blanks.  Ian McKellan is very believable as the corrupted Magneto, and some fan-favorite X-Men have cameos as students at the Xavier Institute (Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, Cannonball, Shadowcat, and Colossus).This movie was a dose of reality.  It reinforced the idea that they CAN base a movie on a comic book or video game character that won't bomb in the box office.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I want to see it again...,"I will pay this film my highest compliment:  I want to see it again.It was much more than I expected; especially after reading some lukewarm reviews about the characters that X-Men aficionados felt were missing, the special effects and other trivial minutiae.BUT ¬ñ for someone (me) that has never read an X-Man comic and knew nothing about the characters, this is an exciting, well-told story with characters that had the boldness of comic book characters, all told in a visually gripping style.The story would appear to hinge on Wolverine but it makes a smooth transition to the real lynchpin of the plot.I am quietly grateful that Hugh Jackman was a last minute replacement for the actor that was originally scheduled for the part of Wolverine. He has an incredible intensity and screen presence that cannot be entirely attributed to his character.  He Rocks!Anna Pacquin as the mutant unsure of who she is and how she fits in ¬ñ either in the Mutant society or the ¬ëreal' world ¬ñ turns in a performance with just the right amount of ¬ëangst' and still is believable and can be taken seriously.One of the naysayers in another review I read said that Halle Barry was misscast as Storm¬Ö.  I disagree.She is undeniably beautiful and looks more like a comic book hero (especially with her blonde mane) than anyone else in the film.Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters) was suitably chilling as the evil Magneto and Dr. Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) arch nemesis.Ray Park (Darth Maul from Star Wars) was supremely disgusting as Toad.  I ended up wishing he had more screen time.But what held this film together above all was the dialogue ¬Ö there had to be a certain amount of exposition for the non-X-Men audience; but it had the basics of the story and moved the plot along at a steadily increasing pace.All things said I was not able to find many faults with this film and I cannot wait for the sequel(s).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Could have been worse, could have been better","Not a bad attempt and given Marvel's history of *terrible* films, this one is a pretty good effort.

The plot isn't all that terribly well thought-out or explained, however, and the exposition zips by like a bullet train. Storm and Cyclops are little more than moving standees, unfortunately.

Mutated humans battle evil mutants.,"Comic book  fan or not, you will enjoy this movie.  The film is plot driven with twists and subtle turns not often found in an action movie.  And of course there is the action and special effects we have come to expect in our age.  There are differences that will disappoint the Marvel Comics readers but also some that are engaging which can't be said for all screen adaptations.  The movie is well cast (excepting Cyclops) and focuses on Wolverine who is well played by Hugh Jackman even if he is taller than the 5'4 character.  The movie is not an ensemble, but relegates even Patrick Stewart (Professor X, Jean Luc Picard for you trekkies) to a supporting cast role despite his strong performance.  The movie certainly was a hit for my 13 and 11 year old kids and was appropriate viewing for children their age without excessive violence or adult content.  There is some minor swearing. There is obvious sex appeal for the adults in addition to the story and action.  While, Famke Janssen (strong resemblance Elizabeth Hurley) as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos - Mystique will keep the men entertained, my wife couldn't stop talking about Wolverine on the way home.  There's not much that I can say about the plot without giving too much away other than, as expected, bad guys try to take over the world and good guys try to stop them.  Certainly an old premise but done with flair. Ian McKellen does a masterful job of portraying the villain Magneto without being over the top and maintaining a believable quality.  In the end, the movie left several openings for a sequel and the audience wanting more.  As a fan of the X-men comics, etc., I expected an ending with a little bit more flourish, but was more than happy with the overall film. 8",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Despite its shortcomings, X-Men makes for reasonably interesting viewing with spits and spots of various character plus story elements combining in an obtuse fashion.","Structurally, X-Men is all over the shop. Its building, brooding hour and a half of character and conflict is stretched out to an awkward length during which things unfold, but sporadically before having everything land at an overall 'base' in which a finale of good vs. evil can predictably play out. But the getting there is enjoyable enough, if a little scattered and episodic; the fun the film has with its lead refraining from taking either side, even though there are those in one camp so desperately wanting him to join them, keeps the film from descending too quickly into that aforementioned battle. Small, relatively inconclusive sub-plots bulk up the runtime and make us feel more gets done that perhaps does; the sense of the franchise being set up is certainly prominent in this first edition in flirtations and meek romance between characters; rivalries between others as well as an entire back-story shared between the two most powerful characters in the whole film is only hinted at, but not fully explored. Regardless, from its muddy and grotty opening during which an individual who's rendered an outcast by a superior force suffers at the hands of human beings, right the way up to its climatic fight on Liberty Island during which a similarly desired extermination of a 'race' must play out; the 2000 film X-Men, an adaptation of a comic book series of the same title, works.We begin with, mercifully, one of the film's very few expositional moments during which an American senator explains to a crowded room just what the mutants are and what threat they may or may not pose, the the view being to take away their right to hide as mutants and make themselves known. We're in, and, like everyone in that room, informed on what everyone is and the general proceedings. Later on, we get a sense of how important this issue is to everyone when the item is placed relatively high up on the United Nations' mandate at their annual meetings. The film provides us with a lead in the form of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, a mutant with the power of invulnerability of which many will rightly point out there is usually little to no peril when revolving a text around an indestructible lead, although he does come with a sort of secondary 'power' in the form of indestructible metallic blades which shoot out of his knuckles when provoked.Wolverine come across like Clint Eastwood came across as Blondie; complete with gruff voice and nary a cigar too far away so as to easily light up and chomp down on a fresh one now and again, in the process struggling to find much compassion and rarely ever being anything but cynical of what or who might be around him. His introduction, after the brief political speech, sees him forebodingly dominate his human counterparts in the outback of Canadian snowy nowhere as he persists in winning tavern-set cage wrestling matches. In providing us with Wolverine as a lead, we are spared having the film revolve around someone ready to accept his role as a mutant and thus are granted the chance to observe an arc dedicated to coming to terms with one's identity on top of future ideas linked to where one comes from.The leader of a large proportion of mutants is a certain professor named Charles Xavier (Stewart), whom has set up a base disguised as a school for the gifted in order to bring in young mutants so they may learn more about their powers and how to control them. Under his tenure, Cyclops (Marsden); Storm (Berry) and a certain Jean Grey (Janssen) have prevailed; the mutants on this side of the ideological fence retaining generally 'normal', human-like features in their basic appearance and that each of them are either very handsome or rather attractive in general, as they, complete with Xavier, inhabit this rather beautiful, isolated locale of an academy. On the other side, Ian McKellen's Magneto inhabits a very dark, dingy base of operations with his office taking on a very ugly, metallic, cubist form while his minions are these abnormal creatures whom carry disfigured, scarred bodies in the likes of hulking Sabretooth (Mane); an ugly, blue lizard-type shape shifting creature named Mystique (Romijn) and the, well, toad-like mutant named Toad (Park). Despite being a victim of a proposed purification himself as a young boy at the Nazi death camps, it is Magneto's goal to himself purify human beings as mutants so a more ""developed"" species can take over, before we supposedly wipe them out; a kind of rooted hatred of humanity after what happened all those decades ago. It's an interesting move from director Singer to ask us to root against this character, given what we saw him suffer through at the beginning.The fitting element to the conclusion, during which a U.N. meeting is taking place in New York City and Magneto wants to 'mutantanise' the members, is that the final fight unfolds on The Statue of Liberty; itself a piece of iconography symbolising liberation; freedom and freedom of choice ‚Äì the key thing being that Magneto is out to sabotage these things in reaction to the popular pass that mutants must surrender their own freedom of choice to remain in the dark. We only need to be told once where the fight is unfolding, and a number of exterior shots during this climax only serve to emphasise the point. At its worst, X-Men is the equivalent of watching a series of slightly interesting battles between expensive action figures giving a makeover by way of a computer, as numerous dead-end sub plots worm their way to nowhere; but these complaints minor and rarely happen. At its best, it's an interesting and genuinely fun romp about, at the most, three conflicting ideologies during which oneupmanship is the rollicking order of the day.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good introduction to the Marvel Universe.,"Batman, Superman, and several other comic book icons had been coming to the big screen for years, but none of those movies really required the sheer ambition that was necessary to bring such a beloved and complicated, ensemble style book like X-Men to film. I don't think that X-Men was quite as good as the first Spider-Man or Batman movies, but it succeeded admirably in putting together the world and characters necessary for it's sequel, X2, to be such a great movie.I think that Bryan Singer and the producers made a lot of good decisions with this movie. Focusing the story on the relationship between Wolverine and Rogue was smart, as were most of the casting decisions. The film adaptations of the various characters and their powers were not perfect, but they certainly could have been worse. The special effects were great for their time, too.For all those things that it does right, though, I still consider it to be only slightly above average. Maybe the reason that I don't love the move more, is because I've seen it so many times that it has little left to offer me. I don't ever remember thinking it was amazing though, even when it was new. X-Men is a decent comic book flick, but it pales in comparison to its much better sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This was the coolest movie ever,"I never actually read the comics, but I watched the cartoon X-Men, and when I saw they were making a movie, I was ecstatic.  I was afraid they might ruin the story and change everything, but when I saw the movie, I loved what Singer (director of the Usual Suspects) did with it.  I think that Hugh Jackman, who played Wolverine, was perfect for the character, and that all the other actors did a great job as well.  I really hope they make a sequel to this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"While it won't be anyone's favourite, this is a very solid first entry.","X-Men, in many ways, is the first true ""modern superhero"" film and revisiting it all these years later, it's striking to me grounded and small scale the film feels compared to so many of the outlandishly large scale and cartoony later MCU films ended up being.At the end of the day, superhero films were an unproven commodity back in 2000, and needed to be as relatable and accessible to a mainstream audience as possible. This film feels firmly grounded in the trends of the time, from the ""futuristic"" font, to the John Williamesque music, to the guy who plays Toad looking like a specific type of white man you just don't see anymore (iykyk). Perhaps it's most defining feature is that it strips away all the comic book zaniness - including yes, yellow spandex - for grounded sci-fi action.I liked the realistic stakes in this movie; essentially, Magneto is trying to...mutanize global leaders, and while it's sort of a silly plot, the idea of him essentially trying to assassinate humanity's leadership feels high stakes, but not so cartoony that it's hard to relate (aka basically every 2010s superhero flick.)Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is obviously the standout character and performance here; the franchise would come to essentially be his show, which, for fans of the X-Men leading up to it wouldn't have been shocking, but definitely a surprise. It's easy to see why here; Jackman is PERFECT for the role, so much so that 24 years later, he's donned the claws again and most people don't seem to mind it.Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are literally perfect casting for this. We're talking Harry Potter level casting here; so much so that it's difficult to imagine a timeline where these two didn't play Charles Xavier and Magneto respectively. Although, I will say, their characters don't feel explored all that much. Magneto in particular felt like a run of the mill villain and not the iconic character he'd come to be. But, I don't think Singer and the team were under any illusions that this would be only instalment.As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty good, but I do have to admit that Famke Janssen feels a little miscast as Jean. I don't what it is about her, but she doesn't seem to have the vulnerability - and her character, the agency - that comic book/animated series Jean would. Everyone knows that James Marsden is theoretically great as Cyclops, but as is the meme, he is CRIMINALLY underused here. His character solely exists to get us to like Wolverine and Jean's relationship more and it's a crying shame.You know who else was surprisingly underused? Halle Berry's Storm. It's amazing to think, but she has less than 10 lines in the entire film.All that being said, it largely works. X-Men feels like a fun entry into a new franchise, it's certainly not going to be anyone's favourite movie. Ithink the film does a great job at introducing us to the characters and the lore, but there's clearly more awaiting us.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pleasant surprise,"I haven't read a comic book in 10 years, but I did see a few eps of the X-Men cartoon TV show that was so popular 4-5 years ago. I was surprised then at how serious that cartoon was, and that it was in serial form with each episode building on past episodes. Pretty adult stuff for a TV cartoon.That is the same way I felt after seeing the X-Men movie. It was dark, serious (there were maybe two laughs, including one big one), and -- best of all -- interesting. I expected the movie to end up somehow ""kiddie-fied,"" with lots of things that made little sense and many cheap laughs and stupid one-liners. Boy, was I surprised.X-Men looks like a terrific start to a movie franchise. The characters were all believeable (well, they are mutants, so you have to buy into the premise). The technology was interesting and not too futuristic. The actors ranged from excellent (Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen, and the guy who played Wolverine did a great job, too) to passable (Halle Barry, Sabertooth). Some characters didn't say much (Toad, Mystique). The plot made sense, mostly. We only nitpicked a few things afterward.The core of the movie, which sets up the ""good"" and ""bad"" sides, is believable and thought-provoking. How *would* our society react if we found that certain individuals were genetically different and had exceptional powers? Would we embrace them or lock them up?I hope the X-Men movies keep up what this first one started. I would love to have seen the additional 45 minutes that were supposedly cut from the movie. The information was interesting enough to support showing it. If I have one criticism, it is that the movie was a bit slow in the first 45 minutes, because the characters had to be set up and brought in. But that was a price I was willing to pay.Check out X-Men. It is better than you think it will be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Hell of a ride,"Okay, the movie that I thought would be the biggest flop of the summer is actually pretty damn cool. I admit it, I was wrong. Mr. Singer, cast and crew, I apologize, I shall never doubt you again (except for that idiot Halle Berry, thank God she barely has any dialogue here). Actually, this movie is much better than it has any right to be. The potential for embarrassment was huge. We have a director who has never directed a commercial hit-special effects film before, a cast of mostly unknowns and a bunch of super heroes in leather suits with goofy powers. And lets not forget a final battle taking place on top of the Statue of Liberty. But I'll be a son of a gun if Singer didn't do it, and do it well.After an opening sequence that is  as moving and dramatic as anything I've seen all year, I knew I was in for something special. I've been reading the book for about 15 years now, so I'm one of those types that the media was focusing on as the movie opened up around the world. Yes, it's all true, we are all pale friendless virgins who obsess over every little detail of the book (sadly, this IS true for many of the books readers. Comics just seem to bring out the anal-retentive types). So it's safe to say that I had some interest in how the movie would come out. Wolverine is my all time favourite character, and after seeing this, all I can say is that Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine! It was uncanny. I just sat there thinking, ""This guy is Wolverine! Could this be any cooler?"". Others may not have this reaction, mind you. If Jackman plays his cards right after this, he could become a major star in Hollywood. Keep an eye on this guy.Something that really surprised me was how well the relationship between Xavier and Magnus was handled. The few scenes that they share are some of my favourites. McKellen and Stewart are the two thespians of the cast, so this should be no surprise, but they captured the unusual friendship they share very well. Magneto is and always will be the Malcolm X to Professor Xavier's Martin Luther King in the fight for peace between mutants and humans. They other villains have mostly non-speaking roles, but they do their jobs well. I hope Ray Park fans noticed the little homage he did to Darth Maul in one scene. Cute. The good guys get a little more screen time, the standouts being Jackman, Stewart and young Anna Paquin who is adorable as the cursed Rogue. She's a scene stealer in this one, and the relationship she has with Wolverine is very sweet (a part played by Kitty Pryde and then Jubilee in the comic). Famke Janssen provides sparks (and is easy on the eyes. Yum!), and James Marsden is pretty cool as Cyclops, a character who is usually hard to do anything with. I also thought the scene involving Xavier's journey via Cerebro to the psi-plane was very visually interesting. They took something that had always been rather obscure in the comics and made it look very simple yet fascinating on screen.No real complaints here. The third act leaves a little something to be desired (I thought the end battle was maybe a little unspectacular), but otherwise this was great. The movie has the same problem that the book often faces, which is, ""how do we get rid of Xavier before the final battle?"", because when you think about it, when you have the most powerful psi on the planet on your side the rest of your team seems a little redundant. From the sounds of things this one will make one hell of a DVD, with a rumoured 45 minutes worth of cuts made before it was released to speed it up (some say at the character's expense). We are witnessing the birth of a franchise here. They could probably release an X-Men film once every two or three years like the Bond films. The story possibilities are endless, if they wanted they could just lift them from the comic. They have the Dark Phoenix Saga, The X-Cutioner's Song, Inferno, The Mutant Massacre, The Phalanx Covenant and so many more. If they want new villains, why not use Mojo, Mr. Sinister, Apocalypse, Onslaught, The Hellfire Club, The Shadow King, etc. Unlimited potential, really. I very much enjoyed this one, and it deserves a 9/10 stars for impressing me so much. G'night!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie was like a glass half full.,"This movie was like a glass half full.As much as I do not enjoy debating whether a glass of milk is half full or half empty, in this case, I have no choice but to join in and declare that this movie is like a glass half full as we were only able to catch glimpses of what this movie is fully capable of showing us.Personally, I believe the decision to move the story along at a brisk pace with hardly any pause has cost us in that we are unable to get to know any of the mutant heroes in depth ¬ñ and there were lots of them.  They were therefore reduced to cardboard mock ups providing thrills and spills at the whim of puppet handlers and the movie suffered as a result since the story was now completely plot driven and relying on set pieces none of which were ingenuous or original.There was great potential for characterisation in this movie as well as great potential for a much stronger theme.Instead the theme appears to have been buried and forgotten much in favour of putting bums on seats and I mean twelve-year-old ones.Take the case of Wolverine for example, a character begging to be explored in full.  Instead we were teased a lot about his past but learnt nothing. . . .Or Professor Xavier, or Rogue.  I am not impressed with the reason Magneto turned bad either.  I understand his paranoia, but it is no justification for his subsequent actions.  I expect the real reason is probably on the cutting room floor.I have not read the comics and I hate it when comics are adapted for the movies as virtually no one would be fully happy with the final outcome. But even though I never heard of X-Men before the movie, what I saw here was great potential but suffering as a result of the commercialisation of Hollywood.  I long for the old days of Hollywood when movies were work of Art that could entertain for generations.  X-Men isn't one of these movies. I suspect a reworking of the movie and its underlying theme could benefit us but not the moneymen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Homo-Sapien or Homo Superior?,"While X-Men is far from flawless, At least Mr. Singer seems to respect the characters and the source material enough to take them seriously (which is more than I can say for Mr. Shumacher or Mr. Burton). The first half of the film works surprisingly well, especially the Haulocost sequence and Logan's introduction.  What's also fascinating is that Bryan singer seems more interested in the quiet moments than in the Pyrotechnics.  Wolverines conversation with Rogue at the train station, for example.  There is a certain fragile quality to those scenes. Unfortunately, things fall apart in the third act, mainly because of the thin plot and surprisingly lifeless action sequences ( although the train station battle and Magneto's stand off with the police are handled well).  You can almost feel the film pulling it's punches.  I would have preferred a more straight forward approach to the fight coreography instead of all the Hong Kong style wire work.  Note to Bryan Singer and company: Just because ""The Matrix"" grossed nearly two hundred million does not mean that every ""comic Book"" movie has to look like Iron Monkey. I liked what I saw, but I wanted more.  I'm really curious as to what was in those 35 to 45 minutes that Fox took out of this film just prior to release.  I'll bet it consisted mostly of character development and plot. Hopefully, Bryan will get a bigger budget (and a longer running time) with the sequel after Fox sees this weekends box office results. Bryan seems to aiming for a thinking man's popcorn movie, and while he wasn't completly successful this time, I can see what he's getting at.  If nothing else, you've earned my respect, Mr. Singer.  I give you a well deserved B this time.  Maybe Fox will take you more seriously now that you've delivered the 4th biggest opening in history.

"When Mutants Show Up in Black Suits, It Hurts... Almost","We need to talk about the first X-Men, the one from 2000, back when everyone wore Matrix-style sunglasses, and we thought Hugh Jackman was just some random jacked Aussie. Bryan Singer, the guy who had probably never even cracked open a comic in his life, throws in mutants in black suits like it's the biggest revolution since the Swiss Army knife. And guess what? It works. The guy leaned so hard into the ideology and the whole humans vs. Mutants clash that he made you forget there were only about three lousy special effects in the film. For the action? Eh, we'll get back to that. But the story, man... the story's rock solid. And that's pure Singer.You've got Patrick Stewart as Professor X, exuding charisma like a Shaolin monk of the mutant institute, and Ian McKellen as Magneto, who sends chills down your spine with his metal-bending powers-the dude's like a Jedi of scrap metal. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) shows up as a brute, throwing punches and wisecracks that smell like cigar smoke and sweat. But can we talk about Storm and Sabretooth? Zero charisma-like oysters on Xanax, I swear.Okay, remember those black, Matrix-style costumes? We were in 2000, man, it flew by without a hitch. The problem is, you were expecting powers that'd blow your mind, but what you got were school-play-level special effects. Yet, even with that, Singer pulls it off, like, ""It's cool, you want story more than explosions."" Except, we're all here to see Wolverine slice people up, not philosophize about genetic mutations on every street corner.The film has its moments of brilliance, especially with that mutants vs. Humans opposition. But, man, when things slow down, it's like waiting for Windows 98 to boot up... you're half asleep. The pacing's in post-cassoulet nap mode, and that doesn't help. You just want to shake everyone so something can happen. Thankfully, when it does hit, it hits hard. But for the real powers that'll knock your socks off, you'll have to wait for X2, because this one's on a bit of a diet.Even though it's aged a bit, let's be real: this first X-Men cracked open the door for everything that followed. It's got all the elements that would later define the Marvel Cinematic Universe: the humor, the characters throwing quips between fights, and a message that's deeper than ""look, I've got a giant laser in my eyes."" After this, comic sales blew up, and everyone wanted a black leather suit and adamantium claws. Mission accomplished, man.For a guy who had never read a comic, Singer hit the nail on the head. This X-Men planted the seeds for a cinematic universe we thought would be impossible to adapt correctly.

It's got great characters, main and supporting, a great setup, a great general introduction to the concepts, a nice balance of special effects, a respectable plot that effectively sets up the main characters' relationships, and hints at what the next step in the story's development will be-- and then it just stops.  Great, I can't wait for next week's thrilling second installment!  Except in this case it'll be a year-plus before a sequel's out.I had a few minor quibbles with this film, especially over the way the straightforward plot seems to have been severely edited for time, but the only real problem was that the film seems to lack a real effective climax and conclusion.  It honestly feels more like a terrific TV pilot episode than a stand-alone movie, and I have the suspicion it would have benefited impressively from the extra running time it might have gained on television. Luckily the rest of the movie is well enough done-- especially in the way it manages to independently develop characters with decades of history behind them in a ridiculously short amount of time-- so that I'm willing to wait to see where the story's going next.  With a setup this engaging it'll be a crying shame if the follow-up doesn't prove to be twice as good-- and that ought to be really impressive to see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very good!,"Was it worth the wait? Well, I read my first X-Men comic 20+ years ago and dreamed of a movie since then, so probably not; but it is a very good movie. It is true to the comic, with an actual story to go along with the action and special effects.The acting is strong, Stewart (Prof. X) and McKellen (Magneto) give their usual strong performances but it is Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) who really steals the show. Jackman IS Wolverine. The rest of the cast does a good, if somewhat under-used, job; I hope future sequels will better use the under-appreciated Halle Berry (Storm).As a longtime X-Men and movie fan I definitely recommend this movie. As an aside, do now worry if you do not know they ""mythos"" behind the X-Men, it is adequately explained throughout the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Mutants ARE Among Us,"Rarely does a movie come along that works so well on so many levels, with the appeal to engage an audience of young and old alike.  `X-Men,' directed by Bryan Singer, is one of them.  Simply put, there is something here for everyone; there's the obvious story (which is excellent, by the way) which can be taken at face value and will be the attraction of the wider audience, and then there is the allegory to ponder for those who choose to go the distance (sorry, folks, no clues; you have to do it on your own, it's part of what makes this movie so good).  Just be advised, there is a whole lot more to this movie than meets the eye, and it's so well done and delivered, from the directing to the outstanding performances to the dazzling special effects.  Singer has done a superb job of bringing this all to the screen; his pace and timing couldn't be better, and he seems to have an innate sense of what makes this material work, and how to put it across.  This film could so easily have become just another sci-fi `B' rated throw away in the wrong hands, but with Singer at the helm, and with such a great cast, it doesn't come anywhere near sinking to that level.  There is also a restraint in the use of the special effects here that makes them all the more spectacular, and again, Singer must be given credit for that as well.As far as the performances, this movie should launch the relatively unknown Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) toward stardom.  He's charismatic and has a magnetic screen presence; he's given Wolverine real depth and credibility and emerges as the star of the show.  Anna Paquin (Rogue) also stands out, creating a truly empathic and sympathetic character that makes her accessible and allows her to connect with the audience.  Other notable performances are turned in by Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto).  The supporting cast includes Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly), Tyler Mane (Sabretooth), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) and Ray Park (Toad). 	There is a depth to this story of mutant's living among us that comes, quite frankly, as a pleasant surprise.  The dialogue is believable, and the characters are distinctly drawn and avoid stereotype.  Again, there is nothing about this movie that can be dismissed out-of-hand; even the mutant's names are cryptic, which adds yet another level to the story. Whether or not it was the conscious intent of the author and creator of the X-Men is open to speculation; what is important is that it works, and makes it all that much more engaging.  `X-Men' is destined to become a huge success, and will no doubt spawn welcomed and eagerly anticipated sequels. This movie is further evidence that since `The Matrix' came into being, the genre of Science Fiction has risen to an unprecedented height, the progression of which began with George Lucas and `Star Wars' in 1977.  Since then the cinematic Universe has never been the same, and `X-Men' is proof that it will only continue to expand in the future.  I rate this one 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Welcome, X-Men! ‚ô¶ 67%","With X-Men, the super-hero franchises get a push ahead. The setup is similar: superheroes with somewhat weird powers, villains & their confrontation. Although, X-Men has some kind of peculiarity in it that not only appeals but stands out.I am not surprised by the plot, but the Singer's skill of introducing characters is amazing. With proper balance of story, character depth, CGI, X-Men marks one of the best-ever introductory installation. For one, the cast line-up is appealing. For another, dialogs and humor are proportionate.But still, it lacks newness and borrows elements from published superhero movies. I am not accusing it, for any superhero movies will look the same.BOTTOM LINE: A decade later, if the charm of X-Men, evidently, sways in the atmosphere, it definitely gets a head up, ain't it?

The film was too short and therefore did not allow for any type of development for all the characters(Storm was especially underused).This was not an action/special-effects driven film as most comic book/summer movies tend to be, but it has a good amount of action for most people.I was also surprised by how funny the movie was at some points(the interactions between Wolverine and Cyclops are some of the better personal scenes of the movie).Hugh Jackman delivers as Wolverine, 110%. The films few errors fade when we see the first ""snikt"".No actor disappoints in their roles because most of them don't get the chance. This film revolves around Wolverine, Rogue and Magneto. The rest of the characters serve to occupy camera time even to an extent, and I'm surprised to say, Patrick Stewart.

"Though perhaps dated by today's standards over 10 years later, Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" adaptation is still a strong, entertaining and complex thrill ride.","At this point in time (November, 2013 as I write this) the Comic Book and Superhero have become the world's modern Greek Mythology. And the Comic Book Movie Adaptation is common... in fact, it seems that now we get at least three high-profile films adapted from comics every year. And they are often films of spectacle, quality and excitement for audiences, as studios have finally begun to understand how just incredible, complex and important these superheroes and stories ares.And there are two films that are often credited with getting the gears rolling on the Comic Book Movie... 1998's ""Blade"" and this film- 2000's ""X-Men."" Both took their source materials seriously and without irony, and both were box-office hits that were also warmly received by fans and critics. They paved the way for later classics like ""Spider-Man 2"", ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers.""Bryan Singer directs this stirring, thrilling and often thought- provoking action film from a screenplay by David Hayter.Set sometime in the near future, mutations have become something of a controversy in the human population- for whatever reason, many people exhibit strange, unique and often dangerous gifts that set them apart from others. We follow two such mutants- a teenaged girl who calls herself ""Rogue"" (Anna Paquin) and an amnesiac loner with a rough, violent side who goes by ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman), whom are both rescued by a team of mutants calling themselves the ""X-Men."" Lead by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the team aspire to be protectors for human and mutant alike, despite the prejudices they face from the non-mutants. They also fight against the ""Brotherhood""- a dark group of mutants lead by the nefarious ""Magneto"" (Ian McKellen), whom sees war with the non-mutants as their only option left.This film is very much a large, ensemble film. And this is one of the great successes, as the cast is uniformly magnificent. Jackman, who has sort of become the lead in the entire series, having been given the spotlight in almost every entry, is fantastic as Wolverine. He brings a toughness to the role, but also a curiosity as he is unsure of his past, and even touches of sadness and self-hatred, as well as a touch of humor. Patrick Stewart is phenomenal as Xavier, bringing about both touches of a loving, fatherly figure as well as a fearless leader. McKellen is both frightening and tragic as Magneto, our villain who has become lost due to hatred. And other performances by the likes of Paquin, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Bruce Davison and many others are all just a joy to watch. I just unfortunately don't have the space here to properly address everyone.The production is fantastic. Singer's direction is top-notch, and he is able to balance not only a bit of an origin story for the series, but also the action, pathos, symbolism and themes such as oppression and prejudice. This is definitely helped by a wonderfully crafted script by David ""Solid Snake"" Hayter, which blends together many themes and story lines wonderfully without them stepping over each other or losing focus. Those very themes are a large part of what makes ""X-Men"" work so well- while many superhero and comic-book films have issues for their characters to overcome or be defined by, ""X-Men"" makes the issue larger on a societal level, and the mutant heroes often come across as sort of metaphors for oppressed groups like African Americans, Women, Homosexuals, etc. And it does a lot to aid the film's realism, impact and provocative storyline.The set and costume design is also a lot of fun. And the musical score by Michael Kamen, while not particularly memorable, is still a wonderfully crafted piece of music that adds mood and atmosphere to the images.Really, this is just a darned-good film, with a few problems here and there. For starters, although Singer's direction is almost perfect, some of his action-sequences do feel a bit flat. He didn't seem to have too much experience with action prior to this film, so it can be forgiven. My other issues is that the film is perhaps a bit too stylized and therefore in retrospect, a bit too dated for it to be taken quite as seriously as it should be. While it is a well-made film, some of it just oozes ""late 90's, early 2000's"" style and it does sort of hurt the film in retrospect.But those complaints aside, this is still a good film, and is definitely well-worth seeing and investing some thought into. And the fact that this series is still on-going, with the seventh entry coming next year, it should definitely be a priority film to see if you already haven't.I give ""X-Men"" a very good 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Better than I expected it to be!,"Firstly, let me state I am not a big fan of the X-Men.Sure, I've read one or two of the comic-books, ahd a Marvel Annual when I was a kid, and seen a few episodes fo the Animated Series on TV, but I have to confess that I never really got into X-Men.However, I did like what I had seen, and it interested me enough to go see the movie at a preview screening in Australia.  The fact that Patrick Stewart was cast as Professor Xavier was a big plus, as I generally enjoy any acting work he does.The movie was a pleasant surprise.The overall acting was done well, and Hugh Jackman did very well as Wolverine.  What special effects there were weren't overdone, and the storyline hung together very well.In a way, I felt that the movie was more about Wolverine than anything else, but I suspect that if they make any sequels, they'll probably concentrate on other members of the X-Men.Sure, the movie is a little short, but I came out of it satisfied that I had gotten my money's worth.Talking to people about the movie afterwards I heard the following comments :""It didn't suck"". - always a plus :-)""As someone who has been reading the comics since the 60's, I thoguht the movie was good"".And the most often heard comment from a lot of people was ""I don't know anything about X-men, but I really enjoyed it"".Overall, I'd give the movie 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A solid start to the superhero trilogy,"The first ""X-Men"" movie is big-screen escapist fun with an all-star cast and a sm√∂rg√•sbord of special effects.For me, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is the star of the show.

He's joined by a very talented set of actors including Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen (as a slightly camp Magneto), Famke Janssen and Halle Berry.

At times I wasn't sure I was fully following Magento's motives. There were some holes that left things to be desired.Keeping in mind this movie is from 2000, I won't knock it for some of the cheesy things that didn't age so well 24 years later like some of the special effects and some of the acting.

"Doesn't really follow the comic at all, but still enjoyable.","This movie mainly focuses on Wolverine and Rogue.  Cyclops, Jean Grey, Professor X, Storm are also present along with a few others doing brief apperances.  The villians are Magneto, Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad.  As you can see as much as I liked this movie there were quite a few characters and its short running times meant you really couldn't dwell on anyone to long.  And as good as this one is the next one sounds as if it will just to many characters period.  The people who made this one though were smart enough to focus on Wolverine and he was the best character in this one.  I was disappointed to see Iceman a student at Prof X's school seeing as how he is one of the founding members in the comic book, but this movie, unlike Spiderman doesn't really follow the comic book much at all except for their powers and in some cases not even then.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, what can go wrong.","I have never really liked comic book adaptations all that much because they have always seemed to be to be quite dull. With the exception of Tintin and Asterix I never really got into comic books as a kid, or even as an adult. In particular I never really liked Superman, but when one takes some of these comic books and step back and consider the world in which it is set it begins to take on a new life. Most comic book heroes tend to be incredibly wealthy, and in their spare time they are off saving the world for super villains.While it can be suggested that this is the case with the X-men, it is actually quite a lot more complicated than that. The Marvel Universe has three types of people. There are the normal humans, like you and I. Then there are the heroes, normal people who during their life have gained some form of superpower (such as Spiderman when he was bitten by the radioactive spider) and finally there are the mutants, people born with superpowers. It is these mutants that this particular film explores.The setup is complex. First of all you have the humans than fear the appearance of these mutants, and because of the powers that they possess, they are threatened, and as such are looking for ways to restrict and control these people that are appearing. Then there are the mutants themselves, divided into two opposing camps. There are the X-men, who are lead by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and they seek to protect and defend humanity, only using their powers for good. Then there are the mutants who follow Magneto (Ian Mackellan) who believe that because of their powers they should rule humanity. There are mutants that do not follow either of these two philosophies, but in this film it is these three groups that are fighting against each other.The movie opens with Rogue about to kiss her boyfriend, only to discover that when she does so she drains all of the life out of him, so she is forced to flee. Running to north Canada, she falls in with Logan (Hugh Jackman) otherwise known as Wolverine. After convincing him to let her travel with him (he is a loner), they are attacked by mutants who are loyal to Magneto, but the X-men arrive in time and take them back to the Xavier's School of the Gifted (the X-men's base). It is from there that we begin to learn of Magneto's plan to cripple humanity and pave the way for a mutant takeover.The question with this film is the continuity. While this is the first film in the series, there are films that occur before hand, such as Wolverine. In that film we discover that Wolverine and Sabretooth are brothers, but that does not seem to come out in this film. However, Wolverine has lost him memory (we don't know how that happened at this stage), but when he is told about Sabretooth, it seems to jog his memory slightly. As for Sabretooth, at the end of Wolverine he cries out 'nobody kills Wolverine but me!'. In this film this is suggested, particularly when Sabretooth takes a particular interest in Wolverine's dogtags.When one stands back a bit, and considers the movie as a whole, it really comes down to Magneto having a plan to make him more powerful and to rule over humanity, and the X-men going out to beat them. However, one thing that was a little disappointing was how easy it was to kill Sabretooth. He got blasted with a laser, and that was it. However, in Wolverine he was much harder to kill. He had claws, and like Wolverine, he could regenerate. We see none of that here, however one probably does have to consider the comics a bit more, something which I really do not have the time of inclination to do. However, while the plot may be a little dull, it is the background (as well as having some heaps cool actors) that attracts me to this film.There is also the issue of discrimination, and I guess it is a thing that we all need to confront. Discrimination is something created by fear. We fear that we are going to lose our place in the world, and because of that we will discriminate against another race. I remember in the 80s in Australia when the target of discrimination were the Asians, and it is true that the Asians are much more populous than us. We fear that by letting a few in, they will then flood in, and we will lose our identity and power in our country. It is the same fear that rules humanity here. Despite the X-men seeking the best for humanity, humanity fears them, and this is because it is clear that the mutants are so much more powerful than us. Discrimination is actually a theme that seems to not only run through all of the movies, but through all of the comics as well (though Wolverine has a somewhat different theme running through it, as does First Class).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel finally gets it right,"I really went into this movie prepared for the worst.  As a lifelong comic fan, I had found the X-Men and its family of titles were becoming practically unreadable.  The unrelenting hype surrounding this film screamed ""flop"" - as if Marvel were trying to milk everything they could out of it. Anyone who has been into comics for more than 3 years knows that this would be standard operating procedure.  Not to mention their abysmal parade of cinematic failures (Blade would be the exception, but then again, it hardly resembled the comic character.)Thankfully, they got this one right.  The opening scene made me sit up and take notice, and they held me throughout most of the remainder of the movie.  The first half in particular was perhaps the best adaptation of a comic I have ever seen.  It did a great job of highlighting the characters, and setting up the conflict.  I am not particularly fond of the comic version of Wolverine, but they hit a home run with this one.  He looks great - rough, tough, and ready to rumble without being a complete psycho.Needless to say, the effects were great.  Magneto, in particular, has some spectacular scenes.  I did find the fight scenes to be a little cartoonish, however.  Wolverine-Sabretooth promised to be the all-time heavyweight championship match, but it didn't deliver a knockout. Hopefully, they'll work on their choreography next time (Ray Park is tragically underused in this one!)After the well-conceived and -executed first half, the film slowly grinds to the finish line.  It wasn't a total letdown, but I really expected more.  Of course, they had to leave a few threads dangling; these will no doubt be tied up in the sequel(s).All in all, I came out of X-Men very satisfied.  This is a very promising start to what will (hopefully) be a series of quality movies based on Marvel Comics.  The high points of this movie more than balance out its flaws.  I guess the best comment I can make is that it made me a fan of the X-Men again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The rebirth of comic book movies,"Three years had gone since the disastrous Batman & Robin. The movie had destroyed the Batman movie franchise and still today the low point of comic book movies. Then the genre was back on its feet with this smart and serious yet also fun and entertaining film. First of all the cast has been chosen with great respect for the characters. Hugh Jackman is spot on as the beer-drinking savage anti-hero Wolverine, Patrick Stewart is the one and only Professor X, Ian McKellen is wonderful as Magneto and Famke Janssen isn't half bad as Jean Grey. But great actors won't work without a solid screenplay and while the movie does have minor plot holes the story is unpredictable and well paced enough to keep you invested. Of course some characters have not enough time to develop in an hour and a half movie but that's OK because then the movie would have been much to slow. Director Bryan Singer is obviously aware that the comics themes of fear of the unknown is to be taken seriously but there is also a touch of humor and self-irony that makes X-men deliciously self aware. It doesn't really have that many action scenes but those there are really do entertain. All in all a great achievement for comic book movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Successful start to a great franchise,"X-Men released back in 2000 had several among fans of hype since it was the beginning of the decade as well as the film has been very anticipated. This film does a lot well and is a great piece of entertaining. Running relatively short on screen time (about 96 mins excluding the end credits) compared to the typical 2+ hour of other comic book superhero films. Although the pacing could have been better, since it wasn't too long, things come into place very quickly and the film becomes instantly good.The cast is great, which is what makes the film excel. The chemistry between the characters work out well, especially Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) with Patrick Steward (Charles Xavier) as well as the other heroes Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Rogue. The visual effects are top notch.We see how far this franchise has come into the year 2017 as many had not known back then how successful these films would have become. Comparing this original X-Men film to the newer films of the 2010's, this feels somewhat more dark in spirit, and less comical in some ways. A feel in tone is noticeable. X-Men most definitely lived up to the hype and is overall exciting and faithful to its original comic book origins.Although with quite a simple plot, it flows decent enough and by the end of the film (in which an obvious sequel was set), we are left wanting more. Highly recommend for those of fans of the source material as well as those wanting to see how the origin started.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
