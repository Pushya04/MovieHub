Landmark Japanese animation that opens boundaries and minds.,"'Akira' is an astonishingly influential film, easily as much so as cinema's touchstones Citizen Kane and Pulp Fiction. Its impact is made more difficult to judge, though, given that it was made more than sixteen years ago, and didn't make an initial impact outside of Japan. Oddly, this made its influence even more profound, benefiting from 'word of mouth' and the influx of cheap VHS at the end of the Eighties. It's also gained enough of a following to warrant being digitally remastered, at a cost of over US$1 million, as a 'Special Edition,' which I am basing these comments on.Rather than suffering the humiliation of being advertised, Akira filtered, like a software virus, into the bedrooms of what would become Generation X. Hollywood began to sit up and pay attention after teens began abandoning the pap of the day like Last Action Hero, and started seeking out something different, dissident, and Akira finally had its audience. Japanese animation now has a firm presence in our media, and so many paths lead back to the cultural genesis of Akira. Finally, its role in the history of film was cemented with the release of last year's mega-hit, the Wachowski brothers' The Matrix. Without Akira, there is no Matrix, and with no Matrix, you have to wonder how very different Western cinema would be today.So what is Akira? It's a Japanese animated film, an adaptation of 2,000 pages worth of graphic novel by Katsuhiro Otomo and set in the futuristic world of Neo-Tokyo. Rebuilt from the ashes of World War 3, it's a technological dream of neon, computers and soaring science, mated to the social nightmare of corrupt politicians, a rampant military and an oppressed working class. Add to this the rise of a powerful breed of psychics (or 'psionics') capable of various degrees of telepathy and telekinesis, and somehow linked to a top secret military project known as Akira, and Neo-Tokyo seems ready to explode. You can almost feel the heat, the sweat, and the grime, courtesy of the borderline-masochistic attention to detail in every frame of every scene of animation.Akira is all about hyper-reality, which later became known as bullet time. Animation, and more importantly imagination, allows impossibly kinetic and 'free' camera movement. The style rams home every car crash, explosion and death defying stunt. It's not the easiest film to watch in one sitting, nor indeed, at all, but you'll come away knowing where the inspiration behind so many late Nineties blockbusters came from. More importantly, you'll appreciate how mediums come to influence other mediums, and barriers such as language and culture can be hurdled with ease.It's not just an action-fest either. The main arc of the story is that of Tetsuo, who begins developing psychic powers but doesn't understand what is happening to him or the responsibilities that come with such godlike power. This opens the door to some genuinely moving scenes of film-making endeavour and artistic triumph, as Tetsuo wonders if he is losing his mind and eventually lashes out against anyone and everyone. The standout scene in the whole film, for me, should be mentioned about here. Whilst under observation in a hospital bed, Tetsuo hallucinates being attacked by childhood toys. Dreams and reality are folded into each other and so it remains for much of the rest of the film. Horizons peel away and reality itself seems to disintegrate, fragment after animated fragment, as Tetsuo battles his way to downtown Neo-Tokyo and prepares to face Akira, whatever that may mean.The only other character developed to this level is his best friend Kaneda, who in a number of small, well-judged scenes, comes across as bright, breezy, confident and heroic, and on hand to reason with Tetsuo. No matter what point Tetsuo's powers escalate to, and no matter how much he is wanted by the police and the military, Kaneda just wants his old friend back, and it is this hope of redemption which gives the film its emotional backbone.Other strengths include the intelligent use of sound. A minimum of scoring is used: mostly Japanese drums and percussion, and some voices during dramatic parts. More interesting is the use of silence, absolute flat silence, during key moments. It fits in very well with the themes of psychic/telepathic powers, and in a more general way, the vivid hyper-reality of the film's delivery. Put it this way - when you dream, you dream in a silence of implied words, and Akira knows this too.I thought the dialogue was excellent too. The street kids have catchy and sardonic street lingo (""Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's going to kill him, it should be us!"") The military are represented by a titanic general whose lines have gained a certain amount of hilarity during translation (""You hedonistic fools! Can't you see it is utterly pointless to fight each other!"") I found myself eagerly awaiting the next punchy exchange between players, which is something that Hollywood has been missing recently. In seven out of ten films I see, the dialogue is truly awful. How difficult can it be to get two people to talk naturally?'Akira' is not for everyone. In the first twenty minutes we have strong language, an attempted rape and the kinetic carnage of a fight between rival biker gangs. Some will simply not tolerate this in an animated movie which is, despite all efforts, going to be viewed by younger children. Even if you can stomach the unsavoury content, you might be beaten by the sheer oddness of Japanese culture. (They certainly have an unhealthy obsession with seeing Tokyo laid to waste.) But if you can skip over these points and see the overall genius of Akira, you may just appreciate Akira's place on the pantheon of modern culture.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Masterpiece of Epic Proportion.,"Visually Astonishing, Dark and Original is what best describes Katshuiro Otomo's Masterpiece `AKIRA'. Now here is an animated film that is way ahead of his time, the film was released in 1988 even before Disney created computer FX's in their animated features. AKIRA is one of my favorite movies of all time it has beautiful visuals, great animation, an extraordinary story and a wicked soundtrack. I have read the entire AKIRA manga comics and yes it makes the movie that much easier to understand but with the new DVD edition which contains the correct dubbed version that allows the viewer to understand the film a little easier. I first saw AKIRA back in 1994 when I was 14 years old and ever since then I have collected great anime, at first I was confused but yet intrigued and consumed by the plot, I wanted to know what the story was about. Finally after 4 times viewing the film I understood the plot and the message Otomo wanted to deliver in this feature. The story is fascinating it takes place in the future in the city of NEO-TOKYO were citizens live in a constant chaos of an urban revolution, while the youth lives reckless on the dark streets gathering in bike gangs the government proceeds with the so called `akira project'; a mayor step in scientific discovery based on human energy.AKIRA is a movie about betrayal, love, loyalty, anger, and fiction. For those who do not understand it is a movie about the universe and how us humans connect with it, we use about 11% of our brains but what if we were able to use 40% or even 100% of it, what then? And what if some of that percentage was damaged by hate, depression, or anger, this is the case of TETSUO who is the center character of this film. The possibilities are far from anything we can imagine, `AKIRA' provides a fictional possibility that self energy exists within all of us and that is just as delicate as it is powerful.This is an epic proportion animated feature, the action sequences are creatively amazing, the plot is very intriguing, dark and character driven like no other film. It is one of a kind and even after 14 years we have yet to see anything like it whether is an animated or a feature film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Trademark Manga for the Western culture,"Without a doubt the necessary injection of Manga culture Western audiences needed. Personal objections (or should I say appraisals) aside, Akira deconstructs the form of narrative and character development that we had all become accustomed to through Hollywood and produces a reasonably honest translation of Katsuhiro Otomo's Manga epic, with mass deletions of unnecessary characters and plot avenues. The story is complex enough to keep western audiences attention, yet simple enough to digest whilst taking in the wonderfull animation and excellent soundtrack (a collection of traditional Japanese instruments and modern day synthesised electronica that allow for elements of cinema to establish themselves for the audience) The conflict between the two main characters, Tetsuo and Kaneda is ultimately superceded by the films namesake, the mystery of the boy Akira, and as with very few films Hollywood produces it leaves it's more labour intensive thinking until the end. A delight to follow, with periods of intense action and thought provoking predictions of a neo society, one would like to think of the film as the pipe dream of one who predicted such tragic events as of September 11. Akira, whilst violent for the medium, is a lush metropolis of gang warfare, a psuedo examination into the possible, and a fantasy tale of elements long lost in modern cinema. A cool, entertaining piece littered with cult visions and awesome bikes.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Apocalyptic Animation...,"Oozing with metaphorical messages and warnings, as relevant today as when it was first released, this apocalyptic take on a future world takes place in 2019, some years after an Armageddon event in Tokyo. Often as confusing as hell, a little bit all over the place at times, if you manage to make it to the end you may need to pause for thought to consider what you have witnessed, which can only be a good thing with the shallowness in so much of what we're served up these days. Definitely worth a visit.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Be careful with this film.,"*Stereotype:  Akira is a gratuitous bloodbath.Maybe, but it's also a hard-nosed societal critique.  Gore fans get what they want, but they have some morality shoved down their throats, as well. Most people who hate this movie watch it with a predetermined mindset. . . It takes thought and patience to piece together its sophisticated story.*Stereotype:  Akira rocks!!The animation equals or exceeds Disney's best, the music is awesome, and the characters are complex, but ""Akira"" has its flaws.  Chunked together from a long pre-existing storyline and filled with gritty violence, ""Akira"" draws fanatics too bloodthirsty to appreciate its message, and scares away critics intelligent enough to understand it.  It takes a very open mind to enjoy this movie.All in all, be careful with this movie; it's not for everyone.  Just ignore the hype on BOTH sides and judge for yourself.  I recommend the subtitled version; the dub's voice actors suck and anyone who'll understand this movie is obviously smart enough to read.",,Anonymous,Animation
Every Anime fan have to start from a certain place.,"I was probably around 8, when I first saw Akira. It was my step dad who asked me if I was interested in watching this Japanese cartoon. I expected something like, my favorite children movies like The Lion King or The Land before Time.Akira however, was something else. At the time I was to young to understand English, since it was a second language for me. But I remember what kind of an affect it had on me. It was brutal, it was hard, it was edgy. The drums and Neo Tokyo lights flew through my little body as butter, as I witnessed death, gore and sadistic killings. Something my pure and innocent eyes had never seen before. And yet I was strangely excited. I was never tough as a kid. I was a afraid of the dark and often had nightmares about all kinds of things. But Akira, despite it's mature nature, just had me in awe. When I finally re-saw it many years later, when I was an old teenager, I was still in awe.Akira is simply a wonderful and entertaining sci-fi movie. It was what introduced me to anime, and innovation in a hole new way. If you want to start watching anime or see, what all the fuss is about, then Akira is a good place to start. Even though it's over 17 years old today, it is still a fantastic and visually stunning animation. Even if you don't appreciate animation you owe it to yourself, to check it out. It has spectacular action, motorcycle-chase-sequences, mad scientists and tons of blood and shooting.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I really wanted to like this movie,"I really wanted to like this movie, I heard from everyone that it was an anime classic and I had seen screenshots that looked really cool. In the end I was disappointed.The movie was hand drawn and it looked amazing no doubt about that, I could stare at still from this movie all day long, it's the other things that bothered me.The story is a mess. I loved the first act, seeing this cyberpunk city was really cool, seeing the gangs and everything. After that the movie turned into a anime horror movie, which I don't feel fit the tone at all. The whole Akira thing was confusing as hell, they never explained it, everyone was asking the whole movie ""What is Akira?"" The third act dragged out so much, things that were happening didn't make sense at all. The end was just a mess with destruction everywhere, but no story to tell about it.The soundtrack was also annoying. Some of the songs were cool, but they play them almost 7 or 8 times in the movie, which wears out the song and just makes it ambient noise.This might be only the English dub, but the dubbing was horrible. The words were off the mouth movements and the voice actors were bad. In intense scenes the voice actors never gave an intense feel.For a classic there were some big problems. The story could have been more direct and made more sense. In fact, they could have just made the movie about the city and the gangs fighting and that would have made it better. With the movie how it is, they could have cut it down to take out the dragging on of the end. Akira just ended up losing my interest near the end, making it not as interesting as I thought it would be.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not sure what all the fuss is about,"2019. 31 years after being destroyed during World War 3, Tokyo (now 'Neo-Tokyo') has been rebuilt and is a thriving metropolis. Shotaro Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang. His friend Tetsuo is injured in an accident and taken to a top-secret government facility. He develops telekinetic powers but decides to use them for evil rather than good. He has the same powers as Akira, the force that destroyed Tokyo in 1988, and now it appears that history will repeat itself.Regarded as some sort of animation-drama masterpiece but it is far from that. The animation is great but the remainder is average, at best. The plot has potential but becomes quite random quite quickly. Stuff happens that seems tangential to the story. Plus, there's several strands of plots going on at the same time, adding to the complexity but detracting from the focus of the story and the engagement level.The random, rambling, plot becomes quite tedious past a point.However, the plot is not the worst if it: character engagement is where the movie falls flat. There's really nobody to like or care about. Characters are one-dimensional and appear to be constructed to appeal to kids.Ultimately, it's mediocre.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An anime that never ages,"I remember the first time i watched this when i was 14, back then it didn't mean much to me i just watched it because of the violence. Growing up i cant count the number of times i have watched it but it seems as though every time i watched it i uncovered something new in the plot. On to the review then; There are two different dubs for this film in English, the initial one i watched on VHS is much better then the one on DVD. The voices match the characters and bring across emotions very well in the VHS dub. In the DVD dub the voices seem alien to the characters personalities, this may be due to the fact that I'm used to seeing the film with the old dub.The animation is very fluid, definitely a revolution in animation. The vast range of colours used really bring the metropolis alive. The start of the film where Kaneda and the crew are riding through the city you get to witness all sorts of sub-environments of the city, from tight alley ways where you can almost sense the deprivation to the bustling streets bright from the flashing neon lights.The characters grow on you the further in to the film you get, at the beginning you can sense friction between Kaneda and Tetsuo, however as the film progresses you understand the past between these two characters and come to terms with their feelings. The colonel is also a very interesting character who seems to represent a beacon of hope constantly attempting to avoid the inevitable catastrophe headed for neo-tokyo.The storyline revolves around two central characters, Tetsuo and Akira. It is heavily emphasised towards revealing what the next evolution of man is and whether or not the evolution would be in the best interest of man.Closing comments, Akira is a must watch for any anime fan who appreciates a thought provoking storyline and dense characters.Also watch; Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Shell:Innocence and Perfect Blue",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Animation Film,"I only recently watched Akira (though I have heard a lot about it) and I must say I am impressed (so much that I bought the DVD). This is, beyond any doubt, one of the best animated films in existence. Visually impressive, solid direction, with a compelling story (if a little complicated), just the right amount of character development, good and very appropriate soundtrack and an extensively detailed New Tokyo, Akira manages to be as groundbreaking as it was when it was first released.It's only drawback is that most people (including me) will probably have to watch it again (and again maybe) to completely understand the full story. Highly recommended (especially to anime fans). I give it 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The One and only Anime classic -- 10 (classic),"When I first grabbed the cover box for AKIRA off the shelves of my local video store, I had never heard the word ""manga,"" (Japanese comic book) nor ""anime"" (Japanimation) for that matter. Back then I would have given that movie a 9 (excellent), since it was like nothing I had ever seen before, was true graphic violence, but was still a bit too long and too hard to understand. Ten years later, having watched a slew of other anime productions, I would have given this movie an 8 (very good) from memory had I not seen it again yesterday. After seeing AKIRA for the first time in the original Japanese language, I have come to fully appreciate its cultural and artistic merit.Ten years ago, I watched the English dubbed AKIRA and understood absolutely no Japanese. Ignorance of the language made for funny jokes with my brother (""Just as my bullet was reaching the red line! You think you're so tough"") but added nothing to the movie. Ten years later I understand both the language and the country, thanks in part to AKIRA, and I have finally realized that Katsuhiro Otomo had created a classic. While critics may know the director Kurosawa, it may take another 10 years for the name Otomo to make its way to the forefront of American cinematic consciousness.From here on out, I have nothing but praise for this historical milestone. No other hand-drawn movie I have ever seen is done as meticulously. The pillar lined coliseum comes to mind. It's apparent on first viewing that an immense amount of effort was put into the hand-drawn animation. It seems as if every detail within the frame is in motion. This stands out in the ANIME industry, where so many directors don't bother with effort and instead choose to have a still frame frozen over five seconds. In my mind AKIRA's animation is peerless on an international scale.Second, the Neo Tokyo depicted in AKIRA is definitely the one that should exist today. Nightlife is dark and violent. Fundamentalist Buddhist sects roam the streets chanting dogma and searching for answers. And most importantly, the medicated punk teenagers speak a crooked, thuggish Japanese slang that I haven't heard in any movie of recent memory. 1988 was Japan's heyday, what with the bubble economy and all, but since then the artistic vision of Otomo's AKIRA seems to have gotten stuck in an economic recession. I feel as if modern Tokyo and its Anime has diverged quite a bit from the Neo-Tokyo depicted in AKIRA.My final comment is DO NOT rent the English dubbed version, as I did long ago. If by chance you've developed a familiarity with Japan's language and culture, AKIRA makes so much more sense, as it was animated for the Japanese language. The poor English dub job does nothing but distract BIG TIME. As Japan's economically exuberant and excessive 80's heyday fades further into the past, AKIRA will prove to be a relic of a cult imagination that may be fading as well. To watch it in English would be sacrilegious.In homage to this classic, I've titled my homepage AKIRA-TETSUO, which is named after that demonic anger and guilt you feel when you fail -- the emotion that you can harness to wreak atomic havoc upon this green planet earth. No happy ending with this cataclysmic movie.JYJimboduck-dot-com",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Insane,Original and dark film that will sit with you long after it concludes. Visually stunning film that leaves most films for dead. Cerebral filmmaking that is still one of the most interesting animes ever created. I'm happy I found this and sad it took so long.

Meanwhile military scientists is experimenting on supernatural powers.While the style is ground breaking, I would have wanted a clearer story with a more prominent main character.

Overrated & Overlong,"Heard a lot about Akira prior to watching it, both about it's quality and cultural impact, and since usually I'm a mild fan of Japanese animation, I had very high expectations for this film.I was let down.Although the movie is very stylish and the story has promise at first, the movie is simply overlong and almost impossible to get through in one sitting. It has a lot of potential and has great word-of-mouth referances so it's surprising that even though it boasts a huge run time for an anime, the characterization is still paper thin, and by the end of the movie you are left thinking of what happened and more importantly, why.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An animated masterpiece, without the sing-alongs of Disney fare","It amuses me that so many people are appalled by the ""graphic violence"" of this film when they are the ones who will turn around and glorify a movie like ""Silence of the Lambs"" simply because it is live-action.  Akira completely dispels the myth that animation must be replete with characters who are super-deformed and randomly break into song.  This is a true emotional experience the likes of which Hollywood could not duplicate even if it tried.A gang of young motorcyclists get involved in a government plot involving the resurrection of ""Akira,"" a force which once laid waste to Tokyo.  Now, in the Neo-Tokyo of the future, the youngest and lowliest of the gang, Tetsuo, ends up harnessing this extremely destructive power and goes on a rampage of telepathic mayhem to earn the fear of those who once bullied him relentlessly.  Beneath the violence in this movie lies the very touching story of this young man and his reconciliation with Keneda, his best friend.One of the most moving scenes in the film is a flashback that shows the first meeting between the two when they were very young.  Though the other kids had bullied and harassed Tetsuo, Keneda was there to stick up for his now lifelong friend.  If those who watch Akira can discard their preconceived notions of what animation should be, they will find one of the most exciting, emotional, and rewarding films they will ever have the fortune of seeing.As a special side note, I personally prefer the dubbed version, which is executed very well by a talented cast of voice actors. My favorite line in the movie belonged to the Colonel: ""They don't teach tact at the academy."" Though it was adapted from a huge body of manga work, Akira was executed perfectly, being directed by its original creator, Katsuhiro Otomo.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Different, detailed; but a masterpiece? Not really.","I've been a big fan of science fiction and fantasy in both literature and cinema for at least 25 years. I love the cutting edge, yet until the year 2000, I had never seen any anime. My anime-loving friends urged me to introduce myself to the genre with either ""Akira"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" or even ""My Friend Totoro"". Since my friends only had ""Akira"" on video, I chose that. I watched this in November 2000, so please forgive me for forgetting the character names.Right away, my viewing frame of mind fell once the English soundtrack came squealing its way through my sound system. What is it about US distributors of Asian movies? Why do they think we want to hear grown women talking in baby imitations? I'd much rather read subtitles and hear the original soundtrack than these peevish, cartoony caricatures.When my friends had hyped the incredibly detailed, fluid animation style that put American animation to shame, I looked forward to seeing it. In fact, every review here seems to glorify the skill and talent of the animators. Although the frames did contain a lot of detailed artistry and a large number of independently animated objects, the movement was jerky as all hell. It was very easy to see where the frames were linked. It was like playing an action game on a PC when it gets overloaded trying to keep up with the game. Disney may be pablum for the masses, but its theatrical releases certainly are a hundred times more smoothly animated than ""Akira"".I had to put the ""viewing experience"" aside and concentrate on the plot, theme, and characters. I've done it enough times in the age of VHS rentals, so it was no problem here. I found that the character development for everyone except the protagonist was weak and shallow. I never could understand any motivation for the erratic behavior of the friend. Now, this is more like an American movie than some cutting-edge Asian import.The plot.. well, very poorly explained, especially the last 20 minutes. I think I understood the ending of ""2001"" better the first time I saw it. I don't want to spoil anything, but there is no explanation for what happens at the end of this movie. Those of you who have seen it will understand... bigger and bigger and bigger... why? Just to be grotesque?Finally, the theme made sense to me. Our world faces great danger from our misunderstanding of technology and humanity's preoccupation with it. We will be our own downfall if we are not careful. Good message, I get it.So, overall, I gave it 4/10. I thought it was sloppy in direction and the story was utterly lacking in interest. Those of you here (and on the video jacket) who compared this film favorably with ""Blade Runner"" are, in my opinion, not paying very much attention to ""Blade Runner"". That is a hugely superior film to this.Finally, as to ""My Friend Totoro"", I saw it too. It had the same problems with animation jerkiness as this does. Is ""Princess Mononoke"" going to let me down too? I'm going to watch the SUBTITLED version of that anime just to get away from those baby voices.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Tetsuo, Kaneda, Tetsuo, Kaneda, Akira, -kira, -kira, -kira (web)","In fact, Akira was the thing of my twin brother and as it was his, it was crap. (I know how much we can be dumb when we are kids but that's what adulthood is about). Well, I watched him collect all the books and above all, I heard a lot the rhythmic score in our parent's car! I remember to watch a few minutes years ago but it was senseless with Tetsuo calling ""Kaneda"", Kaneda calling ""Tetsuo"" and that was all.One week ago, I started to read the comic and it was hard to put it down: Contrary to traditional comics, the text is minimal so the pace is really dynamic and matches the story: as it deals with devastations, technology and mysticism, it's really Japanese at heart. The characters (Kaneda, Kei, Tetsuo, Kaori, the kids, the Colonel) are well studied and all the emotions are rich: humor, romance, courage, madness, faith, friendship... Otomo is a stunning artist too and the numerous devastations of Tokyo are among the best pages of comic ever. If there is a big slump between volumes 17 and 27, the last volumes are visually fascinating!Now, comes the movie: actually, it's 20 years old but it's not very outdated. At its release, it surely rocked the animation because there weren't a lot of productions like this. As for the adaptation, it's a good thing that Otomo was at the helm: The movie looks like the comic and vice versa. The story has been drastically cut for the screen but the core is still here(in fact, it's indeed the big slump mentioned that has been left). In addition, a lot of ideas have been rewritten so it's nearly like a special edition.Finally, the comic is so explosive that this animation is nonetheless less powerful. In other words, if you like the movie, read the comic because it's a thousand more epic and read ""Domu"" as well (it's a good prequel!).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

An encounter with a powerful child leaves one of a gang, Tetsuo, injured and captured by the army.  They find his mind has powers that can be developed  however the lessons of the mysterious Akira are still fresh in their minds and the army know they must control his development.  Meanwhile Tetsuo's friend, Kaneda, fights corrupt politicians, a powerful military and the power of the opened human brain to get his friend back.When I went to see this film at a big cinema chain that I won't name, it had been over 10 years since I'd last seen the movie and could remember very little of it.  The screening was cancelled because the emergency lights couldn't be shut off (d'oh) but we were all offered free tickets for later. Coming back to it I hoped it would be worth the bother and, on the whole, it was.  This type of film is usually all visual flair and some messed up plot about demons etc.  Akira is almost that but rises about the average by being cleverer than that and by being one of the first of it's type.The animation is excellent  breathtaking cityscapes and futuristic effects. The violence is graphic but is nothing compared to modern Japanese standards.  It doesn't take away from the film and it all looks great.  The use of sound (or rather silence) is also effective with powerful silences at key moments really adding to the film.The plot goes a bit nuts at times and ends up with the body horror of many films of the genre.  However at it's core it is looking at the idea of humans using their full brain power and possible next steps for evolution. That doesn't mean it doesn't drag at all and several bits do go on too long  the ending in particular never seems to reach a closing point!  I felt it could easily have taken 20 minutes less and still done the same job.The only problem I had with the version I saw was the hammy American voice work.  It really made it feel clichéd.  However overall the film looks good and has some great action.

Also admirable are the so very non-Hollywood little human things like for example: The annoying TV commercials, the dull hanging around of the gang being bored, and senseless chattering of a girl on the phone. Everything is just... real! Next to this, the quality of the animation is just overwhelming! You can see the dedication and hours and hours of work on every frame!

It was difficult to care for the characters,"It's eventful, action-packed, and most importantly, it doesn't shy away from showing unrestrained gore and blood. It has been almost three decades since its first release, and the visuals still hold up.Having said that, the narrative does have some issues of its own, specifically the struggles and dilemmas in regard to character development. I was consistently finding it difficult to connect with any of the leading characters, let alone rooting for their survival and success.If truth be told, I found myself caring more for Tetsuo, our supposed 'Villain' than Kaneda, our annoying brat of a protagonist!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overrated and nonsensical,"I don't care if I anger every so-called ""otaku"" out there that loves this movie, but I must say that Akira is certainly NOT the best anime out there. Akira does have its qualities, such as the intense motorcycle chases throughout the movie, and as with all anime, the superb attention to detail is not lacking a bit.       However, Akira suffers from a severely disjointed story. I know that almost all animes have plots that are confusing, but Akira tops almost all of them. I could understand the whole government testing idea, but the plot present at the last half of the movie about psychic powers and stuff lost me. The movie holds up very well until the testing begins, and the climax is disgustingly absurd. The writers offer little to no explanation of half the events in this movie, and I feel that this is what killed the film, along with the badly-drawn Dragonball Z-type characters. If you want to see good anime see anything by Hayao Miyazaki. 1-10  Overall--5.5 Direction--6 Story--2.5 Visuals--8.5",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Confusing to the weak of mind.  The best anime film ever.,"The first time I saw Akira was when I was young.  I remember thinking that the animation was superb but it was not until recently that I discovered it's true beauty.  The plot, whilst complicated, is a tremendous example of imagination and foresight.  The film draws you in and you really get a feeling of empathy for the characters.  I recommend this film whole-heartedly to anyone who wants more than stunning visuals and violence (Akira has a balance of both).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
2001 Remastered Version Blows,"As most things that people try to ""remaster,"" the 2001 version that Poineer Animations put out just doesn't cut it. I've watched Akira on VHS about 4 times in my life with the original English dialogue. That original cast had great voices that supported the characters. Although the translation may not have been as accurate, the actors were portraying the characters appropriately with their voices. In the original cast, the tones of the voices and calculated pauses gave the scenes that sense of urgency and strange phenomena. This new version has lost its aura. The new English voice actors made the characters shallow and stereotypical. These new actors are lifeless. They just sound like Hollywood rejects reading lines, as opposed to acting. My mother could do a better job with line delivery. I used to say that Akira was the best example of dubbing of a foreign film. But no more. From now on, I'm only watching it in Japanese.",,Anonymous,Animation
Still a state of the art adventure three decades after its release.,"Akira isn't only my favorite anime; it's my favorite animated film and one of my favorite films, period. Katsuhiro Otomo has crafted an animated sci-fi actioner for adults that's good, a rarity since most ""adult"" animation fails by relying on dopey sex jokes and idiotic plot rather than a good story with likable characters. Otomo's film weaves together themes of friendship, honor, betrayal, the deadly consequences of playing God, gang war, espionage, corruption, and the abuse of power while maintaining a brisk pace throughout its running time. Throw it all in a blender and it's one of the greatest animated films of all time.On July 16, 1988, Tokyo was obliterated in a massive explosion, setting off World War III. In 2019, Tokyo has been rebuilt as Neo-Tokyo, a megalopolis crawling with malignant crime and governed by corrupt politicians where 16-year-old Shotaro Kaneda (Cam Clarke in the 1988 Streamline dub, Johnny Yong Bosch in the 2001 Pioneer dub, Mitsuo Iwata in Japanese) is the tough, cocky, skirt-chasing, and bullheaded leader of the Capsules, a biker gang that's currently at war with the Clowns, a band of savage rapists. Kaneda's gang consists of his friends, 15-year-old Tetsuo Shima (Jan Rabson, Joshua Seth, Nozomu Sasaki) who's like a brother to him, 15-year-old Kai (Bob Bergen, Anthony Pulcini, Takeshi Kusao), and 16-year-old Yama (Tony Pope, Michael Lindsay, Masaaki Okura) and a few others. During a brawl with the Clowns, students are protesting and an odd-looking boy named Takashi (Barbara Goodson, Cody Mackenzie, Tatsuhiko Nakamura) with psychic powers has been abducted. After Tetsuo takes down a Clown, his bike explodes upon nearly ramming Takashi. The boys arrive to find a battered Tetsuo. The army, led by Colonel Shikishima (Pope, Jamieson Price, Taro Ishida), arrives on the scene and takes both Tetsuo and Takashi away, while the boys are arrested. At the police station, Kaneda gets 17-year-old resistance member Kei (Lara Cody, Wendee Lee, Mami Koyama) released with them, having taken an interest in her. Dr. Onishi (Lewis Arquette, Simon Prescott, Mizuho Suzuki) conducts experiments on Tetsuo, prompting his escape. After Tetsuo steals Kaneda's bike to run away with his girlfriend Kaori (Goodson, Michelle Ruff, Yuriko Fuchizaki) and both are attacked by the Clowns, Tetsuo beats a Clown to a pulp before he is again taken by the army to the facility that also holds Kiyoko (Melora Harte, Sandy Fox, Fukue Ito who is credited as Sachie Ito), Takashi, and Masaru (Bergen, Mackenzie, Kazuhiro Kamifuji who is credited as Kazuhiro Kando). When Kaneda tries to find out what happened to Tetsuo, he and Kei soon find that Tetsuo, now gifted with telekinesis, is being consumed by psychosis, and after he murders one of their friends, an enraged Kaneda resolves to stop him.As you can guess from the summary, there's a lot going on in Akira. Even with Otomo having removed much of what was in his then-incomplete manga, there's still enough to warrant its 124-minute length. We see Kaneda worry about Tetsuo as a true friend does, Tetsuo lose his grip on sanity and become someone else, and Colonel Shikishima struggle against politicians who only cares about money. We see the dangers of playing God as Tetsuo wreaks havoc on Neo-Tokyo and even earlier when Colonel Shikishima says that maybe they should leave that power alone. We also get glimpses at honor when Kaneda tries to curb Tetsuo from killing a Clown he's already beaten severely and with Colonel Shikishima's musings on a soldier's duty. On top of that, Otomo throws in religious fanaticism as people blindly follow Tetsuo, thinking he's ""Akira."" There's more where that came from and the stakes keep rising to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Due to Otomo and Izo Hashimoto's excellent writing capabilities, the film isn't overstuffed and nothing feels out of place.The animation is stunning. All 327 colors are jaw-dropping; watch out for those reds. Each background has immense detail; the streets of Neo-Tokyo are gritty and grimy, buildings vary from excellent condition to run-down and deteriorated, we see walls and even a door with English profanity painted on them, and the sewers are as filthy as a real one while the interiors of the hospital are exceptionally clean in contrast to the clutter and graffiti of the school the boys attend. Each character looks like a real person, with the array of facial expressions that entails while clothing looks like what real people wear. The gore is also very realistic. Anyone without an iron stomach will want to steer clear of Akira. Organs fall out, half a face is shot off, and limbs are removed, which is not to mention the mutation scene. With that said, the gore serves the story rather than the reverse. The attention to detail goes even further to the few animals depicted in the film; the attack dogs near the beginning and even the dog that's seen in a commercial on a TV in the background look like real dogs and the rats in the sewer look like real rats. Put it all together and it's a depiction of 2019 that looks a lot like the real thing. The way Otomo keeps everything moving only helps. Otomo's decision to record the dialogue first and animate every nuance of the actor's mouth is where he pulls out all the stops, since this wasn't done in Japan at the time, making it even more impressive that the dubs sync with the animation as well as they do.Whichever version one prefers, though this fan is partial to the Streamline dub, performances excel across the board. Clarke, Yong Bosch, and Iwata are uniformly excellent as Kaneda, the tough, cocky and womanizing biker who cares about his friends and won't let anyone mess with them. He's a lot like I was at that age. While some have argued against both Clarke and Yong Bosch in favor of the other as sounding too old, I don't think that's the case with either; when I was 16, I didn't sound far removed from Clarke's take. Another argument some have made against Clarke is that he speaks in monotone, but nothing could be further from the truth; his tone changes with the situations he finds himself in. The same can be said of Rabson, Seth, and Sasaki as Tetsuo, though Seth lags just a little behind. With that said, this can be partly attributed to the Pioneer dub script, though it is grating that Seth often mispronounces Kaneda's name as ""Kah-nee-duh"" rather than ""Kuh-nay-duh"" or ""Kah-nay-duh."" Take the scene where Tetsuo advances on the soldiers in the government hospital and Seth says, ""It's no use hiding anymore,"" while neither Rabson nor Sasaki says, ""anymore."" It's not that big a deal, but it takes away from his menace some. With that said, all three portray him as an abused kid who loses his sanity and despite being the villain, you feel bad for him. Or at least I do since I see a lot of my mentally ill little sister there. Cody, Lee, and Koyama are first-class across the board as Kei, portraying her as tough but sensitive, well in line with how Otomo conceived her. The same can be said of Pope, Price, and Ishida as Colonel Shikishima, playing up his no-nonsense manner and sense of a soldier's duty. Bergen, Pulcini, and Kusao are superb as Kai, one of the film's most likable characters. So are Pope, Lindsay, and Okura as Yama, the most confrontational Capsule, and the same also be said for all the rest. That said, you can't go wrong with any of them.Music is a crucial part of any film. Akira is no exception and the Geinoh Yamashirogumi are up to the challenge, using drums, chants, guitars, gamelan percussion, and even a church organ to form Akira's musical score. Kaneda is the most recognizable, having been used in just about every trailer. It's easy to see why; it's an exhilarating track and it's hard not to feel pumped once you've heard it. The same can be said of Battle Against the Clowns, Tetsuo, and Exodus from the Underground Fortress. The score mostly remains the same, with the only radically different version being the Japanese hypersonic track that Geinoh Yamashirogumi founder Shoji Yamashiro mixed in 2008 for the film's Blu-ray release. In this version, which Yamashiro mastered at 192 kHz, music has been moved around, some pieces are shortened, some are replaced with alternate versions, and the piece used during the flashback to Kaneda and Tetsuo's first meeting has been replaced with an organ, and not necessarily for the better; if you want my honest opinion, the flashback is more powerful with the original music sampled from Requiem. That said, the entire score is incredible and I've listened to it countless times. In addition, Otomo squeezes in Tokyo Shoeshine Boy by Teruko Akatsuki during the scene where the groupies walk off from Kaneda, Kai, and Yama. Mix in a jaw-dropping sound design and it's a film firing on all cylinders.Akira is a fun and exciting film, one I could watch over and over again. Wanting to see it at age 11, it knocked my socks off when I finally saw it at 18. At 30 years old, it continues to stand the test of time. It's a timeless film, just as relevant today in 2019, if not more so than when it first dropped on Japan in 1988 and the United States in 1989. Akira was one of the first anime to arrive to the western world uncut; without it, we may not have Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and many more without a single frame removed. Akira is the best animated film made for adults and one of the best films of the 1980s, anime or otherwise. Its characters are well-drawn and feel real, it deftly handles global issues still at work, its frenzied action scenes continue to thrill and it's vastly quotable. Its imagery will remain burned within your psyche and its musical score will ring inside your eardrums long after the credits roll. If you love sci-fi and can brave the violence, you should see Akira at least once. Who knows? Maybe you'll like it and want to come back to it repeatedly. Very highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Upon the fourth viewing,"I have already written a review for this film, written after the second time I saw it (actually, a long time after my second viewing); I suggested a different way of looking at it, an approach more directed at the human aspects of this film (explored even further later in this review), and handed it a 9/10. It's greatest flaw, I stated, was that its story was far too complicated and difficult for its own good. Although by the second time I had understood it a lot more than the first time, many parts were still undecipherable. On my third viewing, on the new Pioneer Special Edition DVD (VERY highly suggested; you can't get the edition with the collector's tin anymore, but a plastic, and actually a better box is still available), I finally got to see it in widescreen and finally in Japanese. The Japanese (or the subtitles rather, since I don't speak the language) reveals more of the political level of the story. On my fourth viewing, the first one when I watched it entirely alone, I connected the story a little better, but many questions were still unanswered. But now my attitude is this: who cares?Few doubt its visual mastery; only Princess Mononoke is comparable in the level of detail. I would say that Akira is still, even compared to Mononoke, on a level all its own. It's something that most people tend to look over when they're examining animation, but the techniques of the direction are actually highly developed. The techniques of direction in animation are still far behind those of live action film because the medium is not taken seriously. The Japanese are solving this problem, but Akira is still its peak.I have previously talked about its more human side, trying to shut those up who accuse it of being nothing but spectacle. Here, too, comparing it with Mononoke, which stands as the most universally liked anime film in America (despite what Disney thinks; btw, if you think I'm ragging on Mononoke Hime, I do love it. Check out my user comment on it, although I don't quite like it as much as I did upon my first viewing), I think the emotional and human values of Akira are greater. There has been a constant fuss about the ambiguity of Mononoke's characters. ""There're no good guys or bad guys,"" is a popular phrase that I think even I used to describe the characters in the film. If there are no purely good guys, then what is Ashitaka, for instance? Akira's characters are actually much more ambiguous. I bizarrely chose to compare Ashitaka with Travis Bickle, the crazy taxi driver from, well, Taxi Driver in describing how complex I felt his character was. I'm embarrassed that I said such a silly thing; not that Ashitaka, despite his good- guy ethics, isn't a complex character; it's just that comparing him with Travis Bickle implies something that it oughtn't to. Now Tetsuo can be fairly compared with Travis Bickle. As Roger Ebert once said about Bickle, Taxi Driver is a great film because we can all identify with Bickle, even if we would never go as far as he did.Tetsuo is the same way: there is an enormous amount of pathos in that character. Caneda is just as well developed. To see just how well written this script is, follow Caneda's developement throughout the film. He is not the same person at the end. Kaori, Yamagata, Kai, the Colonel, Masaru, Kiyoko, and Takashi have quite a bit of depth, too. Perhaps the only characters who come off a little thin are Kei and Ryu; this is because of the difficulties the screenwriters had in developing that particular aspect of the film, the revolution. I'm not sure, for instance, why they were smuggling Takashi away at the film's beginning. Maybe a fifth viewing will reveal more of those aspects. Of course, the politics are only supposed to be working as the background to the struggle between Tetsuo and Kaneda.On this fourth viewing, Akira reveals itself to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made, one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen, maybe the best (and I have seen a lot), and easily the best animated film I've ever seen. It also stands now, in my opinion, as one of the greatest masterpieces in cinema.PS: No, actually, I'm not a fanboy.

"Decent, okay; just highly overrated.","After hearing many reviews on AKIRA being such a highly praised, groundbreaking anime film and cult classic among anime lovers, I decided to finally watch it to see what the hype was all about. Suffice to say, I was left pretty disappointed. I'll start with the mechanics of the film. I must say that the animation is very well done for the time the film was created. Of course, modern animation (whether two or three dimensional) is much more dynamic by today's standards, but context is everything. Visually, it was pretty impressive, especially the action scenes, and the detailings of the setting. It fully captures the essence of dark, grim, and futuristic, dystopian Tokyo on the verge of an apocalypse. So, on to what I didn't like about the film. I felt as if most of the characters very one-dimensional and dull, even the main characters Tetsuo and Kaneda. Tetsuo and Kaneda's relationship could've been a lot more developed, but they failed to do so. Immediately, we are thrust into a major plot point where Tetsuo gets injured. There was no time for the development of their relationship, which only could've taken a few scenes to animate. Instead, I felt as if there were a lot of unnecessary scenes with irrelevant dialogue throughout the film, dragging the film out longer than it should. Later on in the film, we find out that Tetsuo is struggling with his identity and role in his friendship with Kaneda. There is obviously a difference in status and lack of balance in power within their relationship. Again, these concepts are implied and underdeveloped. I felt that Kaneda's bike gang didn't have much development as well. Rather than a close-knit and loyal gang, it felt more like just an ordinary gang that was just ""there"" to fill in spots for characters. Also, the plot of the story was not difficult to catch on, but it took awhile to fully grasp the big picture, since the film is dragged out longer than it should. It got confusing at times and even convoluted, leaving the audience with many unanswered questions. Overall, AKIRA was not that bad. It was sort of decent, just highly overrated. I do understand why AKIRA may have been hailed as a ""classic,"" as the animation, plot line, and overall themes of the film were pretty original and groundbreaking material for anime during that time, as well as the fact that it was introduced to the Western audience when anime was not very common and popular. A lot of people may have nostalgic attachments to this film, but from a more unbiased point of view, I didn't think it was that great and there are a lot more anime films that are much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
good but not great,"Before reading this review, understand that I am over 40 and am not an avid anime fan. I have watched MANY anime movies (my daughter is NUTS about anime) but my primary interest is in Japanese movies (such as those by Akira Kurasawa---a DIFFERENT ""Akira"" from the one in this movie). So, look at my review in this light.Artistically, this movie is brilliant. When I was a kid, Japanese animation meant crap such as KIMBA or SPEED RACER--very choppy style animation and in their American form ONLY for the kids! Calling that old stuff AND this movie ""anime"" seems like a disservice because of this. Instead of poor backgrounds and extremely low frame-rates that made the shows look more like slide shows than cartoons, Akira abounds with high quality animation, backgrounds, intense sounds and action! This is certainly NOT ""your father's anime"".So why only a score of 7? Well, the story is incredibly confusing---even for anime. I felt like I needed a script so I could logically follow along or that MAYBE the translation into English subtitles was flawed (I've seen this ruin several movies before).In addition to being totally confusing, the main characters are unlikable street thugs. It's hard to get into a movie when you just don't like ANYONE (well, maybe I liked the one freaky kid who had neat mental powers).But, for lovers of anime and anyone who wants to see an incredibly intense and high quality Japanese animation movie, this will definitely be a must-see. HOWEVER, I STRONGLY WARN PARENTS TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT TO LET THEIR KIDS SEE THIS. The movie, is at times, intense and gory AND features one attempted rape that gets pretty graphic!

Every shot could be framed and mounted on your wall. It looks that good.,"The hype built around ""Akira"" is there for a reason; see this animated film for yourself and get ready to have your mind blown. It's 2019, post World War 3 Tokyo, now Neo-Tokyo. Shotaro Kaneda (voiced by Mitsuo Iwata) is the leader of the Capsules Biker gang. While out fighting their rivals, Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) nearly crashes into a small, odd-looking child. Tetsuo is injured and taken away by government agents, who discover that his brain patterns are very unusual. Colonel Shikishima (voiced by Taro Ishida) orders experimenting to begin on the boy, who begins to develop similar powers to Akira a mysterious boy with mental powers so powerful they were nearly god-like. The plot follows Kaneda, who allies himself with anti-government forces in the hopes of rescuing his friend and Tetsuo, whose growing abilities begin tearing at his sanity.This film looks amazing. The post-war setting of 2019 Neo Tokyo makes for some truly incredible sights. This is one of those movies where any number of still could serve as backgrounds for your desktop because every little element is lush and detailed. Every frame was painstakingly hand-drawn and painted and you can tell everyone involved consistently delivered their best work. Every frame is beautiful and exciting to see. Populating this world is a story that fleshes out Neo-Tokyo and makes it seem very much alive. While we mostly follow Kaneda and Tetsuo, we also see glimpses of the rest of the population. We find out that there is political unrest between the youth of Japan and the corrupt government, that there is a religious cult following the mysterious Akira, that the youth who are disenchanted with rules and politics roam the streets, fighting each other and joining gangs. You get a glimpse at a world that's very interesting; just enough to get you worried when the climax of the film threatens it all.If you're a big fan of animation and you want to break the stereotype that every animated film is for kids, this would be an excellent choice to show to the uninitiated. If you're not a fan of animation and you want to jump into the format, this is a great spot to go; no silly sequences where a character screams, but only his mouth moves or backgrounds are replaced with streaming lines here. There are some shocking moments of violence and some frightening sequences (mostly Tetsuo's hallucinations as he develops psychic powers) that are the stuff of nightmares. The story is complex, but not difficult to follow (kind of a must for a film that is subtitled and moves quickly) and the characters are well developed, with some nice subtle moments to them. It's all set to a fantastic score that's memorable and haunting, cleverly using vocals (but not necessarily words) and to me, what sounded like an extensive selection of wooden xylophones to generate a primal, haunting melody that hinted at the action that was incoming.It all wraps itself up into an unforgettable climax and the film is filled with iconic moments that once you see, you will recognize in countless other films and stories. The film nevertheless stays fresh and stimulating throughout despite inspiring countless other filmmakers. I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who I wouldn't recommend ""Akira"" to and if you can see it on the big screen, it's an engulfing experience you won't easily forget. Even you, that guy that doesn't really think of himself or herself as a person that likes animation, you have got to see this film. I can't believe it took me this long to finally get around to watching it. It actually makes me angry that someone didn't introduce it to me earlier! You absolutely must get around to watching ""Akira"". (Original Japanese version with subtitles on the big screen, January 31, 2014)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Akira Review,"As with anybody else exploring Japanese animation for the first time, Akira was one of the first titles that I ran across, for it represents one of the most popular, most innovative, and most explosive experiences committed to the medium. For at least one generation, the film served as a major gateway drug to the larger world of anime, with promises of pulpy and unbridled violence that normal American animation would never dare divulge in (and the cult of Akira thrived well on video tape bootlegs, before the advent of optical media). If you are looking for animation with such elements as killer biker gangs, military takeovers, out-of-control psychic warfare, and mass destruction galore, then there's no better place to start than with Akira.The film begins and ends with a bang...literally. Set in the scuzzy streets of NeoTokyo, some 30 years after a cataclysmic explosion that heralded the coming of World War III, the film immediately kicks off with a thrilling biker gang chase. When one of the gang members is captured by the military and experimented on, unlocking latent psychic powers. all hell continues to break loose. Tetsuo's psychic rampage leaves nothing but awe in its wake, as he stops tanks shells and laser beams in the air, destroys entire city blocks, and sends vehicles careening out of control. It all builds up to a huge showdown in the stadium, where evolution suddenly goes into overdrive, and the fate of the world is suddenly at stake.The film is fast and densely-packed with loads of well-staged action setpieces. Even when things aren't blowing up, the visuals are superbly-drawn, and often serve to express more to the story. However, even I'll admit that the experience hasn't always been that endearing. The film felt convoluted and stiff at first glance, but through repeat viewings (and after reading the original manga), I grew to connect much deeper to the story and characters.When comparing the story to its source material, there is some missed potential; the Akira manga is a huge saga with numerous subplots and characters that would require more movies (or maybe an anime series) to fully cover. Katsuhiro Otomo, however, takes his own story and completely remixes it for the film, paring down the whole story and cutting out whole characters to make it all fit in a two-hour time frame. Even though the full story of Akira would be grand to see on the big screen, this film proves that less is more. The movie is entirely set in NeoTokyo, and it methodically reveals all the characters and ideas it needs to to make sense. I believe it actually handles all of this much better than the manga did, where characters seemed to bump into each other at random and then go on the run; in the movie, the characters receive a more pronounced introduction and are gradually tied into the various plots involving military coups, secret experiments, and all-out destruction. The film squeezes in as much characterization as it can; more screen time for everybody would be welcome, but there's just enough to them to make them easy to understand. The plot seems dense with all the different characters and concepts it has to juggle, but the film strings it all together aptly to make all the twists and themes feel natural. Themes of power - the best and worst of it - resonates throughout the entire picture.Made with a larger-than-average budget, the film boasts spectacular animation quality. Every scene is laden with rich, highly-detailed, and brilliantly-colored artwork. Action moves very smoothly. Even character movements and lip flapping is very well-done (unlike other anime films, Akira is pre-scored, with dialogue recorded before the animation, allowing them to animate mouth movements to match the voices). A few computer effects are used in the film, and generally match up with the film well. Designs for all the settings, characters, costumes, vehicles, and things are really cool. Voice acting can be a hit or a miss, depending on what version you see. The Japanese dubbing is decent. There are two different American dubs available, and they're both cheesy and over-the-top in their own right. Writing is pretty well-balanced; exposition is used to condense some parts of the plot and make it more accessible to audiences, but it doesn't sacrifice much, and most lines are punchy and good. Sound design is pretty cool. The music score contains some of the weirdest music I've ever heard, but it's strangely fitting, and perhaps a little catchy.Even though it seemed odd at first, I've grown to love Akira and its dystopian world of warring bikers and psychics. Its style and levels of superpowered action inspired more films and shows in the medium, and it would inspire me (and others like me) to explore more of the exciting world of anime. Even on its own merits, it has always been a thrilling, edgy, and inspiring experience unlike any other. If you're open to watching this type of animation, it's recommended watching at least once for mature audiences.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An incredible film of epic proportions.,"I remember seeing this film when I was around oh, 8 or 9 years old, in full knowing of the adult content (I mean, the most violent animation I had seen previos was probably ""Footrot Flats""). I didnt sit all the way through it (its a hell of a lot of story to consume) but the action in the first half entranced me like no other ""Cartoon"" had before ie I couldnt believe they allowed breasts and shot dogs in cartoons.I have since bought it myself, and it still, from start to finish entraps the imagination in its beautifully stunning animation, set pieces and unbelievable action. I would say the last half hour is the greatest action sequence ever portrayed on film, whether animated or not, and is enveloped in animation I believe far surpass' that of even Ghost In The Shell (which is saying a lot) especially considering its entirely hand drawn, which I appreciate greatly in animation.The storyline while being convoluted and incredibly hard to follow the first few times, and could alienate some viewers through its intricacies, opens up after several viewing and provides a great backdrop to the entire experience.I will admit one thing though. I have yet to see the subtitled version, and while sure to be superior to the dubbed, its not entirely necessary IMO. The American dubbing, while ruining a lot of the context (as anime dubbing does) its probably one of the best efforts I have heard. The characters voices really grow on you, and are all individual sounding with a lot of character differentiation.Overall it sits on my personal top ten, and provides a depth rarely seen in film, let alone animation.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Simply Stunning,"I remember that when I first rented the video tape of Akira, I didn't like it, most likely because I didn't understand it.  But after waiting 2 months for the special edition DVD of Akira, I gave it a second chance.  The second time, I loved it!  What probably drew me into it was the stunning and beautiful animation.  A second factor that probably drew in even deeper, was the musical score.  It is definitely the best I've ever heard.  The violence here isn't really as graphic as some people have made it out to be.  Yes, people get shot, yes there are bodies exploding, yes when people get punched or hit by foreign objects, blood does flow, but all the blood and gore here is sustained.  I won't lie.

Not denying its impact on the world of animation: Akira (the Movie) isn't THAT good,"Really interesting and defining the genre for its time, first and final sequence were spectacular, in the middle the writing could've done a better job at explaining the premise. To be fair that was a lot of manga fit into just two hours. Regardless it changed animation forever!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
at the time it was ground breaking in its overall quality of production,"when compared to some of the digitally edited anime on offer nowadays AKIRA seems almost antiquated with its soft hazy backgrounds and over emphasised facial expressions but if you look at the work as a whole, taking into account the staggering amount of man hours involved in each scene (there is almost constant movement in every shot, especially the traffic scenes!) and the ease with which the audience empathises with the characters, then you have to consider it to be the benchmark for future anime to be judged against. I love this film because it got me into anime! And it was one of the smartest films of it's genre, somehow adding acceptability to an otherwise entirely implausible plot. I love it, and I prefer the original to the anamorphic!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nice animation, but confusing","As a neophyte in the world of anime`, I was hyped to see Akira, generally regarded as the best anime` movie ever.  It was kind of a letdown.

Great animation but the story was confusing and the constant explosions/destruction was gratuitous.  **** for art, ** for story. Recommended for those who have the patience.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Movie Of The Decade (1980-1989),"I'm not going to be critical on this movie. Shame on you all critics and users who put 7 or less on this movie. Shame, on, you.

An excellent anime,"If you're like me and not certain about anime, and your only reference is Dragonball Z, be prepared to be dazzled and amazed. In the first ten minutes, this movie hits you with a plethora of intense futuristic imagery. Unlike with live action sci-fi films, the anime experience is only limited by the director's imagination. Anime is also treated more seriously as a medium in Japan than it is here in the states.I don't want to ruin it too much, but if you are not familiar with anime and are looking for something that will transport you to another place, Akira is the place to go.

The best hand-drawn thing I have seen in my life.,"This is by far the best hand-drawn animation I've seen in my entire life and it surpasses every single anime that is praised for the hand-drawn animation like Dragonball, Naruto and many other anime series. It has been made in 1988 and it is way ahead of it's time, Disney is just a copycat in my eyes from now on for me.

One of the best films of all time,"This isn't just the best anime of all time.  I feel that it trancends its boundaries as an ""anime"" film and can rank amongst the all-time greats. What many don't understand in their haste to compare this to films like Princess Mononoke or Ghost in the Shell is that it came out about 12 and 7 years before those films, respectively.  Akira was so far ahead of its time, that it's actually aged very well.The story, centering around two members of a biker gang, actually goes so far in depth about the nature of their friendship that you actually forget about the theme of ""man vs. nature"" in the story.  The SE DVD was done really well and it plays really well on a good home theatre system.You can't possibly think of a film this layered as just another Japanese cartoon.  It set a high water mark for anime and along with films like Macross and Vampire Hunter D; was very instrumental in anime crossing the pacific to enjoy widespread popularity in the U.S.The only complaint I could think of at the moment is that much of the plot was toned down from the even more adult themes of the comic book anime that this was based on.  Although many people think that the original dubbed voices were poorly done, I think that they gave the movie some extra character and charm.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Tip of the Iceberg,"Thank You Katsuhiro Otomo for opening my eyes to the wonderful world of Anime. Akira was the first anime I ever watched, though I was young at the time. The spectacular animation blew me away.Akira is what I now call an Onion film. Not because it makes you cry but every time you watch it you understand more of the complex storyline and characters. Now to address the DVD problem Only in Australia do you get the original dubbed English dialogue which if you have watched Akira you know the classic lines. But in the US that DVD has more features. I was disappointed in the way the ""new americian"" dialogue over simplified the old dialogue. The mysterious and deep dialogue died. I shall give you an example. Here is a line that is not in the movie but demostrates how the new US dialogue is bad Old US dialogue dub ""Akira is a highly powerful entinty"" New US dialogue Dub ""Akira is a very powerful guy""Now back to Akira"" The old US dialogue version"" , after the first viewing of the movie you understand a little bit of Akira then I advise you to watch it several times over a year or two and delve deeper into the story.

A confusing but impressive movie,"I enjoy modern anime quite a lot, and this movie has been on my list of old anime to watch because of the fame surrounding it.The music used in the movie was very good.

The animation of the movie doesn't seem to be as smooth or natural as modern, big-budget anime, but the colors used in the movie pop a lot. There were a lot of unique colors, all of which fit in nicely with both the supernatural theme of the movie and the post-apocalyptic future the movie is set in.The storyline of the movie is what confuses me, though. I didn't enter the movie thinking that it would be very hard to digest, but it is. There are a lot of things the movie leaves up to the viewers to decipher, and there are times where the movie gets a little confusing.

Amazing,"I had seen Akira a number of times a few years back, and watching it again just two days I can't tell you how enthralled I was watching it. The animation is beautiful and very detailed with a wide range of colours that are extraordinary to watch, and the score was phenomenal, it stirred many emotions inside of me. Just like the storytelling that was thrilling, shocking and heart-breaking did, likewise with the use of sound, the silence was even more haunting and intense than those scenes with sound, the excellent dialogue, characters that are developed so well(for a character-driven film you'd expect that, the main characters' conflict is especially well done) that you do root for them and a message that I highly appreciate and don't feel it's over-didactic.

Excellent film:  One of the best ever made,"AKIRA is more than just a good film.  It is flat out great.  Its story is unequaled in the movie business and it is by far the best anime ever made, LODOSS being a close second.  But many people are turned off from AKIRA by reviews about its bloodbath and intense violence.  In fact, there is hardly ant blood in the movie.  A lot of people die, but much of it is not graphically shown.  Anyone 14 and above can, and should see this movie. It is appropriate, if the viewer is mature of mind, and delves into the realm of the human psyche vividly.  For anyone who loves real ""ART"", completely drawn except for one scene, and of a truly high caliber of films, then AKIRA is for you.

One of the first and one of the best.,"I guess I should start off by saying that I'm a Japanimation fan ever since I was little. I always enjoyed watching robots fight it out on tv. Then of course I grew up, and became more and more interested in animations and I thought I should watch a full-length anime. I went down to the local video store and a little package in the corner of the shelf caught my eye. I picked up the video and was first introduced to the best anime of all times : ""AKIRA"".I was absolutely enthralled when I first viewed AKIRA. Even though I felt that the story was complicated, it did nothing to effect my judgement of the film. In fact I liked the mysterious feeling the movie gave me the first time I looked at the futuristic Tokyo with all the skyscrapers,lights, and the incredible artwork it was presented in.The character animation in this film is by far the best I've seen. The characters moved fluidly and realistically, showing off a wide range of emotions. The voices were equally well done, the speech actually matches the character's mouth movement. This can be seen by watching the subtitled version of the film, which I consider to be the better version.One of the things that stands out in this movie is the detailed background. The futuristic Tokyo was brought to life in it's full glory. Complete with detailed texture on buildings, realistic lighting effects, and constant movement in the background make the film extremely atmospheric. Along with a powerful and unforgettable soundtrack. You'll be sucked into the animated world in no time.The story like I said is very complicated, and will require multiple viewing to fully understand. Basically in a nutshell the film is about a secret army experiment on ESP that can render a test subject so powerful he/she can destroy with only their will. The main characters come from a motorcycle gang, the leader Kanada, and his friend Tetsuo. In one of the battles with a rival gang. Tetsuo was seriously injured and was taken to a military hospital, where he became a test subject for the army. He gained more and more power and finally escaped from the hospital. On the verge of insanity, Tetsuo swept through Tokyo with his supernatural abilities and it's up to Kanada and his rebel friend Kay, plus a trio of psionics to stop Tetsuo and prevent the destruction of the whole city, perhaps even the world.If you want to fully appreciate AKIRA, i suggest you watch it at least 3 times so you can full piece together all the subplots.I've said all I can about AKIRA. I can say no more if I do not wish to spoil the story for those of you who haven't seen it. All I can say is no matter if you are an Animation fan or not. Go rent AKIRA and enjoy it, you won't regret it. Because this is the best animation ever made and there'll never be one like it ever again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
best film i have,"I am a 15 year old boy and i bought AKIRA for my psp. i went to buy pro evo 5 but i was 49p short and because i am an impatient punk i didn't want to walk back and get more money. When i watched AKIRA that night my life changed, my friends say I'm obsessed with the film and i know they would not appreciate the film if they did watch it. If you have not seen this film go and buy it now you will either love it or hate it (like marmite)if you hate it then at least you wont spend your life wondering what would my life be like if i bought AKIRA but if you are one of the people that grasp the intelligence and over coolness of the film you will never regret buying it for a second. And you will look back with sorrow at all the wasted AKIRA free years and think,""why did someone not tell me about this film"", this is the only Japanese animie film i have seen but it will not be the last AKIRA has opened my eyes to a different kind of film, a kind of film without actors that are in love with themselves and in which the word impossible is nonexistent i hope you will take my advise and go out and buy AKIRA right now...stop reading this and buy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hard Edges,"This is an interesting film. The story is sophomoric and the characters are, well, cartoons. But the cinematic world is interesting. The creator was clearly brimming with ideas, and these are obviously from his print efforts.This was done using print techniques. meaning that the animation is drawn and page-sequenced rather than using what are now common computerized techniques. So this may be the best of the films that are 'hard-edged.'The art itself is all cartoon, meaning each object and person has sharp outlines. This is hardly unique, even with modern (but cheap) animation. But at least here, you have some clever shading and use of complementary colors. Few colors are used throughout. Shadows and blends are also ""hard"" of course.More interesting is the hardness elsewhere. Because this is cell art, there is no motion blurring. Its lack is jarring once you've gotten used to films which use it, so because of its age, this film has already achieved a curious antique effect of hard motion. Obviously, the animator was aware of this, because he uses extreme discontinuities between shots. The result isn't just simple choppiness, as others have noted, but a continuation of the punkish style of hard edges, as well as an evocation of comic panels.Stupid story, but curiously stylish, dated animation.",,Anonymous,Animation
A masterpiece,"This is the ""Watchmen"" of the Orient. An awesome masterpiece which has so much to say to young people. The struggle in 2019 in Neo-Tokyo by the orphaned teenagers is our struggle. We identify with Tetsuo and his horrifying decent from childhood into manhood and beyond. A marvelous superhero story and the human relations. Tetsuo´s girlfriend and ""best friend"" we know and understand these problems. Akira remains the elusive opponent of Tetsuo. But in reality the battle is not between Tetsuo and Akira but between Tetsuo, his friends and the leaders of Neo-Tokyo. I cannot emphasize how much I recommend this movie. It is the animated version of Kurosawa blending with the modern art of Tsukamoto´s ""Tetsuo"" which is definitely build on ""Akira"". I didn´t know that until I saw it today. I guess it has something to do with the Japanese concept of ""Manga"". Anyhow, don´t believe the ""low"" rating for Akira on IMDB. This is one of the most important films ever made. 10/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A good transition, short of perfect","I understand how some people feel: that this film has absolutely (or very very little) to do with the original books, or that there is no discernible plot. And I would agree. As a movie, AKIRA is very shallow. However, you have to understand what this movie has done to Anime. It was the movie that brought the anime craze to the United States. Also, just watch the movie from an art perspective. Just as a cartoon, this film blows all conventional anime standards out of the water. No current film has ever come close to what AKIRA did for anime, and I doubt any other traditionally made (cel) movie ever will. My thanks and congratulations to Katsuhiro Otomo's team.Kaneda's character in the film is much shallower as the one described in the manga. His real motivation is only mentioned once in the movies, when he says ""Tetsuo is our friend, if anyone's going to kill him, it should be us."" In the books, Kaneda's transformation from mere bike gang leader to head of an entire resistance is a slow one, and you can see his skill growing. He is motivated by sheer revenge in the beginning, revenge for Yamagata. Towards the end though, you can begin to see that his interest in the Akira Project itself is present. Unfortunately, the actual Project is not made perfectly clear in the movie version. A terrible shame, as it provides some interesting aspects of the behind-the-scenes of the story.*more to be updated in time*",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Deserves more than a 7.9.,"This movie honestly blew my mind when I watched the first 30 minutes of this. Everything I saw was really amazing and nothing not even my bedtime could lure me away from Akira. I hold this as a really extraordinary masterpiece (next to the Street Fighter II anime film) in my opinion, and I don't see why any anime fan can consider themselves an otaku without watching this. This will blow you away and I'm not lying, watch and be amazed. I mean sure there's a lot of graphic content (that Mutation scene still freaks me out), so this is primarily aimed at an older audience. I really consider this to be one of the best anime films I've seen thus far and if you have not seen this, DO IT NOW. If not, then you are crazy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Life-changing.,"Like the introductory nuke that sets up the back story, Akira exploded upon the western hemisphere with the power of 10'000 pounds of pure TNT. Wasn't animation supposed to be cute? Wasn't there supposed to be song and dance routines, fluffy animal sidekicks and good old fashioned morals interspersed between moments of slapstick comedy and saucer-eyed shenanigans? Thankfully, in Japan they do things differently; in Japan, animation is cool.Akira blew my mind when I saw it at the impressionable age of 15. I wasn't a complete noob, but still I had no idea what I was in for when I popped that crispy VHS tape into my noisy VCR. This movie had everything my teenage fantasies craved; ultra stylized and ultra violent sci-fi action more than a decade before the Matrix with production values that (now) nearly 20 years old still rock. There are scenes in this film drawn with more precision than a computer rendering, that look more alive because of that added human touch.And there's a story to go with it. My animation instructor claimed Akira had nothing more than people yelling at each other in it (he was a little biased tho, having been influenced by only the western animation greats like ... well, none of their names come to mind because I was only influenced by Japanese ones! No wait, Tex Avery, got one! hah!...) Needless to say, I pity him and never did forgive him for his stupidity.This is a masterpiece, something that must be seen. The original Streamline dub is better than the new Panasonic one, even though it is probably less accurate it left more to the imagination. But don't let that or the steep asking price deter you from the new DVD. There's tons of special features, from the Akira production report (30 mins) to 100s of character designs and background paintings to frame through. And the digital mastering brings out the picture and color in a way that makes my VHS tape weep tears of joy.If you haven't seen it, I can't give AKIRA a higher recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
stunning,"akira is somewhat mind boggling. without the background of Japanese culture, and the more specific 'akira' backstory this film can get puzzling. but it's worth watching a few times to get your head around what is going on.more important than the tangly plot is the way this film looks & the atmosphere it creates. the characters are well presented, and developed. this helps to create the very dark atmosphere of the film. the animation is stunning, most of the film is at night, and artificial light & shadows are extremely difficult to render, it's achieved superbly.overall if you like your films dark it's worth a watch, if you like your films complicated it's worth a watch, if you're into animation it's worth a watch, basically it's worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Akira Great Animation for its Time but a story that falls flat!,"The Plot: Childhood friends Tetsuo and Kaneda's motorcycle gang encounters a military operation to retrieve an escaped experimental subject. The military captures Tetsuo and conducts experiments on him that unleash his latent psychic ability, but when these new powers rage out of control, Tetsuo lashes out at the world that has oppressed him! My Spiel: I have to say I enjoyed watching Akira for the visuals. But as for the overall story line for some reason didn't appeal to me as much as it did to many others. Granted I love the motorcycle and the animation scenes with the bike and when Tetsuo goes off against Kaneda & the army. This coming from a artist perspective its nothing short of awesome in what they did in 1988. But to be fair I am reviewing movies how I watch them and how they are, and I just think the story was average.

AKIRA revolutionalised not only Anime but MOVIES !,"You may think it's a bold statement to say this one film, all be it an animated one help mould today's modern cinema. But I really do feel without a film like Akira, people like the Wachowski brothers, Quentin Tarantino and Doug Linam even wouldn't have half the creative juices flowing in their head from the explosion of vivid storytelling, fascinating narrative (even if it was in Japanese) and amazing detail.This movie is ground breaking on so many levels its mind boggling, the story is a bit out their, but someone please tell me which Manga ain't, in fact you can't tell me Lord of the Rings or Star Wars aren't ""far out there"" stories either, at least Akira is set in Tokyo a real place ! With great characters you really feel immersed in the plot of the movie and Tetsuo's roller-coaster ride is portrayed beautifully. But this movie is all about Kaneda, what a guy, if a young teenager needs someone to idolise its this street punk, who has a chip on his shoulder throughout this movie and tries his best to keep his best friend Tetsuo from falling deeper into a black hole.

My all-time favorite anime,"""Akira"" is one of the most visually potent animated films of all time.  Set in a darkly futuristic version of modern-day Tokyo, this tale tells of several people trying to stop mentally unbalanced adolescent from turning the city into rubble by the use of enhanced mental abilities.  I have seen this movie twice and I still cannot believe how spooky and disturbing it is. The plot is hard enough to follow that it might require a second viewing. This is a movie to watch if you really to have some fun experiencing the anime genre.The animation is exceptional considering it came out before the advent of computer-assisted animation.  Now, it looks even better since it is digitally remastered.  I believe this is the best animated work to have come out of the Land of the Rising Sun.  It is quiet possibly the most beautiful classically (aka sans computer assistance) animated film of all time even though it was probably one of the last ones to ever be made in the classic sense.Overall, Katsuhiro Otomo has created visual and even psychological potpourri that will leave an etch on the psyche of animation for all time despite the country of origin.  Animated films that were released after ""Akira"" and that have yet to be released have looked and will continue to look ""Akira"" for inspiration because of how groundbreaking it actually was.  This movie introduced me to the anime genre but nothing will probably overtake ""Akira"" as being my all-time favorite anime film.  10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Grossly Overrated,"For its time, Akira set new standards in animation. However, a movie is more than just visuals. In this respect, while ground-breaking on a technological level, Akira is a failure as a movie. It features unlikeable, boring, often-stereotypical characters with poor character designs. And the plot does little to make up for the lackluster characters. At best, it's a very rough synopsis of over twenty volumes of manga. At worst, it's an utter train wreck.Rather than seeing Akira as a movie, viewers should consider it an animated ""omake"" to the manga. If you liked the manga, and always wanted to see certain scenes in action, then it's worth watching. In that respect, it's sort of like the movies your annoying uncle takes of his vacation.

Breathtaking,I know I'm a little late with this review but after seeing this movie I've got to say something about Akira. Directer Katshiro Otoma has made quite the piece of work. Akira has the most original story and captivating characters ever seen in an animated film and perhaps a real film too.Shotaro Kaneda ( Japanese voice by Mitsuo Iwata) is the leader of a Neo-Tokyo bike gang. Along his side as one of the other gang members is Tetsuo Shima (Japanese voice by Nozomu Sasaki). When a secret military experiment is thrown in the picture turning Tetsuo into a crazed psionic killing freak Kaneda and his gang must save Tetsuo and save Neo-Tokyo at the same time.This movie goes beyond any other anime film ever. Even the widely known Princess Mononke. The movie is fast paced and the characters are well thought-out. Akira goes down as the greatest anime film of all time. 9/10.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"a great, but loose, adaptation of great manga","Katsuhiro Otomo wasn't even finished with his sprawling, 6-volume, 2,000 page epic Akira when he got together with a huge team of animators to make the film. The books were hugely ambitious, combining Buddhist-influenced ruminations on the evolution of intelligence (What if something like an amoeba were given the power of a human? What if a human were given power far beyond itself?) with a sci-fi/action plot taking place in a post- annihilation Tokyo, featuring everything from teenage motorcycle gangs, covert military psionics research, and something called ""Akira"". In the film, Akira is a perpetual mystery. Until fairly close to the end, we can only guess from the facial expressions of those in the know whenever the name is uttered. In the books, however, Akira appears by book 2 of 6 and features heavily in the rest of the story. This is the main difference between the books and the film: While the film builds to one massive climax, the books have several gigantic climaxes along the way and, therefore, quite a few more notable characters. Lady Miyako, for instance, is a huge character in the books, but only glimpsed twice in the film, and only from afar. Joker, the head of the rival Clowns biker gang, only features in the opening sequence of the film and has no lines, whereas in the books he remains important until the end as an actual character. Other such massive aspects of the books' plot, such as the Neo-Tokyo Empire and the covert American military operations to stop it, are completely left out of the film. But somehow, all this shedding of material that seems quite important in the books only distills Akira down to its essentials. It keeps the jaw-dropping action sequences and the philosophical weight while slimming down the narrative structure to something that feels like a much more natural fit for film. The core characters - Kaneda, Tetsuo, Kei - are still fleshed out extremely well. All in all, though the actual worlds of the books and the film are quite different, it would be impossible to say either world is better (though more hardcore fans will definitely pick the books since there is simply much more to sink your teeth into). So I recommend you watch this film, though not on an occasion where you just want something light and fluffy. It's dark, it's a bit gory, and most of all, it's extremely heavy. If you come away wanting more, then you should definitely check out the books.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Till This day stills being an amazing piece of animation. Simply amazing.,"I have always thought about Akira as one turning point in the history of anime and general animation as well. It was one of the very first animated movies to show gruesome acts of violence, people getting killed, and blood and gore all over the place. Of course, this is not the first time an animated movie directed to a mature audience was made. In fact, for me the first movie of this kind was Heavy Metal from 1981. I admit Heavy Metal is awesome but the movie wasn't that popular, and became more of a cult movie rather that something that completely redefined the genre. For me Akira was not only the movie that completely redefined the genre of mature animated films, but also was the movie that showed everyone that anime, and ""cartoons"" were not longer exclusive of the kids culture. When It came out, Akira made look animation for the first time as something cool. It was no longer something for a small group of followers of anime, but opened the genre and animation to a much more bigger audience, including the Media. I cannot think of any other animated film that made such a drastic revolution such as Akira. The movie is amazing not only for the mature themes, but also the story and the animation itself are the show stealers. The animation was fabulous, extremely detailed and extremely accurate into showing a ""Cyberpunk"" world. The city of Neo Tokyo stills being one of the most amazing things ever made in animation, and the action scenes were also pretty good. The Blood and Gore effects were also fabulous. Katsuhiro Otomo created a master piece of animation which will last forever as a classic and a total revolution in the history of anime and animation in general.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Easily one of the best anime ever,"About 7 years ago, with little prior exposure to anime, my roomate set me down in front of the set and blew my mind. I watched his subtitled version of AKIRA over and over. It was the first anime movie I ever bought. Packed with stunning visuals, AKIRA showed me what could be done with animation. No, it ain't for kids. Its an animated Hong Kong action film in a sci-fi setting.10 out of 10",,Anonymous,Animation
"One of the most famous, but not one of the best animes","In 1988 Tokyo was hit by a huge explosion. In 2019 the town is full of street gangs and criminals. One night the police shoots a man who was carrying a green child with telekinetic powers. By accident, a young boy named Tetsuo comes in contact with the child and they both get kidnapped by the army and put in a laboratory. Tetsuo's older friend Kaneda starts looking for him and meets a girl, Kei, who tells him about the ""higher"" power, called Akira. Tetsuo develops telekinetic powers himself and escapes from the lab...In one way, I owe a lot of respect to ""Akira"". Thanks to the talented director Katsuhiro Otomo ( ""Steamboy"" ) this film became the first worldwide influential anime, and without it the road for future anime projects may have never been started. In other words, without ""Akira"" they may have never been ""Inuyasha"", ""Shin Seiki Evangelion"", ""Sailor Moon"", ""Hellsing""...All in all, it's a good sci-fi film, but not for everyone's taste. Namely, while on one hand the dark tone and imaginative scenes seem impressive, on the other the story looks confusing and the characters pale.-------------Some of the scenes look great even today. Like when Kei is walking on ( polluted ) water. Or when Tetsuo is using his telekinetic powers to bend laser beams shot towards him. Or when a whole building sinks in smoke. And it may just be that the finale where Tetsuo transforms into a giant organic monster even inspired ""Princess Mononoke's"" sequence with the white pig cowered with red leaches. The dark poetry is powerful, but it cannot hide the obvious flaws, like the stiff and cold composition of the plot. In the end, some part even look like disgusting trash. That's why the dark, but beautiful animes like ""Shin Seiki Evangelion"" still hold on better after frequent viewings.Grade: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wild and Imaginative,"""Akira"" is one of, if not, the earliest Japanese animation I ever watched. It was made in 1988 and based 31 years in the future (which would be two years in the past today). The year is 2019 and it's a dystopian future after World War III. There's a constant battle in Neo Tokyo between motorcycle gangs and the government. Things get worse for Neo Tokyo when the character Tetsuo is experimented on and taps into a hidden power that makes him unstoppable.""Akira"" is somewhat scientific, a lot supernatural, and a bit prescient (the movie correctly predicted that the Olympics would be in Tokyo in 2020). It's a wild imaginative movie about the dangers of an individual having too much power--especially an individual without the knowledge and wisdom to properly use it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated films I've ever seen,"They don't make films like this anymore. There is a reason why the anime industry went into a crash shortly after this film was produced. Animation studios couldn't reach the bars set by this movie.Animation quality, sound design, and the storyline are groundbreaking. The use of light throughout the film is unique and presents it as its own protagonist.The fact that no one is a true villain or hero is another reason why I love this movie.

Sprawling,"Pretty striking visuals and I liked the artistry of this film especially for 1988, but the story and the way it was told was pretty lackluster to me. The dark themes of a dystopian future - a suppressive government and gang violence in the streets - aren't well developed, and the film sprawls through an overly complicated plot involving supernatural forces and a lot of gore instead. Somewhere along the way it began to feel like a testosterone-fueled mess, never shifting to a lower, more thoughtful gear.

One of the best Anime I've seen... (so far)...,"I must admit I have not seen a great deal of Anime but having seen this I am keen to see more. The version I saw was dubbed into English, which made it a little easier to concentrate on the visuals which were quite stunning. The plot I found to be very inventive and quite enthralling, if a little complicated. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.After World War III, Tokyo is destroyed. It is re-built and re-named Neo-Tokyo. Parts of the old city still exist but are not inhabited. A biker gang lead by Shôtarô Kaneda, known as Kaneda for short, travels the streets, picking fights with rival gangs and generally doing what kids do. There are riots in the streets and anti-government protesters have broken into a secret facility and kidnapped a small boy. This boy has special powers and is separated from his kidnapper before he is involved in an accident with one of the bikers, Tetsuo Shima. The government people holding the boy come to pick him up and also take Tetsuo with them. His accident has released a power within him, one that he will struggle to control in the future. He becomes aware of another who had similar powers, Akira, and he makes it his mission to locate Akira. Many will try to stop him, including the boy and his two companions and Kaneda. Will they be able to stop Tetsuo from releasing Akira and possibly bringing about another catastrophe on Tokyo? Well, you probably guessed I'm not going to tell you here, those Spoiler Police are tough.As I've already said, the animation is first rate, I assume that there was very little, if any, work done on a computer, given when it was made, which makes it even more remarkable. I did find it a little too long and a little too drawn out towards the end, but it didn't detract too much from, what is, a very fine piece of work.The thing that struck me was, as with the majority of Anime I've seen, all the action takes place from the point of view of the young people. Personally, and probably because I'm older, I would prefer to see a more balanced point of view. It's only a slight niggle, I know, but maybe something the filmmakers might like to consider. Over all though, a rather excellent piece of work! Recommended.My Score: 8.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Deep-cool, a great and rare combination","Not often does a movie come out that has both kick-ass action and storyline, but also a deep hidden meaning and some huge questions. 2001 must have been one of the first, even though it's ""coolness"" has faded over four decades. Since then, every now and then movie-makers has decided to coat existentialism with action-packed innovation. Matrix is one of the latest to mix the two in a good way.Akira is another of those movies. The story starts out on a pretty basic level but quickly unfolds at a brisk rate which forces you as a viewer to keep your eyes peeled. This is made very easy in Akira by the amazing visuals, the fast and sometimes mysterious storyline and a kicking soundtrack.Akira is raw and uncompromising, the action is over-the-top and spectacular, the setting(Neo-Tokyo) is fantastic, and the characters intriguing. At the end of the movie, we also get a good dose of theology/science ideas thrown at us for good measure. Combine all of these and you're in for quite a ride.Akira was one of the movies that started the Manga phenomena outside Japan. It's not hard to see why. Even though I've seen very little Manga, the few movies I have seen has convinced me that the Japanese have a lethal advantage over Western animation. Nothing wrong with that either. The best outcome is, of course, that Hollywood smartens up and starts to come up with some cool ideas themselves. We'll just have to wait and see. Until that happens, there's still a ton of Japanese movies to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Fantasy/Sci-Fi Film in Quite Some Time,"(****) Out of four starsAkira is far underrated, and should be easily in the top 250 movies. The story is innovative, and draws you into the plot in a matter of minutes. The surreal and futuristic society portrayed, is one that few if any other movies can match. The music and cinematography intermix perfectly, as Kaneda and Tetsuo lead the cast in a whirlwind of explosions, mystery, and mesmerizing visuals.The story opens with a cataclysmic explosion, that sets the pace for the rest of the movie, and then from there goes into a heart-racing bike chase, in which Kaneda's superiority over Tetsuo is established.From here on out, words cannot describe the visual aspects of the film, and the plot line is unlike anything that you can read.

Simply amazing.,"Wow. What can I say? Well, nothing to justify the absolute mind-bending Anime that I thankfully picked up on DVD. Akira tells us the story of Neo-Tokyo in utter turmoil, just after a massive war, in which the cause is unknown for a lot of the movie. Motorbike gangs rule the road, but when Tetsuo is taken away by the government after a collision with a mysterious boy, all hell breaks loose as he is put under scientific experiments.The animation is fantastic, impossible to tell that it was made nearly 20 years ago. It has probably the most stunning landscapes and detail that I have ever seen in an animation, bar none. The story is complex and thought provoking, not short of hidden messages and subtle references to the holocaust. It paces along nicely and never fails to keep a viewer tense and interested. It's moving, mind--blowing, intense action-fantasy that won't fail to keep you entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A visual masterpiece,"Akira is a film with a mighty reputation, an anime movie that has transcended it's genres typically more niche fan base and found itself as not only an important part of pop culture but a movie that in its own right is a peak example of the anime industry and a in many circles a respected Sci-Fi classic. Having to admit straight of the bat my complete lack of knowledge when it comes to the Japanese Anime/Manga world Akira is my first taste of films like this and perhaps one of the only ones I will ever partake in.Undoubtedly a stunning looking film (which is a fantastic feat considering it was hand drawn 26 years ago) Akira is a film filled with more interesting imagery and ideas than a film that melds all of them together into a cohesive or overly satisfying whole. Director Ohtomo's vision for the 2019 city of Tokyo is a fine work of art, a world brimming with neon advertisements, biker gangs, rundown city landscapes and bright clothes. It's a world that is eerily familiar to us in this modern age and could be compared to an animated Blade Runner in its visual aesthetic and it's no wonder that names such as James Cameron dream of one day turning this film into a live action blockbuster. This world which feels so alive is the reason that Akira became such an iconic piece of entertainment for its story leaves a lot to be desired.Watching Akira today the story feels overly familiar with it basically falling down to what people do when they receive great powers, they either do good or they do bad. The arc of the story can be seen now days in anything from Spider-Man through to Chronicle. Whilst this power play scenario centres the film, seemingly brushed aside arcs such as biker gangs, political unrest in a post-World War 3 world, disaffected youth and various other elements go by quickly and without much comment and one feels the film would of benefited from more of this and less creepy stuffed toys and wrinkly looking man children, but then again that is perhaps a key element to the films bonkers charms.Akira is clearly a film that more often than not people relate to and respect and thanks to its bucket load of ideas is never dull. Whilst I didn't personally connect to the film in any type of meaningful way Akira is a beautifully animated film and a film that still acts as a unique entry into the Anime cannon and if you're like me and have not delved into the world a decent entry point to all its strange glories.3 not so innocent teddy bears out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'll admit it was well animated but there was nothing to make me want to see it again nor recommend it to anyone else.

The undisputed definitive title.,"Akira is a film that will live long after it's initial hype and praise. Akira is a shoe-in for the Criterion Collection, if it's not already being considered. Lauded as the anime to start all of the current anime's success, Akira holds firm onto it's iconic violence, cyber punk and dystopian elements to this day. An anime that is as advanced as it was the day it was released, that's something to be heralded.The facets of the film that make it timeless are the same key points that are emulated by other titles. The psionics, kids who are psychic, clairvoyant and not allowed to age into adults, are copy pasted into everything to Pokémon. These entities are not only important in Akira's plot, but are also exemplary exposition units for unraveling the plot behind what's happening in the film. But they're more than just exposition, they are the reason why the protagonist and antagonist are dueling it out to begin with. The psychic archetype owes everything to these guys, and little kid espers as we know them wouldn't exist the way they do now if it weren't for Otomo's vision of how they would act and appear.The protoganist, Kaneda, and his tongue in cheek adopted little brother, Tetsuo represent two sides of the same coin in Akira. The two are compliments to everything a young man has to contend with. Tetsuo's seriousness is mirrored by Kaneda's boyish humor. Where Kaneda has a girl that's crazy about him and he's ""devoted to"", Tetsuo acts the fool to impress whatever's in front of him. Where Kaneda can effortlessly impress, Tetsuo struggles to impress with limitless effort, even as the film goes into it's third act. Their relationship is Goku/Vigeta, Asuka/Rei, Cloud/Zack and any other anime dual hero archetype you've ever witnessed.The cyberpunk genre owes its entire earnings to Akira. Where Otomo may have looked at previous futuristic robot mangas like Astroboy for inspiration, Akira sets the stage for cyber meets biological in a whole new fashion. For example, at one point a character must fuse their limb with discarded rubble, creating a synthetic metal arm to use as a prosthetic. Not only does biological meet metal, soul enters the equation at one point. Is Akira a mecha suit anime, no. Does it dabble in futuristic Tokyo cyber principles via vehicle, lasers, big gun and robot appendages, like no other.Where Akira really shines however, is in it's underlying metaphors of control of innocence, totalitarianism, religion and big government. Everybody is under someone else's thumb in this film. Government is facing riots for fascism and corruption, the army is being thrown a coup via political muscle flexing, gangs are being chased and persecuted, the residents of Neo Tokyo 3 can't move without riot police involvement or being sanctioned by barricades, even the Psionics are told they cannot leave quarantine. The entire subplot of Kaneda telling Tetsuo what to do, and Tetsuo's revolt are all key to this same principle that the only one who's truly free in the film Akira is, well, Akira! If you're feeling personally exploited, watch Akira. You'll suddenly feel better about your own 1st world problems.Akira stands the test of time visually, metaphorically, literally, and of course audibly. The film is just as detail driven from every angle as it was when it came out in 1988. If there's ever an anime to connect correlations to every existing anime genre, it's Akira. You'd be plain ignorant to think otherwise.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"So ugly it's impossible to like, no matter how hard one tries.","I'm all for supposedly intelligent films and series, that contain hidden meanings you have to search for. And it's only on the Japanese market that one can find some good examples of these. I've greatly enjoyed pondering over Evangelion, Jin-Roh, and many others. So why can't I be bothered to do the same for Akira? Simple; Akira is just so... ugly.The big mistake Akira makes is that, if a movie wants to make people think about it's ""hidden meaning"", for people to try hard to understand it's point, the film should at least offer something to draw the viewer in. Likeable characters, interesting concepts, or at least -something- just plain nice to look at. Some positive elements that can make one grow to like a movie.Akira does none of this and is, from start to finish, deeply detestable. It may be just a matter of personal taste, but the character designs struck me as especially repulsive. The film is populated by doughy-faced goblins with bad dressing habits. Ugh. How can one possibly be interested by such a cast of characters who look like radiation-deformed Hiroshima toddlers, let alone remotely like them?Even worse is the way the film hurls a constant slew of sickening and really needlessly gory images at the viewer's face. Sure, violent gore-fests can be fun in a mindless way if you like that sort of thing, but they seem badly out of place here. If it's supposed to be a deep and intelligent film, how come it feels as if you're watching something from Troma studios? These two sides of the film co-exist in a very uncomfortable way. As if Fellini was trying to direct Attack of the Brain-Eating Zombies. Bottom line; the exaggerated bloodlust of a random violent horror film doesn't go hand-in-hand with anything remotely refined.Still, deep beneath all the tasteless violence there's the kernel of some kind of -point- to all this carnage. Trouble is, it's terribly patchy and impossible to make sense of. Every now and then, there's a small flash of lucidity and a few brittles of a deeper meaning are thrown around, but it seems so random and rushed that it ends up just adding to the confusion and the unpleasant overall feel of this film.The overall impression one gets from watching Akira is about as pleasant as staring at a badly-treated, crusty fleshwound dripping with pus. And very few people will want to stare at something like -that- several times in order to be able to make sense out of it (all for a deeper meaning which doesn't even look all that interesting from what I can make out). Sorry, but no way am I going to willingly watch such a repulsive film again, I've been put off for good. Akira is not ""gritty"", ""haunting"", ""menacing"", or any other cool word the marketing bods might want to slap onto it, it's just ugly.And for some reason, there are still people out there who claim that this is the be-all and end-all of the Japanese animation industry. Let's just be grateful that it's -not-. If every Japanese production was this dreadful, we'd have been denied the joys of the most graceful and aesthetic animation in the world. The way Manga video marketed Akira gave a bad, and lasting first impression of Japanese series in general to occidental audiences, which qualifies as a valid enough reason to hold a grudge against this movie in my view. You're better off watching Macross Plus, Honneamise, Gall Force, Jin-Roh, or even Saint Seiya instead of this sick and messy effort. Simply because those, and many other films are thought-provoking as well as plain enjoyable.(fans of mindless and truly disgusting gore will love Akira, though).",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Most Groundbreaking films in Animation,"It is indeed the greatest animated film of all time. The film broke many boundaries in animation, such as the storytelling, the action scenes and the content. I love how it doesn't try to be a kids movie, and that the film is mature, dark, and even sometimes dramatic. Most animated films in the 80s were mostly intended for children (i.e. Disney, Don Bluth) But what about the content of the movie? Well lets see. We got great characters, a great storyline, and great visual storytelling. I also love the soundtrack to the film. The soundtrack is mostly made up with Japanese Taiko drumming, and at times traditional Japanese music. It's a pretty unique soundtrack for an animated film. Akira has been praised by film critic Roger Ebert, giving the film thumbs up, and ever since Akira has been released in 1988, the film has developed a cult following, getting fans worldwide. This movie is very violent and graphic, so if you can handle the violence, you can handle the movie.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANIMATION FANS.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Akira; Not to be missed,"If you are a fan of animation, not seeing Akira is equivalent to not seeing a Pixar film or a Miyazaki film. Obviously Pixar and Miyazaki films are much more family friendly than Akira is. I would not recommend showing this to a younger audience at all, but I will argue that Akira is on the same technical level. The animation is truly groundbreaking, using cell animation to it's advantages rather than allowing it to hinder the incredible amount of detail put into this film. Any fan of animated works will no doubt be delighted to see the incredibly stylized steam-punk Tokyo lit up by neon lights. I don't want to get too much into the story, mainly because of how easy it is to spoil this movie, but I will say that the screenplay works to play on how we tell stories, and how we write/view protagonists.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
What anime is supposed to be.,"In a time where anime has degenerated into the same generic structure of dumb plots, dumb characters, sexual exploitation and overall no creativity, this film is a breath of fresh air. This film should be an example for all anime of today, a story that gets the viewer interested, along with mind blowing visuals. I highly recommend seeing this film, whether or not you are an anime fan. Akira is incredibly violent and full of inappropriate content, so this is definitely not for kids. I do recommend that if one is squeamish, do not watch if unprepared for extreme amounts of blood and guts. I must say now that from beginning to end this film kept me engrossed and wanting to know more about the struggles of the characters. The English dubbing, in my opinion, is quite good and does not detract from the experience at all. I had been growing tired of anime, no longer seeing any anime of the caliber of Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain or Ghost in the Shell.

Stunning visuals and a cool story make for quite a unique experience,"Anime has never been something I felt drawn to, yet there are many titles to which aficionados of the genre/style will always point you and which have achieved a sort of name recognition among those who wouldn't necessarily consider themselves fans. AKIRA is one of those films, and it happens to be the first anime film I've ever seen. The setting is 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, so named because of an apocalyptic event which took place 31 years earlier. The rebuilt city isn't too different from what you might find in a post-apocalyptic/dystopian sci-fi story. What stood out most to me, and the most recognizable elements of this type of story, was the portrayal of a fascist police state where government and those in authority abuse their power and the citizens fight against them. Not only do they show this violence, but there is also a lot of graffiti which provides subtext and context to the overall situation. Some of it went over my head because it's probably specific to Japanese society when this film (and the source graphic novel) were made, but the broad strokes of oppressive regimes, the military-industrial complex and populist uprisings should resonate with most viewers. All of this, and I haven't even gotten to what makes this story unique. At the center of this story is a biker gang, and one of the members, Tetsuo, is captured by a secret military group that studies people with psychic abilities. There is also another group of people who prophecy about the return of some mystical Akira, who will either bring balance or destruction. To be honest, I don't completely understand all of the plot intricacies, but most of the time I was being blown away by the stunning hand-drawn animation. I've never completely warmed up to computer animation, but animated films such as this one have an artistry to them that is second to none (when done right). One minor complaint I have is that the English dub (and I don't really like dubs) was a bit iffy in places. What I mean by that is some of the voice acting was a bit over-the-top. Still, it wasn't too distracting like it might be in a live-action film. My other minor complaint has to do with the length of the film. The third act was perhaps a little bit too protracted and it messed with the overall pacing.

"An Anime So Good, Even Anime Haters Will Love It","I recently saw Akira for the first time, and I'm not a big fan of anime, but I must say this film blew me away. Set in Neo-Tokyo, a city built on an artificial island after a devastating nuclear war destroys not only Tokyo, but the rest of the world. A member of a motorcycle gang named Tetsuo has a chance encounter with a strange boy which unlocks secret telekinetic abilities within him. Tetsuo cannot control these abilities as they take him over in a ferocious rampage to find this enigmatic character known as Akria. Now, his friends, a group of psychics, and the Neo-Tokyo military attempt to stop him before its too late.Akira's art style is unlike anything of the genre, its colors and design is something you would see in a fever dream. The direction is excellent and the world is perfectly created to make a unique and amazing universe that quite obviously inspired many future films. The story is very complicated, the beginning goes by very fast, but it doesn't take away from the film, in fact, it demands a second viewing from you the moment ends. US companies spent over 1 million dollars to restore the visuals as well as adding an entire new soundtrack/sound FX, which was definitely worth every penny, as the film is spectacular to the senses.Over all, its a superb film that requires multiple viewings. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"You have to see it, even though you might not like it","From start to finish, Akira was an extremely heavy and intense movie, in every imaginable way. The fast pace, the cynical story set in a cynical universe, and all the brutal violence makes Akira a very difficult film to sit through. What keeps the viewer mesmerized however, is the extraordinary animation. Every shot is breathtaking and in all the gore and cynicism, it's absolutely beautiful. Akira is a work of art and a stunning masterpiece that needs to be acknowledged and remembered (believe me, it's hard to forget the experience), but I cannot really say I liked the film, at least I didn't enjoy it, as much as I appreciated it.Even though the universe that the movie takes place in is very complex and a lot of the movie experience is trying to understand it, the underlying plot is rather simple; ultimate power is unfortunately given to someone who can't handle it and wreaks havoc. But what really stands out about Akira and makes it very likable, is that it takes so many chances, it shies away from nothing and just when you think the story can't become any more insane, it manages to surprise you again and again.The 7/10 rating is a personal compromise; Akira is absolutely amazing, but it left me feeling hollow and heavy. It's an experience no avid film-lover should miss, but I don't have the stomach to give it a higher rating. I personally find the story very lacking, but much of the imagery is incredible and will stay with me for a very long time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Like a roller-coaster, thrilling but not going anywhere",The first hour or so is very entertaining if you put your brain on hold and don't try to think much about the plot...stunning animation.But then you can't hold back...and start trying to make sense of what you are experiencing...and you can't figure it out.  The same scenes are whipping by except the carnage grows (and you care less) .... by the final half hour it's one colorful blur ... what's going on?  I'm bored...something's gotta happen...it's all going to be explained....oh never mind.If you want a good animation feature rent The Little Mermaid.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Landmark Masterpiece,"As the credits rolled after two hours of sci-fi action, philosophy, and metaphysics, I just sat and stared at my screen. I didn't know what to think of this movie. I still don't. But it is one of the most starkly original and creative films out there, and it is certainly one of the most influential. Many Americans were first introduced to anime via this film and its graphic, dystopian, confusing spectacle. Watching this movie, it is clear how many things it has influenced, things that are probably a lot more well-known to a modern audience than it. Although I do doubt if many Americans understood it. It's a hard movie to really understand if you're an American. It's probably a hard movie to understand even if you're not.In fact, to some degree, it is the sort of movie that is not supposed to be understood. It is meant to be experienced, and experience it I did. I'm not even sure if I enjoyed it or not, but I do know I'm in awe of it.The animation is spectacular, particularly for its time. It doesn't look basic or simple or old-fashioned. It looks smooth, fresh, dynamic, beautiful, and above all, evocative. Not even Tarantino can make a mess of blood and guts looks so artistic, and Neo Tokyo is a completely believable futuristic city. It's hard to make a dystopian landscape that is equal parts terrifying and beautiful, but they managed to pull it off with aplomb.If I had to describe this movie in terms of other movies, I'd say it's a combination of Brazil, Contact, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Blade Runner. But even that doesn't really cover it. This film is Japanese, through and through, both in the obvious ways, and in the less obvious, more cultural ways. If you have a fair understanding of Japanese culture and/or have just watched a lot of anime, you should be fine. If not, you might get lost pretty quickly.Speaking of anime, the second half of this movie is absolutely anime-tastic. It's as anime as anything I've seen. I've never been a personal fan of anime tropes, but they are done really well here, and they make a sort of sense, not a particularly logical sense, but a thematic, philosophical sense.The story is interesting. It's too long and complicated to describe here, so suffice it to say it revolves around two boys, Shōtarō Kaneda and Tetsuo Shima, and a girl, named Kei. I wish the story had gone more into the three of them as people, but what we get is all right, if a bit generic. The story itself... if you love anime, you'll love it; if you don't, you might not. It certainly gets more abstract and dramatic and less based in reality as it goes on. The disconnect between the first and second halves is one of my biggest problems with the movie, but it doesn't ruin it or anything.Check out this movie. It is a building block of so many genres and the animation medium in general. Maybe you'll end up as speechless as I was. But hopefully, you'll be as blown away as I was too.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic Anime,"I re-watched this movie for the first time in over a decade and it still continues to hold up for me.Put simply, very few anime have matched the level of animation this movie achieved, and that is saying something for a film that is 35 years old. Entirely hand drawn, filled to the brim with detail, it will make your jaw drop while viewing in High Definition. This film is worth your time just for the visuals alone. If it weren't for this film, anime would not be as popular in the West as it is today.The story is chaotic with non-stop action and explosions while at the same time one of the characters is slowing gaining out of control fantasy powers that can destroy the world. The story is not complex, rather it is the pandemonium vibe the movie creates that really engages the audience in the fully realized city of Neo-Tokyo. The story is somewhat vague, culminating in an obscure ending that may frustrate some. However, this movie is more about the journey than the destination, and like I said before is about being entertained by the vibe and atmosphere of the world and its visuals.The definition of a classic anime. A must watch for self-proclaimed anime fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visually Breathtaking and Extremely Enjoyable,"Akira is the kind of anime film that even people who don't really like anime can watch and enjoy. It's visually breathtaking and has a very creative and interesting story that will keep you engaged.There's a lot of different elements involved in this story. A futuristic Tokyo, biker gangs, secret military operations, kids with powers, and even some blood and guts. It's certainly a story that you haven't seen before. I found myself quite engaged in the story and constantly was wondering what exactly was happening. Not to spoil anything, but even in the end there are some elements that are left for you to interpret yourself. But it will certainly satisfy you once things come to a close.Visually, this movie is a feast for the eyes. I watched it on Bluray, and it's gorgeous. The colors pop, and everything looks great. I haven't seen many other animated films like this on bluray, but i'm sure this is one of the best looking ones.Another element of this film that I really have to commend is the audio. I watched it with the remastered Japanese audio on the bluray, and it sound phenomenal. It blows away the English dubs that are also on the disc. Every little sound is audible, and it all comes together to be a perfect audio experience. I also LOVE the soundtrack. It totally fits the mood of the film and is great to listen to. I usually don't notice audio in a film as a whole, but you can't help but notice it here. It's perfect.Akira is quite an experience. Its highly original and should certainly be watched. I would recommend buying the Bluray from Funimation, because it looks and sounds absolutely top notch. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Don't pay for this movie, please don't, or I will find you and kill you","I saw this movie over at a friend's house.  I always wanted to see because people called it the greatest Anime movie.  I've never been crazy for Japanese animation, but I have dedicated myself to have an open mind. When I heard my friend had it I decided to see it for free rather than waste my own money on it.  And, oh boy, that was the smartest decision I've ever made, EVER.I hated this movie, with a passion.  I don't think the word hated actually portrays my passion for this movie.  I want to be as professional about this review as possible to convince you people this is garbage, not classic.First off, let it be said I don't care about dubbing.  I can stand dubbing. Das Boot is one of my favorite films, and that has dubbing.  I also have no pre-justice against the Japanese.  I actually liked that Vampire Hunter D movie, though I also saw that for free.  But this is inexcusable.First off I'm going to spoil the end.  If you haven't seen the movie, please read this, I'm doing you a favor.We all know Akira is a disease.  What you don't know is that it is a disease that can take control of a person and turn them into a great gob of goo. I have never seen anything weirder than this.  How could you think this is cool?  It's stupid.  I don't care about the gore.  I like some gore (EVIL DEAD 2 RULES, BABY!)  But this movie is just soooo stupid.  Why am I the only one who sees this?If you are smart like me, and thought this movie was stupid, please e-mail me, I would like to know if I'm the only one.Anyway, on with the review.  The other sick people are just too damn creepy. What is up with that.  And WHAT THE F**K IS UP WITH THE TEDDY BEAR, HUH? DAMN I HATE THIS MOVIE!Whew, calm down Sam.Now, the characterization is actually very good.  The plot in the early part of the movie is actually good.  It's just about 2/3 the way through the movie, it all just dies.  Right there, in front of you, the movie croaks.This is just one of those movies that you tell yourself, ""It must get better"".  Then you say, ""I've been watching this for two hours, but I see no end in sight, the ending to this must be great!""  Then you have an epiphany. ""THIS IS THE DAMN ENDING!"".  And before you know it, the movie is over. Finally you say, ""I just wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life.  My Grand dad would kill me if he were still alive.""So, to sum up, if you're a traditional movie fan who's never seen anime before, avoid this like the plague.  Run, run and don't turn back.  I don't really care if you people say this is a classic, they said Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was a classic, so why don't you go and see what I thought of that.I apologize for some of the language, but I needed to say it to fully express my anger for this horrible waist of perfectly good film.  I hope they didn't kill more than one tree to draw this.  I firmly believe he people who made this ""film"" should be taken out of the gene pool immediately.1 of 10.

A Well-Thought Out Beautiful World,"I'll start off by saying that the concept behind Akira is extremely interesting and I will be sure to check out the Manga to find out more about the film and it's background. In addition to this it is animated beautifully. What the film lacks is consistency in it's execution, which I should say won't bother most people, in fact I think this film is pretty entertaining but I don't review based on entertainment I review based on execution.The thing about this film that irritated me the most was the inconsistency of sound mixing, particularly footsteps. The way footsteps are integrated into the environment is a little absurd, I have never heard footsteps as well-defined as the ones in Akira, and as well as this the surfaces on which footsteps can be heard is incredibly inconsistent. It's a pretty minor thing but if you notice it it's really annoying. I have to say the score is pretty great, it's intense and well-used. There are places where the integration of the score into the environment is a little awkward but forgivable. A big problem with sounds mixing was the use of silence. This is mainly due to the fact that once the silence is brought on it doesn't stay. Rather than remaining in silence the film moves in and out of silence without changing location, which could be believable if someone was causing this to happen, but the change in volume was too abrupt and awkward.While the film is animated beautifully the use of depth of field in like 10 shots out of 5000 or so, is really distracting. When the rest of the movie is animated as if everything is in focus and then there is one out of place shot, where someone or something is out of focus is really odd and like I said distracting. As well as this the editing is really weird in some spots. Example, a character is being swallowed up and the film slowly fades to black as character gets swallowed, cuts to the events outside, and then cuts back inside where the environment is no longer black like before but as bright as the outside, and then fades halfway to black before cutting back outside. It's not something most people notice but for me it was a really odd thing to watch.I have to give props to the writers for being incredibly intelligent in their adaptation from manga to anime. There are quite a few things that aren't fully explained within the film, but the world that exists withing the movie isn't able to explain those things to you and so I personally felt satisfied with not fully understanding all aspects of the plot, because even the characters sometimes don't understand what has happened. I saw the movie with a friend who has read the manga and told me most of the things I didn't fully understand were explained in the manga, so the move to adapt the world presented in the film as slightly different to the manga was very intelligent.Overall intelligent, well-thought out, beautifully animated and entertaining, check it out, especially if you've never seen any anime before, this film is a great bridge into that kind of thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"after the apocalypse, anime dystopia, strange children, and the Godzilla effect","Dystopian, post-apocalyptic anime film, set in Neo-Tokyo, afflicted by an exceedingly corrupt government and exceedingly violent revolutionaries, and the main characters are members of a teen motorcycle gangs, who cross the paths of the terrorists and the secret project attempting to monitor and control the development of children who, in the next stage of evolution, have started developing super-powers, like the legendary Akira, a child whose powers, some claim, led to WW III. One of the young bikers, Tetsuo, turns out to have the powers himself, to an extreme degree, and it gets out of control, changing his personality entirely, and he becomes a flame-haired monster, but is saved from himself by his best friend Kaneda, who has fallen in love with the revolutionary Kei, by the three strange children, and Akira, who returns. The militaristic colonel turns out to be a hero, despite his fascist leanings. The story is disjointedit comes from an extensive series of anime booksand in close-ups of people the animation appears a little cheap, though the city scenes are very impressive. The wanton destruction of bridges, buildings, and hordes of otherwise harmless people is disturbing to me, especially when it only serves to demonstrate the vastness of the characters' superpowers, disregarding the humanity of the general populace (could be called the Godzilla effect)and the destruction has no effect on the storythe cruel monster Tetsuo is still considered sympathetically, a victim of the suddenness of the onset of his powers.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Animation Classic&Definitely one of Landmark Movies of all time!,"28 years after its release in 1988 & My First encounter with Akira.An awesome post-apocalypse (sort of) movie set in 2019 & Neo-Tokyo after 3rd World War.(Only introduction I'll give about the plot so as to not degenerate into spoilers).I'm a huge fan of Anime & This movie is a prime example of almost prophetic futuristic vision in sci-fi& how awesome it looks in animation.Often better than real-life props,plastic sets or fallible expressions of human actors.It has everything,intriguing story,suspense,visuals,sights & its a pioneer in many movies which spun-off its characters & modified it to their stories,novels,movies & characters.I could actually see&remember so many of them.I've seen stunning animated movies set in similar circumstances out of Japan which remain my all time favorites like ""Ghost In The Shell"" & ""Animatrix"" but all of them owe some of the origin to this movie.So do 'The Matrix', ""Minority Report"" & at least 4 or 5 more that I can name that draw parallels at least.This is probably the most realistic scenario one can expect after a few decades of War & details are just exquisite.Definitely joins a collection of memorable ones I've seen.It's intense &music score is one that I especially loved.Considering how Lo-fi it does seem at first glance after digital revolution in animation in 90s & '00s,it's just jaw-dropping in how well it was shot.This is me raving Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Supreme Level of Animation and Imagination!,"The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating.Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story.The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour.One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Do you seriously think this is that good?,"Well, firstly I have to say that perhaps the American audiences were not exposed to too many Japanese anime.

The soundtrack is something else, absolutely the best I know and a piece of art in its own right -- the voices of the dolls Akira sees in his nightmare, for example, are pygmies, not children or a studio effect.

"Brutal violence, deep ideas, masterful animation","Akira is a giant in its field. Based on a highly popular manga series and directed by said manga's original writer Katsuhiro Ohtomo, it's a film that helped popularize anime culture in the West. It was nothing like we had seen before, being aimed solely at the adults, containing graphic sexual references, disturbing and gory images, heavy themes and more violence than any two Hollywood action blockbusters put together. It's also a thoughtful story and analogy about a young man forced to grow up too quickly and being confronted with strange phenomena, feelings and powers he's not yet mature enough to understand, let alone control.So what's the story? Kaneda is young hooligan belonging to a motorcycle gang. They're enjoying their freedom and mischief, until one day his friend and fellow gang member Tetsuo happens upon a small child, who's much more than he seems. Tetsuo gets injured and happens to absorb some of the child's power. From there the eponymous Akira seizes control and lures Tetsuo into trying to free him. And from there it's a nonstop battle for the survival of Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo's soul and everyone's lives. All told through phenomenal voice acting, alluring twists, great plot points and animation so vivid, gorgeous, detailed and vibrant that people have made completely valid arguments for this being the crowning achievement of animation.Furthermore, the score is very good. It's not what you would expect from a movie such as this, being more groovy and ethnic than the normal pop and electric tunes, but it fits. You're always a bit surprised by it, but after a few moments you'll start digging it.Akira is a masterpiece. If you can, do read the manga series beforehand, because it's well worth it and offers a deeper understanding of the material. But, if you can't, this movie will still win you over with its brazen style, high impact concepts, beauty and sheer energy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beware: there are several versions of Akira.,"Personally I like the original, wide-screen, dubbed English version.  This was the movie that incited me to start riding motorcycles over a decade ago, when I was just a punk.  For that reason it holds a special place in my library that may not be appreciated by all.  Still, it's corny, violent, artsy Anime at its best with a wonderful soundtrack by Geinoh Yamashirogumi! The original Japanese version is okay too, especially if you understand Japanese and can read the English subtitles together for a great laugh. I don't like the new, re-edited, re-dubbed ""American release"" at all. They re-cut the movie slightly, rewrote the English dialogue and re-dubbed it with more ""normal"" American voices to, ostensibly, better explain the movie. It's like taking a beautiful, esoteric, impressionistic painting of a cityscape and turning it into a color glossy photograph of New York City with circles and arrows on the back explaining each scene. BAD FILMMAKERS! BAD DISTRIBUTORS! Just say NO to mucking with things you know nothing about. Anyway, if you can find the original version of Akira enjoy it.

A New Look at an Old World,"First off let me say that I haven't watched Anime for over two to three years after probably Gundam. I used to watch Robotech(Macross), Gundam, etc... This is my first anime that I have seen in quite some time. I have aged significantly too, which means that I understand some of the conflicts that are brought up in some of the shows better than when I was younger. Recently Akira was brought to my attention as being the one of the best pieces of Japanese anime's ever produced if not the best. I was interested to see how well this would hold up to my film knowledge and criticism. To tell the truth, this would make a great live action flick if it could be done WELL. And I stress well, because there is also great potential to make this a piece of crap too. First off I found the artwork or animation to be quite refreshing. I haven't a good cartoon so wonderfully drawn in many years. I'm more used to crude animation like the old days. I only wish I could have seen this in theaters back in 89' or so. Sadly I wasn't born yet so therefore couldn't have possibly seen it. But I have the next best thing, a new clean DVD transfer that was done pretty well. The dub in English was pretty well done but I wish I could have had both the original dub and the new English one as well. I haven't listened to the Japanese language track because I never used to when I was younger. But hopefully now I have matured to the point where I will listen to it. The characters in the film feel and look very lifelike to me. Akria seems to borrow a lot from American films and throw them into a Japanses anime, which is very intriguing. I found out that the voices were recorded first before the animation, therefore; the lips would match the dialog perfectly. This is something that Disney has been practicing forever but that this was the first time it was used on a Japanese anime. Quite cool. Akira's story again is like a great director from the 20th century has created it. It has an essence that pull the audience into the world of Neo Tokyo 2019. A little Blade Runner, a little Children of Men and so on. The only nudge I have against the movie is not giving more insight to what Akira is. But I guess thats the great adventure to the film. That you really don't have a clue as to what Akira is, or who he is. I kept thinking that Akira would pop up somewhere and kill Tetsuo, and control Neo Tokyo once and for all. But this never happened and I'm glad it didn't. Just see the movie. I won't give anything away, but just to say that the end is a bit of a downer. Although, what great movie isn't. The film is immerse as it sucks the audience into a world that is dark and mysterious. It makes the viewer question his or her own life and choices we make in it. Although, I might only recommend this film for Sci-Fi, action people. Don't be put off by the fact that its anime.

Review for class,"Akira is an anime film released in 1988. It's an iconic landmark for animated films and science fiction. The movie is set and based in a dystopian future Tokyo. This Tokyo is now called Neo-Tokyo. The film follows the story of Kaneda and his friend Tetsuo, who gets involved in a government project after a motorcycle accident grants him telekinetic abilities. The plot delves into themes of power, corruption, and the human condition, making it as thought provoking as it is visually stunning. Watching this movie is an experience that stays with someone. The animation is groundbreaking, especially for its time. It showcases detailed hand drawn visuals which glue your eyes to the screen. The film's action sequences are intense and well-choreographed, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The film's storytelling is complex and layered, weaving in various themes that make you think about the future of society and the human spirit. Tetsuo's transformation from a troubled youth to a being of immense power raises questions about how power corrupts and the consequences of unchecked scientific experimentation. Kaneda's journey, on the other hand, highlights the bonds of friendship and the struggle to save a friend lost to power. As an avid fan of animated films and anime, I recommend this film to anyone with an interest in the two.

This is where it all begins,"We have seen many rivalries like Goku-Vegeta, Naruto-Sasuke, Deku-Bakugo, Asta-Yuno etc. But it all begins with this manga - Akira. It features two frenemies, Kaneda-Tetsuo. By 1988 standard, the animation looks top notch. I can only imagine what impact it would've made back then. It is said that this manga has a huge role to play in the globalization of anime. This movie didn't work at the Japanese box office but it still enjoys massive popularity outside Japan. And I would say it deserves the popularity it has achieved. Back in those days, the Western audience had a knack of watching superheroes, not only defeating the villains but also managing to save the world and avoid destruction of the cities. However, in this movie, there is no superhero and yet one of the most bizarre destruction awaits for the Tokyo. Yes, there is no superhero to save the ordinary people. The ordinary people themselves will have to rely on their own intelligence to avoid the worst possible outcomes. Otherwise, what is inevitable is bound to happen anyway. No plot armour awaits for the city that would save its destruction. It is going to get destroyed. That is its fate. This movie tells us that all the buildings and all the monuments would someday get destroyed. They will be nothing but the ancient ruins. But all those humans survived will have no choice but to get up or come out of the ruins and start moving forward or to start restoring life. The concept very similar to Baroque - the 17th century literary movement or time period.This movie deserves the classic status, which it enjoys today. The world deserved to know the mindset of the Japanese creators. They have come from a land which had to bear the two atom bombs.Now talking about the negatives of this movie. The movie was made out of the six manga volumes. It is a risky thing to do. As that would mean that movie will have to leave out some significant parts too. And yes, somewhere in the middle, the story does look unconvincing. The characters who had a lot to do in manga, didn't get much screentime. I wish to read the manga as well and would like to review it someday.I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. This movie is something which deserves to reach all the anime enthusiasts. Even if you don't like it, I am certain that you will definitely find something which will amaze you or will make you think, 'wow, something like this was also created back then.'",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kaneda! Tatsuo! Kaneda! Tatsuo! Kaneda! Tatsuo!,"Without a doubt one of the most classic and powerful films of Japanese animation ever put to celluloid. In many ways it defined the genre going forward, and everything afterwards seemed to be a copy of some sort. It also proved that a very adult and violent cartoon could connect with a worldwide audience, and opened the door to many other Japanese animators to reach a global audience.The first thing that strikes you is mastery of traditional animation techniques on show. It gives the movie a hyper-realistic edge to it, and brings the dystopian vision of Neo-Tokyo to life in all it's cyberpunk glory. The animation really breaks all boundaries in what one previously thought animation could be. The level of detail and fact action pace of the story create some incredible and memorable set pieces that seem to one-up each other in ratcheting up the tension until the movie's climax and resolution.It's an amazing work of art. The music too, is otherwordly - with mixes of taiko, choir, and gamelan. Very powerful.The storytelling is where it falls down a bit. The story is told in an incredibly subtle fashion, and if you're not paying attention or are simply unable to follow it - Akira would seem to have nothing important to say, and rather be an excuse for the gory violence and destruction.This isn't quite true. The world of Neo-Tokyo is a metaphor for the bewilderment that Japan found itself in after the utter nuclear devastation of World War II and into Japan's rise to postwar miracle in the short span of a few decades (mirroring the film's timeline). The film seems to suggest that this metamorphosis was too fast and lacking in something which would have otherwise been a more natural evolution. It hints that the postwar miracle of modern day Japan somehow became an uncontrollable, and unrecognizable ugly mutant from what came before.Mysteriously this movie also predicted the Tokyo Olympics of 2020, and it's subsequent cancellation.While it's a great film, some scenes tend to plod a bit and the constant back and forth of ""Kaneda, Tatsuo, Kaneda, Tatsuo"" also grated considerably.When all's said and done, however - it's a must-see film and a classic of cyberpunk.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Wake me up when this is OVER""","Okay, I don't mind some films with blood and gore, nor I don't mind some nudity here or there, but at least it should have a co-hesive plot. Unfortunatly, Akira has NONE of that. Akira is basicly the ""Monster a Go-go"" of anime!Even though Otomo has done some creative things (Memories, Robot Carnival), he did not do so well here.Were to start.....Hmmmmmmm..... It's about some weird wacko named Tetsuo and his insanity getting worse when he hears about something or another called AKIRA. Meanwhille, some other punk kids and espers (who look like badly deformed ""Garbage Pail Kids"") try to stop his orgy of madness, but things just get worse.I do have to admit, Akira does have EXCELLENT animation (the characters don't look like bug-eyed freaks), but the plot keeps going around in circles that it makes you think that three or four animated movies went into the making of this.-Like what is up with the dream sequence of the Teddy bear and the car/milk bottle thing?-Now why did suddenly Tetsuo became a monster?-What was the point of the scene where dogs and children get shot down?-What is the point of that computer animated blob thing?-Does anyone know?

Groundbreaking apocalypse animation,"(1988) Akira
DUBBED/ VHS version
JAPAN ANIMATION/ SCIENCE-FICTIONFaithfully adapted from the Japanese comic series tells the tale of Neo- Tokyo ""Blade Runner""- like setting focusing on 2 uncouth delinquent teenage kids stumbling upon, unethical gov't scientists experimentation on it's psychic ability patients, unbeknownst that one of them might become powerful as a result! The cartoon film that first put Japan animation on the map in North America! I remember the first time I saw this, I couldn't believe what a fresh change it was to see something that was so violently made for adults, after seeing so many Disney or animation which were also made for kids! And when any English speaking cartoons would be animated theatrically intended only for adults to see, it would always involve a lot of nudity and sex, such as ""Heavy Metal"" and ""Fritz The Cat"" to name two or the dull ""Lord of The Rings"" made in 1978. There was nothing showcasing just violence, that adults should be able to understand, not until ""Akira"" came along and upon seeing it for the first time, was like a dream come true, even though the Japanese put out others before it, that're just as violent as this, this one had set the bar for more animation for adults to be made, never mind that it came from the comic book series! It may have actually set the tone that they're just as much adults who want to see ""R"" rated violent cartoons as much as seeing them in actual films aka The Terminator and Lethal Weapon, the Mad Max films were originally rated ""R"", except that in animation no one can get hurt in real life! Showcased regularly on ""The Cartoon Network"" with Mature warnings of course because of the action such as ""Dragonball"", ""Bleach"", ""Nuratu"", ""Death Note"" would never been shown in North America if it wasn't for the success of ""Akira"" and then they're the films ""Perfect Dark"", ""Fists of the North Star"" and ""Ghosts of the Shell""! It may seem long if much of the viewing audience are kids, but shouldn't be long for adults since it does consist mature dialogue as well as it's situations, kids shouldn't be able to understand! To say anything more would be pointless.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

It went to a whole different direction from what I thought. The poster looks really cool and I thought it would be about motorcycles, but then I watched and was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the animation is really good, the colors and the idea, but the movie had much more potential. The characters are not very appealing and their expressions are awkward at times.

Neo Tokyo is about to E.X.P.L.O.D.E,"I saw a VHS tape of Akira when I was 8. It looked weird with the pill on the back of a young motorist. But I was curious. So when I was 10 I saw this movie as a reward for doing homework and I was not disappointed. Akira wins on almost every level. Adult oriented Japanese animation at it's finest.STORY

But it turns out one of them boys are actually a lab expirment that is hellbent on having the power of a God. Tetsuo gets stolen back by the goverment for more tests and the boys have to get him back. Luckily Tetsuo escapes. You have to see it. It's a trip. If you are smart you will get the subtle touches in the atmosphere. Although the manga was better and complete you will still enjoy this masterpeice of teenage angst and rebellion. Riots break out in the streets. Goverment corruption is about

By far the best animation ever in a animated movie. Akira is basically Manga in full motion. On a tech and art wise. It's better than almost any Disney movie in existence. The art style is semi-realistic. The technology is detailed and the animation is as smooth as can be. Akira may not always be perfect but it does everything perfectly. The characters are well animated. They gestate and move their lips. It's not like how in most anime even OVA where the character's are standing still flapping their lips.Amazing lighting effects.Pipes flail about and swing. Lots of complex designsYou will see beautiful bouncy futurist bikes with light trailers. Beautiful explosions. 3D perspective no CGI.There is tons of blood and gore and violence.The backdrops painstakingly detailed and realistic with neon cities, fancy buildings and squalid corridors. There is no cheese to be found. No dumb lights. No stupid unnecessary pans. Everything is smooth concise and consistent. AKIRA has aged well entirely.SOUND
The Sound of Akira is Jaw dropping. Especially in the latest dubs and releases. But don't waste you time watching that. Watch the sub at 3 am you dank hipster you. There are amazing songs with Japanese traditional drums. Timeless sounding.
You will constantly hear spouts of TETSUO! and KENADA!OVERALLAkira is basically a once in a lifetime anime film right next to other Katsuhiro Otomo's. . You watch this and you're a big boy now.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Akira,"Having only ever heard and read great things about this film, it is safe to say that my expectations were high. However, I had somehow managed to stay away from any spoilers. Indeed, going in, I had no idea what Akira was about. Certainly, I assumed that motorcycles would play some part in it, as the now-iconic red motorcycle has become inseparable from any material associated with this film. But apart from that, I had no idea what to expect. As such, to say that this movie lived up to my fairly high expectations would be both correct, and incorrect. As far as the quality of Akira is concerned, I couldn't have asked for more. But when considering the story and the message of it, the expectations that I had built, couldn't have been more wrong.There were some moments that seemed to support the picture I had painted in my head about what this film was about. Indeed, Akira began with a tone that, while still often full of surprises, felt somewhat expected. In fact, this first part, which I would consider as the first of three distinctively different acts, proposed an idea and setting that still stays relevant today. While a sense of mystery was introduced early on, for the most part, it remained hidden and veiled, out of the view. This first act not only introduced us to the main characters, it also built the world where the upcoming events would take place. And while the characters it introduced were interesting and fun in their own unique ways, it was the world of Neo Tokyo, that absolutely blew me away. A world literally built from the ashes of a nuclear bombed Tokyo. A world so full of detail, that I would've happily spent the entire film just seeing what it held within it. Neo Tokyo, that, without a doubt, has acted as an inspiration for any and all cyberpunk worlds that have come after it.
But, perhaps even more importantly, the first act introduced one of the central themes of Akira. The fight between those in power, and those not. The fight between corruption and justice. The fight between brutality and control, and freedom. Themes that, incredibly enough, thirty years later, are as relevant as ever. Indeed, these themes were so strongly presented, that had it not been for the hints of something else going on in the background, I would've thought that this film was an exploration of these issues, set in a world so dystopian, that everyone watching, would hope to never see it.Yet, there was that hint of mystery, constantly reminding us of itself. And it was that mystery, and it becoming the main focus, that launched the second act. As the film first began rolling, I never would've dared to expect what this second part brought with it. Long gone was the simplicity of fighting the power through riots and living on the outskirts of law as a part of a motorcycle gang. The focus rapidly shifted into something beyond our understanding. With an introduction to new, peculiar and unexplainable beings, the film took a shift towards something bigger than humanity. Yet, in it, was also closely tied the strengths and shortcomings of the human race. As one of the main characters unwillingly learns that he wields a power much greater than himself, he must cope with the idea of godly strength. What to do with it, and how to use it. While the themes of the fight between the weak and the powerful never disappeared, they were overtaken by the examination of the ability of human nature to deal with extraordinary power. As this is a Japanese film, it isn't much of a stretch to imagine this being a metaphor for the power of the nuclear bomb. And as this theme is explored, it becomes evidently clear just how easily corruptible the human mind is.And it's ultimately this corruption that brings with it the third and final act. An act of truly biblical proportions. In a lot of ways, it is the most straightforward of the three, as it is a barrage of non-stop action and adrenaline. Yet, the more I kept thinking about it, the more evident it became, that the theme being shouted the loudest and clearest, was that of hope. The second act, as well as the first one, were destructive in their nature. Indeed, they presented a picture and world, where hope was hard to come by. But by the end of it, as the sun shone through the dissipating clouds, there was a sense of hope that was hard to push aside. Replacing the never-ending destruction, was a sense of excitement for what was to come. A chance to start anew. A chance to build something better. Of course, in addition to the hopeful tone, the third act also had a strong sense of comradery. The main characters, despite their differences, ultimately reached for each other, when they most needed it. This too, speaks to the sense of a new beginning. The sense that no matter the past, the future can always be brighter. These themes are especially relevant in a country like Japan, where the memory of the nuclear bombings still remains. But the true power of Akira is in its ability to reflect these themes to anyone, anywhere.Despite writing a fair amount, there is still so much more to unpack. And while I would love to do so, I simply don't have the time, nor the ability, as I'm certain that I didn't understand even half of everything that I saw. Akira is, without a doubt, a film that deserves to be seen multiple times, and one that can hardly be appreciated on a first viewing. That isn't to say that seeing it without any prior knowledge wasn't a powerful experience, I'm merely implying that so much of my capacity was used to follow the story, that I most certainly missed a lot of the less obvious tones and themes. However, that is hardly a problem, as this is a film that I will happily revisit in the future. It is quite astonishing just how relevant this movie still is today, and as much as it saddens me to say it, the themes presented here, won't be going away any time soon. Yet, while Akira is a grim reminder of the injustices of the world in which we live in, it is also a reminder of the good things. And perhaps most importantly, it is a reminder that there is always hope.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Most Influential Of All Things Anime!,"The most influential of all things anime, Akira no doubt played a key role in the popularity surge of Japanese animation & is considered a landmark achievement of its genre(s) that didn't just shape up most of the art in the anime world but influenced a few live-action films as well. However, purely from the storytelling perspective, it didn't do much for me.Set in the underbelly of post-apocalyptic Tokyo, Akira tells the story of a teenage biker who inadvertently gets involved in a government secret program & ends up with psychic powers that are beyond his control. The only people capable of stopping him are the leader of the biker gang he used to be a part of & a bunch of psionics who know what his power can unleash.Co-written & directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, Akira is based on his manga of the same name & he has transformed it on the film canvas in a truly astonishing manner, setting up whole new standards in the process. The futuristic world it puts on the screen is highly fascinating to look at plus the cyberpunk tone present in its dystopian society provides the right feel to it as well.The screenplay is finely adapted & while its execution makes sure that meticulous attention is provided to smallest of details, the narrative unfortunately isn't captivating enough & even the characters are quite uninteresting. The animation was a groundbreaking feat of its time, the camera-work is brimming with surplus energy, the use of sound is expertly carried out but its score is a disappointment.On an overall scale, Akira is a technical marvel that rarely lets its viewers breathe for it runs at breakneck speed from start to finish & packs in more action n violence than anticipated but considering its legacy, I expected much more from it. And although I won't be a part of its ever expanding fanbase for now, I do get what the fuss is all about. Definitely worth a shot, Akira is a must for anime & sci-fi aficionados.",,Anonymous,Animation
Highly intellectual cartoon,"Pros: Animation, score, directing.Cons: Storyling gets very confusing at times, need to have an understanding of japanese culture to get this.The film Akira centers around a motocycle gang and the Government. The setting is Neo-Tokyo which is an urban hellhole where rival biker gangs race the streets seeking and causing destructions. Our hero Kaneda, who is also the leader of the bike gang, is out with his buddies where he meets up with a rival gang called the clowns and they have a little gang war. While this is happening, there is a strange man and equally strange kid walking around a student riot. The story is confusing to tell because there is a lot of subplots going on. Akira, as the title is called is apparantly a boy who has this energy capable of explaining the universe. The film boasts better animation than Disney has even till today and is sometimes shockingly but refreshingly violet. My quibble with this film is that the last 30 minutes are about as wierd as anything out there. I am no expert at mangas but how come everyone i  watch always has to have some giant blob reeking havoc (Mononoke, Metropolis, e.t.c). This film has been called a classic by many and watching the animation u can see why, but the story is one big overbundled mess that tries to get philosophical. Not better than The Fist Of The North Star or any of the Dragon ball series in my opinion but quite goodPremise: A Biker gang leader and his girlfriend tries to stop a manical super-human with the help of three superhumans.Akira won a Screen Scream Award at the Amsterdam Film festivalGrade: 7.2/10 (Good but not my cup of tea).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Groundbreaking,"Akira is a groundbreaking movie that redefines animation and sci-fi. The films is able to combine high volume stunning visuals along with a gripping story and a deep theme that creates a cinematic memory that will forever remain as an influential impact just when it was released back then. This movie is renowned for the movement it did for animation. Every frame was detailed and captured everything it needed to make the movie with incredible precision. The animation felt so alive and it was just so flexible in the motion. It's imagery and visions created an environment of beauty and terror, mostly terror, that it just carries all the way through the end credit scene. What really brings out Akira is that it is so deep, because it is not just an action packed sci-fi movie but it also has themes like power, identity, and even showcases the consequences of technology. It questions how far humanity can push its boundaries before it crumbles and breaks. These themes are so important in today's present age because technology is progressing and growing and it creates tension within our society. However, sometimes the movie can be a little dense and hard to understand while watching. It invites people to think and question. Akira continues to motivate and inspire directors, filmmakers and audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Awe-inspiring anime.,"'Akira (1988)' is a seminal sci-fi anime focusing on the rivalry that emerges between members of a teenage biker gang when one of them gains powerful psychic powers and allows his inferiority complex to drive his actions. That's a simplification of the generally rather sprawling plot; it has plenty of moving parts, subtext and elusive, mind-bending ideas. The whole thing is set at a time of political and civil unrest, with terrorist attacks frequently interrupting the action and petty government officials clashing with one another about things they don't understand. It's a really interesting narrative that's occasionally a tad tough to grasp but is ultimately rewarding. The picture is entertaining right the way through. It's distinct and impactful. It's also downright gorgeous, its neon-infused night sequences standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its gloriously gory destruction (seriously, it's surprisingly brutal). It's genuinely one of the most impressive animations I've ever seen; it's honestly awe-inspiring. It's the sort of thing you can unironically describe as essential viewing, even if it isn't the most audience-friendly of affairs. It satisfies the heart, eyes and brain.

Interesting world let down by the characters inhabiting it,"Everyone is screaming, and I do not care.Typical anime-isms let this down. That might sound off when considering how wide an influence this film holds over beyond the borders of Japan, but any whiffs of Western storytelling or stylings are purely hindsight to me, the works that came after Akira defining Akira. Remove its broadstrokes of legacy though, and you have a plot line that feels very dipped in the bog standard anime pool. At risk of overestimating my knowledge of the medium, but this film does a lot that I've seen elsewhere, which is surprising given it's held up as this cornerstone of it all. I've seen the scruffy anti-establishment teens before, especially ones as annoying as Tetsuo and Kaneda. I don't see either of these as tragic figures, because most of the time one's a mutant with a mouth and the other's a brat who is too obnoxious to deserve that bike.Even the visual audacity of it feels like rips of things I myself, an inexperienced novice for knowing about anime, have already seen. The hallucination scene between Tetsuo and the toys in the hospital was cool. Paprika does it cooler. The big blob of fleshy action at the end is epically grand. Evangelion did it grander. And just as in every other anime I've seen save for one character crime drama that spanned almost 100 episodes in Monster, really weak characters, whose peak of development is how banged up they get and how much dirt gets on their clothes. I could tell you much more about Neo Tokyo as a place than I could any of the heroes. Or the villains. Or the little ghost children. For a film which so much on its mind, Akira blurts its ideas too rapidly and without much sense to the ordering, so it becomes wonky in pacing and overall leaves you with nothing more than impression. The substance is there, but I'm not having it. No wonder the singular thing people reference from this is the bike slide.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Akira is Anime at it's best,Akira is arguably one of the greatest Anime movies of all time made in 1988 this movie blew audiences away with its unique animation style a storyline that appealed to a more mature audience with adult themes including intense action scenes with high levels of violence blood and adult language which in 1988 made the movie pretty controversial as it reached a bigger audience and gave people previously uninterested in Japanese style Anime something unique and more appealing to adults.The movie follows a young biker gang who spend there time in seedy bars stealing bikes and fighting with a rival biker gang the leader of the gang (Kaneda) is a ladies man with a bike so cool everyone looks to as the leader and kind of like a big brother to the gang except for the runt of the litter (Tetsuo) who is jealous of Kanedas bike and how he treats him like a little kid also protecting him when one night there rivals the Clowns start causing trouble on there turf the gang chase them down and after Tetsuo crashes his bike in a strange looking kid who uses his strange powers to destroy the bike and leave Tetsuo hurt and unconscious the gang is surrounded by military police who place them under arrest and take the strange kid and Tetsuo away where they begin to experiment on Tetsuo when they discover that he is linked to Akira an experiment that almost destroyed Old Tokyo years prior.Akira has been quoted as one of the greatest Anime movies of all time and inspired the creation of movies like Ghost in the Shell and even The Matrix and now 31 years later it still ranks in the top 10 best anime movies ever made and continues to inspire filmmakers to this day.I recommend Akira to any Anime fan you will definitely appreciate it's beautiful old school animation and story.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Timeless & Timely,"I have been wanting to watch Akira for a couple decades now, but finally seeing it in 2020 seems oddly appropriate. Less than a year has passed since the movie's post-apocalyptic 2019 setting and Tokyo's postponed Olympic Games...the story feels oddly relevant. Otomo's vision is absolutely staggering, and the visuals still hold up. Even without the masterful animation and action sequences, his approach to this urban science fiction tale has so clearly influenced our storytelling. Just like Blade Runner, you can see elements of it *all over* the last 30 years of film. There were points when the characters' motivations were a little unclear or the plot felt a bit convoluted, but I rarely cared. This is a classic story for a reason.

A True Test for Anime Fanatics,"Like wise, Akira was (and is) considered a great Anime film for one reason, it was one of the first to be brought to American television. That is the only reason. The Animation itself is NOT typical Anime, just a fat Americanized version of the thin slender, big eyed wonders that wander the screens of Japanese houses. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because of the fantastic story line that has stayed almost the basis for all Anime plots brought to America. DROP IT EVERYONE, Akira is NOT A CULT FILM, just the first Anime seen by general public.Accept the fact that it sucks, no one is forcing you to like it. I hope Japanimation lives forever but no through this pale version of a violent, fat, Disney cartoon.If you want to view authentic 'anime' watch Ninja Scroll, Demon City Shinjuko, Appleseed... basically everything else except this.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
An epic dystopian film!,"As a person who recently just got introduced to anime not too long ago, I feel like this movie was ahead of its time and the concept as well as the story was great in every way.This movie is set in a post apocalyptic city of Neo Tokyo, where after a government experiment, tetsou develops an uncontrollable psychic abilities which endangers the city once again.Whats so special about this movie is that this set the stage and the bar for many animes and animated movies. WIth critical storytelling and an interesting plot as well as the animation, which was totally hand drawn.The most special scene in my opinion and one of my favorites was when the bike chase was going on through the neon lit streets of neo tokyo as well as the part where kaneda uses a laser rifle to battle tetsuo, showcasing the abilites with stunning visuals!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing animation with a compelling story,"Akira is one of the best anime films of all, and for good reason. The story gets better and better each act and the animation is absolutely breathtaking. By far my favorite part about Akira is its animation. It's so fluent and kinetic; you have to watch it to truly understand. There are some flaws to film, like the pacing. I think it took a little to long for the story to develop and some acts also took a little too long, but once everything added it up, it only got better. The story also touches on some great themes about humanity, so there's some replay value too. Overall, I found Akira to be very enjoyable for the most part. If you enjoy anime as a genre, then it's a no brainer to give this film a shot if you haven't seen yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie.,"This is a title that can be hard to understand as the movie progresses but it worth watching. The animation is fantastic. I will warn you that it is a violent movie and not for the regular viewer However, saying that, I did enjoy the whole movie.

A landmark animated film that shows the beauty of visual storytelling...,"Akira personifies what makes animation and the cyberpunk sub-genre of Sci-Fi great. The imagery and storytelling are fantastic here and we really feel the intimate effect of disasters on the movie's characters and the people within that world. It looks at the past and future and looks at the effects of the nuclear devastation of Hiroshima. Many Science Fiction themes are presented and in a great way even though some of it feels very condensed due to the story being adapted from a Manga series (Japanese comicbook).This is what I love about Akira, it's just a true testament to visual storytelling and the creating of a fully developed world with interesting and developed characters that seemingly have basic personalities. It's a film that feels timeless, feels like something that could easily be made today with a distinct form of visual presentation. If you haven't checked this film out and read this, please give it a go, even if you aren't a fan of anime or animation.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Social Outburst and Neo-Tokyo,"I live in a country where lately has been full of protests, riots, movements. It is inevitable not to compare the situation with the destruction, the fights, the violence, the sence of fury and nonconformity with the government seen in Neo-Tokyo. A city and a country has been carrying up the anger a very long time... It was time to let the anger out. Now the streets are full of dust, rocks, broken glass, tear gas is still in the air, blood. The whole country is in a state of anger.What you see in Neo-Tokyo is the picture of our days. Unfortunately we don't have the same buildings and holograms as in Akira. It doesn't matter on which side you are, you can see it is moving, and is making noise. A mass of people in the streets.One day, a cinema near the center of major protests and riots had a special screening... Akira. A movie which i've never seen at a big screen and a sorround sound.The movie starts. The whole room knows what is about to begin. Japanese voices of caracteristic tones and sounds covers the cinema. Kaneda's Theme is playing. The neon colors break through the viewer's eyes. A masterpiece of Katsuhiro Otomo.It was like seeing our streets, the people, the cops, the violence. Just hearing the Kaneda's Theme almost made me tear up. Not because i felt sorrow on how similar it was to the country, but how amazing and incredible sounded along with the visuals and colors. A journey everyone should experience.The movie ends. A full room of spectators leaves... Another group of people is waiting for the next movie... The exit doors are opened... Just when we got out, we see the movie again... Akira is here, Neo-Tokyo is here. The poeple, faces, clothes, burned cars, fire, people running and throwing rocks, screaming in cholera, phones recording everything, the social media is in the air, technology is inside us now.All of this says a lot of how a movie, Akira can be timeless in its entirety concept.",,Anonymous,Animation
my first anime film,One word: wow before watching this film I wasn't a fan of anime.... Now I am,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Woah...""","So here I am, the only animation fan I know who's over the age of ten, and I had never ever watched ""Akira"" before yesterday morning.  I am very ashamed of myself.So let me just say that ""Akira"" is awesome.  It's pretty much everything I'd ever heard about it and much more.  It will literally blow your mind.I'll only share a few things because I don't want to spoil it.  You'll want to be in the same mind-set as the unsuspecting folk who went to see this movie in the late eighties, back when animation meant Disney and nothing else.  Two small bits of information might help, though.First of all, the story is a little confusing.  Fortunately, I read a criticism of the movie a long time ago and one of it's helpful points came back to me while I was watching it, so I'll share it here.  The story is basically a darker ""Star Wars"", one where Luke goes insane after all he's been through and Han Solo is a horny jerk.I'm also telling you not to eat while you watch it.  It is *very* gory in parts.  The final half-hour is especially insane.  As I told my sister, ""Well, it's real pretty they way they animated the horribly mutating corpse!""  (Poor, poor Tetsuo...)I should note that the version I saw was the letterboxed subtitled edition. I know many people make a big deal out of that sort of thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Akira, no spoilers.","One of the best anime movies, ever made. Period. The music, the atmosphere, the incredible story. It has everything it needs, to be awesome. Then there is the thing about age. This movie is old, really old. So they had to restore the movie, as much of the original content was dirty and dusty because, well, the movie first came out in 1988.So they did an amazing job, cleaning out the dirt from old age, and restoring the picture, giving colours more saturation for more brightness (the original movie was much more dark. The sewer scene for example was almost unwatchable as you couldn't see anything)What they also did was to redub the voices in English for 5.1 surround systems. The only problem though is that the quality of the voice acting from the new kids on the block, is of abysmal quality, and the script is also different. I wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't for the Blueray disk which let me choose between Japanese 5.1, English 5.1 (2001), and English 2.0 (1988).They knew what they were doing back in the 80s because of the boom of cartoons being imported to the US and EU marked. This art was lost some 19 years later it seems. I have listened to both English voice overs:1988, engaging, dynamic, energetic, you hear on the characters voices that they are in peril, both emotionally, and physically. Great varied reactions to terrible life changing events, 100% without swearing. (And sadly, subtitles for this version doesn't exist... Why.... Why...........)2001, apathetic, out of context, some characters sound like they couldn't care less what happens to them. 'What the' gets said as a reaction 20 times throughout the movie ( the original voice over had 0 'what the'. And lastly, lots of swearing.The subtitles are a replica of what is said in this new redubbed version.So yeah, do yourself a favour and watch Akira in its restored for HD quality for sure, but avoid the 2001 English redub AT ALL COSTS. If you really want the crisper soundtrack, watch Akira in Japanese 5.1, and English subtitles directly taken from the 2001 redub. Not perfect, but the Japanese version is not far from the quality of the original. And yeah, you get to learn how many of the swearing in the English language is written.I watched this yesterday, with 1988 original voice over, with not that crisp sound, and the cruddy subtitles for some laughs. Conclusion: I had a blast. Nice to see such a good movie get the HD treatment. Also glad I got to choose if my characters sounded like they cared, or not.Akira is a masterpiece, but to fully see why, you also need to see it with a voice over made by the pros.As the saying goes: If it ain't broke, why fix it ey?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Incredible animation, stylish, atmospheric and dystopian - complex and dark horror sci fi","I watched Akira not due to word of mouth VHS but because of aesthetics video set to music I saw on X. I watched it for the animation, ans obviously I'd heard of Akira as anyone who even has a minimal appreciation of anime or manga would.And the animation doesn't let down, one bit. It is staggeringly beautiful, vivid colours and with every character interesting and unique. The atmosphere of the dystopia conveyed is spot on, the world built is quite special.The story Is interesting but soon veers into horror territory where it loses momentum, and just becomes a bit too dark and depressing. The violence, while never gratuitous or unnecessary to the plot is still quite a lot and its not a film for kids by any stretch.It's a bit too complex, and the characters actions and motivations don't always make sense- in fact there's too many it's hard to really get to know them or what makes them tick.I don't think it's the legendary film some say it is, but even if I don't feel the story of the Anime is that great (not Manga. I hear very good things about the manga) the animation and beauty is undeniable.Also some of the jokes and lines don't hit well in translation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who or what is Akira?,"One of the most popular anime films of all time and helped launch anime into the western audience. With a surreal atmosphere its anti-government theme and excessive gore and violence. Akira tells a story of a guy named Kaneda, runs a biker gang in a post nuclear Tokyo. They don't care for the rules or authority. It doesn't seem all that Different from any other day Until one of his friends named Tetsuo develops strange mental abilities. From what most would hear about this movie or see from trailers. it's worth noting that movie is not just one big action sci-fi film. there's a heavy theme on corrupt political agendas and the consequences of inhumane scientific experimentation and abuse of power through military force. that's where the movie strongest suit is in the commentary of what the citizens are experiencing and what they think of other cities being run. The major thing that the movie suffers from is the fact there no other characters that don't leave a lasting impression. The only two characters that are all that interesting is Kaneda& Tetsuo.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Akira"" (1988) is a surprise to me seeing it for a first time in 2019, 31 years after its release. I did not expect for this movie to be such a deep and effective. Animation itself was simply amazing - terrific attention to smallest details. Story itself was epic, deep, dark and brilliant. The storytelling was superb - this movie did not dragged for a second (well, maybe a bit by the end). The world itself was amazing and dark.Overall, ""Akira"" is an amazing movie.

"Takes two watchings to understand, but is worth it.","There seem to be two main sides to this argument. One side argues that this is the greatest Anime ever, on the basis of it's outstanding visuals and intricate storyline. The other side says it's a load of things unpleasant, and usually emphasise less the violence (of which there is plenty, no one disputes that.) and more the lack of a storyline.First, let me dispel that myth. There is an intricate, deep and powerful storyline here. It touches on the nature of religion (in much the same way as Monty Pythons 'Life of Brian' did, funnily enough) whilst also ruminating on the worth of a science that cannot hold back. It has characters who are genuinely deep, (especially the Colonel.) something which most people neglect to mention. One of it's main arguments is that all debts, good and bad, will eventually be repaid.But lets also face it. It's confusing. The first time it's watched, nothing makes any sense, the government cover-up plot is too confusing for words and the cult is an absolute mystery. Akira (the character) is lost within the utter chop and slice manner of the movie. There are simply too many scenes to keep a track of.But watch it a second time, and it will all make sense. You to work out all the pieces, make the puzzle fit together. And you discover a film that is far deeper than most films out there. For an example, watch ""Deep Impact"", another apolyptic style film, and see which makes the more profound statements. On a first viewing, Deep Impact is more accessible. But on the second, Akira unlocks it's hidden secrets. Akira is all about that second viewing.And now to dismiss another myth. Akira is not the greatest Anime ever and never has been. Golgo 13: The Professional, held then and still holds now the honor of greatest Anime.",,Anonymous,Animation

"the storyline can be hard to follow, but the animation is outstanding","it is a long movie, and you will probably get a lil bored about half-way through, until the end, and the characters are weak in their storyline. this is mainly an action movie, but it seems like they also want it to be about the story-line. it could have been a lot better at building up the great story concept, and adding some more action scenes, but for 1988, this movie deserves a 10+. i give it a 7 or 6 for what i'm used to now, but i feel this IS a milestone for its time and every anime lover should have a copy) so if you don't mind looking back towards the past and watching a decent anime, this one is for ya. also...the front cover has a pic of a dude and a motorcycle and a picture of a pill on the back of his shirt. his motorcycle is hardly in the movie, and the pill pretty much is never seen in the movie, so i don't know how they come up with that. like i said, the story line is weak, and put together quite badly, but hey, it is 1988, and the graphics still look GREAT today)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Mighty Overrated, Possible the Worst Anime Ever Made","Akira(1988)Review: I remember when about 15 years ago when my brother rented this movie and was excited about it. I never heard of it, but had an open mind. Here's my take:Akira is possibly the most overrated anime ever. I do not understand the love. It's been hailed as a classic. Tell me why you loved this. Is it because of the convoluted story? Is it because of the lifeless and dull characters? Is it because it is really long? Is it because of it's many scenes of unnecessary violence?Seriously, I do not get it. The characters were dull, the story is contrived and confusing and the violence is far to much and some of it is towards the kids. It gets rather hard to watch. I found no joy in this. This movie overstayed it's welcome. It's just too damn long.However, I must give credit where credit is due. The animation is really good here. For 1988, it's mighty cool.There are many Anime that are great like Vampire Hunter D:Bloodlust, Princess Mononoke, and the Cyber City Oedo miniseries. Akira just does not satisfy at all. It's a boring and unpleasant experience.And to finish my story, halfway though Akira, my brother who was excited fell asleep and I was really drowsy. True story.The Last Word: I hated this movie. Through the test of time, Akira will remain the most overrated piece of Anime garbage. Good visuals do not make a good movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ambitious,"Neon Genesis Evangelion?A classic anime movie. Immediately I was immersed into the dystopian Japan in 2019 where most people live in rag and chaos. The animation did a great job portraying the condition as well as the violence. Our main character was part of a bike gang, and the special animation of the bikes and chases at the beginning were electrifying and fun. Also, the music was unique and set up the strange and grim atmosphere of the dystopian world.The story was quite complexed. There were political commentary, discussion on human condition, and biblical allegory. Although not as grand-scale as NGE, this movie was still as ambitious and a surreal experience. Of course, there were many details that I'm sure that I missed, but the main message was still strong and impactful.As for problems, I think the main character wasn't interesting, and he's only there acting like the audience. I wanted him to have more purpose.Overall, a great and ambitious movie. 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
1988: A Year of Anime,"The year 1988 will go down in film history as three major animation films from Japan were released and all three were critically acclaimed. One of those critically acclaimed films is Akira, which is probably one of the best films of 1988. The movie tells the story that is set in the year 2019, where Tokyo is built into a different kind of city called Neo-Tokyo. 31 years ago, an mysterious blast devastated Tokyo and now, the city is now being replaced by cutting-edge technology and warring political backgrounds. The characters in this movie are very interesting mainly because all of them, except for one, are teenagers. The teenagers are part of a biker gang and they roam the streets of Neo-Tokyo, looking for trouble. In the opening scene of Akira, we see them fighting with another biker gang called The Clowns. When one of the members of the biker gang is injured, he is sent to a hospital, where an government team is conducting an experiment on the injured boy. While the boy is being treated for his injury, the team gets a hold of a telekinesis power that is being put into the injured boy. But, there's more to that. That special power that the boy possess was the cause for the mysterious blast that occur in Tokyo 31 years ago. Even more specific, a young boy who was present in 1988 had that special power to ultimately destroy everything in sight, including the city. The young punk soon knows that he has the power to destroy anything that he sees and can only do it in his mind. He even uses it against the army that occupies the city by blowing up tanks and destroying an entire bridge. But, there's only one problem. If he overuses that power that has caused the blast in 1988, he will not have the ability to control it. That advice keeps popping up by the young kid who started the blast in 1988. Instead, the power will overcomes and destroy mankind as we know it. The punk doesn't realizes that because he thinks that having this special gift is fun. The real truth is that his ability to damage certain buildings and people can destroy his friends as well. While the boy uses the special power, an very aggressive Colonel gets involved with the young boy and he is also affected by this mysterious force. He also want to catch this kid before he even hurt or endanger the lives of others. Along the way, an government scientist teams up with the Colonel to find out the meaning behind this powerful, yet mysterious force. Akira has a lot of energy going for it. To me, the movie is a cross between Disney and the 1982 science-fiction thriller, Blade Runner, (it's ironic that both this movie and Blade Runner are set in the year 2019). The animation is very crisp and very colorful to look at. I also love the idea of having hell-raising teenagers as the protagonists, especially the young punk, who gets a hold of the supernatural power. The story of Akira is very well-told as we see this very imaginative metropolis crumbled as two-warring political parties and members clash against each other to win their independence and their freedom to express each other's thoughts and ideas. The story is also adapted from the manga of the same name. Add that and also the kid and you have a great anime movie. One of the things Akira does that other movies don't do is cast teenagers as the main characters. So many science-fiction films and anime involves adults and also older people. This movie doesn't fall into that category. I think that making teenagers interesting characters makes the movie work because as we see Neo-Tokyo develop, the entire population is swarming with warring political parties, government officials who are operating under direct orders from the military to keep everything in check and also the rebellious teenagers themselves. The main characters are almost like the kind of teenagers that bring out a lot of appeal to the audience. The action sequences is this movie are very gut-wrenching. We see in the beginning of the movie of the biker gang terrorizing the streets of Neo-Tokyo by assaulting each other while driving their motorcycles through the busy streets and highways, not even caring who gets in their way. The finale takes place in the Olympic Stadium, where the punk can't control much of what was given to him and he starts to develop into a giant moving mass, almost like a mutation of some sort. Even though he can't control the power, he doesn't even regret anything that he did wrong. We, as the audience feel his pain throughout the movie because this possession and obsession of using his power hurts him outside and inside. It even hurts and affect the people around him. The movie also tells us about how runaway technology affects everyday life like these kids that live in Neo-Tokyo. Akira is visually-stunning, packed with high-octane action throughout, and it is very violent. This movie is not recommended to younger audiences. All in all, Akira is one of the best films of 1988. It's style and action culminates itself into a anime classic. It's ground-breaking for its time and will not disappointed fans who love the genre. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"As inspired and bizarre an anime sci-fi film you're likely to see, not perfect, but still a post-apocalyptic wonder","Science fiction films, even when they might be a incoherent in spots (and maybe the story and action in Akira is not completely incoherent but as an American some of the Japanese styling is, well, f***ed up), are supposed to raise questions about human behavior and thought, and be intelligent enough to let the audience try to fill in the blanks instead of force-feeding the answers. The film Akira by Katsuhiro Otomo (from the comic by him) does just that, and at the same time is a visual extravaganza. It has been quite a number of months, truth be told, since I've seen the film, but many of the images, particularly the more grotesque ones but also the ""simpler"" ones, have stuck with me for so long. It's a post-apocalyptic take on manipulation of a person to serve what could be considered the ""greater good"", but in the end, what does it feed but more destruction?That there are some interesting action and character elements in the story helps, and after an explanation of what happened to the natural world (by way of a large, atomic-like explosion), we're introduced to a group of bikers. One of them is Kaneda and the other is Tetsuo. Tetsuo, while on the run from some other bikers, gets caught up in a Government program that is all too elusive for his own good. After some crazy scenes involving his body changing around, it's clear that things have gone awry, on both his end and the government's. So it's up to Kaneda, with a little help from some friends to stop the forces that be from causing destruction. It is through the various confrontations that happen with Kaneda and the 'powers that be', and Tetsuo's reactions, that make up Otomo's outrageous, seemingly unlimited visual prowess.Aside from a climax that might feel a little 'long', however hypnotic, and how gruesome some of those transformations and the violence can get, it actually isn't necessarily as disturbing an animated film like the masterpiece Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. It could even serve, as strange and 'heavy' the film gets, as a good starting point for those interested in watching anime and have never been much exposed before. Some sequences, to be sure, are not for the squeamish. But there is also a certain innocence that goes along with the story as well, with the theme of experimentation on small children. When coming from a Manga comic book, it's also fascinating to see how the film also works as a kind of transition into what anime would completely blossom into in the 1990's (for better or worse). And that the plot, once understood up to a point, is 'gotten' it becomes very worthwhile, because it deals with questions that are always abound in science-fiction stories, and told with an energy not captured in American films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

An otherworldly experience that frightened me for life,"I still remember how was the first time I got to see the movie: saw how cool Kaneda looked on the VHS cover in a film rental store and asked for my aunt to rent it. Little did I know I would get scarred for life at 8 years old, and would have nightmares with the movie the same night as I watched it. I have to thank this moment, as it scarred me it also fascinated me, since nothing after that touched me so deep in an unconscious level, and that made me watch the movie a thousand times during my life.The movie is unanimously regarded as an orgasmic visual and aural experience, and I agree with it. But it's also questioned a lot by it's confusing story and unexplained ending. What I have to say is that the film is a tragic story about how power, when wasted and misused, means nothing, and how qualities like friendship and loyalty, as forgotten as they may be inside the human spirit, will survive after all the hate, anger and madness have done it's job.It's the soundtrack the true highlight of the movie - the tribal, powerful drums and dreamlike bells, all make it sound like there's something out of the physical realm orchestrating the inevitable fate of the characters. After so many years and so many times watching the movie I realized it was the soundtrack that traumatized me, as the genius combination of it with some of the imagery can give a profound impact even on an adult viewer... On a poor innocent 8 years old who only expected an action cartoon where the red jacket hero with the big laser gun would save the city, it's an impact he'd never forget.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Violent, adult and fascinating","Extremely bloody and violent animated film about neo-Tokyo 30 years or so after World War III. The story is way too complicated to get into--suffice to say it starts quickly and never lets up. Actually, that's a big problem.It does move quickly and is hard to follow (at times), and there barely a let-up. At two hours + that tends to wear you down. Also the English-dubbed language is very funny--all comic book clichés coming fast and furious. Still this is one of the best animes.The animation is mostly superb. Some of the characters moved rather awkwardly and they all look the same (a real problem with Japanese anime). Still all the other animation is just great. There are some stunning motorcycle ride/chases/fights and the views of neo-Tokyo ""moving"" while the motorcycles are roaring really astounded me! Better than anything Disney ever did!I do have problems with this movie though. As I said, it's too convoluted, and the women are shown pretty badly. There are only two female characters--one is a victim (who, for no real reason at all, is almost raped) and the other is the love interest who will do anything for her man. Sheesh!Still, this is a truly fascinating film. If you have a strong stomach (the violence is VERY explicit) and can follow a plot going full-speed constantly, you'll like this.

1 chapter of manga a minute? Oh my...,"The beginning motorcycle chase scene will forever be burned into my memory. It was so cool at the time. This movie was great for it's time. However as great as it was, a lot of it seems disjointed which was probably because they shoved 120 chapters of over 2000 pages of manga into a 120 minute movie. I would really like to see this adapted as a tv series instead of more movies, that would really expand the story so you can understand why the people did what they did and how it really unfolded from start to finish. Making a movie at a pace of 1 chapter a minute really makes you think what they had to cut away and make it understandable still in such a short movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film should be taken more seriously,"Too often, Akira is thought of as the typical anime. It's thought to be action, gore, and nudity packed. I think far too few viewers see the enormous amount of detail the writers put into their characters. These characters are very well developed. I think the conflict between Tetsuo and Kaneda is a very compelling one. How many of us can sympathize with Tetsuo? I'm sure nearly all of us can. He lives his life as a cronie, a short and insubstantial punk whose friends treat him like a joke. Then he gets these super powers, and like so many, he lets his power control him.Kaneda begins the film as just a punk, but as the film progresses, he realizes that only he has the power to help. He thinks, and I can see him think in the film. It's all very well done.I also love the three children with super powers (I don't recall their names). Their situation, along with Akira's, is very tragic and quite affecting. The most impressive scene in the film, where these three accost Tetsuo as giant toys, is among the best scenes in film.The only problem with this film is that it can be overly complicated at times. It took two viewings to understand Tetsuo's past (and I'm still not entirely sure that I got everything). anyhow, 9/10, a near masterpiece. Much better than the derivative American film The Matrix, of which Akira was a precursor (and the filmmakers have admitted to having seen and loved it).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kinda slow at first...but it really gets going.,"Saw this on sci-fi channel so I have no idea how much was cut out.  What I saw though was pretty cool.  It is a bit slow at first, but once a dream sequence starts up it gets moving pretty fast.  The story is about a group of bikers, one of them takes a spill thanks to a mysterious boy in the middle of the road and the army takes the dude who had the spill and does experiments on him.  These experiments end up giving him telekinetic powers...powers that were apparently given to another named Akira.  Well the guy ends up going berserk and using his powers to destroy the city, looking for the one called Akira.  Meanwhile his old friend joins some rebel group in the hopes of finding his friend.  The rebel group opposes the Akira experiments.  After awhile the two friends have a cool duel.  Parts are hard to follow, but all in all it is a cool movie and trust me nothing I wrote will spoil it for you.  This is a very brief summary of the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
All time best Anime Film.,"AkiraThis anime film came out the day before my 1st birthday, yet I consider it one that I grew up with. Between this and Dragon Ball Z, there are few others that define my childhood exposure to anime.Back when cartoons were slowly becoming more adult. I had forgotten how ultra-violent the movie was until I watched it recently. The animation still holds up today despite being from the 80s.The music in by far one of the most memorable aspects of the film. I could listen to the soundtrack for hours on end. The blend of choral work and percussion is timeless and never dull. Not only that but the thunderous drums intensify scenes that were already amazing.Before cyberpunk was even a big fad, Akira helped spawn and influence other films like the Matrix. Seeing this now, I can easily see their take from this. The blend of bleak future with heroes that do unrealistic and sometimes horrifying actions progresses as the film reaches it's second act.The film had an underlining stereotype that Japanese people are fascinated by Caucasians, considering a few of the antagonists are typical Americans, large white, mustache sporting stern types, and the like.I really enjoy that the main characters feel real. Kaneda is the cocky ""older brother"" figure who treats Tetsuo a bit harsh if only to toughen him up. Where was Tetsuo doesn't really get that kind of relationship and even through friendship he still resents Kaneda for how he treats him. It's super relate-able and wonderfully written.Verdict: One of the best anime films of all time. There are some weird elements, and ultra-violent, but really should should look past that to the bigger picture, like a Tarantino film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Silence Between the Screams,"Akira is a violent movie, nearly to a fault. While violence has existed in film nearly since its very inception it really isn't used to this extreme except in the case where a film relies on it for a central elemant of the plot or enjoyment of the film (such as in horror or war films). But Akira isn't into about those things, despite the elements of both genres that it wears throughout its 2 hour run-time. The violence and gore in Akira is simply meant to convey the feeling of basic feeling of pain and the crushing feeling of anxiety that the story's characters suffer through.But there are moments between the gore and blood where there is just beautiful silence or near silence that come out of nowhere and just leave you with scenes told entirely through animation and expression rather than from exposition or any dialogue. these moments are some of my favorite in the entire movie with two scenes in particular that are sticking in my mind. I won't spoil the one that comes towards the end but during the first act of the story one of the two main characters Tetsuo begins to see terrifying visions and insinuation that show some really scary stuff in dead silence. It's almost suffocating to watch this scene without sound and it adds considerably to the panic of the scene.Animation wise this may be one of the greatest hand drawn animated movies of all time. the skill and detail in each frame of this film is staggering even 20+ years later. Honestly there is only so many ways that I could describe the visuals with words other than beautiful or impressive.The film is also a pinnacle in the cyber-punk genre of film, standing tall among other important films like Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner as some of the finest examples of this sub-genre in film form as the buildings and neon of the city are as imposing as a wall in a small room, almost making being outside as claustrophobic as being indoors.I'd recommend this movie if you were 16 or older and had a stomach for disturbing imagery, otherwise I don't know if you'd get the fullest out of this movie as you would otherwise.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good movie even for non-anime fans,"I myself am not a fan of anime.  I think the closest I got to watching anime on a regular basis was watching the cartoon Voltron as a kid in the 80s.  Back then though everything was just a cartoon and who drew it really didn't matter.  Anyways, I rented Akira because I have heard a lot about it. I rented it and was pleasently surprised.  I thought that while it was one of those films that was heavily influenced by the style of Blade Runner, the story itself was different and it had a great visual style.  I think the action was excellent (for a cartoon) and the scenes were really memorable. I can't say that I would rent more anime movies because of it, but I'm definetly more open to the idea that cartoons can be entertaining to adults. Rent it if you are interested in sci-fi/action or want to see something we a great ""look"" to it.Zoopansick",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Anime for Adults,"Akira. Every anime fan worth their salt knows the name, many have seen it, and some understand the legacy it has. Akira came out in 1988 to critical acclaim and may be considered one of the first truly mainstream anime successes. Its success was enough to open the gates to the golden age of cyberpunk anime, paving the way for Ghost in the Shell and a slew of mostly forgettable 90's OVA's. With the majority of anime of the period being cast aside or forgotten, especially by casual anime fans and mainstream audiences, Akira has had a stranglehold on pop culture for years. But nearly thirty years after its release does Akira hold up? The year is 2019, thirty years after a giant explosion wrecked Tokyo during the Third World War. Neo-Tokyo is now home to motorcycle gangs, such as the one led by the teenaged Kaneda. During a battle between his gang and an opposing group of clowns (seriously), Kaneda's friend/rival Tetsuo gets into a crash caused by contact with an escaped psychic child. Tetsuo is taken in by the government where it is discovered that he has powerful psychic abilities. From there, Tetsuo and Kaneda wind up meeting for a violent and disturbing fever dream of a confrontation.The plot is very reminiscent of Philip K. Dick and the idea of using psychic children is interesting. The problem with the plot is that despite the iconic biker gangs and general scenario, the actual story we follow is not exceptional. The mean rival becoming super powerful and facing off against his former teammate has been done before and done a million times after. The story that we follow is bare-bones.And the same can be said of the characters. Tetsuo and Kaneda have taken on a life of their own because of how iconic this film is but I can't help but feel they are pretty underwhelming as a pair. Neither gets a lot of development, something that makes the final scene less emotionally impactful than I thought it should be. There aren't any extraneous character moments to show the camaraderie between the two. Instead, we're tossed right into the story and denied any real depth.The same can be said about the relationship between Kaneda and Kei. The implication is that they are in love or have some sort of romantic bonds growing, but the majority of their time together is in the heat of action. I understand that compressing a large manga into a two hour movie requires cutting away the fat and the director would rather have a comprehensive story than well-defined characters. That's fine. And truthfully, the lack of real character depth in no way detracts from this film since the story is interesting and the world and design are fantastic.The art of Akira is what is, for me, the most memorable part of the movie. Painstakingly hand-drawn with multiple layers for even the most mundane of shots, Akira is gorgeous from start to finish. The city is dour but feels lived in and the movement is ridiculously smooth. The color scheme reminded me very much of The Watchmen. It wasn't very anime-y in palette. In fact, given the fact Watchmen and Akira share some themes and have a very similar ending, I wouldn't be surprised if that graphic novel influenced some of the design choices for the Akira film.Adding to the ambiance is an absolutely stellar soundtrack that doesn't feel like background noise but integral to the entire design. The use of music and the sound effects on top of the cinematography and direction shows that the production team busted their asses to make as good looking and technical a product as humanly possible.Akira has aged well. It's prettier than most of its contemporaries and the plot, characters, and especially the world are still engaging. Pulling out from the nonstop praise and love it receives and looking critically, you can see Akira's armor is fairly hollow. But that armor is way too beautiful to be left to rot and belongs in a display case and revered if not for its substance for its craftsmanship. Akira is a movie well worth your time and should be a must-watch for all anime fans. Even if you're not into it, you should still be able to appreciate what it brought to the table and how it evolved the medium, showing that anime wasn't just for kids and teens, but for adults as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Never live in Tokyo,"I'm sure if this was live action it would be banned. This (very violent) classic is the film that launched Anime in the west. Whilst it is a dystopian film stuffed full of unlikeable idiots and some of the side plots are barely explainable the sound scape, cinematography and originality raise it to classic status.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"One of the only films to be thrilling, shocking, chilling, heartbreaking and hauntingly beautiful all at once... almost perfect","It's such a huge surprise that Katsuhiro Otomo managed to pack so much wonder, beauty and pure cinematic perfection into only two hours of film. Of course, with the equally extravagant source material, I would expect the adaptation to be horrifically cut and toned down, washing away all the excitement of the manga, and though a lot has changed, Otomo has certainly done very, very well.The music is beyond brilliant; it gets you heart racing when it wants, it frightens you to death in the nightmare scenes, and it breaks your heart in the sad scenes. Throughout the film, I couldn't stand up, do anything else, or press the pause button. In fact, I stayed sat down, watching the end credit sequence. I was so impressed by its beauty, that I got that glorious feeling of crying, as you so do after such a brilliant film.There are a few very mild criticisms though, as the film is not without very minor flaws. The more recent English dub by Pioneer Sound is certainly more impressive than the previous Streamline sound version, but the best way to watch it is definitely in the original Japanese with subtitles on. Even if you're one of those people who hates having subtitles on, no matter what, it's much better the way it was originally written. The American voices often sound very silly and they draw away from the wonder of the story. And also, they cut out some parts from the actual film, and edited the music (no creepy organs, or 80's style action riffs!) due to some reasons I've yet to understand.Another small criticism I'd like to give is the story. Given the 2,000 A4-size page material that Otomo originally wrote and had to adapt into a 2 hour motion picture, he did a very, very good job at getting all of the most suited bits and making the necessary changes. But, if you're a casual film-goer, you may miss the points and end up lost. As for clever people, they will spot everything and realise all of the points, and the clever but complex story will affect them as it did with myself. The first time I saw it, I loved the spectacle but barely understood it, but the second time (after I'd read the books) I fell in love with the story too.I'm not sure what else to say... great story, great plot, great characters and voice performance (in the Japanese version at least), and the animation is remarkable, even for today! At 26 frames-per-second and all of the complex action, it's certainly a wonder how they achieved nearly everything with hand-drawn, hand-painted cells. It's at the level that we can only achieve with CGI today... and this is only a few artists on paper in a studio, with few computers involved.If you love anime, you HAVE to watch this film at some point. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody who won't pay attention to it, but any film- goers who love a great story along with superb spectacle, this film is totally worth it.Overall: 10.0/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Decades ahead of its time,"Just think for a minute that this was released in 1988. Think of where animation in general was in 1988 and now think of all the intricate concepts portrayed in this film, from corrupt politicians to the vast expanse that is the human consciousness.Akira was way ahead of its time in both the animation quality, the artwork, the script everything really.Please do yourself a favour and watch the Japanese dubbed version and not the English dubbed version.First time I watched this I was quite young and caught the half end of it on TV and I was in a state of shock.. I had to watch it whole. Eventually I found it on VHS tape and watched it whole. I was then in ecstasy. Since then I've watched it 3 times in the cinema and lost count how many times on DVD, VHS etc.This is a landmark of not just anime but Japanese art.Just watch it bearing in mind THIS WAS RELEASED IN 1988!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie migth change your life,"I have always felt as if this movie is more than just that; a movie. Not only because its a beautiful piece of cinema but also because of its emotional spectrum and the way it reflects upon us as humans.The movie must not be confused and dealt with as just another ""anime"" movie, for it feel like that thats become a scarlet letter these days. Sure the characters are done in the oldschool manga fashion but don't let that scare you away.Akira is a work of art animation, an animated spiritual journey. So give this movie the approx. 90 minutes out of your life and you wont forget it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Should have been tightened up at the end,"A great film that could have been among the best films ever made, Akira is hampered by it's drawn-out conclusion.  Both beautiful to look at and listen to (referring to the new sound dub on the Pioneer DVD), Akira also engages the mind and emotions.  Then its climax goes on for about 17 minutes, boring and confusing the audience.  For an hour and a half, I was spellbound, but the draggy climax turned me off.  And the very very end is one big ""HUH??!!"".  But maybe I'm just too stupid to get it.Some points: The Pioneer DVD doesn't appear to be a new cut.  The American voice actors on the new dub are good but not great.  The sound however is phenomenal. And music is far better than the usual edgy-cartoon-heavy-metal associated with the genre.  Also someone commented that you need to watch the subtitled version in order to see the movie as the makers intended. Hogwash I say!  The makers of the film intended for you to watch the film, not read it.  The Japanese version is dubbed too ya know (since cartoons can't talk yet).  I have no problem watching cartoons dubbed.  And this is a strong dub.  I flipped to the Japanese soundtrack and subtitles and found myself reading the confusing dialogue and missing out on the spectacle. it's a matter of preference.  Some folks are purists I suppose.Last point, the book is always better than the movie, except for ""Jaws"".  It goes without saying that a book/manga can go into more plot detail and character development than a 2 hour film.  That said, I found lots of places they should have actually reduced the plot of the 2000 page manga even further, to be more appropriate to a 2 hour film.  Such as: ""TIGHTEN UP THE ENDING!""I'm done - thanks (8/10 - the first 3/4 is that incredible)",,Anonymous,Animation
Cyber-punk anime in a neon light,"Akira was hot wired directly into the sizzling, 'Bladerunner', William Gibson fueled cyber-punk movement of the 1980's and was rightfully the first Japanese anime to make an impact on Western audiences. The screen burns with the glowing neon of Neo-Tokyo, where giant advertising hoardings float over huge skyscrapers and bustling street markets while motorbikes paint streaks of light across the motorways. It's easy to be carried away with Akira's sheer style, it positively drips with light and colour, most notably in the films unforgettable opening ten minutes. Akira is the true spirit of cyber-punk, anarchic, intense, dark and virtually crackling with sheer energy. The plot is too complicated for it's own good, becoming somewhat entangled in the ideas it is juggling, with a few too many sub-plots and minor dramas too keep it's focus. Furthermore, the imagery occasionally goes just a bit too intense and mind-bending, making it easy for a less commited viewer to sneer and miss the film's more interesting subtlties. However, there are some great ideas swimming around in the pool of concepts behind this film, as well as some unusually complex characters for an anime, such as the brooding army officer in charge of guarding akira, whatever that might be. Most notable though is the film's hero, Kaneda, who embodies the spirit of the film, full of berserk energy and simmering rebelion. A flawed film, but a great one at that, it looks great, it's very exciting and that first sequence just can't be faulted.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"One of the most recognised, respected and revered pieces of animation in movie history","This is something too epic to not see, Katsuhiro Ôtomo's masterpiece that paved the global way for Anime and Manga, gaining international attention and still remaining to be one of the highest grossing films of '88.But for those not familiar with Akira or it's legacy, Ôtomo-san's post-apocalyptic sci-fi started back in 1982 as a series of manga and continued on till 1990 until and was eventually released into six massive volumes that wouldn't look dissimilar to a collection of encyclopaedias. The art- work is incredible and set a standard for Manga and then doing the same for Anime when evolving into the feature length animation.The full story of Akira, is the modern Iliad and Tolkien of Japanese pop culture, an incredible work of science fiction on such a scale it's truly epic by definition and only fans of the original Manga series might be disappointed with the film adaptation as the movie is considerable shorter. Whilst keeping the core of the story true to the Manga, the viewers are missing, what I would estimate another 75% of the original plot. Yes! That much.The story is set in Neo-Tokyo, around 2019 in the wake of an apparent nuclear disaster that decimated the city the year previous. The new city, though rapidly rebuilding is buried in politics, controversy, terrorism and an amphetamine-fuelled, cyberpunk culture that's rules the streets. Introducing Kaneda, the alpha-teen gangbanger who leads a biker gang of fellow juvenile delinquents and during a night clash with one of their oppositions, his friend Tetsuo has a near fatal accident when crossing the path of an escapee child, a government subject with interesting powers.Tetsuo's recovery does not go well, basically being captured and monitored by the military, under the watchful eye of the colonel who is desperately trying to prevent a repeat incident that previously destroyed the city the year before. There's conspirators and treason within the government who know the truth about what happened and though it's not entirely clear the intentions of any of the parties, it boils down to harnessing or controlling the power Tetsuo has somehow contracted from his accidental meeting, leading to political intrigue, casting the government into turmoil and eventually a coup d'état with a rising spiritual revolution, riots and acts of terrorism.Tetsuo starts to realise his powers and unfortunately takes a turn for the worse for mankind as his demonic rage obliterates anyone and anything that stands in his way of seeking out the absolute power, the child Akira. One way to describe him during the transition is being like Jack Torrance from The Shining, only with literally mind-blowing powers of Neo from The Matrix. The escape from the facility is bloody brutal.The animation is still some of the best work I have ever seen, the violence portrayed is incredibly visceral with impressive action sequences that give the film a grand sense of scale and was innovative with out-of-focus perspectives. The opening bike chase in particular, with rear light trails, the velocity and detail gave the animation a a level of realism not otherwise seen in animated movies. It's very surreal, but so elegantly done and borderline horrific with grotesque images but balanced with vibrant, illuminating scenes of technology, architecture and science. I know this was a challenging film to animate due to being loaded with gorgeous night scenes, the cityscapes and lighting effects, demanding so much more from the animators, but the final spectacle makes it all so worth it.The soundtrack is marvellous with a complete mixture of modern electric guitar entwined with Balinese Tantric chanting, taiko drums and other traditional Japanese percussions. Composed by Yamashiro Shoji and performed by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, it fits the film so perfectly well with Kaneda's theme song being high-powered and full of attitude and then the ambient 'Winds over Neo-Tokyo' being very soothing and dreamy. The mixture of tech-noir and tradition is conveyed across amazingly well too, with tracks like 'Mutation' and 'Exodus from The Underground Fortress' but Requiem is my personal favourite track because it captures the essence of the entire soundtrack together, giving a reprised merger of the key themes. I'm actually listening to it now while I write this.This film was the ground-breaker, getting the rest of the world outside of Japan to notice and paved the way for international anime recognition. It was the main anime to reach wider audiences and was normally the gateway to other anime greats like Fist of North Star, Ninja Scroll and the more controversial Chôjin densetsu Urotsukidôji, better known as The Legend of The Overfiend that followed. Not forgetting to mention Ghost In The Shell. The films multiple posters are all iconic and instantly recognisable with Kaneda walking up to his bike being my personal favourite.Admittedly, I watched the film first before reading the comics, which, incidentally had not finish running until two years after the film's release. It was this pinnacle film that got me hooked on manga and anime so I started collecting the manga and continued reading Akira as Ôtomo-san original envisioned it. Some, like myself, could be disappointed with the much-butchered story of the film but it's Ôtomo-san creation of both anime and manga, so he had complete creative control and who's to argue?It's a masterpiece, an extraordinary testament to animation that perfectly bonds music, story, action and animation so gloriously well. It's the iconic film that placed anime where it is internationally today. Akira, the legendary anime that became the one of the most recognised, respected and revered pieces of animation in movie history.Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 9 (not 10 only because of the comic story) Script: 9 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being the ground-breaking, iconic masterpiece with some of greatest achievements in animation.  96% 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A little over-rated but not to be overlooked,"'Akira' can be said to have helped in making anime (kind of) popular in the United States a long time ago in nineteen-eighty-eight; I keep a copy of the movie inside of my personal library because of how it's a sort of landmark. I suppose 'Akira' really WAS an enormous contribution in making anime a little more mainstream here, and it always will have a special place inside of me because of that, though I have to disagree in that it's not 'THE GREATEST ANIME MOVIE EVER'. Being an self- proclaimed Otaku (and because I call myself as such for truthful reasons) I can say that I've seen better through my experiences with the medium, though that's not to say that I dislike Akira either; only, I think it's over-rated (my personal favorites are 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'End of Evangellion', but I'll talk about those two later). I'm going to keep this review brief by leaving the story vague; of the story are elements of science fiction and surrealism which feel to me as leaving the audience in a state of being helpless. The characters show a contrast with future anime heroes and heroines; that they have a grittiness to them and appear void of melancholy (they're like a homage to American comic-book characters even). The story too feels like a homage to American actions comics; super-human-powers fill the story with conflict.This film is 'fun' and it gets for it's audience to think too, but again, there are better anime films existing, and I can say that 'Akira' has little of some important things like character development; I feel like the director didn't care too much for that stuff anyhow, and focused his attention on violent scenes so to interest the action fans (and I'm sort of fine with that).7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I think Masaru kind of looks like a small Louie Anderson....,"I am generally not an fan of anime, but there are a couple of exceptions. This movie is the biggest exception. This is one of the few animes I really enjoy. The story revolves around Tetsuo Shima, a young member of a bike gang in Neo-Tokyo. After an incident with a strange young child leaves him injured, he is taken by the government, who awaken latent powers inside him that Tetsuo finds himself consumed with and unable to control. The movie, based off the manga of the same name, is probably one of the few anime films that will ever find itself in my collection.The animation in this movie is fantastic; the movie looks great. My favorite scene in the movie would have to be when Tetsuo awakens in his room at the government facility and he finds himself hallucinating, the toys in his room coming to life. It's one of many awesome visuals in the film. The film contains a good amount of graphic violence and 'frightening' imagery, so this is definitely not a film for a younger audience.I can't think of much to say about the film, except that its worth checking out.

Less Than What I Expected,"I am not familiar with anime, or Japanimation, or manga, or any other sort of Asian animation style. I watched Akira because of its reputation as one of the best films of its genre. Evaluating Akira as a film, however, as opposed to a cultural phenomenon, I thought it was disappointing. The animation style is very detailed and glossy, although in 2002 (with films such as Shrek, Toy Story, Final Fantasy, and Waking Life in circulation) the visuals in Akira are nothing special - they even seem somewhat dated. What really bothered me about the film was the lack of interesting characters, uneven pacing, and an alternately boring and incoherent plot. What could have been an interesting story about human evolution and government conspiracies gets stuck in a teenage biker gang soap opera before falling off the metaphysical deep end in the last twenty minutes. This might make sense to people who are familiar with anime styles and stories (I think that Akira was a book before it became a film), but speaking as someone who is not versed in that folklore I was left scratching my head in confusion and not enjoying this cinematic experience. I give the film 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"AKIRA was, is and will be!","A superlative manga film adaptation, but not only that.

Thematically, we get coming of age, cyberpunk, body horror, supernatural powers, genetic experiments, the fusion of man and technology, dark future dystopias, political power struggles and plenty of action. The story is relatively complex, may require several viewings and lacks the why questions in many places, as the overall concept of the manga series was not yet complete at the time of the film's release.Something like Akira did not exist before and hasn't really existed since, but it has been the inspiration for numerous contributions from all possible artistic directions.

A masterpiece,"Akira is without doubt the best animated film ever!The backdrop is neo-Tokyo after the third WW, where we follow some youngsters who have nothing else to do than ride bikes & and take pills. It's a VERY violent film, as it will knock you to the floor and keep you there. The animation is by far the most fantastic i've ever seen, with excellent coloring.Of course, like manga, it blows completely out of proportions for an eye-dazzling ending.I recommend the big LaserDisc release, with an amazing making-of.",,Anonymous,Animation
Remarkable...,"I am no expert in Japanese animation, I'm not even a big fan of that genre, but as far as I remember thanks to ""Akira"" a lot of people got keen on ""manga"" (at least here in Spain). The truth is that I have never felt like watching ""Akira"", but I decided to watch it the last week... The first thing that called my attention is that it looks so modern, even though it was made almost 20 years ago. The story is pretty good (maybe too long), and that post-apocalyptic world it reminded me of ""Blade Runner"" and stuff... It's just nice.Do you think that Wachowsky Btros ""borrowed"" some ideas from ""Akira""? What do you say? The power to stop the bullets, for example...*My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

High-Concept Anime Simply Does Not Get Better Than This,"""Neo Tokyo is about to explode,"" boasts the neon-bathed artwork for this cornerstone of anime, and that's true on so many levels. Three decades removed from the megaton blast that annihilated Japan's capital and sparked a third world war, the physical rebuilding process is nearly complete, but societal wounds are still very raw. As demonstrations grow violent in the streets, politicians line pockets and point fingers, motorcycle gangs rove the highway and the military quietly readies a coup, a secret, pre-war government program is losing control of its super-powered test subjects. And, naturally, it's all come to a head at once; a reverberating chorus of disaster that's suddenly reached its apocalyptic crescendo.Akira is every bit as rich, dense and complex as that description sounds. While many of those arching themes are grandiose in nature, essentially wide-angle subject matter, the story itself is quite personal. We get a sense of the big picture as it's suffered by key individuals; a cocky street punk, his beta dog buddy, an out-of-her-depth resistance fighter, a military general and a trio of disfigured, omnipotent children. It's a mysterious film. It does not give easy answers, but the truth is there for those willing to dig. There's just too much going on, too many massive set pieces and tidal shifts, to slow down for anyone. At times, that can make it feel cryptic and inaccessible. In those cases, I'm afraid, the hyperactive pace, towering scale, breathtaking action scenes, striking visual feats and monumental soundtrack cuts will have to suffice. Even if you don't get the ending (which, let's be honest, is way out in space somewhere), the journey to get there is everything.I don't know if this would've been a ten the first time I watched it, way back in the mid '90s, but it would've been in the neighborhood. After soaking it in, over the course of so many years and repeat viewings, it's not even an argument. Akira is one of the most ambitious, and rewarding, animated films ever made. It's a certifiable masterwork.Updated thoughts after a 2025 re-watch: Beneath the cutting-edge animation, rich soundtrack and dense atmosphere, Katsuhiro Otomo's animated masterpiece portrays a desperate city in conflict with itself. Clouds of warring motorcycle gangs swarm the highways. Scores of abandoned children rot in filthy, state-run institutions. Apocalyptic religious demonstrations share public space with violent political protests. Elected officials puff and posture, making speeches and pointing fingers without hearing or solving anything. And the military operates free of supervision, violently quelling discontent in the streets while scheming to outmaneuver its rivals using a slew of morally-questionable human experiments. Thirty years after a secretive large-scale disaster wiped out much of its population center, Neo Tokyo is once again on the verge of an explosion.The prevailing theme of this multi-faceted story is extreme power in the wrong hands. An emotionally unstable biker punk; a brash, stubborn military commander; an overzealous lead scientist; an opportunistic group of activists; each contributes to a perfect storm of raging discontent and untimely misfortune that might just bring about the end of the world. If that sounds stuffy and impenetrable, don't worry. We'll run into plenty of telekinetic dwarves, machine-gunning sky scooters, orbiting space lasers and arena-sized glop monsters between talking points.Not to mislead anyone here: Akira can definitely feel unintelligible. It moves fast, gives us a lot to follow, asks about a thousand ambiguous questions and leaves most of the answers open to interpretation. I've probably seen this movie fifty times over the years and still go back and forth over what the ending really means. I love that about it. Likewise, I love its ability to feed me more detail, and further context, after so many viewings. It's an audiovisual powerhouse, no doubt - even after almost forty years, its artwork resides at or near the top of the pile and its music remains powerful, distinct and thematically perfect - but the reason it's stuck around for so long, striking chords in generations of open-minded audiences, is that incredible depth of meaning. Every character means something, every softly-tinted flashback enriches the moment and every decisive action compounds the next. This is as well orchestrated as any type of big-picture cinema gets. That it's also a brilliant, genre-defining example of high end anime is just icing on the cake.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Looks and sounds incredible,"Got to watch this as the first part of a double feature at my local cinema tonight. It's a film I first watched close to a decade ago now, and had always wanted to give it another shot. It's held up as one of THE essential anime films, and while I always liked it, I never fully understood the hype.Getting older might weaken your body to some extent and make you more jaded, but one of the positives is that it becomes easier to appreciate older films, and place them in context better. For being made in the 1980s, Akira is absolutely insane when it comes to how it looks, feels, and moves. You can see its influence on many of the best anime films and tv shows made in the 1990s/2000s.I would say it's a better experience than it is a story. The world, the look of the whole movie, and some of the grotesque and awe-inspiring visuals are what stick with you most; as does the excellent and unique music. But I was able to understand the story this time, which is something I remember not being able to do the first time I watched it. And overall, it is still a pretty decent story, and quite well told, though you do get the sense there are some pieces missing, and that they could only cram so much into a two-hour runtime.So for that, I'm thankful for being able to rewatch it in a cinema- the big screen and theatre sound really did justice to this animated assault on the senses.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"'You got it, I'm gonna wipe this guy all over the street!'","Akira is a masterpiece, classic anime which has not been bettered since its release way back in '88 - incredible that its all hand-drawn.The film is based on the 2000 word novel and does a pretty good job of condensing the plot into the 2 hour running time, although you may have a job understanding if you are not familiar with Manga anime's or your old (like my grandparents - they didn't have a clue! Bless 'em.).The plot - Akira is a very powerful being, who blew up Tokyo through his sheer energy, afterwards the government dismembered his body and began to run tests on Akira and other test subjects - looking to use this energy for their weapons and machines.Some 30 years later Tokyo has been rebuilt and is now known as Neo-Tokyo, Kaneda and Tetsuo are two friends who have known each other since childhood now they are members of a bike gang who frequently fight with their rival gang - 'The Clowns'. On one such occasion Tetsuo is injured in a head-on collision with Takashi - one of the test subjects (number 26 - who appears over-aged due to all the drugs the government use to suppress the power that has been given to him). The government agents take Tetsuo away to use him as a test subject, after which he escapes only to become over-powered with the sheer energy that he now possesses.I have seen both the dubbed version and the special edition subtitled version which included a 'making of...' feature - the time that was taken to create this anime and the amount of people that were needed is astonishing (see the full cast and you get the idea).The result - one of the most realistic, graphic and beautiful animes ever produced - you forget that you are watching a cartoon and are just engulfed into the whole story.The greatest manga film period.

I think the studio that made this where reasonably old and it shows a matured polished product. The characters are easy to dislike, there is no chance of feeling pity for anything in the movie, the violence and supernatural+Sci-Fi horror is artistically appealing, the setting shows a Grotesque Japan that can be related to, with a knowledge of Communist or Nationalist idealogy which is common in Asia.

The sheer power of imagination,"(+) The soundrack is amazing and the use of silence is clever.(+) The images and the scenes display a sheer power of imagination and left me speechless. The bending of reality is beautifully rendered (eg: the toys in the bedroom). The exploration of human possibilities appears in both the visuals and the plot itself. The reflexion about the limits of power gets clearer as the story unfolds, and gives food for thoughts after the ending.(+) The violence is not gratuitous (after reading some reviews, I ask myself: why should violence be considered the opposite of a good storyline in the first place?)(+) The story looked understandable to me, despite this reputation of a movie you have to watch twice of more. Conversely, a lot of reviews criticize the thinness of the plot line... which is not a problem to me (it is totally understandable: since this is an adaptation of a 2000+ pages manga, there may have been a tendency to over-simplify) and if ever it is problematic, it is largely offset by the visuals.(-) The movie is too long and too heavy to be enjoyed in one sitting.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Easily The Worst Anime I've Ever Seen,"This was the game changer? Really? Wow. I can't believe that a movie with such poor writing is considered one of the all-time greats, the anime that brought the medium to The West. Its 2 hours long, but its worse than Genocyber in terms of character development and explanation. I felt helpless as the plot unfolded, each point more out-of-damn-nowhere than the last. Things only happen because Akira wants them to. Who cares about logic?As if there's a reward for interpreting the cryptic writing. These characters are awful. Most of the cast has no personality beyond their role: ""biker"", ""colonel"", ""scientist"", or ""politician"". The two lone exceptions are Tetsuo and Kaneda. Tetsuo apparently has a huge inferiority complex that makes him homicidal immediately after getting his powers. We barely see him struggle, but we hear him b!?$% about it throughout. Kaneda is just a dumbass. Rude, violent, and annoying, without any backstory. Instead of creating a strong relationship between these two, all we get is bike chase scenes and yelling the other's name.The saddest part is, honestly, the animation is among the best out there. The level of detail on such a grandiose city is astounding. The animation is smooth, and it overall conveys the dark tone. The weird moans and yells of the soundtrack also strangely work out. Too bad its wasted!This is one of the worst written films I've seen. Akira cares far more about fast bikes and bloody deaths than character development. Not one character resonated with me, and the ass-pull ending was emotional anti-matter. I hate this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is definitly not for children under the age of 13 or for people who have a low tolarence for blood.  Akira has a good view of a very violent and futuristic city.  Although it is set in the future it still looks like what was created in the movie can be acheived by that time.  The animation for this movie is fully animated unlike most anime films.  If anyone is looking to start watching anime they should start on Akira and pay very close attention to it (I had to watch it  3 times before a caught every detail about it.)

"This is one of ""ALL TIME GOODES'T MOVIE EVER!""","Absulutly, AKIRA is one of the best movies ever made, in terms of Magic, Graphics, Story (Based in the Manga with the same name).

Better than Katsushiro Otomo, may be Hayao Miasaky, with his ""Pricess Mononoke"" - 1999 and ""Spirited Away"" - 2001.

A triumph of animation,"""Akira"" is more than just a character's name or an iconic motorcycle; it's 2019 Neo-Tokyo, one of the most distinctive places you've ever been transported to. Within this city are warring biker gangs, a sinister government bureaucracy and freakish all-powerful mutants. And despite the ""RoboCop"" levels of violence, you'll find yourself coming back. This is that big of a mind-bender.There's substance to the claims that the plot can be a bit opaque, and I think there was too much of the epic manga crammed into this (the political subtext and metaphysics are only given a passing glance). But with regard to animation, there's simply no rivaling this. Look at the rippling destruction of a citywide energy blast or the blood spray of a human body as gunfire cuts it to ribbons; the sheer effort and attention to detail that went into this are staggering. The line work is articulate and the color is just stunning. This is a post- apocalypse and it's still a visual feast.

A godsend from 80s!,"For a long time it was just mesmerized by 'real' films, last week i saw the animation movie Akira and I am blown away. This film was made in 1988, the year I was born! The first computers existed just a couple of years, there were no cell phones, and there was not even the Internet.Still, the team behind Akira succeeded to put down one hell of a movie. The cinematography, the colors, the technique and the depth of the images is really well done. It's always interesting how a director has suggested the future. Akira takes place in Neo Tokyo 2019. Katsuhiro Ôtomo has chosen to combine his image of the future with his current time.

How to Akira a story,"How could we describe some of our biggest fears? Certainly, there are many troubles in society that make us think twice before saying that we live in a beautiful world. Well, to those who still have some doubts, Akira is a film that you should watch.And I don't exaggerate when I say that this film is marvelous. As many others have done before and after, this film shows animation in its best context and does not try to be gentle with us.Akira talks about a lot of things at the same time. Many movies who try to tell a story this way usually fall and aren't able to be a good cinematographic product. It is not the case with this movie in particular.We have a lot of troubles in society who are perfectly and harshly, even viciously. shown in this movie. The way we learn this story is quite striking, and the visual and direct metaphors that are used are meant clearly to shock the spectator. We have a lot of blood, a lot of people dying, and we don't think at any point that it is ""gross"" and that there isn't a good reason for it to be.The espers are probably one of the strongest points in this movie. They are these kids with scary and disturbing faces who seem to hide some kind of power that is being exploited by the army and scientists. From talking about poverty, and the worst side of society, the movie moves to a point much more symbolical and strong not only because of its impeccable visualization, but also because of how, I repeat the word, ""striking"" are the characters.The feeling of losing some of this new comrades that the film introduces us is present at any point in the film. We clearly see a development about Kaneda or Tetsuo, two of our main characters, and how the things that they are seeing and facing change them, specially Tetsuo.By using shocking methods, the films tells its story and divides himself in three acts: we have the introduction and the idea of what will happen, we have the progress and then we have the final act, which concludes in not only an epic way, but also dramatic and certainly unexpected.I can perfectly state that this film is as good as many made by Studio Ghibli. The strong message behind it, and its way to tell us what he wants to tell us by simply being natural (as sadistic, as graphic and as fluent as it wants to be) and sincere, is probably what is most important in ""Akira"".How many times have you seen a story talking about gangs and the creation of the universe, or the Big Bang Theory, at the same time? Well, my dear friends, Akira does it. And what an ending, please!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not only a great Anime, but a fantastic Sci-Fi Film as well","Based on reputation alone, I expected quite a bit from Akira, and I have to say it mostly lived up to its reputation. I say mostly because I was led to believe this movie had battles similar to Dragonball Z (superpowered characters facing off against one another), but that certainly is not the case here. I guess I was expecting a bit more 1v1 battles between espers (those with psychic abilities), but instead, the movie had a deeper story to tell. Akira is a brash and dark film that takes place in a dystopian future where the government is struggling to keep secret the evolution of mankind. The concept alone was enough to hook me in and using animation was the perfect medium for this type of story to fully flourish.Everything in the movie was unique to say the least, from an animation standpoint to its bizarre conclusion. If you go into this movie thinking it will be nothing more than action or your typical 'strange' anime, you will be quite surprised at how much detail goes into the story itself. There are a ton of ideas floating around (albeit a bit too many to fully understand most of the time) but the important ones are developed quite nicely. But those larger ideas that they choose to focus on really do thrive thanks to the animation, which as I said, know no bounds except the imagination of its creator. The only downside seemed to be most of what occurs in the first half of the movie seems a tad irrelevant in the end. It was as if the creators were trying to throw in too many ideas from the manga into the movie and it became a bit convoluted. But that is where the whole idea of rewatching the movie comes into play, Akira makes a bit more sense having seen where the story goes in the end. That way, as the movie progresses you can follow what exactly characters mean when talking about past events that occurred which we are given very little detail about.But the main driving force behind Akira (for me) had to be the idea of unleashing the supremely powerful Akira. Knowing that he was powerful enough to release the energy equivalent of a hydrogen bomb was enough to suck me in for the entire runtime. It was this idea that made the movie interesting if not nerve-wracking because we don't exactly know what kind of a person Akira is, is he good or bad? Will he save the world or choose to destroy? It was this type of trepidation building throughout the entire movie which lead to the final climax of the film that worked for the most part. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting the type of ending the movie had, at first I was disappointed with how everything ended up, but as time went by, I kept thinking more and more about the ending. And eventually came to the conclusion that the ending was justified. It not only leaves the viewer in awe but more importantly, it leaves a very strong lasting impression.Looking back on the film, the actual storyline of the movie is a bit more interesting to me than what was put on film (possibly meaning the manga would be something I should look into). While I didn't necessarily love the movie like I thought I would, mostly because it seemed to have pacing issues (at least the first hour of the film), the story itself was right up my alley. That being said, I would gladly watch the second half of the movie because that's where the action picks up, the telekinesis starts to appear, the characters start coming together, and the movie dives deep into hardcore science-fiction. Assuming you have no problem with anime and can buy into the idea of telekinesis, Akira is something everyone should see based on the impact it had within the film industry.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

But you get my point)As I said before, this movie relies a lot on storyline, building up to an absolute climax at the end. And this is what makes this movie so great.

Stunning,"I read the comic book series a handful of years ago... I had read some other Manga prior to that, but this was the first that *really* grabbed me, and I made sure I read every single one of the chapters. I found out about this not terribly long after, and was excited to find out about both if Ôtomo was as skillful a director as a graphic novelist, and how the heck he was going to make a two-hour film out of 20 100-something(please feel free to correct me if my memory is off on this) page intense Animé releases. He did a darn good job. Some story elements are altered, and others, as well as characters, entirely eliminated, but without doing so, this would have been considerably longer. The fast pace is retained, and as far as I can tell, the meat of the source material comes through. The plot is engaging and well-told. The score is... interesting. The acting is great, with a few exceptions. I watched this with English voices, I don't know about the Japanese ones. The animation is a visual extravaganza(in the nicest possible meaning), breathtaking, the lighting, the effects, all of it. The artists have an awful lot to be proud of here. The action is awesome, and the designs incredible. A solid chunk of what was really, really cool in the original work is here, and it is *astounding*. There are some rather bizarre, as well as many quite disturbing and grotesque sights and sounds in this, and those unsettled by such should almost definitely steer clear. There isn't a lot of language, but it tends to be strong. There is graphic violence and gore throughout the entire feature. There is a little nudity. It's all written out in the Parents Guide for those who want specifics. I recommend this to fans of Katsuhiro and the novel of the same title, as well as the overall style(which this has in spades). 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great Anime,"Akira is a great film, beautifully animated, complexly plotted and aimed for adults. This was the film that gave that put Japanese Animation on a global stage, and Japan does produce some of the best animation and some of the best films generally. The basic plot of the film is that it is set 30-years after World War 3 and the film starts in 1988 and you see Tokyo getting nuked. In Neo-Tokyo, built on the ruins of old Tokyo, Japan is suffering an economic crisis and the city is infested with teenage gangs, similar to A Clockwork Orange. During a gang battle one gang member clashes his bike into a strange, green skinned child. He is captured and studied by the government and he starts to develop psychic powers.Akira is complex and has made plot strains going on at the same time and I don't want to ruin it for you. It is great if you love sci-fi, animation, anime/manga or just all things Japanese. The animation is also very good from a technical level and all the little details are just great. This is a film aimed for teens and adult, not one for children, but this is just an example that animation is not just for children. Akria is worth watching, and watch it in Japanese with subtitles.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
My introduction to Anime,"Still the best Anime ever made to me. It's truly affecting and never feels exploitative even when the violence is extreme. Works to a fever pitch ending that is tragic and beautiful at the same time. The animation is gorgeous, the music is fantastic and fits into the pantheon of sci-fi classics like Blade Runner.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A surreal future out of control.,"Anime is an underrated genre in the world of cinema. Unlike the American animators who either take cover for princesses/talking animals, and whose major attempt at branching out to an older audience include (pre)teen action adventures or cartoon adaptations of comic books (perhaps the sole exception to these rules is Ralph Bakshi), Japanese animation has the potential to leap to adult, mature-minded audiences, exploring fantasies and futures that, no matter how many times Hollywood tries, they simply can not replicate. However, Japanese animation was fairly overlooked and undervalued for a very long time in North America.In 1988, Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira"" was released to instant classic status in Japan and still managed to find a small following in the Western world. However, its popularity was so infectious, that its appeal spread throughout the Western world and created a new generation, and legion, of anime fans. They soon wanted more, and the rest was history. It was a global cultural landmark. But I digress.Many others have said it before, and I'll say it again - ""Akira"" ranks amongst the greatest animated films. Amazing that a story about an out of control psychic can be transformed with such Gothic and macabre detail, yet visually it is still utterly mesmerizing; how everything falls into place, how it looks, how it sounds, how it feels. It has been said that Otomo animated the voice actors' lips and synchronized it by hand onto the characters. The film also reportedly used over 160,000 animation cells. When put together it forms a gripping effect, we see the characters are hand-drawn, yet the super-fluid motion and good voice acting says otherwise. Groundbreaking stuff. The US$ 10 million (yes it was that expensive) budget had been put to supremely excellent use. tell the creators put a lot of effort and determination to give the public what they want.In the year 2019, youth culture, delinquency, social unrest and future uncertainty are abundant. The city of Neo-Tokyo is weighed against the historical spectre of nuclear destruction and Japan's post-war economic revival. Otomo and his animators realizes this scenario with some jaw dropping sights, the encompassing metropolis of Neo-Tokyo fills up the screen, the streets filled with neon lights, chaos by oppressed citizens, and a shroud of gloom and despair throughout. You can tell that the look and feel of Neo-Tokyo has been inspired by, perhaps even modeled after many film noirs or neo-noirs more than science fiction. ""Blade Runner"" is probably the biggest influence on the film's look (the year 2019 should be the biggest clue).Despite the futuristic elements, the city surprisingly shows a lack of technological progress as oppressed citizens take to the streets to overthrow the corrupt government. Amongst all this, the main story involves teenage delinquents, which looks like a cross between Hells' Angels and the delinquents in ""The Warriors"". One of them, Tetsuo, begins to harness supernatural powers after a freak accident, and he begins to lash out at anyone who opposes him - all while his best friend Kaneda tries to stop him/save him. Kaneda is the typical male anime hero, cocky, hilariously arrogant/ignorant at times, but desperately determined. Tetsuo, the villain, slowly descends into insanity and we watch as his design also changes along with his character. It's a solid tale of good and bad, the future, abusing power, friendship, and surprisingly, the introspective near the end of the movie, which is enough to make Kubrick proud.I love how the film is put together and arranged at the right moments. Crisp editing makes the fluid animation smoothly glide by. Otomo's masterful direction of not only the heavy material and spectacular visuals accompanies the slick, ambitious and thrilling action sequences, more than complementing the visual world that he has created. The violence in said action sequences are shockingly graphic, but not overly grotesque like many other animes before it - it's just the right amount. This is not a movie for young children to watch, unless you feel they are mature enough to handle graphic violence and some introspective scenes. Rounding up everything to come into fruition is the atypical anime, or film, music score. Composed by Shoji Yamashiro and performed by his musical troupe the Geinoh Yamashirogumi, haunting visuals of the city and the graphic action are accompanied by surreal sounds of traditional Japanese chimes, chants and drums, giving it a wholly cultural feel to the film and seemingly making it exist in a truly different world than the one we know.This film is excellent, simply excellent. An event of gargantuan proportions. Run out, buy this, see this yesterday, and preserve it for generations to come. Some films can be forgotten - this film will stay with you. It's a shame Otomo's next directorial feature was to become the disappointment that is ""Steamboy"". He should have another go for ambition.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
kind of movie you need to watch several times.,"This is kind of movie you need to watch several times. It's a good movie but it's really confusing, the direction in this movie was my biggest gripe but I could don't really understand the end. However, the animation is excellent and strong. It is Japanese animated work (It's the first anime to get 5 stars in North America) and good enough to give a good mark. The story is a highly stereotypical anime but it has got some decent artwork and an underdeveloped plot line. The ending is Okay, tho I think the animation guys totally flipped their lids but it's fun to watch anyway. This film most definitely is not for everyone. highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A familiar beautiful world,"Yes, my name is Akira. Yes I am Japanese (American). With that out of the way, I have to confess my allegiance to this movie. The world is strange, post apocalyptic in that Japanese style which was embedded into our communal psyche after being A-Bombed.If you are just getting into anime, this is the starting point. The animation itself might seem dated to a newbie, but given the context it must be regarded as one of the most influential animes of all time, skyrocketing the anima scene into the mainstream.I will spare you the details of plot. The plot however isn't the standard Western follow a character's development to the end. It morphs, it changes, whom we follow changes, and gets far out and completely psychedelic towards the end. This could be viewed as a negative of course, since cramming all the six volumes of the original manga into a two hour movie leaves lots of room for disconnect. And in fact, if I were to give an honest criticism, I find that the movie remains a bit detached because of this approach.Nevertheless, I would be a fool to not recommend Akira, especially to a person inclined towards the East for getting a dose of entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Here is epic movie with fluid animation, realistic images, philosophical messages and kickass action sequences. Some people say that manga is better. Don't believe them.

If you want something different from childish cartoons, Akira is your best choice. Beware of R rating though!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Its okay,Animation wise this holds up pretty well and is watchable with good style. But as far as plot and story goes it doesn't make a whole lot of sense and i don't find it rather compelling. It may symbolism how the advancements of technology comes at some sort of cost. But i in know way feel i can relate this to myself and normal life. Character building is a mess and the actions characters choose don't make logical sense along with the repercussions of these actions. I would not go back to watch it and wouldn't recommend it either unless your seeking vintage anime. I also don't understand why there has to be a 10 line minimum for reviews it is inconceivable to think people would do this for shows they have watched.,3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, adrenaline-pumping and powerful- A landmark film in animation","Considered a landmark in Japanese animation and seen as the film that launched anime in the US and later worldwide. Akira is without a doubt one of the greatest animation films ever made. Known for it's extreme, brutal violence and intense action, Akira is set in the aftermath of World War III in which a psychic explosion destroys Tokyo, (All shown in a brief, but memorable opening scene). Years later, Neo-Tokyo, a dystopian metropolis gripped by terrorism and gang violence rises from the ruins of old Japan, among these ruins lies the buried secret of Akira, a mysterious and unimaginable power. We are then introduced to the characters of Kaneda and Tetsuo, who while fighting a rival gang get caught up in a military experiment. Due to it's release in 1988, the animation was produced using the older, darker and grittier style of Japanese anime which works well for the tone and atmosphere of Neo-Tokyo. The soundtrack also fits the mood perfectly with a mix of ancient and contemporary music, also notably at times very sombre and depressing, again working well with it's visuals. However, what makes Akira stand out the most is its complex story-telling, mind- blowing imagery and artistically created and iconic blend of cel and computer animation. The only single minuscule flaw with Akira is that watching from a 2016 point-of-view where animation has evolved massively since '88, the film can look slightly dated. However, this did not in the slightest deter me from this masterpiece of a film and with a highly emotional and powerful final act, Akira ranks as one of my favourite movies ever. Mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, and features some of the most adrenaline-pumping scenes in history. Every scene feels relevant, interesting and keeps driving the plot, the characters are well-developed, relatable, hence as an audience we connect well with them, their motivations and their actions, therefore Akira rightfully earns it's place in film history as one of Japan's animation masterpieces and 100% fully deserves a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Anime at its finest.,I saw Akira in about 1992. I was blown away then and blown away when I re watched it a few years ago.In between that time I also saw a dubbed version and was somewhat less blown away. So stick with the subtitled version. It will take a few watches to understand everything going on in this film as the plot is very complicating. But if you stick with it it is probably amongst the most rewarding films you can watch.The animation is fantastic and the story is amazing.The characters are fantastic and the soundtrack really stands out.Sometimes you forget you are watching and animation this film is so great.whether you are a fan of anime or not you really should see this film...,10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It truly does something with me, and a movie which has a stunning sound-track can't go wrong with me. John Williams (of the ""Star Wars"" sound-tracks and ""Saving Private Ryan""), mostly bores, but this composer, I can't come up with his name right now, really kicks ass and adds the best to this movie.

Pretty good anime,"Rated R for graphic violence and brief nudity.I usually enjoy anime films so I was interested in seeing Akira when it played on teletoon Friday night.It was a fairly long movie(clocked in at 2hrs 45min with commercials).It was a pretty interesting movie, anime buffs should like it but I thought it was a bit overrated. There is quite a bit of action, it has a good story and some good humor but the film is fairly weird and the dubbing isn't all that great(I hear its a new dub).Its about this motorcycle gang in which one of the members get picked up by some FBI agents and gets some sort of new power.He now becomes evil with power and its up to his friends to stop him.If you enjoy anime films then watch Akira, you might like it but I thought it was sort of overrated.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The characters are developed ( not as much as the Manga by far but this can be forgiven ) and you can really come to understand just how confused the characters are given the circumstances.The two main characters end up facing each other even though they were inseperatable friends but it makes sense. While some things are just beyond understanding without the manga you can really feel that there is something epic going on.With the 15 of 10 score and great English and Japanese performances, this is a MUST see for any anime fan, modern or old.

"""Akira""- Oft-considered a masterpiece of animation and storytelling, Katsuhiro Otomo's sci-fi classic continues to thrill and enthrall thirty years later.","Not only a definitive cult hit, but also one of the earliest films to bring mainstream popularity to Japanese anime in Western markets, writer/director Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira"" is a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Quickly approaching the thirtieth anniversary of its original release while still maintaining a strong degree of freshness and a unique flair, the film has aged remarkably well and manages to hit home with the same great gusto it did all those years ago. ""Akira"" is a film I've almost been afraid to discuss, with it's influence and following still felt in the world of entertainment. But upon revisiting it once again just recently after having actively decided to take a break from it for several years... I'm just shocked by much in continues to surprise and captivate.The film is set in a alternative history, in which Japan was nearly destroyed following a third World War. In the future of 2019, the streets are filled with protests and violence as gangs and corrupt cops rule the night, while corporate and government big-wigs run the world from their skyscrapers during the day. The film follows a group of hoodlum gang-members, including Kaneda and Tetsuo- childhood best friends whom are always at odds despite their past together. When an accident appears to awaken latent psychic abilities within Tetsuo, a web of treachery and deceit begins to unfold, forcing Kaneda to team-up with a group of anti-government activists to try and save him... Little does he know, however, that it might be too late... as Tetsuo is overcome by his newfound powers and decides to strike back at the world he feels has betrayed him. All the while, Tetsuo begins a search for a mysterious figure known as ""Akira"", whom he is haunted by recurring visions of...The really fascinating thing about ""Akira"" is how it manages to tell a rather heady and multi-layered story in a fairly accessible way- by wrapping it all up in a classic, almost borderline cliché, action- thriller based around warring street gangs. While my first few viewings of the film as a young teen did leave many questions unanswered, revisiting the film as a mature adult... it's actually all there, and the information is quite cleverly doled out. The film deals with some really complex ideas and touches on some fascinating themes including existentialism and religious fanaticism, but it's always in a subtle and artful way that doesn't spoon-feed the audience nor withhold too much. It's a smart film that in turn allows the audience to feel smart by giving them the pieces, and allowing them to put it all together on their own- something many mainstream sci-fi stories in recent memory struggle with.Visually, the film is a powerhouse. Stunning in detail and fluid in motion... it's awe-inspiring to behold, and remains one of the most aesthetically compelling hand-drawn works in recent memory. ""Akira"" is filled to burst with minute details that flesh-out the story and build-up the world while also having a vast and staggering scope like few others of its time. Character design is also keen and concise, with each member of the cast being given a simplistic look that tells you exactly what you need to know before they even speak a word of dialog. Otomo's works have always been spellbinding in terms of look- just check out the incredible ""Steamboy"" for further examples. But ""Akira"" might just be his finest in terms of direction and design.Within the situational writing and structure, however, is where the film's few flaws begin to gradually emerge. Now don't get me wrong- the plot of the film is quite fascinating and the characters are enjoyable and entertaining. And on the whole, yes, the film is very well put-together. I think the fundamental issue is that a lot of the subtext, a lot of the story, and indeed a lot of the character development had to be lost for the sake of run-time. It feels like a shortened digest of a much grander tale. Which is basically exactly what ""Akira"" is. My most recent viewing of the film did leave me feeling a bit of a tonal whiplash from scene to scene, as the movie rockets past pivotal plot-points and set-pieces with an urgent rush that can sometimes feel haphazard. But even then, what's there is keenly thought out and well assembled. It just could have used a bit more time to play out.""Akira"" is an outstanding film. There's no doubt about that. And just as it has captivated audiences for near three decades now, it will continue to do so for years to come. While it might not quite be a perfect film due to some minor issues with the pace and structure, the phenomenal art, good use of subtle storytelling and enjoyable cast of characters make it a journey well worth taking and worth revisiting again and again. And so, I give ""Akira"" a near-flawless 9 out of 10. It's a classic... just not a ""perfect"" classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's all about the bike...,"I feel that ""Akira"" is one of the best films ever made.  If it were a live action film, it would be without a doubt regarded as such.  But ""Akira"" is a film that alienates some of its viewers with the very complexity that secures its greatness. Next time you watch Akira, try this; A) Forget it's an animated feature, look at the screen and imagine the same shots are live action, it's not hard to do and you'll suddenly see visuals that would have made ""Titanic"" look like a Kevin Costner postcard epic.  B) Forget the sub-plots!  The sub-plots in Akira are intricate and elaborate, but they are there to enhance subsequent viewings of the movie and provide the background to a masterpiece that upon each viewing you discover something new about the world you thought you knew so well... C) Focus on one thing, the red bike.  I was with a group of my friends, and we had just finished viewing Akira and began talking about it.  One friend was explaining how the movie was about Bhuddaism, another was explaining how the movie was a microscopic perspective of a macropolitical situation, others had similar interpretations... a couple people mentioned it was about the relationship between the alpha male and the omega male.  From different perspectives, they were all right about what ""Akira""'s about. Then I explained that at it's core, the movie is about the Bike, Kaneda's bike.  The bike symbolizes everthing going on about the film, and how all the events are on a parallel course, oddly enough, with the physical condition of that bike. I could go on and on relating everything in the movie back to Kaneda's bike, but I digress.  Just, next time, before you sit down to watch Akira, say to yourself; ""It's all about the bike.""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Astounding and complete.,"I recently watched Akira again, unsure if it would hold up after so many viewings. It did.The animation and music is fantastic. Tetsuo's ""nightmare scene"" in his cell is a masterpiece on its own. The way it builds its music from tiny noises to a full-blown surrealistic symphony couldn't have been better.Akira successfully realizes more than an adventure, more than a story, more than just a movie - a vision. The world it creates is fleshed out and complex. Still, with all the politics going on in Neo-Tokyo, the film never loses focus from the heart of it all - the friendship between Kaneda and Tetsuo. The side characters are all memorable to some degree - the Colonel is one of my favourite characters of any movie. However, characters and character development is not the main focus of the film, the story is what's important. And it's a great story.I have to mention the animation again because it is just incredible. If not as flawless and glossy as that in modern anime, the style of the city and the characters still make it the downright coolest animation I've seen. The film is, if nothing else, a visual (and aural) masterpiece. On top of this, it's just so damn entertaining. Well worth seeing several times, which isn't something you can say about any movie.I love the iconic imagery, the well-needed humour provided by Kaneda's likable biker gang, and most of all, the gloriously apocalyptic conclusion. Akira is an essential film, one of a kind, and the very idea of a remake is laughable. A must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The biggest strength of this movie is that the characters are discovering things just as the audience is. Therefore, there is a much greater investment in how things will end up for them. The only drawback is that some of the characters are a slightly under-developed because the story has so many moving parts. I still highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in anime or animation in general. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
the quintessential anime,"From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on.The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo.In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The story is supposed to start 31 years after WW III, in a city called Neo-Tokyo. The city is in a decline and its easy to see why with the police unable to stop biker gangs, and the high schools not teaching the students.

A fine movie about balance,"First of all, this movie is purely science-fiction. However, one of the tenets of science-fiction is to create devices or elements which could not otherwise exist in reality, and those devices enable the story to show and reveal certain aspects humanity that deserve introspection but aren't easily as accessible under the non-science fiction genre. In fact, this whole movie speaks in metaphors. We see people getting riddled with bullets, getting torn to shreds by this or that, yet later we get a sense that even the police/army have no idea why they are doing what they are doing, and thus lies in the greater tragedy; Everyone in this film has no direction, everyone is living on this neurotic fringe surrounded by the bleak trappings of modern industrial life, and ultimately we see that everyone in this film essentially has no balance, no inner light that guides them, and I think the film wants to explore the journey that one could take to find that balance, that inner light.This movie has directional problems. The incredible action that surrounds the movie completley destroys our notion that this movie is trying to deal with something profound, something philosophical, something that you sit down with a friend over a cup of coffee for a few hours about. The juxtaposition of intense action to intense personal drama is really not a good idea, sort of like riding a rollercoaster than trying to discuss the nature of love immediately after stumbling off.The things which make this movie well worth seeing are+ the ""literalization"" of Tetsuo's lack of balance / lack of control of his internal energy (remember, this movie is speaking in metaphors, when things go boom, take some of it with a grain of salt)+ the friendship between Kaneda and Tetsuo, Kaneda's genuine concern and care about helping Tetsuo regain his balance+ the incredible animation.What this movie could have done betterthis movie could stand a lot of trimmingthis movie also needed some additional things to be said about balance/friendship/relationships/modern urban life to be truly ""complete""there are too many elements that require knowledge of the manga comic for this movie to stand on its own..How to Take something from this movie+ watch it with an open mind, think about what it is saying about internal balanceContent: 9 Efficacy: 5 Overall: 8",,Anonymous,Animation
This was made in 1988?,"AKIRA is set in Neo-Tokyo, post World War III, about a biker gang leader named Kaneda, whose friend Tetsuo is kidnapped by an organisation ran by the government to be experimented on in a secret project also ran by the government. But luckily, Kaneda and his buddies journey through Neo-Tokyo to save Tetsuo. Meanwhile, all goes wrong when Tetsuo discovers that he's got the telekinetic powers of Akira after being experimented on and goes on a violent rampage with his powers causing chaos in Neo-Tokyo. Can Kaneda and his buddies stop Tetsuo or will Neo-Tokyo or even the world be destroyed?In my opinion, AKIRA is the best of all ultra-violent anime; the action scenes are filled with blood, explosions, lasers, bullets, motorcycle gangs and even more, the animation is superb, all hand-drawn and no CGI. The scenery is very BLADE RUNNER-like and can even make you feel like your in the film itself (even though it's a cartoon). And how can I not forget the music? Instead of using synthesisers and other electronic items to give you the futuristic feel, it uses authentic tribal music and it works perfectly (it also uses the organ near the end which also fits perfectly).However, it is important that if you're going to watch AKIRA, watch the 'Special Edition' version, which contains the newer and better English dubbing, rather than the original English dub because the original English dub hasn't got as-good voice-acting and the dialogue isn't good. Or you can watch AKIRA with subtitles in it's original audio language, which is in Japanese.And like they say, no AKIRA equals no MATRIX.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Grandmasterpiece of All Modernist Anime,"This is the film that started it all in terms of innovation and layered, modernist animation.It defies pretty much all classical mainstream western animation stereotypes, which simply makes it all the more appealing to youth culture the world over.Upon the first few glances of Akira, one might easily wonder where the animation staff behind it got their ideas for the film, which came primarily from Blade Runner. As has been well documented, Akira was created through a painstaking process that took creator/manga auteur Otomo Katsuhiro roughly ten years to complete in terms of the manga. All the hard work over in Tokyo paid off, because Akira, in terms of vision and story, is a flawless, well-executed anime film in every sense of the word. It is one of the most complex and well documented anime of all time.Akira's story revolves around a secret government organization in Neo-Tokyo that is conducting mysterious experiments on certain members of a Neo-Tokyo biker gang and young children. The narrative kicks off with an extreme wide shot of a nuclear explosion which demolishes contemporary Tokyo, thus plunging the world into World War III.Unlike many other, less ambitious anime titles, Akira is indeed fully animated, with vibrant flashy backdrop lights included in a Blade Runner-esquire metropolitan manner. The use of color in this film is nearly hypnotic in its radiance, making for much eye candy on many levels. The dubbed sound editing is eloquently executed as well, with a brilliant voice-over performance accomplished by then-obscure Johnny Yong Bosch, who plays Kaneda, a member of the Neo-Tokyo biker gang. There are many other notable VO performances in this film; however, Bosch delivers one of the most memorable.Akira is a mature film in every sense of the word. It's smart, beautiful, and intense, with partial nudity and a bit of disturbing imagery here and there. Quite simply, Akira is one of the all time anime classics, and a great title to start off with if you don't normally watch anime. It managed to set the bar quite high for the entire ocean of post-Akira manga and anime that followed. It's the kind of film that The Matrix WISHES it could be. Akira is worthy of the highest rating possible.As for the package itself, the casing is beautifully done, with many behind-the-scenes features that will easily use up a lot of your time if you watch them. Even without the ""making-of"" features, the film itself stands alone as a Wonder of The World among high brow cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Masterpiece of Animated Cinema,"Set in a dystopian future Tokyo, Akira follows the story of Kaneda, a young biker gang leader, and Tetsuo, his best friend. Their lives take a tumultuous turn when they encounter a mysterious psychic child named Akira, whose powers are beyond human comprehension. The film delves into themes of power, control, identity, and the consequences of human ambition.One of the most striking aspects of Akira is its animation, which is both visually mesmerizing and revolutionary for its time. The attention to detail in the hand-drawn art brings the futuristic cityscape of Neo-Tokyo to life, immersing viewers in its gritty atmosphere. The action sequences are intense, fluid, and adrenaline-pumping, showcasing Otomo's remarkable ability to choreograph breathtaking scenes that set new standards for animation.Beyond its technical brilliance, Akira's plot is intricate and multi-layered, seamlessly weaving together elements of science fiction, cyberpunk, and social commentary. The film explores the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the human desire for control, themes that remain profoundly relevant even in today's technologically driven society.The character development in Akira is also commendable, with Kaneda and Tetsuo's friendship at the center of the story. As Tetsuo's powers grow, so does his internal struggle, which leads to a deeply compelling character arc. The film portrays raw emotions and existential dilemmas, making it not just an action-packed spectacle but also an introspective and emotionally resonant journey.Additionally, the haunting and atmospheric musical score composed by Shoji Yamashiro perfectly complements the film's tone, intensifying the emotional impact of pivotal scenes and adding to the overall immersive experience.Akira's influence on modern cinema and pop culture is undeniable, inspiring countless filmmakers and animators worldwide. Its themes, storytelling, and visual prowess have continued to inspire works like The Matrix and countless cyberpunk narratives.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
a masterpiece became a cult legend movie,"Even now, it is brilliant and unsurpassed . Even if you watch this over 30 times since it came out....it is still so good.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mind blowing,"If Uncle Walt could stop bouncing little children on his knee and refrain from telling them stories about handsome Princes rescuing beautiful Princesses from the clutches of evil fiends he could go out and take in a John Woo, Brian DePalma or Sam Peckinpah film. If he did, he could go out and make one of these. A gloriously stylish, plot-riddled, and spiritual (albeit violent) film.Yes, I said 'film.' This is not a cartoon and never will be. The term 'animation' could be used but that barely does it true justice. Akira is one of the most marvellously cinematic experiences ever made. Easily the best all-round example Anime ever. And there have been some damn good ones. But because of its animated nature this, and many other great 'films' will never be truly taken seriously. Which is a shame for any fan of cinema.There has been much criticism levelled at Akira and it is easy to see why. The film attempts to squeeze into two small hours over 20 issues of a full size Japanese comic. The fact that the comic series was never finished when Akira went into production means that it also has a slight incomplete feel to it. Many are easily confused as to what it all means. I have to admit that I'm one of them. But repeated viewings with a firm grasp of where the film is heading helps and the fact remains that it is truly compulsive viewing.The best way to approach this is to treat it like any other film. The characters may be paint and pen but you still care more about them than the humans in a lot of expensive, flimsy blockbusters (makers of a film involving a certain big, green lizard take note.) There are sub-plots and histories which all give the people some kind of personality. Kutsuhiro, the director, achieves his masterpiece using the same methods as any other director. Pacy editing makes for some disturbing dream sequences. Zooms, pans and slo-mos turn in some dazzling action scenes and the animation is as impressive as any expensive CGI. The one true criticism I lay at it is its graphic scenes of violence. There's more blood and shredded corpses in this film than Verhoeven could get away with. This is not a film for under-fifteens and its brutal nature will shock anybody expecting a Japanese Mickey Mouse.That apart the result is a marvelous trip into the surreal that screams out to be made into a 'real' film. If a studio did decide to take the plunge then the end result would be a thing of incredible beauty. But its unlikely to happen. CGI will never be good enough to pull off the nightmares and the cost to make this would make Titanic's budget look like chump change. Add to that the incredible cult fan base this film has, and the fact that a live-action version is sure to be booed by most of them, and it would be a brave company that would try to adapt it. And bravery isn't something the Hollywood system is known for is it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Marvellous Japanese Anime - a cross between Blade Runner & Mad Max and so much more!,"Although 12 years old now, and looking a little dated (CEL being replaced by the rather more sterile & lifeless CGI), Akira is the grand-daddy of all Japanese Anime films.I only saw it by accident on TV about four years ago. Flicking idly through the channels one night until I saw what looked liked a rather detailed ""cartoon"" strip, which later turned out to be the full majesty of Akira.However, I'd missed about 30 minutes of the film and by the end I was no more the wiser as to what had happened and what it all meant. But in spite of my confusion & ignorance I was simply in awe at the beautiful CEL rendering of a post-war Neo Tokyo.I had to join a Manga organization to find out where to buy this movie, and when I did I couldn't get home quick enough. Fortunately this was the subtitled version (I have yet to see the dubbed version and in a way I'm glad because usually dubbed films often ruin the whole ""feel"" of the film)It is, however, hard work to follow. The story is very detailed and moderately convoluted, not helped by having to read the subtitles while still keeping an eye on what's going on above. It took me at least 4 or 5 repeat viewings to finally get comfortable with the involved storyline but its well worth it in the end, although the last 20 or so minutes does go marginally anal with itself, and just pulls the film down from being a true classic.It should be  remembered that this film is only part of a long-going story of Akira comics, so it's not surprising that our western eyes are a little confused with some of the sub plots & subtle Japanese spiritual & cultural meanings within the film that are never fully explained away.Many have compared it to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, not so much with regards the story of course but on the grand visualization of some neo city of the future with its technology & artificial human society.But IMHO, Akira supercedes even BR not only visually but also at a sub conscious level. Blade Runner lacks any real human attachment or emotional drive, whilst Akira makes you feel part of the crowd looking on at the goings on of a bunch of motor bike riding kids causing mayhem in the streets of Tokyo, but in fact could be any city you wish really.Personally I prefer Ghost In the Shell, Cyber City & PATLABOR 2, closely followed by Akira, in that order of preference. But Akira is perhaps the most intelligent of these and all the other anime/manga films out there.Don't confuse this kind of ""cartoon"" with the likes of Pokemon, there is simply a world...no, a galaxy of difference between the two genres. Akira is a tough, brutal, violent & grim film that will leave you both perplexed & confused by the end. But even if you don't want to be too involved with the story line its worth seeing simply for the majesty of the animation alone.****/*****",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A masterpiece of technical animation,"As we approach 2012, the year designated by the Mayans in their calendar as the end of our present age, more and more people are beginning to come to an awareness of our multidimensional reality. Just recently an article in New Scientist magazine reported that an essentially empty area of our universe has been discovered nearly a billion light years across, implying the presence of a second universe beyond our own. Coming just a few weeks after other scientists drew the conclusion that parallel universes, which exist in the same area as our own but in overlapping space, may be real. This new discovery amounts to a shift in our understanding of reality.I was thinking about this while watching Akira, the breakthrough Japanese anime doomsday fantasy by Katsuhiro Otomo from 1988 in which the old order has broken down and strange and powerful forces are working to propel the planet into a new universe. A masterpiece of technical animation, Akira is also a complex and challenging work of art that baffled Western audiences when it first appeared in 1990 but who appreciated its exciting animated style. At that time, animation was considered in the same vein as a children's cartoon, without artistic or intellectual substance but Akira changed that perception to the degree that anime in the 90s became one of Japan's chief cultural exports.The film opens in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo in 2019, 31 years after World War III. Adapted from Katsuhiro Otomo's long running manga comic book (originally published in a teen magazine), Akira complements its non-stop action and explosive violence with recognizable human beings who can express complex emotions. While the film also contains a political thread in which young people rebel against authority and seek freedom from oppression, the plot is not as significant as the magnificent colors and the quality of the animation.The main character is Tetsuo, a member of a teenage biker gang (bosozoku) led by his friend Kaneda Shotaro. The film revolves around Tetsuo's relationship with Kaneda. Growing up together, Kaneda has always comes to his aid, but the situation has fostered both Tetsuo's dependence and resentment. During a motorcycle ride, Tetsuo encounters a strange psychic child whom he later learns has been frozen into an unnatural aged childhood as a result of group experiments with telekinesis. Tetsuo's encounter with the child unleashes his own telekinetic energies and the story becomes one of his growing powers developing against a background of civil riots, terrorism, and government crackdowns.Taken captive by government scientists who experiment on him, Tetsuo is transformed into an unrecognizable creature that can unleash super powers, capable of doing considerable harm to himself and others. Escaping across the city in search of ""Akira"", the entity rumored to be the most powerful of the group of child mutants, Tetsuo becomes a lonely outcast cut off from his friends, then disappears. As the screen is filled with silence, a radiant white dot comes down from the sky and we hear in voice-over the words ""It's begun"". What has ended and what has begun may not be fully understood until five years from now.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An excellent cult-classic anime.,"Before ""Memories"" and ""Steamboy"" there was ""Akira"".July 16, 1988, the outbreak of WW3 comes to an end. When Tokyo was wiped out by an enormous nuclear explosion. 31 years later in an alternate 2019, Neo-Tokyo stood where Old-Tokyo once stood from the nuclear blast.Neo-Tokyo is large, vast, and very high tech compared to the Tokyo we knew well. Over the past couple of decades, the city is over run by gangs and the newer generation. Inlcuding an unbalanced uproar of violence, drugs, crime, and sex. Shotaro Kaneda, leader of his own bike gang is someone to look up to when it comes to fighting off bullies and helping out someone in need. Including his friend Tetsuo, who was never a good fighter and was pushed around a lot as a kid. When in doubt, Shotaro will always be there to stand up for him. Shotaro, Tetsuo their pals were taking care of things perfectly in their neighborhood.Right until they encounter a mysterious decayed kid who's on the run. This kid has mysterious kinetic powers and is being tracked down by the military. When Tetsuo encounters the kid, he immediately inherits some strange illness which makes him a victim for the military to take and examine. Shotaro tries to get his friend back, but failed. Multiple experiments were performed on Tetsuo as he is now similar to the decayed kid he encountered earlier. The power he has is believed to be similar to Akira's power. And Akira is known for being the most powerful human being with Psychological powers.Shotaro, some of his friends and a group of protesters seek to help Tetsuo from the clutches of the military. What has become of Tetsuo? Who was that Decade kid? And who is Akira? This movie proves that Otomo was brilliant in the art of animation from the very beginning of his career. This movie broke the limits of an average anime film. And has all the right ingredients for an enjoyable movie. Including Excitement, violence, character development, girls, guns, choppers, technology, explosions, humor, and interesting script.It's an 80s anime with an 80s looks to it. But the animation is just brilliant for only being 2-D. The characters designs are cool. The locations are very visual. And the plot is well thought up.I didn't see this movie until after I was familiar with Otomo's other works. In my book, his skills in anime are worthy. And I can see why this movie was so well received during it's original and American release. It's definitely a cult-classic to watch time after time.Due to it being R rated. It has a lot of violence, including lots of blood, profanity, brief nudity, a few disturbing scenes, and suggestive themes. so viewer digression is advised when watching this movie.I recommend it to average anime fans, experts, newbies, as well as those who seen Otomo's other works.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Anime Movie EVER!!!,"Akira was the best anime movie I ever saw. It was violent, had an easy to understand story, and the redub had great voices (but the originals stunk in comparison). The movie was vastly different from the original manga, and even though it had a completely different story, it was still great. I enjoyed both the movies plot, and it's stunning visual effects: it actually had 50 colors created specifically for it, and that is an amazing feat. I even enjoyed that the movie went into Tetsuo's mind and showed his hallucinations. The super powers shown by the psychics is great as well, as they are strong, but not so over the top that they couldn't be duplicated.I want to see Akira made into a Live Action Movie that is based on the manga. This will probably force the director to make a trilogy, but that doesn't matter: only more movie to love.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly the best movie i've seen to date,"I love this movie, I first saw it when i was very young (around 10) and Loved it to bits, i got it on tape from my brother when i was about 12 and watched it over and over (and never got sick of it) until one day i made the mistake of lending it to a friend, who's parents destroyed it because of the content - which was mighty unfair :( Since then i saw only the dubbed version on the Sci-fi channel and came to the conclusion that it was my youth that made the movie so great in my eyes, but then a few months back i borrowed the movie off a friend in its original format (the same version i had when i was younger) and i was amazed how much had been lost in the dubbing. This is once again my favourite movie, and i bought it on Dvd a couple weeks back. I absolutely love how the movie brings Neo Tokyo to life, and the skill by the voice actors and animators really made this a class film.

Akira: Genuine Anime,"To start, Akira was the first Anime movie I had ever seen. Throughout all my years, it still sticks out as the best I have yet to see.

It's full of action in unique and riveting setting, that sucks you in and will leave you in awe.One last thing, I recommend the English subtitled version if you can manage to get your grubby mitts on it, to me the dubbed version leaves something to be desired.If you haven't seen this one, then get out and treat yourself! 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Unlike a lot of N. American Sci-Fi there's no simple answer!,"AKIRA is an incredible, astonishing film. Yet, there's one thing you should know about the ending, rather the last 15 or so minutes of it. I've watched it so many times and to this day I still can't explain it to other people. I can't even explain it to myself. But don't let that keep you away from the film as it stands, in my humble opinion, as one of the greatest achievements of filmmaking in history. With an awesome cyberpunk/mutant-filled Neo-Tokyo backdrop. At the center are the inherent social problems and barriers that exist within people and government. This is timeless.There's a certain obvious truth, which lies in the film. It is the simple fact that we, as human beings, are simply not prepared. This applies to any and every aspect of our lives. The characters in the film are certainly not prepared for the things that happen to them. And this fact shows. Unlike many North American sci-fi flicks, there are no simple answers for AKIRA. It's depressing and at the same time refreshing to have an understanding that we are limited creatures. It's a harsh reality and a simple answer. For Tetsuo, the changes that he goes through tear his very mind, and humanity, apart and it's not just him.If given the unfortunate chance of suffering his same ""collision"" with destiny it would have the same effect on anyone. And no matter how much we say we would be unaffected it's all just a lie to ourselves. To Tetsuo. When Tetsuo's hallucinations begin the result is only catharsis, and rightfully so. No one would ask to be put into his situation and as the viewer we must watch the madness unfold.Don't let the fact that it's anime steer you away from this compelling, and albeit twisted tale. The detail put into the imagery and story in the film adds to the unique and realistic feel, which AKIRA possesses. And there certainly wasn't any slacking in the story of the film as we are given an often thorough explanation of the events of the past, which have affected the Neo-Tokyo. Indeed, by the end of the film I felt like I had lived in Japan of the future, that's how drawn in I was. And still am. Whenever I am given the opportunity to watch AKIRA I must put off whatever I am planning to make room for this monster of a film.If you get a hold of this flick, and it's dubbed, make sure it's the old dub with the truly gravy melodramatic voice acting by the main characters. The new version has some crummy, by comparison, dubbing that is nothing short of inferior to the original.""TETSSSUUUUOOOOOOOO!!!""""KANEDAAAAAAA!!!""What more do you need from a film, people????",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated movies ever,"this movie is probably one of the best animated movies ever, took the genre to the next level. the is one thing to keep in mind, this is an adaption of a comic book series with a detailed and complex storyline. if you watch it not knowing the comic book series you will for sure scratching your head. as an adaption the movie makers simply decided not to take too much effort making the movie enjoyable to newcomers of the story, if they would have, I think they would not have been able to make it the movie it is. the comic book is drifting in the second half of the series to much into details that blur the main issues in the story, the movie did great in putting back into focus what this all about: gang wars, arrogant technological advance not in check, political intrigues and power games, the need of people in a overcrowded super-city for something to hold on and seeking it in fanatical religious groups and so much more captured very good in a way you could compare with blade runner, but, the main theme being the friendship and growing up of kaneda and tetsuo, I cant remember a relationship of this kind being portrait so brilliantly as in this movie. try to get into this story reading at least the first half the comic books so you are familiar with the neo-Tokyo world and then lean back and enjoy one of the best scifi movies of all times!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Anime classic... kinda,"A very confusing and frankly not very interesting film.This piece is not your classic anime entertainment, instead, it is a kind of post-apocalyptic mishmash with characters that are quite well animated for the time.I remember watching this movie with my cousin, it was a boring day and we decided to watch something classic to lift our spirits.He fell asleep halfway through the movie, and I don't blame him, the movie is extremely complicated to follow and doesn't explain itself.I decided to stay to see it until the end but I could only appreciate how well animated it was, no character conveyed anything important to me and it was definitely not a memorable film.My recommendation is that if you are looking to see something fun, don't stop to see Akira because it is not the best option.It feels like it would have been a great music video because of the efficient visuals, but as a film I feel that they aspired too much but delivered little, it is not suitable for the general public.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animation Manipulation,"Akira wants to be smart, but, in truth, you'll find more detail and sophistication just by watching the first season to Transformers than here.The animation isn't that good...now I've said it, here comes the lynch mob. Most of it has dated with obvious clunky movements compared to The Rescuers Down Under (arguably the best traditionally animated film of the 90s) or even Bambi.  Come to think of it, anime is only a collaboration between Disney levels of detail with stories ranging from Heavy Metal to Ralph Bakshi in inspiration.  Of course, the goal of animation is to present the impossible by creating a universe in the mind of the artist and translating that on celluloid.For that matter, Akira is very stagnant in the visual department.  Animation has an edge in that it can explore absolutely unknown territory, but few films have actually done that.  None of Walt Disney's original work did much searching as they were focused solely on fixed artistry and construction. Only recently have animators started going around the environment to see what their world looks like.  Heavy Metal marginally did this, but I'd say Roger Rabbit helped push that idea forward.As an action movie, Akira pales next to The Killer and Die Hard because those two are a dominant benchmark for the genre.  Adrenaline requires good heroes, menacing yet credible villains and technological comprehension of some kind.  In Akira it is about faceless nobodys with toys that resemble beefed-up props from Terminator.As science fiction, Blade Runner and 2001 are more sophisticated and fluid. The dialog here, both subtitled and dubbed, is totally cornball and separated from the actual plot.  Instead of advancing the story, it divides and often contradicts our focus.  Not only is the heavy-handed message lost in the violence, but it becomes an enormous hypocrisy.  If films like this were more concerned about telling a story than blowing stuff up (or just blew stuff up and didn't try to make us think with cheap tricks) then they wouldn't be as shallow in subtexts.  Others like that include Face/Off and The Rock.Overall, if this is the best anime has to offer--doesn't look like that now with Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke getting more and more acclaim--then I'm not impressed.  Foreign film's many different tones and methods aren't too dissimilar from their American counterparts because an equal percentage of them just don't work.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Animation
The definition of POP and quality,"It is impossible not to notice right away how ""Akira"" influenced and used influences, it is impossible to say if the manga inspired the art direction of the first ""Blade Runner"" or if ""Blade Runner"" inspired the art direction of ""Akira"" , but it is livable that a baby from the source of the other, this is just an example, since innumerable other animes and films bring elements of ""akira"" such as ""Elfen Lied"" or so many others, ""Akira"" is politics, violence, vulgarity, music, action, photography, ""Akira"" is synonymous with the word POP, and one of the framers of Cyber ​​Punk culture in the East and West. ""Akira"" in two hours has a very unpleasant mission, he has to build a whole universe and still tell a story full of symbolism and subjectivity without letting the viewer get distracted, obviously he uses a lot of graphics to accomplish this task. but first of all, the basis of everything, is the script, that script is the only thing in the movie that is not perfect, she got confused, hangs, gives back, abuses ex-machine, but even so, he is extremely daring, innovative, philosophical and grandiose, perhaps even too much, contemplate the histories of Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata) and Tetsuo (Nozomu Sasaki), two friends who are forced to face each other after being brought in by metahuman power, intrigues, youth, war and society are treated in the length of Katsuhiro Otomo, from this degeneration of youth, in the best style ""Mechanical Orange"" to the end of the world. is really a screenplay that covers a lot, although you get lost a little on this long road, he knows how to develop the characters partially, incredible as it may seem, is missing some flash backs, and you have problems defining a protagonist, or even even the real function of some character, as this is not told to the viewer, just shown, it is up to whoever is watching connect the dots, and please né, the screenplay of ""Akira"" is not a head bug, the luggage that we have today, many things are easy to interpret even if the story in some points leave many ends tips open, and the end, leave the viewer completely confused, of course, unless you have read the manga, there will be a wonderful experience, but we have to give a discount, it is difficult to adapt more than 2000 thousand pages of manga in two hours of film, several characters are left out or are poorly exploited. The first thing that jumps in the eye in ""Akira"" is the beauty of the animation that is something completely timeless, recorded at I20 frames per second, something extremely advanced for the 80's, and all handmade, details, windows, shadows, the beauty of this animation is something vicarious and addictive, it is impossible not to be in love with the movements, colors, angles, details, graphics, it is really a perfect animation, that even after more than 25 years stays above the level, conquering generations, just like her soundtrack, full of voices and synthesizers she is tribal, mechanical, scary and house completely with the film always leaving the viewer glazed on the scene and sharing the emotions shown on screen.

I like action and violence!"" But the story is more deep than that. In summary: In Neo Tokyo, a boy had tests and experiments conducted on him that brought out his psychokinetic powers, enabling him to destroy buildings, armies, and even a city, like what happened many years before.

"A confusing circus of noise, blood and guts","Working in the animation industry, I'd often feel embarrassed admitting that I'd never seen Akira. ""What!?"", people would exclaim. ""Akira is like The Godfather of animation, you HAVE to see it"".Well, now that I've seen it, I'm not sure I can agree. There's no denying the sheer technical marvel of this film. It looks incredible, even by today's standards and the camera work and action sequences are so high energy. To be an animator on this film must have been both an honor and a death sentence. I think I would go insane trying to render smoke and crumbling buildings to that level.That aside, the story is an incomprehensible soup of Anime tropes. Hyper macho violence, loud screaming, casual misogyny and high falutin philosophical mumbo jumbo about higher beings.
Things happen in disconnected bursts: Biker gang - Authorities - Revolutionaries - Corporate corruption - Weird wrinkly green kids - Telekinesis - Sciencey stuff - Explosions - Fighting - Explosions - More fighting - Super Telekenisis - Amoebas(?) - The world explodes...blah blah...- End credits.There's no time to absorb the characters, no attempt to make them feel like real people. We're always being rushed to the next brutal action sequence and not really given enough information to know what's happening, who's doing it and why?

"It's great, it really is, but Ninja Scroll is the best anime ever","Akira was my intro to the world of anime back in'89.

It's an incredible piece of art, but I've only seen the dubbed version and it's a little difficult to comprehend just what in the hell is going on, even after multiple viewings. This movie is similar to David Lynch's Lost Highway, where just when you think you have a valid explanation of the film, you pull your hair out when you realize that you've left out one detail that brings the structure of your overall grasp of it crashing down. That's why I'm not even trying to explain the film. I've seen it God knows how many times and I still can't grasp it completely. Akira has just been announced for DVD, so I'll hopefully be able to watch it in the Japanese language with English subtitles and explain it afterward, since this tends to be the most accurate way to watch these movies. It definitely oozes style and the animation does surpass anything that Disney's put out (except Tarzan, which is incredible in it's own right) and yes, the music is amazing.

Anime Classic,"Akira is another film that I saw prior to this class. This movie is definitely a masterpiece, although, I didn't enjoy it as much I wanted to. Everything about it is handled very well and yet it left me wishing I had more thoughts about it. The animation is exceptional, and the story is very engaging and interesting. My favorite part about this movie however, is the world. I love the cyberpunk aesthetic, and Akira is one of it's original pioneers. The art that makes up the backdrops is jaw-dropping, and I love the way Katsuhiro Otomo portrayed this futuristic and dystopian world. I love the mature themes and gore that wasn't typical of this genre, making this world feel grotesque and disturbed. This movie inspired so many others but amidst that, I still prefer to watch Ghost in the Shell (1995) or the Cowboy Bebop Movie (2001). Both are mature Japanese anime films, that were likely inspired by this film, and yet I feel more connections and intrigue with those rather than Akira. I still really like this movie, but it didn't leave the mark on me that I anticipated. It definitely deserves its cult classic status, its art and action are amazing, and it's influence alone is enough to give it this status. It's an anime classic that I'm aware millions love. For some reason though, it doesn't resonate with me as much as I wanted it to. I love it for the fact that it caused the creation of so many other mature anime classics, but as a film, I don't see myself rewatching it as much as other anime films.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"One of the greatest animated films ever made, but SEE IT SUBBED!","I'm really getting sick of this film being tossed off by critics as ""visually impressive, but too confusing"". Or by people who haven't seen referring to it as ""that gory anime sci-fi movie"".  Nobody regards it as what it is: a modern masterpiece.The first time I saw it, I had never seen anime before. This was a new experience and I loved it. It was dubbed, and it was edited for television, yet I was still awestruck by the entire film. I watched it 2 or 3 more times in this incarnation, but I couldn't understand a thing that went on, and forgot about it. About a year later I saw it subbed, and it was like a whole new movie: there was much more emotional depth, and the translation was better so I immediately understood the whole movie! I can't believe how badly the dubbed version butchers the experience...not as bad as what we did to ""Nausicaa"", but pretty close. In the dubbed version Kaneda sounds like a robot,  and the Colonel is permanently growling. In the subbed version the Colonel emerges as probably my favorite character in the movie: the only voice of reason in a city run by corrupt politicians. The scene in which he is ordered to relinquish command, but instead orders his men to kill the messenger because ""we're all going to die soon anyway"" is very moving. I've now seen the film countless times in its subbed incarnation, and every time I am swept up in it, almost hynotized by the beautiful images before me.My one and only complaint is the beginning, with the gang war: it's just too...generic. I've lent the film to friends who didn't watch past the first part, because they thought it was too much like ""typical"" anime, and I had to force them to watch the rest (of course they loved it). It just doesn't even hint at the beauty and epic sweep of the rest of the movie.The film is also remarkable from a filmmaking perpective, and I don't just mean the animation. The use of dissolves followed by quick cuts are very inventive and effective, as are the various perfect transitions. And best of all the music adds to the film on many different levels. Image and sound play off each other to the point where I couldn't imagine the film without it. The flashback scenes all have an extremely washed-out color palette, where everything is brighter, perfectly evoking a more innocent time. And the film is packed with indelible images. My personal favorite is in the aftermath of Tetsuo's first major attack, when it's at dusk and pieces of the SOL are raining down on earth, Tetsuo's body sihouetted against the sky.I will love this film forever, and though some people say it's a Blade Runner rip-off, I say Akira is better than Blade Runner in every way possible. Katushiro Otomo is one of the best and most innovative directors in the world, let alone animation directors. And he's not a one-movie fluke either...watch a fansub of Memories and be prepared to be wowed all over again. It may take a while, but one of these days people will wake up to Otomo's genious.",,Anonymous,Animation
a brilliant movie,"Akira, was one of the first Japanese animation films I came across. I think this is how it is for a lot of people in America because it is one of the only Japanese animation films available in common video rental stores. I found it on a bottom shelf on VHS, but it really deserves better acclaim. It can never hurt to go back to the classics, and this is a classic. for nothing else, this movie would merit applause simply because of the quality of animation. I have never come across an anime with a better sense of movement! the way the character mounts his bike, or the way their bodies move, its all so fluid. Not to mention the soundtrack! though I agree, if you watch it you should watch it in the original Japanese. (I saw the English dub first and liked it.) But once you see the movie in original Japanese there is no comparison! this is an absolutely incredible anime! It is a perfect combination of art, gore, government conspiracy, and psychological thrill ride to keep you coming back to this wonderful classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Complex, unusual film","The first time I saw Akira (on dubbed, pan & scan VHS) I was very disappointed.  I had pretty much misunderstood the entire film and sat in stunned disbelief as the end credits began to roll.  Having been familiar with various animes, such as Ghost in the Shell and Wings of Honneamise, for a long time, I just couldn't believe that THIS was the classic everyone was talking about.I now know better.  Akira is like the anime 2001; you just don't get it the first time around.  Look at the explosion we see at the beginning of the film, for instance--despite the initial reaction you'll probably have, that isn't a nuclear weapon of any kind.  It's something much, much different, and the only clues we have as to what it really is turn up towards the very end of the movie.  Because of stuff like that, Akira is a demanding, obtuse film that really requires a lot of work on the part of the viewer, and the funny thing is that it doesn't have nearly as much gore or nudity as one might expect.The story has its flaws.  Writer-director Katsuhiro Otomo was faced with the seemingly impossible task of compressing his 38-issue (I think) manga series into a two-hour film, in a way that would please both fans of the comics and Akira newcomers.  As a result I think there are too many characters and subplots swirling around.  Personally I would have liked the film much better if Otomo had left out all the confusion with the corrupt parliament and the underground resistance movement, and focused more on the complex relationship between Tetsuo and Kaneda.  The movie's greatest story strengths are the statements it makes about friendship and teenage violence, and most of the other plot elements made sense in the manga but aren't really necessary here.But in the final analysis, Akira is an intelligent and provocative film that deserves its cult classic status.  And it need hardly be said that the English dub is pure garbage compared to the Japanese version with subtitles. Watch it, and then watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of a kind Anime,"This was one of those movies that I haven't watched but know because of the memes and references. I finally got to see this movie recently and learned why people have been referencing it for decades. Personally, I was shocked to learn who Akira is since I always thought that the guy on the red bike was Akira. I think a lot of people made the same assumption considering how the iconic bike slide is widely known as the ""Akira slide"".The animation of this movie was great as I expected but what caught my attention more was the soundtrack. I found it strange at first to hear a track that sounded like a piece of rural folk music in the story set in the futuristic dystopian city of Tokyo. As an individual born and raised in Japan, the music struck me with a sense of nostalgia, like being at a traditional Japanese festival, while also hitting me with a mysterious feeling of being in a foreign land. Moreover, the style of music reminded me of the soundtracks in another cyberpunk anime movie, ""Ghost in the Shell."" It's interesting how both of these films use traditional style music in a futuristic metropolis setting. Considering how the two movies deal with philosophical themes at their core, I feel that the music emphasizes the fundamental human spirit that connects us to the past and the future. Anyways, I am now oddly addicted to the unique music along with the bike actions of this movie...",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure Classic,"One of the indisputable gold standards of Japanese animation, Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira - adapted from his own manga - tackles the socioeconomic effects of war and the dangers of atomic power.The animation is beautiful and very detailed with a wide range of colors that are extraordinary to watch, and the score was phenomenal, it stirred many emotions inside of me. Just like the storytelling that was thrilling, shocking and heart-breaking did, likewise with the use of sound, the silence was even more haunting and intense than those scenes with sound, the excellent dialogue, characters that are developed so well(for a character-driven film you'd expect that, the main characters' conflict is especially well done) that you do root for them and a message that I highly appreciate and don't feel it's over-didactic.Akira works on several levels as a straight-ahead sci-fi blast, a teen's gone wild adventure or an intellectual sci-fi posing many questions. Note that in order to totally understand the ending, I would recommend you read the Manga. The anime was made before Manga could be completed and so, the Anime is not in-depth as in manga.All in all, amazing, a real landmark for not only anime but also animation in general.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is an all time great anime picture that is a masterpiece and absolutely must see,"Akira (1988) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again with my daughter on Tubi.

Not the movie everyone thinks it is,"I've learned to love this film, but it shocks me that such a loyal cult following has sprung up around it.  It's not an easy movie to watch-- the story meanders between many different interlocking plot threads (personally, I find the sections dealing with the underground resistance movement to be boring and needlessly complicated).  At its core, though, it's a story about a biker, Tetsuo Shima, who suffers from an inferiority complex and lives in a self-imposed cloud of low self-esteem; when Tetsuo gains psychic powers after the government experiments on his brain, he uses his new-found abilities to take revenge against a world that rejected and scorned him as a child.  ""Akira"" disguises itself as a big crazy science fiction movie, but it's really about the Columbine syndrome, how some misguided young people can only escape their self-imposed feelings of isolation through violence against the supposedly happier, more 'accepted' people they see and envy every day.  A fascinating film that absolutely demands multiple viewings, and one of the most rewarding movies ever made (if you understand it).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Akiraaaaaaaah!!!,"I have to admit that when I first rented this movie out in 1990, I watched it about 5 times before I returned it. 5 times in 2 days. I'd love to say that it was because of the thoughtful characterisation or the deep and intriguing plot but I'd be lying. I watched it over an over again because I had never seen anything like it before.I now own ""Akira"" on DVD and I sometimes catch myself scanning certain scenes frame-by-frame, just to see how they would have looked to the Japanese animators who built the story sketch-by-sketch. OK, you could do the same thing with ""Bambi"" if you wanted to, but ""Akira"" is no Disney cartoon.Even when Bambi's mum got shot, you never got to see any blood in Disney cartoons. ""Akira"" has blood. ""Akira"" has violence. ""Akira"" is literally a moving sci-fi comic book. Today you could turn it into a live-action CGI-packed blockbuster, but in 1988 the only way to make a movie like ""Akira"" was with conventional animation. The resulting film is visually spectacular.The Neo-Tokyo cityscapes in ""Akira"" have sometimes been compared to those of the ""Blade Runner"" version of Los Angeles. This is more due to the ""Blade Runner"" set designers basing their vision on Tokyo circa 1982 than the later movie copying ""Blade Runner"". Both movies take a dystopian view of the future, but the genetically-engineered nightmare of ""Akira"" has a uniquely Japanese perspective.This means that it's not a movie for everyone. Mark Stephen Johnson, however, has watched ""Akira"" as many times as I have. In Johnson's 2003 live-action movie ""Daredevil"", there is a blatant copy of the sequence where Kaneda runs headlong at an advancing Clown gang member riding a motorcycle. Kaneda then jumps onto the front of the bike and kicks the Clown out of the saddle. DareDevil does exactly the same thing to Bullseye, shot-for shot in Johnson's movie.

"A strong classic SciFi plot, but the technicalities don't really impress me","The movie presents one of the classic plot line of Modern SciFi, the emergence and rise of a superhuman power. It also develops like all the rest of its sub genre, having the powers develop into something wild, uncontrollable by the wielder, and then wreak havoc on an epic scale. Looking at the release time frame, I think it's possible that this movie actually influences many of the sub genre movies. Thus the plot line may be considered one of the classics. But I really don't see wealth of enjoyment in looking at the technicalities. Despite the world setting is carefully built, it doesn't really seem to be explored so much in the movie. The movie's coloration choice of having few contrasting colors makes it boring if only the the story is not that strong. The emotions depicted are also quite hyperbolic as characters show disgruntled faces all too often. The vice acting is as usual the standard Japanese hyperbolic where characters shout overly at all things.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great...,"AKIRA is in the TOP10 greatest works of art I've made. It's so great it makes me change, not just rearrange but change..this shocking with it's realism and purity animation joining the powerful screenplay creates the thing I call art - high social work of the creative activity of the human. This movie is not only aesthetic delight but a work that provokes me to think in a different way, a way expressing the meaning of life in a wholly new but still right way. I really started seeing that human possesses all the energy inside and all he has to do is to find the right, the truthful way of using it. All you have to do is make a choice, when ready, and follow it. I do think AKIRA is a work of art that shows the beginning of a new era..something that can create and destroy... something that possesses the energy of the ""new world""... though we are far from it we see it coming to life... we watch (but not all of us see) the changing of the world!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Tetsuooooooo!    The most depth-charged film ever created.,"In Walt Disney's groundbreaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, the villain is an evil sorceress and the heroes are seven `funny' dwarves and a beautiful woman who sings to cute animals while sitting under a tree. In Katsuhiro Ôtomo's groundbreaking AKIRA, the villain is a corrupt government and the heroes are `terrorist' revolutionaries and amphetamine-addicted biker gangs who hit rival gang members in the head with ratchets at 140 km/h. Sound different Disney lovers? Well it is. It is very different.This ultra-violent and dark vision was brought to life in 1988 by creative genius Katsuhiro Ôtomo. It was the most expensive Japanese film at that time and it became the all-time anime classic. The only film ever made that truly defines its genre.The story of the film is as follows: In post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo, a biker gang member named Tetsuo has mysterious powers ""awakened"" inside of him and goes out to find Akira, the one who gave him his power.Not as simple and straightforward as you think (or wish). Many filmgoers complain that AKIRA makes no sense and never goes anywhere. Here is what I have to say to them, ""Read the manga.' The manga is over 2,000 pages long while the movie clocks in without end credits at 122 minutes. And if you watch it several times it actually makes perfect sense.The most mind-blowing aspect of the film is it's ""organic"" music. Recorded before a frame of animation was finished, the music sounds absolutely stunning and fits the images on screen almost perfectly.Another stunner is the animation. The only CG used is in the comparison of Akira and Tetsuo's power (the glowing hologram). The cel animation looks unbelievably realistic even today and the introduction of Kaneda's gang is a real eye-opener.Warner Bros. is apparently trying to remake the film as an animated movie. Let's hope they fail, because the only time this movie should have been ""upgraded"" was in 2001 when Pioneer released their great remastered edition.With it's ultra-violent kinetic real-time action, mind-blowing visual designs, and complex story, AKIRA made my top 150 list at number 4.

"Technically very good, but so confusing that it doesn't work.","I'm 33 years old and my childhood saw the popularization of Japanese anime in Europe and the West thanks to hits like ""Dragon Ball"" and others. However, I have to say that, even as a child, I hated this type of highly stylized animation, so different from what I was used to seeing.Even so, it is necessary to grant this film some value. The animation it brings us is of excellent quality and very well designed, and the perfectionism typical of Easterners is clearly evident in the attention given to the smallest details, scene by scene. As has been the hallmark of modern anime, it has a lot of action and moves in a futuristic, dream-like environment, much to the liking of the Japanese. In fact, it is quite remarkable that they are a people so attentive to the future and so respectful of their own traditions and their past... a good example of how both things are not incompatible, quite the contrary, a sign that we can build the future without cut with the past.The problem with this film is that, until now, I haven't been able to understand the story. It's confusing, and the feeling I got is that the creators focused so much on the action and technical execution of the drawings that they totally forgot to do all of this based on a logical story, capable of being followed without difficulty.

One of the greatest achievements in anime.,"I have been interested in Japanese animation since I was a small child. Shows like Thundercats and Gundam introduced me to anime (Japanese animation). However, as I grew older I began to slowly become less interested in anime of that kind. One day I was going through my old toy collection when I found one of my Gundam action figures and I remembered how much I liked those shows. At that point, I became more and more interested in trying to find an anime film that is made for a more mature audience. I went out to look for that kind of movie one night and found Akira. At first I had little interest because of the cover (Kaneda walking up to his motorcycle). There weren't many other options, however, so I decided to go for it. That night I once again became hooked on anime. The animation of Akira is simply breathtaking, and the plot is so involving; many adults will have to think about the ending for a few hours to clear everything up. I will not hesitate to say that some people will be turned off by the intense violence of Akira, and many will be disturbed by the powerful story about two friends being torn apart by a force that no one can control. You absolutely must have an imagination while you are watching this film. Anyone who approaches Akira without an open mind will be disappointed and confused. This film was the beginning of an incredible genre including great movies like ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Ninja Scroll"", ""Perfect Blue"", and ""Princess Mononoke"".

Great Movie!,"Akira is one of the most acclaimed animated films which changed the face of the animated films. This cyberpunk thriller is the work of its director Katsuhiro Otomo, who also wrote the script based on his own manga, and this is a rough, visually vibrant tale about power, revolution, and people. This science fiction movie was released in the year 1988 and its plot takes place in a fictional city called Neo-Tokyo which is actually representative of Tokyo in the future. The story is about Kaneda, a delinquent motorcycle gang leader, and his friend Tetsuo, a character who acquires psychotic abilities after a certain event. The plot is very engaging, it has political conspiracy, character feud, and plot twists. This is a very rich narrative that doesn't unfold linearly and thus requires the viewer's focus to grasp its tiers fully. The animation is amazing, even with today's technology. Each scene is jam-packed with information, whether it is the lights of the city or the fight scenes. The flow of movement and the palette of colors give a real feel of the dystopian future of Neo-Tokyo. It is quite impressive how much attention to detail was put into this film which is why Akira is like a cinematic masterpiece.Another great aspect of the film is the music which was scored by Geinoh Yamashirogumi. The use of traditional Japanese music and futuristic electronica gives the right mood for the film and adds tension and emotional impact to every scene. What makes Akira so great is that it has depth. It's not only entertaining and full of action and has beautiful visuals, but it's also a philosophical piece about human beings' dreams, science, and the tragedies that come with its, power. It is a movie still applicable today despite the fact that it was released quite some years ago. Akira is not an anime as simple as it seems; it is an icon and a great work in the field of cinema. If you love animation, sci-fi movies, or deep meaningful movies then this is one movie you should watch. This is a fierce and inspiring piece that makes a lasting impact.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I'm speechless.,"Ahh, the elusive 10/10 (aka 5/5 or 4 stars etc) given to something typically for being perfect. But what about something flawed at times, but yet so transcendently glorious at other moments that it seems to deserve the 10 as well. If a case can be made for the later (and I do think it can) then the extant corpus of Catullus and AKIRA certainly fall into that category.This movie was often breathtakingly brilliant and beautiful. It also portrayed it's themes in a sort of muddled vague sense..go figure. At first I thought meaning was lost in the translation. But look at a film like mononoke. Nothing lost there. Anyhow. I was moved. But maybe I'm a sucker for sci-fi.What.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the weaker anime films,"Well before watching Akira I had at least sine expectations. I thought it would be a great anime like most of the others. Unfortunately this time I got disapointed.The story is boring, the pacing is terrible and some animations are so over the top that I wonder what this movie want to express.The science fiction setting does not help at all. I felt nothing for the world presented me.The only positive thing about Akira is it's solid animation and the great use of brutality. However this should not be enough to get someone watching this movie. There are great anime films but this is not one of them.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Adult anime that changes the anime view of the world.,"""Akira"" by Katsuhiro Otomoto is the most expensive animated film ever made in Japan (over 1 billion yen). The film is set in 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, 31 years after World War III. Packs of cyberpunks on motorcycles race through the streets, engaging in deadly jousts. One pack, led by Kaneda, has a run-in with Takashi, a physically crippled but telekinetically charged child. Tetsuo's abilities spiral out of control, and he becomes the focal point of a conflict between oppressive authorities and resistance groups. ""Akira"" is a bold animated film that can be interpreted as a parable about scientific responsibility and cosmic rebirth, or simply as an action-packed serial.There are several ""Scanners""-style showdowns, ""Altered States""-style hallucinations, and none of the usual comic relief found in cartoons. The detail is astonishingly realistic, fluid, and multidimensional, evoking both a futuristic world and ancient quests.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
this is one mind-blowing movie,"When I saw this movie a couple weeks ago, it absolutely blew my mind. The animation was really amazing. Seriously, Japanese people can make some damn good cartoons. The action in this movie is more exciting than in many live-action movies, such as the crappy Men In Black II. But the story is what I liked best about the movie. I thought it was a completely original, thought-provoking story and that's something I love in a movie.

Pioneer of its time but...,"This movie is very nicely animated, so much that even in 2018 it's still looking quite good, but honestly... without any nostalgia towards this since I just learned about the movie I didn't like it very much.The plot is in my opinion weak, maybe a 5 or 6 out of 10, but what made this movie really boring for me was the fact that I didn't care for ANY of the characters, not even a side character. I think everyone has those movies where they just can't identify with any character or just don't like the characters.There is not much else to say, there's not too much music but when there it is really good.

A Classic Anime Masterpiece,"Wow. OK so I'm a big anime fan, and I've always heard of this when the greatest anime movies were listed. It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed.Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it.It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater)Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just plain bad,"As an avid anime watcher, this movie was shockingly disappointing after the numerous claims saying it's a masterpiece.In short, the animation looked awful (not surprising when considering the release of the film), the characters designs are either bland or just downright ugly, and the 'motion' wasn't smooth at all.As for the characters themselves, they were all very unrealistic and their dialogue with other characters was comically bad. We weren't really given a reason to care about anyone and I have a hard time remembering any remotely interesting characteristics of anyone, or what motivated them.Finally, the plot was a mess. Nothing was explained properly and it felt like several unrelated storylines that someone tried to connect together without much success.So, surprisingly, this turned out to be one of the worst films I've ever seen and I wish that was an exaggeration.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
30 years later and it's still incredible,"Akira is a film that proves animation doesn't need to be confined to preexisting genre conventions. Atom-slicingly sharp social critique in a futuristic biker movie would be enough to make an all-time great film, but to throw in psychic powers and a blistering deconstruction of superhero tropes with animation on par with or exceeding present-day Pixar in terms of technical skill AND inventiveness? It's almost too wild for me to handle.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very inspirational,"Okay, so this is considered one of the best anime of all time. Well clearly that is a stretch due to a human's preference, but nobody can deny that this is the most influential anime to hit the western hemisphere.To start off I watched the 2001 English dub version because Johnny Yong Bosch did the voice for Kaneda (I love Johnny). The voice acting was terrific and it was very powerful. The setting was beautiful, you really felt like you were involved in their struggle. The story was awesome until... you learned more about Tetsuo's condition.I don't know if I'm crazy, but I really felt like the story all went down hill whenever Kaneda finally found Tetsuo in the lab/hospital place. The story was far more interesting whenever you were kind of confused and didn't know exactly what was going on.The beginning of the film is so epic, it's beyond words. The introduction of The Capsules (the bike gang led by the protagonist, Kaneda) is just spectacular and I honestly feel like they had a better story with the bike gang as a whole, but instead the story went completely sci-fi and way over the top.In conclusion, this is definitely a must see. It is very inspirational and nothing is held back from hitting the screen. It is very mature with the inclusion of loads of blood, death, language and even somewhat of a rape scene. If you have not seen this, WATCH IT NOW!I rated a 7/10 because I was more interested in the bike gang and Kaneda more than I was Tetsuo and his condition. Kaneda is a much better character and he should of had more time on the screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply too important to miss.,"Probably one of the most claustrophobically dark and atmospheric anime films out there, Akira is also an incredibly important movie. First of all, the back-story and the politics would lose a tremendous amount of impact if not for the chilling darkness, and the perpetual ""end of the line"" environment that these teenagers live in. This dark depiction is owed largely to William Gibson and his invention of the ""cyberpunk"" (""high tech, low life"") environment; towering, pristine skyscrapers lit up like plastic Christmas trees, and cracked pavements and old, dilapidated buildings left to rot in the 20th Century, it simply adds marvellous tone to the film.And the back-story itself? Seamlessly interwoven flashback scenes not only reveal a lot more about the characters' histories with each other, but the white, washed-out optics and the dreamy tone make it seem like a world away, and thus we are left with one window to light and innocence in this dark, coming of age tale. Teenagers fighting for themselves in gangs, teenagers subjected to psychic experiments, all paint a tragic picture. A brilliant picture at that. A picture that has influenced other favourites of mine, such as The Matrix.My qualms are that, whilst it remains an influential piece of work, there are better anime (the Ghost In The Shell franchise has consistently delivered 10 out of 10 perfection, for instance, well, save the first film) and there are less confusing, more rewarding ones. The story can seem a bit unreal at times; the pacing often throws the film into an intangible realm which the viewer can not understand with flashback after dream sequence and so on; the dark atmosphere sometimes throws off the reader from the plot itself.A marvellous film, nonetheless, only shy of a perfect 10 due to a slightly confusing presentation of plot and often counterproductive pacing that doesn't focus as much on plot as we should do. This does little to cloud the fact that this piece is an artful depiction of a high tech, low life environment, with credible characters and realistic dialogue.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie took me in right at the start,"Got to say, when I heard that the movie was known for being extremely detailed, I have to agree. You can pause at all scenes and try to take in every detail. Yet it doesn't become too detailed, just animated enough for the characters to not look off-putting. It may have helped make the viewers' reactions more real, especially during the infamous body horror scenes that happened later in the movie. So small warning, if you have never heard of this movie and want to watch it, prepare for a few nasty sights. Anyway, some moments destroy the immersion. One would be the principal slapping the boys while yelling out ""discipline"" multiple times. Another is a friend having blood gush out of his smiling mouth as the characters walk out of school. But they are few and far between enough to overlook. It is an anime after all.The movie had a strong opening, with the gunfires and the explosion that happened at the beginning of the movie. That, along with the great music and sound effects, takes you in and makes you excited to see what is the cause behind the explosion. And got to say, it was well worth the wait. Gosh, the plot. I had such a fun time watching the characters try to find their friend and seeing the mass power of the psychics. Especially with Tetsuo when he lays destruction across the hospital and then the city, especially after he puts on that red cape.Another thing that makes it so immersive is its world-building. It doesn't try to shove information about the world through telling, and even when it does tell, it does in ways that feel natural, like the news and meetings. One effective example was early in the movie. A guy shot a security dog chasing him on a very crowded road, with one child inside a nearby car watching with horror. That gave me quite a reaction, especially for the kid. All the information makes you want to learn more about what it's like in there. In fact, maybe so detailed that it gets hard to follow sometimes, especially with the science of how the characters' powers work. I had to dig into a few wikis to make sense of them.Still, the movie made up for it in its characters as well. They have quite the depth and intrigue that you want to keep wanting the best for them. Tetsuo, who has endured a lifetime of bullying, desires to shed his weakness. In contrast, the colonel's role is to keep the government and military in check, despite their corruption. A few others not so much. One way to paraphrase the sentence is: Kaori, Tetsuo's girlfriend, is one of the few people who understands him. However, since she didn't have many lines and we don't see Tetsuo's reaction to her fate, it's hard to fully grasp their relationship. Another is Kaneda, the main character himself, since it is hard to be interested in him when he's surrounded by much more powerful and colorful characters, even when he's a badass in his own right for standing up against Tetsuo.So this is quite an interesting watch, so I can see why this movie is so iconic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Stunning animation, Japanese or otherwise","As a peripheral fan of Japanese animation, I somehow avoided seeing this movie until recently.  Being disenchanted with the genre in general since it really blew up in the last couple of years, I was pleasantly surprised. This movie's reputation as a classic is well-deserved.  I found myself wanting to watch it again the next day, something that really suprised me. The animation is so smooth and pleasurable to watch in some sequences, even when disgusting things are happening (there is some gore in this).  I wonder how they acheived this technique.  There's a more human story here than in Ghost in the Shell, and I liked this subtitled version of Akira better than the dubbed version of Ghost in the Shell.The story here is not terribly important, but the characters are interesting, their faces are wonderfully expressive, and the images are unforgettable.  The last 30 minutes or so will blow you away.At least a couple very striking similarities to Blade Runner-  the music (especially in the opening scenes), the golden buildings and the punks in the street.  And I thought the ""milk"", or whatever it was, spewing out of the giant stuffed animals was inspired by the demise of Ash in Scott's Alien, as perhaps the ""cloak"" scene in Ghost in the Shell was inspired by Predator.  To me, such touches aren't ""rip-offs"" but a sign of respect for the films and their creators.  They're put to good effect in both movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic,"I first saw 'Akira' a little over ten years ago.  Like many others, it was my first exposure to Japanese animation (not counting television series like Robotech and Speed Racer).  Over the years, my perception of this film has changed.  What I once saw as simply a quirky yet elegantly ""animated film"" is now a classic in the genre of science fiction.  The film has aged very well.  I sometimes have to remind myself that it is almost 15 years old!In my opinion this film deserves to be mentioned in the same breath along with other genre masterpieces like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' 'Blade Runner,' and 'Brazil.'

Anime at its finest,"When I first saw Akira, I was new to the anime scene.

Right from the beginning of the movie you are thrown head first into a Blade Runner like world of future Tokyo.  This film is extremely violent.  It is not just a cartoon; certainly not anything you would want to show your kids.  Its grittiness makes it more real and adds to the fact that this is a bleak distopia that the Japanese now live in.  Although action or sci-fi enthusiasts would enjoy this film for what it offers them, the film's message would escape someone just watching it for the gore factor.

Essential Anime,"Akira is the epitome of anime:  uber-violent, complicated, and, especially for us western viewers, cryptic and difficult to decipher.  Of course, it also features an end-all, kick-in-the-head, apocalyptic ending from hell that should remain with you for quite a while.  To put it in terms of American movies, Akira is essentially an ultra-violent Blade Runner ingrained with heavily Japanese subtexts (search for identity, suffocation from the urban sprawl, fascism, atomic destruction) and with some 2001-tinged metaphysics thrown in at the end for good measure (and to confuse most viewers even more).  It's all too sprawling and unfocused to be real a classic, but Akira still remains as one of the most, albeit sporadically, impactful sci-fi/action movies ever made.  It also set the mold for just about every sci-fi anime made since, though it would be 13 years before Rin's ""Metropolis"" (2001) came along and finally turned the disparate elements of sci-fi anime into a truly excellent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
When Power Goes to the Head,"In an off-limits area of new Tokyo and the aftermath of World War III, a secret government project known as Akira is unraveling and a freakish stage of evolution is occurring. Rival motorcycle gangs, military special forces units, scientists, rebels and odd kids with supernatural powers, are among the groups clashing. Orders are to kill what cannot be controlled, yet few are in control of themselves. Into the void steps motorcycle gang leader Kaneda, a noble outlaw in the tradition of Mad Max, Motoko Kusanagi and Han Solo, to attempt to tie up loose ends.
 
This timeless, complex and thrilling animation masterpiece is as action packed as it is food for the brain. It is a typical Japanese dish; the artistry, attention to detail and manner in which it is prepared and served are as important as the taste. No corners are cut. To look away, even for a moment, means missing an essential part of the multi-faceted story. Akira is delicious for eyes, ears, brain and heart alike. After 30 years it aged well.
 
Akira revolves around questions of balance; those who absorb power without thought or principle, and those too cowardly to act. Decisions are made for those who do not make them on their own. The only foolish questions are those that are unasked.For a deeper experience, listen to the film in Japanese.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
How could anyone not love this film?,"This film is the most powerful, thought provoking titles to ever be realised.

Akira has the ideas and foundations, and due to the animation it can achieve it's full potential and does.  With no characters who are fully good or fully bad, it is easy to relate and understand to each situation, whether we have experienced them ourselves or not.  The pure idea of Akira is powerful enough, but to create the film with such an impact as this has is one hell of a task and one that should be credited fully.  This film is abosolutely flawless.

Information Overload...,"The first 15 minutes of Akira is a beutiful example of one of the main themes of the film. Information overload.

The film always captivates its audience, they never want to look away.Perhaps this is because of the beautiful animation, or the original story. Essentially the film isn't perfect. The plot is rather complex, with so many characters and stories running around, it doesn't allow enough time to flesh out all the characters. And the story, while deep and interesting, doesn't really touch on all the issues as much as it should, leaving the film with a few loose ends. But then again one can't help but feel that this is intentional, as the fundamental theme of the film is information overload. The tag line says that Neo Tokyo is about to E.X.P.L.O.D.E. and one believes that!It is by no means one of the greatest movies, but it is a great movie, and one of the best manga's out there.

Excellent action/sci fi film,"Akira is one of the most important films in the history of Japanese animation. Mainly because it broke new ground in making an adult, extremely violent and visually stunning film that greatly influenced the design and themes of later anime films. However, I do not think this film is among the greatest anime films of all time, I think that Miyazaki alone made about 6-7 films superior to this one. That's because I did not find the characters and the plot as engaging. The level of emotional deepness is not comparable to Miyzaki's output, also, the soundtrack is not as ""great"" as well. It was an excellent, but flawed movie, like Citizen Kane, which I watched in the same day.The animation has a flowing quality like no other anime film I ever saw. And the story is interesting, basically about government funded research on the manipulation of an a semi-mystical ethereal quality that living beings have with the purpose of producing ""super humans"", probably for military use. It's said that the first time such attempt had been tried in 1988, a world war followed due to the awakening power, which had destroyed the massive city of Tokyo. The film is set in ""the future"", 2019, when another awakening is occurring. Basically, havoc happens and we are for a treat of awesomeness.It's an excellent action/science fiction film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Landmark achievement in animation,"Katsuhiro Otomo's 1988 masterpiece, Akira, is a cyberpunk anime film that has left an indelible mark on the genre and animation as a whole. Set in Neo-Tokyo, a futuristic city scarred by a devastating World War III, the film follows two biker gang leaders, Kaneda and Tetsuo, whose lives become intertwined with a secret government project involving psychic powers.The film's visual style is nothing short of breathtaking. The intricate hand-drawn animation, coupled with vibrant colors and dynamic camera work, creates a visually stunning and immersive experience. The futuristic cityscape of Neo-Tokyo is meticulously detailed, capturing the grimy underbelly of the city while showcasing its towering skyscrapers and advanced technology. The action sequences are equally impressive, with fluid choreography and innovative camera angles that bring the chaos and intensity to life.The story, adapted from the manga series of the same name, is a complex and thought-provoking exploration of themes such as government conspiracy, the dangers of unchecked power, and the consequences of scientific experimentation. The characters are well-developed and relatable, each grappling with their own personal struggles and desires. Kaneda, the stoic and loyal leader, and Tetsuo, the troubled and conflicted anti-hero, are particularly compelling figures who drive the narrative forward.The film's soundtrack is equally impressive, featuring a blend of electronic and orchestral music that perfectly complements the on-screen action and atmosphere. The iconic opening sequence, set to the pulsating beat of ""Kaneda,"" is a testament to the film's ability to blend music and visuals seamlessly.While Akira is undeniably a masterpiece of animation and storytelling, it's not without its flaws. The pacing can be uneven at times, and some of the plot points may feel convoluted or rushed. Additionally, the film's graphic violence and mature themes may not be suitable for all audiences.Despite these minor shortcomings, Akira remains a landmark achievement in anime and a must-watch for fans of the genre and anyone interested in visually stunning and thought-provoking cinema. Its influence can be seen in countless films and video games, and its legacy continues to inspire creators to push the boundaries of animation and storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Big expectations, big disappointment","First of all I must admit that I did not read the Manga or knew anything about the details of it and had to try and collect my information solely from the film.
Saying that, I was amazed by the details of the graphics and tried to understand the hidden meaning of the film on-the-fly... but... I did not.
I came to the film with great expectations and waited for the right moment where everything will be understood... but... it did not.
I also MUST ADMIT that my review is from a 35-year-old adult, so it's difficult for me to come with a 10-year-old viewer, but at least I don't have a nostalgic-biasy.
I am disappointed from the film by a whole. I think that a movie should give even for a new viewer an understanding of the plot rather than needing to see it a few times for understanding it.
I already understand that there is a large and devoted audience for that movie but THEY need to understand that because the PERSPECTIVE of the viewer is important so that a review of a lower score is also necessary. If the movie would've been enjoying for everyone then it would've got an even higher score.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece.,"Akira is arguably the most influential anime to have entered the western world and despite its flaws it manages to hold up as the defining example of adult animation. The vast scale of the Akira manga was never going to fit into a feature film because it's just too big, but this film does an incredible job of representing the story in all of its spiritual and stylistic traits. The animation is literally flawless and in terms of detail and intricacy is unmatched in anything else I have seen. The story is one of mystery, basically centring around the weary and emotional friendship that Kaneda and Tetsuo share. The bigger picture however focuses on the government and revolution, exploring themes of control and modern science. You leave asking more questions about our modern world than about the film itself. Another impressive element of Akira would be the soundtrack; the ferocious and bizarre music binds the film together and really intensifies the opening scenes when the bike gangs are roaming Neo-Tokyo, the most spectacular sequence in the film in my opinion. Akira may require multiple viewing after you first watch it but is definitely worth your patience. One of my criticisms of the film would be that we don't see enough of an on screen friendship between Kaneda and Tetsuo to feel too emotionally sympathetic toward them. Overall it stands still 25 years since release as the most impressive body of work in adult animation anywhere in the world, an iconic and influential movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Signature animé,"With its lightning pace, smooth animation, and character insight, I found Akira thoroughly engrossing. It tells us about the corrupting influence of power, and what happens when science takes that very power too far (reminiscent of The Terminator). Although ""Akira"" is largely remembered for its generous amounts of gore, it is not mindlessly Hollywood-style - it seems to be there for a reason.However, one may find the plot a little confusing at times, especially the ending. This is probably from the fact that Katsuhiro Ôtomo faced the challenge of condensing a 38-volume manga into a 2-hour film. As others have mentioned, you may have to see it more than once to fully appreciate the plot.Barring that, Akira is right up there in its genre. Keep in mind the holocaust in the intro is not a nuclear weapon - I'll leave you to figure it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The ""Die Hard"" of Japanese anime","For better or worse, ""Die Hard"" is the benchmark with which most modern action-thrillers are compared.  You can see it in newspaper articles or reviews.  ""Under Siege"" was called ""Die Hard on a boat.""  ""Speed"" was dubbed ""Die Hard on a bus.""  ""Sudden Death"" was ""Die Hard in a hockey rink.""Well, ""Akira"" is the ""Die Hard"" of all Japanese anime.  I'm not an ardent follower of this genre, I must admit.  I like only a handfull of these films, and I own all but one of the ones I enjoyed (i.e., ""Wings of Honneamise"", ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Princess Mononoke"", and ""Akira"").  The reason is simple, if not totally fair: every anime I see, I compare to ""Akira.""  And more often than not, they come up short in one area or another.  ""Akira"" represents, to me, a near-perfect synthesis of action, science-fiction, and high-end animation.  I've seen an awful lot of comparisons to ""Blade Runner"", but the two films have little in common except the time in which they take place.  While ""Blade Runner"" took its time with the storytelling, ""Akira"" starts with the tachometer at the red line and rarely hits the brakes.  It's ultraviolent, semi-gross, and downright startling in places.  Anime just has no right being this good.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the greatest achievements in animation's history,"Akira is able to satisfy any viewer willing to accept that animated movies can be serious and thought provoking.  The story and imagery suck you in and the depth allows (and really requires) the viewer to see the movie repeatedly.  The music is outstanding, good enough that the soundtrack is still sold in record stores after so long.  It does run long and if you aren't interested in either the action or subject you may not be able to sit through it a second time.  If you are familiar with other Anime titles like Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion that deal with questions about humanity and you liked them check out this title, it's FANtastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's really really bad. All those people giving this 10/10 are completely out of their mind.The plot is incredibly dumb. In fact there isn't even a plot in this anime. You just watch things randomly blow up and explode for 2 hours. One thing after another explodes, people screaming, wondering what's going on and no explanation is given in the whole movie. There is no plotline, no storyline, no explanation, no logic, no common sense. Just a bunch of random things happen without any reasoning.As the story progresses you keep thinking ""this is the bottom, the story can't get any more stupid"" but it does. Throughout the 2 hours the story progressively keeps getting more and more stupid and finishes at peak stupidity.I guess whoever produced this anime really wanted to make animations of some explosions and they couldn't bother to come up with a plot so they just decided to throw in 2 hours of dumb animations of things randomly blowing up. There is no message, no character development, no deep meanings, nothing. Just 2 hours of explosions and random action.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
rewatched it for the third time and still one of my favorite anime ever made,"AKIRA is an anime which is based on the 1982 manga by the same name it's written by katushiro otomo who also directed the anime the problem is that AKIRA doesn't cover all of the original comic which is kind of disappointingbut the movie is still really good and highly recommend for those who never been into anime 
 
the art style is the best thing you'll see in the movie neo tokyo never looked so 
epic in 1988 for a movie since my neighbor totoro (never seen that movie yet or even spirted away and princess mononoke)the eng dub sucks tbh just watch it in japanese dub which i would highly recommend before watching it

An all-time classic,"Akira is an extremely challenging movie, both in content and style. The film's ultra-violence will no doubt have Tipper Gore-esque moralists running for cover while the cerebral narrative might just be a tad too cerebral for some.Which is not to say that Akira isn't a marvellous film. Quite the opposite. The involving plot, regardless of whether you understand it or not, will hypnotise you while the sheer beauty of the drawings will simply take your breath away (lest we forget, this was made in the days before computer graphics replaced CEL as the standard animation technique - which makes the workrate behind Akira all the more impressive). Nonetheless, you need to watch this movie several times in order to fully appreciate the Akira experience. The first time you'll simply be too awestruck to concentrate on the important bits.And watch the subtitled version if you can. The original voice-acting adds plenty more depth than the US version.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Akira - original, thought-provoking, and spellbound","First let me get the negative out of the way.I felt very strongly that the original American voice acting for it was better then the new 2001 release of the film. The dialog is slightly different and you got more into the characters through the art of voice acting. Makes me appreciate voice acting so much now that I have heard both versions.The movie still has me thinking and I've owned it or over ten years now. THe story is so profound, so deep, it certainly is a moralistic as well as a philosophical movie.This is not an action movie as many Americans sometimes categorize anime (although there is action in it). Nor will you find cute talking animals. This, all in all, is an adult movie, not for kids under the age of 13 in my opinion. One thing you can generalize about serious anime is that their plot lines or stories are so complex and don't usually focus entirely on a single characters. More times than not they focus on idea's rather then people, which makes for a good thinking movie.Without giving away the movie, this is a serious film about morality and technological achievements in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, which is always interesting to me since there are many post-apocalyptic movies coming out of Japan and the fact that they are in a very real sense, a post-apocalyptic nation, having atoms bombs dropped on them at the end of WWII.This film does stand the test of time",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Forget the red bike...,"If we compare this with later anime's like Berserk then you can tell that the animation here is something special. Everything feels alive and has been painstakingly drawn.The story is nothing entirely special, but it definitely has a lot to say about Mankind in general and it suitably narrates a post John Hersey's Hiroshima.It is often cited as being violent - but its actually very tame when compared to what we are used to today from things such as SAW.The characters can be confusing and one may make the mistake in thinking that the anime is about ""the guy on the Red bike"" - when really it is about his friends descent in to a power mad fury.Enjoy it.

"The Greatest Animated Film, Anime or otherwise...","This film is a milestone for anime, and animation in general.

From the motorcycle chase, to Tetsuo's rampage, the animation stays brilliant and the pace never lets down. The film is worth viewing at least once for those who have never seen anime before, or is an animation fan. The voice acting ranges however, depending on which version you watch. The Japanesse version is great through and through. The English dubs, although not as good, still great. A lot of people will argue that the Pionieer dub is worse than the original dub, but I disagree. I believe the Pionieer dub is much superior but the original isn't bad either.

Very interesting anime....,"Before I give out the information about dubbings and such,I'll get to my brief review.Akira is based on the manga series which lasted from 1983 to 1993 therefore the ending to the movie is different from the manga ending.I think both endings are good,but the movie does leave a lot of unanswered questions.The story is detailed,but comprehensive,the characters are good,and it's visually awesome.Now to the subs and dubs.Most likely the people who don't like this movie probably saw it in the original 1988 dub,which isn't very good.The 2001 dub is far more accurate,but if you want to see Akira at it's best you should watch it with subtitles unless you speak Japanese,then there is no need for them.Akira gets 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Seismic,"There are few pieces of media that have had the seismic effect that Akira had on it's 1988 release. Based on the manga of the same name and directed by the same author, the science fiction film changed the face of Japanese cinema and, indeed, the face of Japanese fiction in general.It's not hard to see why. Katsuhiro's world is dense and alive in such a captivating way; beyond the biker gangs of our main characters Tetsuo and Kaneda we have doomsday cults, government conspiracies, insurgent terrorists, mysterious physic powers... Audiences back then and even now are pulled into the world, invited to explore every nook and cranny, making it instantly watchable and perfect for repeat viewings.Such a shame then, that this is exactly what drags the movie down, particularly in the second act. Cramming the plot full of so many subplots gives rise to many false climaxes and resolutions, leaving the pacing choppy at best. Particularly evident is the resolution of the titular Akira plotline, which seems like it should be the resolution of the movie, but upon looking at the remaining time, you'll be shocked to discover that almost half an hour still remains. Cutting a lot of these superfluous subplots would help the pacing greatly, but then again that's exactly what made the film so engaging in the first place, providing a serious conundrum.Even more confusing is that, because of the inclusion of so many subplots, it seems that the characterisation and character development of our main characters - Tetsuo and Kaneda - suffers as a result. Tetsuo turns too quickly from disgruntled childhood friend to telekinesis-wielding antagonist, but at least this isn't as bad as Kaneda's treatment, who remains the same one-note, shouty delinquent virtually the entire way through the film. Why the filmmakers chose to focus on these smaller threads instead of the main thread of the movie escapes me, but at least another key area of focus for the film - production - paid off in spades.The bubble economy of the 1980s made Japan a lot of money, and it's no surprise that a lot of this money was channeled into entertainment - namely, the burgeoning anime industry. With a budget of around $10 million, this is still the most expensive anime film of all time, and it shows. Everything on screen is animated, even the backgrounds in panning shots, making for one of the best looking pieces of animated film out there. Just watching the film for this level of quality rarely seen in anime films anymore is worth it, and there's no way you'll pick up on every detail with just one watch.So perhaps this is why, despite choppy writing, the film still stands the test of time today, and can still be enjoyed with our modern eyes. Akira still remains one of my favourite films of all time - perhaps because of the impression it left on me at a young age - even though it can't exactly be called the 'best.'",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
New to Me,"I will now join the mass of people who say, ""What on Earth?"" This is unlike anything I've seen. It has elements of Blade Runner as a futurist society, arising from Tokyo's ashes, is beset by gangs, violence, and terrorism. The central focus is on one group of young people, but they are merely vehicles in the world in which they live. They have been raised in violence and blood and are as dangerous to each other as to those around them. Akira is some sort of central force that is not understood by anyone--only that it exists and one should not mess with it. But external forces grab one of the kids, a depressed loner, sho needs attention and gratification. He has been abused in the past and now his time has come. But there is more. Supernatural forces are at work in the form of some strange children. Eventually we find out about the powers, but, even at the end, we aren't really sure what has transpired.

Akira is the best animation film ever.,"Akira is one of the best animation films of all time. Wait, scratch that. Akira is one of the best FILMS of all time. This movie is the very definition of 'ahead of it's time'. Thought-provoking and at times even moving, Akira isn't one of those movies that you pop on with your girlfriend, or when the guys come over on movie night. It's visceral, it's unapologetic, and it's heavy man. Real heavy.Many people find Akira hard to keep up with, and have to go back a second and third time to pick up all the finer plot details. My recommendation - read the graphic novels. The ending will make a lot more sense. Trying to compress Katsuhiro Otomo's seminal graphic novel into one film was an astounding feat, but I think the results are just this side of absolutely incredible. From the intricacies of Tetsuo and Kaneda's relationship, to the fast-paced action of the street-bike sequence, to the astounding, disturbing finale in which the film lives up to it's tag-line, this movie never loses your attention. There are no 'boring parts'.A lot of my friends dismiss anime as 'just a cartoon'. I show them this movie.They usually never say that again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

What is stood out to me for the characters were how the characters have psychic powers.In the end, this is a really good movie to watch if you're into anime and want to see how anime was before the 2000's.

"Anime has never seen anything like this, and probably never will again.","I'm going to be honest. I only saw Akira because I heard it was the inspiration to one of my favorite video games, Final Fantasy VII. My experience with Anime movies was bad to say the least, so I didn't expect Akira to be any good. I was blown away.I was at the edge of my seat from the beginning. This movie was an 80s Matrix. You have to pay attention in order to get it. There are scenes where reading between the lines is required.Now, the acting. Unless the leads were shouting ""TETSUOOOOOOO!"" or ""KANEDAAAAAAA!"", the acting was well done and very believable.Now, there is a scene where some girl's shirt is ripped off, exposing her entire upper body. THAT DOES NOT MAKE THIS MOVIE HENTAI, but it does give it an R-Rating (as well as some mild language and someone having a graphic hallucination that his guts were spilling to the floor, but I digress).If you were disappointed by bad Anime (which seems to be the ONLY Anime they send us) like I was, give this movie a chance, and I swear that you will not be disappointed. If you like Final Fantasy VII, watch this movie. I swear to you as well, that you will not be disappointed. If you like movies that make you think and force you to pay attention, I got one word for ya: Akira.

This is where animation has its advantages but only Akira has done it so far - The way the story is told (it is basically 4 story lines in one) - The music in the movie is almost entirely human voice.But most of all that every scene is essential to the movie.everything that happens is important!!!(This is a movie that when you leave one scene out the story does not make sense and when you ad a scene its to much .And lots of scene's could be added ,there is of cause the original graphic novel which is opposite to the movie in this respect.)I think this is a very special movie unlike every other one I have seen in my life and that it could even change the way you look at life itself.Go See This One.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Poifect,"Akira blew my mind when I first saw it on BBC2 in 1994 and i rate it as one of the best films I have ever seen. From the first scene with the motorcycles whizzing through a neon jungle with the tail lights leaving trails across the screen and with a cool tech-no soundtrack blaring as young kids try to beat, maim and kill each other, to the explosive and catastrophic end which delivers pounds and pounds above and beyond anything you could expect from a films conclusion, Akira is a masterpiece.What you get in between is great humour, both slapstick and dialogue based, tension, horror and a sense of being dragged into a bizarre world in which you could easily become overwhelmed and confused if it weren't grounded by easy to relate to characters.The cast is huge and the story never sticks with anyone too long to let them hog it, but we are given 2 main ones to follow and relate to. kaneda is a happy go lucky hero type, a leader, the type everyone likes and wants to be around. In the film he seems to take every situation with a pinch of salt and is entertaining till the very end. The true star for me though is Tetsuo who brings all the tension, horror and gore to the film. He plays a sort of outsider lackey who's jealousy of kaneda and resentment of society proves catastrophic for the whole of Tokyo as he discovers powers within himself and becomes a sort of demented twisted superman (red cape n all).Throw in to the mix a pulsing sound track, great and grizzly animation, lots of odd and exaggerated characters: power hungry politicians, crazy doctors, soothsayers, prematurely aging kids, psychics and a whole lot of unruly biker school kids - and it seems too much for one film , but it's not, it all comes out about perfect, the story is on point all the way and the end satisfies all expectations with a suitably ambiguous and philosophical end.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
a sci-fi thrilling animation which you'll ever forget it.,"In 1988 the animation audience were used to watch the same fairy tail since 1937 that Disney provided with 'snow white' where ""happy and ever"" ruled and there was no violence or anything to create a REAL climax between the characters with a good mix of blood and explosions.

With a unusual and powerful story, combined with explosive actions sequences and outstanding visuals, Akira turns out to be one of the greatest animations ever made, and open the doors of this entire anime universe we have today.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An amazing film somehow dubbed as over-hyped when it is clearly under-rated,"Akira is a tremendous achievement.  Some anime purist may say it is over-rated but they are used to the traditional anime full of non-stop, violent action.  These fans of traditional anime were bored by this film. This is a movie for serious film watchers, not for those who enjoy only anime.  I have only enjoyed maybe a half dozen anime films and this is at the top of the list.  Another thing that people may be critical about is the English dub that is of course no fault to the Japanese filmmakers themselves.  There is a new dub now, yet any true fan of cinema or any person who respects the directors work, will watch a foreign film with subtitles.  The movie is seen as complicated and hard to understand by some, whom I believe have a short attention span and never really gave the film a chance.  These people in turn call the movie boring and over-hyped, this is because people call this the `Matrix Animated' or something silly like that. The story is more complicated than Matrix, since the Matrix is complete spoon-fed, cliché, fortune cookie philosophy.  If you think The Matrix was original read a Philip K. Dick book and you will see it has all been done better, and 60 years earlier.  The other opinion on Akira is that it is stupid, it ideas are bland, and it is way too easy to understand.  This is an obvious attempt from pompous above-it-alls to show how smart they are and how the film couldn't possibly do anything for them, because the thoughts have already existed in their heads.  Compensation, truth is neither of them understood it.  It is not difficult and it doesn't hide anything from the audience, but it does take multiple viewings, but the first audience is too bored and the second too arrogant and frustrated to be open for another try. I do get upset when directors purposefully try and hide things from their audiences as a David Lynch does in his latest movies, his earlier films told a much clearer concise narrative, which made for better storytelling. This film is only complicated in that it does not spoon-feed, much like other films of the 80s.  However since this is sci-fi you would expect an explanation, there is none given.  I am happy for this because it makes it real, you watch the film as a spectator and you have to deduct what you are seeing.  This film has a brilliant story, marvelous artwork and animation, and it is powerful.  It is all a matter of taste I suppose, but I believe most of the critic of this film are reactionaries or ignorant. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent,"Well in my opinion this is one of the greatest animated films ever made. I've shown it to both anime and non anime fans and all have come to love it. Its become a landmark in modern times.There are many people who say this is the greatest anime ever made, and yet many who say it was terrible. Yet I can't officially say anything because I haven't seen every single animated movie/show to come out of Japan and I don't plan to. Though i can say with out a doubt this is better then most anime movies i've seen. First off the film isn't so bluntly..how would you say it...depressing! Most Jap Anime films are very melancholy and depressing. With smug environments and Drama thats wayyy over the top. This one doesn't. Sure there's that same ol' Japanese them of ""Lets bring destruction upon our country or for that matter the world."" But its not overdone to an extreme! The Animation is top notch for its time period, the music is wonderful and hell the voice acting on both the Jap and US versions aren't that bad. Though many Anime fans usually love the Jap voice acting better...usually i find it to childish and with not much emotion. Though I don't mind either version.So hell if your a fan of Anime, or if you HATE anime! give this film a try. Check it out, buy it, rent it...whatever. Maybe you will come to love it as I did...or you'll hate it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Calling it like it is...,"Akira is one of the films that bridged the gap between East and West. Visually stunning and written with the flair and style we have come to associate with Manga, years before many Westerners knew what Manga was; Akira was a turning point in Anime for many people.It is centred around two boyhood friends, Kaneda and Tetsuo, during the aftermath of a bike accident Tetsuo is involved in. He goes on to be altered by the Government trying to create a super-being. Years before, they had attempted the same thing and destroyed Tokyo. As Tetuo begins to change and become stronger than Kaneda, the roles they have had since childhood become reversed. As this happens, Tetuo is losing control as his power becoes greater. With the arrival of Tetsuo, the end of the world is prophesised and the return of Akira (The name given to the super-being that destroyed Tokyo) is said to be at hand.The plotline is deep and involving, as the characters grow - both up and apart - as their lives diverge. This has resonance with the age they are at; late teens, no longer kids and not yet willing to be adults, making and breaking the friendships they will keep or not.Akira is a serious film about many aspects of life in Japan - both the rise of the cyberpunk and the survival of tradional values.As a film, it is absolutely fantastic, and as a social commentary, it provokes thoughts.Don't ignore this simply because it's animation. Give it the respect it deserves, dedicate some time to it and you'll be amazed at what you find.10/10 - no questions",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The three (and a half) defining moments of my anime experience,"Anime is one of the most misunderstood genres of animation and film in general, at least in the Western world.  Anime movies (apart from  the awful Pokemon franchise) are almost never shown theatrically on the big screen, as some of them are intended.  And that is a real pity, but three weeks ago I was in for a massive treat.I'd first gotten into anime when I was about eight.  And, of course, that exposure was due to the massively popular Dragon Ball Z television series. While a very odd show to sit through now, the Japanese superhero saga was amazing to my younger self, despite the lack of (albeit impressive and unique) fluid animation.As I'd gotten older, and my younger brother was turned on to the Pokemon craze (I'd barely avoided it, with only a brief flirtation with the original video games), I ended up with a bad opinion of Japanimation: the dub jobs were often bad (and the dialogue was cheesy for a Western watcher anyway), the animation often awful, and the less said about the huge eyes the better.That was a philistine's belief, however.  Yet while I wasn't too keen on the genre, I'd heard good things about one movie in particular: ""Ghost in the Shell"".  So when it came on the Sci-Fi channel last summer for a midnight screening, I decided to watch it (what the hell, right?)Hoo boy.  ""Ghost in the Shell"" was not Dragon Ball Z.  Hell, it wasn't anything I'd expected it to be, and it was even better than many live-action flicks of the same yarn.  FAR better than almost ANY Western animated film (to date, my slim liking of animated films from the States include The Lion King, Shrek, and pretty much any of Pixar's work.)  I thought, damn, this was one of the best movies ever, certainly animated.Well, thankfully I was wrong.  During my last visit to the States, in my massive DVD shopping sprees I saw the Special Edition Akira DVD, and read the cover.  It seemed interesting, but I chose not to buy it.  Instead, when I got back to England, I downloaded a copy.  I figured the animation wasn't perfect anyway, so why not get a grainy, online version?Well, I watched it, and was pretty impressed.  It was cool, but I didn't think it was as cool as ""Ghost in the Shell"".  But after hearing a lot of hype about it, I felt sort of disappointed.So THANK YOU SCI-FI CHANNEL for hosting Sci-Fi London!  A three day festival centered around the date 02-02-02 (get it?  ...no, I suppose not), it heralded the theatrical release of several gerat sci-fi movies, including the Aliens series, The Thing, and many top-notch Japanese movies.  Including Akira.Well, all I can say is BOOYAH!  The film was ASTOUNDING on the big screen, especially since it was the THX remastered version.  The haunting music was far more impacting, the visual detail was the best I've ever seen in Japanimation (though some scenes of ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" were a bit better animated) and the new dub was far superior to the old one (why does no one like it?)Well, needless to say I'm aching to head back to the States for Spring Break and pick up the Special Edition DVD.  A truly outstanding movie, but one which, unfortunately, has spoiled me for (almost) every other anime out there.SCORE: As a film: 9/10 As animation: 11/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

When Anime goes right,"In general, I dislike Anime. I think most of it is godawful formulaic crap full of horrendous clichés. But it has it's strengths, and a good director knows what they are and knows how to use them. Akira knows what the strengths of Anime are and uses them.Visually, it's about as good as it gets. Neo-Tokyo is brought to life with detail that would make any sci-fi fan giddy. You enjoy watching the sprawling megalopolis come to life in the bike sequences and the riots and protests throughout. The long sequence at the end is beyond description. All that should be said is that it couldn't be made without animation. Any Hollywood attempt to pull the sequence off would be computer generated and tacky. It could only be made by hand drawn animation, and it's proven to be a formidable format.Throughout the whole movie this amazing drum music plays in the best parts. I'm not sure what it is, I imagine it's Japanese, but I'm not sure. Whatever it is, it complements the on screen action perfectly. The director knows when to put what music where, and does it.The entire movie is able to give you an extreme sense of unease and fear. It isn't fear in the horror movie sense of the word, or in the David Lynch surreal sense, but just a fear of the world you're being shown. It's a scary place, and Akira conveys it perfectly.The characters aren't well developed. Any anybody who tries to tell you otherwise doesn't know real character development. But that's not what the movie is going for. The movie is showing you characters that are as well developed as they need to be. They are well animated enough to seem realistic and do what you would expect them to do in their situation. You don't need to feel for any of the characters. The movie doesn't need them to be interesting people. But for what they are, they are extremely believable and effective.The movie is deep beyond a normal science fiction story. No, it won't question yourself most likely, or your relationship with others. But it will haunt you for a very long time, and it richly deserves it. There are better movies out there, but there's always a better movie. I recommend this to anybody, but especially someone interested in the strengths of animation. This movie is the embodiment of what can go right in animation.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Masterpiece in Sci-Fi Animation,"With its dark and chaotic world-building and violent storytelling, Akira is full of teenage angst and rage. The film successfully blends its cinematic influences, most apparent Blade Runner, within its unique storyline, bringing to life something fresh in its own right. I love the look and feel of this movie. Neo-Tokyo's atmosphere is presented in a beautiful-hazy glow as the city comes to life with color. Its gritty environments are reminiscent of the slums of a major metropolitan city in the early 1990s, yet the film doesn't feel aged and outdated. From an artistic perspective the movie is visually stunning and a masterpiece in cel animation.The film's second act struggles to hold the same cohesiveness as the first. Slowing down to introduce new characters, their motivations, and storylines. Its epic conclusion requires additional research to fully understand the ending, and I can see where Otomo struggled to convert Akiras's massive story into a 2 hour run time. All of which doesn't take away from the movie's enjoyment, but inspires you to dive deeper into the world of Akira. Its gory animation and futuristic themes make it required viewing for all fans of anime and sci-fi films alike.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly one of the finest films to ever come out of Japan,"Akira is certainly gory, its certainly gritty, but after seeing it for the first time, I felt like crying. And not because it was bad. Akira is one of the most deeply emotional and incredible films I have ever seen. It certainly takes a (very) open mind to appreciate and understand it, but once you do, your imagination will explode.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated movies ever made.,"This is the movie that really began the process of making anime a serious genre.

The visuals and aesthetics had a lot of detail in every scene. Graphics were gorgeous/beautiful throughout the film. One negative point about the film was the detail on the amoeba children in the film. They looked a bit odd and looked as though they were old adults.The intense sound effects of the guns and bikes made the film more exciting and engaging through every scene. The sound effects felt realistic, and pleasing to the ears.Overall a action packed, well written, entertaining film worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
one of my favorite animated movies,"Perhaps one of the flag-bearers for the anime genre, even this classification does not do this movie justice. This movie has a lot more merits than most anime films (and I've seen many), one of the biggest being the fact it was made in 1988. This movie portrays the struggle of a group of young punks in the slums and the anonymous massiveness of future Tokyo. As far as content goes, this movie does a great job of pointing out various social issues in that typical nihilistic Japanese/Anime view, and it features an (at that time) relatively story with some of the best written characters I've seen in animated movies so far. The animation is extremely well done, the makers did not shy away from being bloody to get a point across, and they succeed very well in creating a unique atmosphere.To summarize, this is a great movie with a good storyline, good character development and perfect execution.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing action and existential dread,"Akira feels so daunting to take on. It´s literally considered one of the most important anime movies of all time, and after watching it, I understand why. The animation, action, worldbuilding and idea, is so amazing and really sells this world. I might need to watch it one more time to really make it sink in, and make some of the story aspects make more sense to me, but from an enjoyable factor I can only say I loved this movie.In the future, after World War 3, Neo-Tokyo is a hellhole. Constant rioting, gang wars, drug wars are plaguing the city. After a unfortunate run in with an experiment, Tetsuo gets hurt and goes to the hospital but his experimented on by the government. His best friend Kaneda foins the anti-government resistant to save his friend.First off, the incredible display of animation skill. To think this is hand drawn animation is obvious but also absolutely incredible. The craftsmanship at display is phenomenal and hard to describe. It´s just such a detailed world and so many small details makes the drawings come to life. So many small color changes bring every building, character, road and so much more to life. It´s animation that dares and really shows what time and effort pays off. The lights following bikes, the Kanedas iconic bike in itself, the later display at scary things. It´s all so it´s own and shown perfectly. This is a feast for the eyes and Neo-Tokyo might be one of my favorite sci-fi settings of all times, because of the soul but into the animation portraying it. Every frame is a painting here.This also carries over to the incredible action. This movie is brutal, it shows death, blood, and later gore in very horrific ways. The action and violence has a weight to it and again, it dares to show it. When characters get hit, they fall, but instead of cutting to them being on the ground, the movie choses to show the landing, the impact, the tumble. It adds so much to the feeling of damage and makes every action sequence exiting.The only thing I didn't like about the directing of the movie was the editing. It can feel so abrupt when they cut sometimes, and it gave me whiplash a couple of times. I think really noticed it because the movie is well directed for the rest and sometimes the transitions are their so when it just cuts to something new, it feels unnatural.Overall, I found the story compelling and incredible. It´s a story that lets you, the viewer, really make your own conclusions and understand the world in your pacing. Neo-Tokyo is not over explained as Sci-fi often tends to do as you need the audience to follow along. But here the movie knows you are smart. The characters live here every day and shows you what it needs to for you to follow along while not showing everything in your face. Neo-Tokyo has a story to it that is understated. Riots, gang wars, no educated youth, government takeovers, drugs, it´s an afterwar hellhole no one wants to live in, but has to. The world feels alive and like it has it´s own story besides the main characters, until it can't ignore them anymore. I also found the main characters plots compelling. Helping your friends, becoming your own, and a shift to the military just wanting everything to be good again. It´s all hard hitting stuff and works. I think the movie needed a bit more time to tell the plan of the general to make him really work, but I think it´s an aspect, where you have to read into it your own way.I really loved the designs of characters too. They stand out in a good way. Sometimes in what I called generic and rushed animes, mostly shows, I sometimes can´t tell one character from another, but here it´s obvious who´s who and their clothing and designs says a lot about the characters. The kids look ugly though. I think that's the point, but they looked like they didn't belong.The kids are also the weakest part of the voice acting performance. Their lines sound a bit more read somehow. I watched this in Japanese so it´s in no way my native tongue, but compared to other performances, the kids sounded weaker. Both Nozomo Sasaki as Tetsuo and Mitsuo Iwata as Kaneda gave incredible performances though. They delivered a lot of nuance and small things to their performance that made them stand out.I also really loved the sound design and the experimental score. A person having a hard time breathing being a cool part of a score is experimental but fits the movie. The score is out there but it feels unique to this movie and becomes a part of it´s identity.The movie has a lot of shifting tones and concepts. As the characters become more involved, the movie scales with it´s concepts. It goes from gang fighting to political activism and takeovers to a spiritual ending. It works in the context of the movie but could no doubt be longer. What is this movie actually about? Existentialism, what happens after a world war, making the world better or worse, there is clearly an emphasis on what a good government is, what a good life is, hints towards nuclear war and what else fission can do. It becomes a very spiritual movie and I think your interpretation is as correct as mine.Akira is a masterpiece on many levels. It displays incredible action, has a compelling plot and such a deep world. I have to return to this movie to really make it sink in, but overall I was entertained from start to finish and found the movie absolutely incredible. A milestone in animation no doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie is a bit confusing at times so I would say that anyone who is planning on seeing this film should should set aside some time and actually pay attention to what is happening.

"Enduring. After the DVD release, as fresh as ever.","I saw Akira when I was 12. I thought it was very cool. I have watched it pretty much once a year after that, understanding more and more each time (it was quite ambitious at 12 to try and 'get' something that I only just understand at 23!). And now finally I get it (maybe).When the new DVD double pack was announced I was as happy as a pig in s**t!! I wasn't disappointed. My favourite part of the new pack is the new dub. Most of my mates (and my girlfriend) have got the concentration span of a gnat and subsequently cant watch subs. The new dub is a significant improvement over the old one, making it easier to follow and removing some annoying voices.The film itself is a tribute to great writing. I love akira and always have. And watching it over the years I have appreciated it on many different levels. The visuals are marvellous and the soundtrack is exquisite. The visual revamp take years off it and it looks as fresh as ever.I sometimes wonder where it could all lead. What would have happened if Hollywood had dramatised it (After the success of LOTR, Sony may reconsider) or if (and this is my personal wish), a studio could animate a serial of otomos original mangas. That would probably be just about the best thing ever. After all, the story is obviously fleshed out and the character of akira is to good to be just a bit part energy being.Come on! You know you want to! Akira: The Series! Akira: The Movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Timeless,"Akira is not just one of the best anime films; it's one of the best films ever made. I've watched it at least 10 times since I was a teenager, and it never gets old. The animation holds up spectacularly well, almost timeless in its ability to mesmerize. Each viewing offers something new, something I hadn't caught before. This time, I found myself really empathizing with the elderly children characters. There's something about growing older that has deepened my sympathy for both children and the elderly, and here, those identities are fused in such a unique, poignant way.The story is captivating, drawing influence from Neuromancer and Cronenberg's body horror while still maintaining the essence of the manga it's based on. The film's world-building feels expansive yet personal, grounded by complex characters who navigate the chaos of this dystopian future. While the English dub is good for its time, I personally prefer the subtitled version. I've noticed that dubs tend to veer into camp territory, and while I love camp, the original Japanese voice acting carries a rawness and sincerity that I find lacking in the redub. There's an earnestness in older Asian films that gets lost when reworked for a different audience.Though I've never read the manga, and I've heard it's quite different, I hesitate to dive into it. I love the movie so much that I'm afraid it might tamper with the joy and connection I've built over years of rewatching it. I will watch Akira again in a few years and probably have an even deeper appreciation for its wonder.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

If you don't get it don't knock it!,"I have commented before on Akira but I want to make some things clear. You CANNOT compare this movie to the computer animated feces that is unfortunately taking over. eg. SHREK, FINAL FANTASY.These movies are synthetic in terms of animation and pure bubblegum fluff in terms of story, which most people seem to love, thus marketable. Akira is hand drawn and although there are some computer effects they act only as an aid to true artwork. When people don't understand something they will stay away and continue in there mainstream way of life;Hence people comparing this to SHREK (what a joke). AKIRA is not what most people call conventional storytelling. In these terrible days of hollywood movies one might think this would be a breath of fresh air. As for the dogs being blasted near the begining of the film; this shows the type of society Neo-Tokyo is with terrorists posing a threat on the city every day. Yes it's brutal and if you understand that , good, your on your way. The people that come on here and compare this to ICE AGE are the same ones walking out of Scorpion King saying ""That was great!"" There is a story in AKIRA and it does make sense. If you understand the movie and it's social comments and still don't like it I respect your opinion. But to come on here and cut it up and then say ""I didn't get it"" makes no sense So please stick to your Julia Roberts movies and Oprah Whinfrey viewing and stay away from hardcore storytelling...It's not for you.THANKS",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Think Twice,"The first time I watched akira i did not like it.  I was young(13) and did not understand foreign films as I do now, nor did I recognise anime movies as true film as I do now.  I didn't hate the movie either, I just couldn't figure the damn thing out so I rented it again.  More things came into light and this time I liked it. I ended up buying the movie and read the comics and loved it. Every time I watch this flick I pick up different messages:the death of mankind trying to play god through technology, friendship, power (definately corrupts) and the abuse of it. Akira is one of those movies that usally leaves one asking what the hell just happend and the only way to draw a conclusion is by watching it multiple times.  Even then your conclusion is still what you want it to be and thats the beauty of it.

Great movie,"When I sat down and watched Akira for the first time about four years ago I didn't like the movie that much. I liked the action but I found the story complicated and the movie was overly bloody. It was my intention to forget this film and never watch it again. A couple months after the first time I watched it I rented it again at a friends house. I started to enjoy the film more. Today this is one of my favourite movies. The main reason I started to like this movie so much is because in time I began to understand the plot more and therefore the movie was more enjoyable. I find that most of the people who hate Akira don't understand the story and don't like the violence and blood. Recently I rented Akira again. I told my friend about it and he said he wanted to watch it with me. I warned him about the blood and that didn't seem to bother him. I also told him that the plot is very difficult to understand. After the movie I asked him what he thought of it. His response was ""What in the hell was going on in that movie?"" He didn't really care for the movie but again the main reason was not being able to understand the plot. I think Akira is a great movie but it takes an open mind to enjoy it. Be prepared, the plot is very complex and it might take you a while to fully comprehend it. As I mentioned there is a lot of blood in this movie but if that doesn't bother you then give Akira a try you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

And that's not because of the story (although it might be complicated), but mostly because of very weak dialogues. Very annoying. Is that typically Japanese? I don't think so...

The Best Animated Film ever made,"There aren't enough words to describe this incredible film . The directing is unbelievable; the acting, the soundtrack, and of course the animation is great. One reason why I love this movie, is the message it delivers to the audience. The message is how pathetic we really are, politics, war, riots, we are pathetic creatures. Another reason I like this film is that it's the first animated movie to question our existence.I didn't enjoy ""Ghost In The Shell"" as much as ""Akira"" because ""Ghost In The Shell"" tried to give out that same message, but it the message had been shown in ""Akira."" Don't get me wrong I love ""Ghost in the Shell."" I enjoyed the awesome, advanced 3d visual effects, and lot's it references to the Bible.  Also the story was good but it was to short.  If you see ""Akira"" do not see ""Ghost in the Shell"" unless you're tempted like I was to see both.  I like films that give a true message through hard hitting action scenes not just through Bible references. Katsuhiro Otomo is a great director and has made a true animated epic.
