Lots Of Harsh Reviews On MHO,"Many reviewers have blistered this movie, and I agree it contains too many cliches and is overly sentimental. But compared to the endless supply of Hollywood vapidity, this one isn't THAT bad. Mr. Holland is neither saint nor bad guy, but he clearly loves music and cares about his students. I understand that music is a very serious topic for many people including several reviewers who hated this film. But I think they miss the point; Mr. Holland is not a musical genius, he's a high school music teacher. And yes, his opus truly sucks balloons, and that's because Mr. Holland is a musical mediocrity. His dream of being a famous composer was delusional, a ridiculous pipe dream. But he Found his true calling in life as a decent teacher. That's the point of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I can sympathize as a teacher!,"As an out-of-work teacher, I can see and understand Glenn Holland's desire to do more than just be remembered as a teacher but to create a piece of work. As an English teacher, I too aspire to break out the best novel to pull me out of my world. Teaching is hard and rewarding. It's not easy. Don't let anybody fool you otherwise. Richard Dreyfuss' performance as Glenn Holland is not only memorable but unforgettable one of his best roles. Glenne Headly is terrific as his wife. He has a fantastic supporting cast like Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Jay Thomas, Alicia Witt, and others to support the film. The film is kind of a downer about a man who has spent thirty years of his life as a teacher in a small town. I was troubled by the fact that he and his wife stopped having children after Cole was born. I thought the deafness was to create friction between the musical father and his deaf son. Still, it's a good film. You'll cry a little.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Oh for the love of crumbcake...,"So many people have complained about the Gertrude Lang character (Alicia Witt), Holland's interaction with her, and the purpose of the character, and I am simply amazed at the hostility.1) ""Playing the sunset"" was Holland's way of getting Gertrude to relax so she could play the notes fluidly. They both knew that she didn't sound professional, and wasn't going to. The idea was to get her just above the level of making a fool of herself as she did the first time he called on her in class. Then she could, and did, perform in the band without dragging down the whole ensemble.2) Her goal was not to be a professional musician. Did no one else hear her speech about ""I just wanted to be good at *something*""? She listed all the fabulous achievements of her parents and siblings, and concluded, ""I'm the only one who's..."" The missing word would have been ""useless"" or ""worthless"". Or ""a failure"". Thirty years later she's the governor (not the mayor!), because in 1966, Holland helped her gain confidence for the first time.3) She wasn't ""wasting"" Holland's efforts by going into politics. Art, music and theater education don't exist solely to create professional artists, musicians and actors. They also exist to give young people an opportunity for change and growth, even if they never use a paintbrush again.I liked that plot twist. Almost every high school has an alumnus who has achieved something in art or entertainment, but a lot of people sell one painting or appear in one film and become a hero to their home town. But there are only fifty states, and it takes an extraordinary amount of drive to become governor of one of them. It's unlikely that she would have taken that first step towards empowerment without Holland.",,Anonymous,Music
"Sweet, but boring. Disney style kind of movie, with no real drama whatsoever. Too many stereotypical characters in a row are tedious to watch after a while. Nice ish...","This movie follows music teacher Richard Dreyfuss teach music to American kids from the sixties to the nineties. Sweet story, but lacking in any kind of real drama, because of it's Disney kind of style of direction, meaning every plot turn is neatly drawn between the politically correct lines, there are no surprises, nobody gets offended and it ends up being a quite boring picture to watch, that lasts a whopping 2 and half hours. 45 minutes too long.Still a sweet picture, maybe best recommended for families with young kids who want to become a musician, because the spirit of this movie is an uplifting positive one, that anyone can find joy in playing music if their heart is in it...",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Excellent film, with even better music","Richard Dreyfuss is outstanding (as is the whole cast) in this thoroughly enjoyable film.  I really liked it the first time, but with repeated viewings, I'd say that this film got even better.  It's a little predictable, but so what?  For me, it was impossible not to care about these characters, and the ending was the perfect heartwarming note to go out on. It was rather funny as well, but my favourite thing about this movie was the music.  It seems only fitting, considering the importance of music to this film, that it would have a great number of songs, but I was astonished by how much I LOVED the music in this movie.  All-in-all, this was a completely satisfying film, and I would call it a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Taking a bypass from your dreams and finding your true calling,"A composer (Richard Dreyfuss) puts his lofty ambitions on hold to become a high school music teacher in Portland, Oregon, from 1965-1995. Glenne Headly plays his wife, Jay Thomas the coach, Olympia Dukakis the principal and William H. Macy the irritating vice principal.""Mr. Holland's Opus"" (1995) is a good school-oriented drama that's episodic in nature since it spans 30 years. The first 40 minutes were decent, but I was wondering if the film would be able to absorb me into its story, especially considering its considerable length. It did, particularly the episodes concerning Terrence Howard (playing Louis Russ) and angelic Jean Louisa Kelly (Rowena).The movie's kind of a meshing of ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989) crossed with ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), although not great like either of those flicks. But it's a solid drama. A 19 year-old Alicia Witt is on hand as one of the students in the first act.The film runs 2 hours, 23 minutes and was shot in Portland, Oregon, and nearby Marylhurst.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Richard Dreyfuss is good in all stages of the different seasons of the life of Mr. Holland.,"The writing of this movie by Patrick Sheane Duncan (Nick of Time), nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe Awards, is one of the best stories that Hollywood ever put on the screen. The sensitivity and perception of the Director Stephen Herek (101 Dalmatians) adds a special touch to the story.Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl, The Competition, The American President) was  nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for this role, which is my view one of his best performances. He is good in all stages of the different seasons of the life of Mr. Holland.  I seldom cry while watching a movie,  but when Mr. Holland enters the school auditorium with grey hair and the entire school is applauding when he retires, it makes me cry. I cry every time I watch it,  and I can also cry every time I bring it to mind. If I ever get a part where I have to cry all I have to do is to bring back that memory back!  That moment is a combination of my mother a music teacher and my dad aging. There is no greater love than to lay your life for another... When I graduated from college I wrote a letter thanking my parents for the rainy days they had to go to work,  and for all the sacrifices they made for me and left it on top of the dining room table so they could find when I was not around.  Needless to say that the entire family cried. That is what that scene means to me. I do not see Mr. Holland as a frustrated composer, he was just frustrated because he had other commitments that did not give him the time to compose. Glenne Headly did a great job playing Iris Holland. She has appeared in ER recently. Olympia Dukakis (Steel Magnolias) plays  Principal Jacobs. It is beautiful when close to her retirement she gives Mr. Holland a gift.  Jean Louisa Kell (The Day Lincoln Was Shot) is Rowena Morgan who steals the show because she sings beautifully. William H. Macy, (Fargo) plays Vice Principal Wolters who goes insane when he listens popular music coming from Mr. Holland's classroom. Poor Gertrude Lang,  Alicia Witt (""Cybill"") is trying so hard to get the technique that she forgets about her feelings. I love when she finally gets to feel the piece and lets herself go.Then when she comes back as grown up is very touching. A music teacher having a deaf child is ironic. Mr. Holland  teaching the kids about Beethoven is marvelous!  I love when Cole (Anthony Natale (II)), comes back as an adult and participates in the celebration of his dad's retirement, and also because he himself is going to teach at the school for the deaf in Washington DC. This movie struck a cord with me because of the music and because of all the elements that were brought into movie and story. I would give it a10 + if I could. It is one of my favorite dramas! I am not much of a drama person, I prefer comedy, but this is a very special drama.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Life is what happens while you're busy making plans,"The make-up department does a splendid job in ageing Richard Dreyfuss in Stepehen Herek's film about an aspiring composer turned music teacher who finds his vocation over thirty years. It's a good performance from Dreyfuss as well, and the movie also benefits from a reliably creepy turn from William Macy as Dreyfusss' boss. In fact, as a portrait of a life set against a changing political, and musical, landscape, showing how (in the words of a song that features in the plot), ""life is what happens while we're busy making plans"", it reminded me of the epic BBC drama series, 'Our Friends in the North'. But it lacks the deeper engagement of that series with the specifics of the times it portrays, and at times seems a little trite as a result. Dreyfuss was Oscar-nominated for his role and this is definitely the sort of film that gets considered at these awards: earnest, gently liberal, ultimately upbeat and essentially unthreatening. And you can take that as condemnation or commendation, as you will; but I enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
How I wish I had my own Mr. Holland,"What a wonderful movie. I just watched it and am in awe of Richard Dreyfuss' amazing acting. Only being 15 but an avid music lover myself, I sat there wishing I had a teacher like Mr. Holland that inspired me like so many of the students in the movie, that made learning fun by connecting with the students, by doing everything Mr. Holland did. The stories of the students were real and believable. I connected with the girl that played the clarinet, Gertrude Lang, because sometimes I even feel that I'm never good at anything.Every person of every age can appreciate and love this movie. At the end, when Mr. Holland's goodbye party was discovered in the gym and he took the stage, I was crying.What a wonderful movie. History-wise, music-wise, and story-wise.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
story of our lives,"Yeah yeah, I know that it is overtly sentimental and the kind of film that you feel embarrassed to admit that you liked but what the heck? I think sometimes it's good to drop your guards, just be yourself and enjoy whatever it is even if it means wetting a couple of tissues. But having said this, I think the sentiments shown in the movie are quite genuine and at least I didn't feel that I was watching a mush.I have always felt that true teachers, the ones that really inspire you, could be counted on your fingers of your left hand. Richard Dreyfuss plays one such music teacher who would not hesitate to play rock n roll in a class of classical music, if it helps his students to understand and appreciate music better. Richard Dreyfuss is absolutely convincing in this role of Mr. Holland that spans 30 years of his career.Actually Mr. Holland is a composer who has taken up teaching just to pay his bills. He wants to be rich and famous and has been working on a symphony that would help him achieve that but that's not how it turns out to be. He is not rich and not famous, certainly not outside his small community. Is he a failure? The story of our lives (at least most of us).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Life is what happens when you're making other plans""","This is a line of the Beatles' song that Mr. Holland sings to his son, Cole, at a concert. I've seen this movie plenty of times, but for the first time, I noticed just how well this line resonates in this movie. In fact, this line is the basis for the movie, and could stand in for the whole movie in a pinch- except that we would be missing out on one of the most moving and inspirational films to come out of Hollywood in the past few years.Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a man who loves music, who practically lives and breathes music. We see at the beginning of the film, and throughout the rest of it, a man who is most passionate when he is within music. When his wife informs him that she is pregnant, he likens the feeling to falling in love with John Coltrane's music. When a student complains to him that he knows everything there is to know about music, Mr. Holland responds by reminding him that the name of his class is Music Appreciation and explaining forcefully that it doesn't matter how much you know about music if you don't appreciate it.The movie takes Mr. Holland through three decades- from the '60s to the mid-'90s. In the spirit of nostalgia films like Forrest Gump, we are guided through the decades by vignettes of archive footage depicting scenes such as Nixon announcing his resignation, Gerald Ford tripping down the stairs, and even good old Frankenfurter representing the sexual revolution. As a piece of nostalgia for those times and the days of high school, Mr. Holland's Opus works great. As a chronicle of a man's life and the impact he has on others, it works even better.This film could have turned into cheap schmaltz, but through its cast and a story that reaches wonderful poignancy and honesty at times, it manages to represent something so much more than that. Richard Dreyfuss, always a natural actor, is perfectly real and moving as Glenn Holland. I can't describe his performance in words, simply because it deserves to be seen more than just written about. And even though this is basically Dreyfuss's movie, the supporting cast makes an impression as well. Glenne Headly, as Mr. Holland's wife, shows tremendous resilience and emotion as the mother of a disabled child. When she explodes at her husband because of his lack of understanding, you explode with her, because we believe every word she is saying.I don't know if movies can change lives. I think some have the potential to. I know there are movies that can inspire their audiences to be better people- It's a Wonderful Life is one; Casablanca is another. While Mr. Holland's Opus does not reach the quality that those two do (and who can blame it?), it has a similar and near equal impact, and that is definitely a compliment. And how perfect- a movie about a man who changes lives that can also change lives.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The right formula...,"Covering 30 yrs of a person's life was always going to be hard, but this film manages it without interrupting the flow. Mr Holland, faced with everything to hold him back from completing his opus, more than impacts on his music appreciation class - from those who said they couldn't, to those who had to break free and try their hand at the city lights. I liked the subtle time changes with the cars and the aging characters. The Cole sub-plot was a little bit misplaced (although I can't see how else they could have done it) and overall the story was predictable, but it was an inspiring movie all the same.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Lighten Up, Folks.......","It's a MOVIE!  I'm reading comments so vastly polarized to one extreme or another so as not to be believed.Okay, I am a musician.  I've been one on a professional level for over ten years, both as a writer and performer.  And I LOVED this movie (apologies to all those pretentious 'serious' musicians out there).  I enjoyed my theatrical viewing and I have watched my DVD several times.Is MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS musically accurate?  No, of course not, no more so than STAR TREK paying attention to factual science and the laws of physics. But for the most part, nobody other than most of us ego-driven, high horse bound musician types will ever know it.Designed to have a broad appeal outside the aforementioned musically inclined crowd?  Yes, but then so is nearly every movie to come out of Hollywood.  It has to be palatable to a certain degree, and I believe that the much maligned ""Play the sunset"" scene is far more entertaining than having Mr. Holland give us lengthy exposition on the proper articulation and technique that goes into playing a given instrument.And if I hear one more poster scream about Mr. Holland's 'opus' only being ten minutes long (the ""It took him a lifetime to write THIS?"" mantra) I think I'll scream.  Did it ever occur to anybody that what we heard was only a small part of a much larger work?  Most classical and semi-classical pieces occur in (get ready) MOVEMENTS!  It's entirely possible that we only heard the prologue to a much larger piece.  Think outside the box, people.As for the quality of the piece itself, I found it to be acceptable, if not the most dynamic piece of work I've ever heard.  But seeing as how we had been hearing snippets of this piece THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I can't say that I was so overwhelmingly let down as some of our more 'educated and refined' musician types that have posted here.Sure, there were some flaws.  Ms. Headly is not the greatest actress in the world, and beside Dreyfuss she's downright embarrassing.  William Macy's character is so cliched that it warrants no further discussion.  The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long.  And the ending bit where the arts funding gets cut seemed a little too political.But overall, a great film, surely one of Dreyfuss' best, and one of my favorite films.I'm a musician.  And I liked it.  So sue me....",,Anonymous,Music
The Prime of Mr. Glenn Holland!,"Mr. Holland's Opus (MHO) is yet another entry in the canon of Hollywood films that deal with a gifted and dedicated teacher who by his example of decency, inspiration and personal character substantially improves the lives of his students. While Goodbye Mr. Chips is probably the best known of these films, Cheers for Miss Bishop and Good Morning, Miss .Dove also come to mind.MHO differs from the other mentioned movies because it includes the subordinate plot element of how a man whose world encompasses the sound of music must also cope with the challenge of raising a son who is deaf. The situation is rich in irony.Richard Dreyfuss leads a splendid cast in this old fashioned sentimental tale. His journey spans several decades. In the end---Mr. Holland comes to realize that the path he chose to teach others about the wonders of great music rather than attempting to create it himself--was the best road he could have taken. In this respect, he is not unlike the James Stewart character in It's a Wonderful Life---who came to know that helping to improve the lot of others is one of life's most lofty and fulfilling achievements---far more satisfying than acquiring material success.It is not now generally known that in the 2001-2002 season, Richard Dreyfuss appeared in his first television series--The Education of Max Bickford. In it, Dreyfuss plays an inspiring college educator who also has to deal with several important personal problems. While this series was not commercially successful, it received considerable critical acclaim. Could the charismatic role of Glenn Holland have provided either the motivation or inspiration for Richard Dreyfuss to venture once more into the world of striving to lead students into a better life through educating their minds?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Richard Dreyfuss' Opus,"I first saw this movie on video in late 1996, I was 19 years old and I thought that I would hate it.  What kind of sappy, sentimental crap was this?  Why should I like it?  Well, I'll tell you.  Its because this is the story of a man's life work and how he made a difference in the lives of those people around him.  I think that some day many years from now we would all like to look back and say that we made the difference in the life of even one person.  Dreyfuss gives us the performance of a lifetime as the titular Mr. Holland.  Watching him transform from a frustrated, half-hearted, hot-headed young teacher to a man of wisdom, compassion and caring is a wonderous sight to behold.  His battles with his hearing impaired son pull at your very heart strings.  Mr. Holland is a man we all know and love, he might not have been your music teacher but he/she was someone special in your life that made a difference in your education.  I was lucky enough to have a multitude of great teachers just like Mr. Holland that changed my life and made me appreciate the great place a teacher holds in our society today.  Mr. Holland's Opus might be silly and sentimental but I can't help but love this movie.  I'm not ashamed to say that I cry big crocodile tears everytime I watch it.  This movie hits you right where it feels good, it makes you proud to have shared this experience.  You were there to watch him grow and become the stuff of legend.

"Fine, touching but predictable","I liked the movie. I liked Richard Dreyfuss as a main hero, Mr. Holland, a Music Appreciation Class teacher. The movie is very true to the point when it speaks about teacher / class relations. I am a University teacher myself, and I surely do know what it is like to get a tight connection to the students' hearts, without losing either your integrity or your authority. I felt what Holland felt, I understood what he did wrong and what he did best. All his ups and downs, all his misgivings, wrong ideas for the class, bad relations with his hearing-impaired son, tough relations with the local educational authorities - everything is shown admirably well. Also, and it should be pointed out, the movie is especially good at the scope. The 30 years of the US history are shown briefly but very vividly and really well. What is really weak is the sheer predictability. Many Hollywood films are made this way - Good/Bad, Up/Down, White/Black. I mean, I could easily foretell when in the next scene Holland will have a problem or its graceful solution. Also, the grand finale is too sweet. I understand, Hollywood dictates the rules, so the serious film must have a refreshing, sweet final. But it was all too much. Too sweetish, too bombastic. Notwithstanding all that, in general, the movie is one of the few that really shows what teaching job is.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Teaching isn't easy,"Taking a position as a high school music teacher in order to pay the bills, an aspiring composer finds the job unexpectedly challenging but also unexpectedly rewarding in this Oscar nominated drama starring Richard Dreyfuss. The film gets off to a solid start with Dreyfuss discovering his every preconception of teaching challenged; there is no ""free time"", ""high school is not a democracy"" and it is absolutely impossible to leave campus at the same time as his students do. The movie missteps though by not spending more time on this section of his journey; before long, Dreyfuss transforms into an obsessively motivated teacher who has simply come to accept the demands of the job. A deaf son is eventually thrown into the mix to give Dreyfuss a chance to realise how his obsession with his job is negatively impacting on home life, but there is nothing especially novel or exciting about this plot development. A maudlin music score does not help matters either. In fact, were it not for its towering lead performance, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' would be difficult to endure. Fortunately, Dreyfuss is in fine form, credibly ageing over 30 years during the course of the movie. The film also does a good job capturing his reactions to various historical events over the three decades portrayed on screen (his grief over John Lennon's death is highly memorable). Whether this alone is enough to render the film worth viewing may vary per viewer. Clocking in at nearly two and half hours long, the film is not an easy, breezy watch, but fans of its lead actor might well find it worthwhile.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A beautiful film...,"The first time I saw this film was in the movie theater with one of my best friends--both of us musicians. By the time we left, both of us were bawling our eyes out.

I had a band director much like Mr. Holland when I was in middle school, a man who struggled at first as a teacher but soon became a beloved and inspiring director. Every time I watch this film I think of that man, and how he changed my life for the better.

Real issues, especially for those of us who grew up in the 80s and 90s when schools slashed budgets left and right and then wondered why this generation was so apathetic.If the movie was today the director would spend forever on the ""affair"" with Rowena and maybe throw in a gratuitous love scene.

"Make Them Shine, Holland!","A frustrated composer (Richard Dreyfus) finds fulfillment as a high school music teacher.At first, the story is not about teaching the students, but learning to teach. This is really about the growth of Holland and not such students as Lang. For anyone to learn, they must first care about what they are learning. So one can explain things clearly and get nowhere unless they present it in a context that sparks interest. (Indeed, one can imagine how many things they were ""taught"" and forgot until it finally became relevant to them.)And later we get the deaf angle. It seems a little forced and almost exploitative. But it does draw that interesting connection to Beethoven, who himself was deaf. How can one of the greatest composers of all time make music he was not able to hear?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
How a Music Teacher Digs Deeply to Help Teens Succeed,"This movie follows the career of a frustrated composer (played to perfection by Richard Dreyfuss) who couldn't earn a full-time living as a band member. The movie starts when he begins a new career as the music teacher at a small-town high school to pay his rent. He quickly comes to realize it's not only high school students who don't want to be in class, but also their teachers. A series of very unmusical students with a variety of motivations implore him to find a way to teach what appear to be hopeless cases to become competent at their instruments. This forces him to dig much deeper into the teens' psyche and his own soul to invent ways to help the teens succeed. I found it very admirable the way he learned to control his verbal responses to kids who seemed so untalented and so far beyond the possibility of redemption. He bit his tongue and came up with positive responses that were honest yet gently guided the teens towards the discovery of possibilities no one even knew that they were capable of. As the parent of a teen, I can tell you this is very hard to do, and I really appreciated the lesson the movie teaches by example! I found it very inspiring the way these experiences impacted the teens involved as they grew to adulthood and beyond, and I believe such lessons could be very impactful on junior high age students who may be struggling in one subject or another at school, and on their parents. I'd highly recommend this film to benefit the parents of kids in the 10 to 16 years of age range, as well as to junior and senior high school teachers of any subject.The story also shows how he inspires one very talented student, aptly played by the lovely Jean Louisa Kelly, to discover her inner voice and pursue her musical ambitions. To me, this film would have been worth seeing on the strength of her charming performance and beautiful singing voice alone. I think she'd make a great ingenue as Christine in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera, for example, and I hope she gets that opportunity some day. I'd also love to see her opposite Josh Groban performing a musical duet, that would be magical indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I saw Richard Dreyfuss in a bookstore while they were filming this.,"In September, 1994, my mom and I were in the checkout line in Powell's Bookstore in Portland, Oregon. There was a very short man in front of us. When we got up to the cashier, she identified the man as none other than Richard Dreyfuss. We turned around and sure enough, it was he.

Mr. Holland's Opus (1995) ***,"A heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss is the strongest asset of this good, though not great, movie. Dreyfuss was nominated for Best Actor in playing Glenn Holland, a young man who dreams of one day completing a memorable piece of great classical music. In order to make ends meet and feed his wife and deaf son, he must lower his standards by taking on a frustrating teacher's job at a high school. Holland initially has a tough time trying to interest his lethargic students in music appreciation, but his efforts ultimately pay off as he begins to make a difference in their lives. Spanning a period of 30 years from about 1965 to 1995, the film does not successfully realize that transition as well as it might have. For example, I was able to spot a number of chronological errors in how the montage of passing years was represented. But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Presented as a video biography, of the 30-year career of the eponymous lead character, Glenn Howard, who is a music teacher.Glenn Howard's journey is well-written and offers heartfelt moments, with a stellar performance by Dreyfuss. Stephen Herek directs this story with maturity. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score, are worth a mention.Dreyfuss earned a Oscar and Golden-Globe Nomination for his Performance here, for Best Actor, and deserved to. This is one of his best performances to date. He makes Glenn Howard memorable.On the whole, A Must for Dreyfuss fanatics.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
a bit long-winded,"I can see why this movie was such a hit, but it's a bit difficult for me to sympathize with someone who treats his kid so badly. Also, there are a couple of big errors which any musician should pick up instantly1) emotion is never a substitute for technique. Saying to a student in a lesson ""play the sunset"" just doesn't happen2) ""Stravinsky was the music of the Russian Revolution, so what do you think of that?"" says Holland to his uptight vice principal. Actually, no. Stravinsky was an emigre from the revolution, whose music was officially disfavored by the Soviet regime. They must have meant Shostakovich. (What the hey; they both begin with 'S')3) Mr. Holland's long-awaited ""American Symphony"" was a tad short to be called a symphony, and its musical qualities suggest it would work better as background music for an airline commercial than as a vehicle for the concert hall.Having said all that, the movie does have its moments. Its montage of news clips shows the passage of time quite effectively, and the growing friendship between Holland and the coach is nicely portrayed. Also Richard Dreyfus conducts quite convincingly; most actors who are called on to perform this arcane skill - Yul Brynner, Cary Grant, and John Cassavetes come to mind - do it wretchedly. Best line: ""We think our football team is lacking something, Mr. Holland.""  ""Yeah. Touchdowns.""",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreyfus's Triumph,"With all of the trashy, throw-away, so-called ""stars"" out there, a small handful of folks have always stood out on the basis of sheer acting talent. Richard Dreyfus is among them.I first got turned on to him with THE GOODBYE GIRL, and something just clicked. THIS was the Real Thing! After JAWS, I started looking for more... and promptly found a quirky, offbeat offering, THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ.Three wildly different roles... and all handled to perfection. THIS MAN IS AN ACTOR! After a succession of other roles, Dreyfus hit THE role, the one he can always be proud of... playing Glen Holland, the reluctant music teacher who came to love the profession that life and circumstances had forced him into.The greatest gift MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS gave to me was an appreciation for a person in my own life... for the first time in several decades, I thought of my personal Mr. Holland, band director Herbert Rifkind of Chicago Vocational High School. Mr. Holland and Herb Rifkind couldn't have been more different people; Herb had been part of the Marine Corps Band in Washington, and tho he'd moderated the military approach to one more suitable for dealing with high school kids, his band was a tight and precise machine, carefully trained with patience and love.Holland's ""marching buddy"" practice, and the sound of the drummer's Street Beat winding up at the start of the parade instantly took me back across decades... during halftime in a football game in Soldier Field in Chicago, steering 40 pounds of reluctant brass Sousaphone through a high wind while maintaining precise marching interval and cadence in the ankle deep mud, all the while struggling for perfection on the bass obbligato of ""The Stars and Stripes Forever""...We didn't do it for glory, or even for ourselves... tho we'd have never admitted it back then, the band did it right to keep from letting Mr. Rifkind down. Holland and Rifkind were alike in that way; he was our best friend on the faculty, and the one that we now remember with a special fondness.The Rifkinds and Hollands of this world probably have the most profound effect on their students of any high school faculty member; they give their kids something of VALUE that lasts a lifetime; an appreciation for music, and the self discipline that's needed to master a musical instrument or navigate life.Holland and Rifkind are very special people... simple men, doing a job that they love, but a job that affects every student they ever encounter for a lifetime. It was time that somebody made a movie about these unsung heros.Dreyfus did it RIGHT.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Pretty Good, but Not GREAT","Mr. Holland's Opus is a fine film in every sense of the word. It is well-acted, well-written, and fully engaging.

Misclassification,"What Low Man and others who have made similar comments fail to account for is that 7/8 of the movie-going public don't know a fugue from a fermata.Most of them like one or more of the musical genres, but probably can't say why, in musical terms.In any case, the movie isn't about the rarified and arcane nuances of music as an art. Its creators didn't aspire to see it cited in Grove's or a top musical journal. The film could have easily been about dramatics, fine art or any of the three r's disciplines. Each evokes passionate interest from students and claims some wannabee top performers in those fields as teachers, sooner or later. The film is about how one can release one's tight grip on self-aggrandizing dreams and find a gloriously satisfying life in service to others.

Sentimental Journey of a Music Teacher,"A stymied composer finds fulfillment as a high school English teacher (played by Richard Dreyfuss) in this overly sentimental film that is more about music than it is a musical.

Messy Melodrama,"The impact of a good teacher on all of society is undeniably a worthy subject matter for dramatization, but my goodness...this is some sappy, manipulative, melodramatic mediocrity.

The forced daddy-issues (though the ""Beautiful Boy"" performance is fairly effective). I'm a sucker for music movies and Richard Dreyfuss...making this all the more disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Great story with challenges and rewards,"I remember seeing ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" for the first time in high school. I liked it then, and still do. Films about teaching often involve tough kids and less than ideal teachers, among other things.  I have to say this film is an exception. Mr. Holland is an inspiration in so many ways that he does not realize or even want to acknowledge. It is also a story that could have taken place and that some people can relate to.  This is why I enjoyed it so much.Mr. Holland has a dream of composing a very memorable and moving symphony, and to ultimately be ""rich and famous."" But working odd jobs in pursuit of his dream doesn't appeal to him. Reluctantly, he takes a day job as a high school music teacher to support the family and at first hates it. His students are not motivated to learn through readings and tests, and do not respond well to the music of Bach. When he finds they love rock and roll, he integrates this into the curriculum, much of the disapproval of the administration, who believe ""rock and roll by its very nature leads to a breakdown in discipline."" He teaches and mentors many students over the years, from a clarinet student who doubts her talent and feels inferior to her musically talented family, to a wrestler who becomes a drummer, and a talented singer with her eye on him who wants to go to Broadway despite any barriers. Whether or not he knows it, Mr. Holland inspires them to do something worthwhile.Despite his love and talent for teaching, Mr. Holland cannot develop this same level of rapport and love with his wife Iris and son Cole, who is deaf. His desire for Cole to appreciate music is outweighed by Cole's inability to hear and his father's reluctance to help him. Cole learns sign language from his teachers and mother predominantly. Mr. Holland appears to be the kind of person who detests imperfection of any kind, and this strains his familial relationships. Gradually, though, he learns to accept and deal with these challenges, and becomes more loving and appreciative.I recommend ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" for musicians, singers, music teachers, and really everyone. Enjoy the show!",,Anonymous,Music
Let's Not Forget The Music Teachers,"Glen Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) was an aspiring musician and composer, but like most artists he needed to earn a living while striving for his big break. He chose to teach music at John F. Kennedy High School in Portland, Oregon while trying to compose his ""opus.""Mr. Holland took to teaching like a fish to water and he threw his entire self into it. And unlike many pedagogical movies, he didn't have to reform a classroom full of misfits.""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is an ode to teachers in general and music teachers in particular. In no small way this movie shows their sacrifices and their incredible responsibility. It's a fine movie even if it didn't really stir me. There was some drama with him having a deaf son and him dedicating so much time to teaching. I think this movie tried to represent a wider swath of teachers who are heroes without rescuing a class or a school from eminent collapse, but just subtly touch the lives of their students.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I did have my own Mr. Holland,"I just finished re-watching this movie. I first saw it in the theaters when it came out. I fell in love with it as my favorite teacher in high school was my band/choir director. As fate may have it, immediately upon arriving home from seeing the movie, I received a phone call asking to be part of the orchestra to celebrate the retirement of my favorite teacher. A special song had been written for him, so of course I dusted off my clarinet and before I knew it, I was part of my own Mr. Holland's Opus. I remember that evening and all the wonderful years surrounding this teacher each time I watch the movie. It still requires a box of tissues in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Good story for the unsung heroes of life  touching without being sickly sentimental,"Glenn Holland is a young composer.  In the fifties he stops touring with his band to teach music in a school which he hopes will free him from touring to allow him to work on his main love of composing his own music.  Despite initially hating his job, Holland soon learns to enjoy it and how best to communicate the love of music to his pupils.  We trace his life over 30-40years as he has a son with his wife and goes through great emotional times while putting his personal dreams to one side.Although this had `sentimental life lesson film' written all over it, I still wanted to give it a go and strangely still enjoyed it.  The film is very much a bit of praise for all those who are unsung heroes in there lives and it had the potential to be really sickly sentimental.  Happily a good script manages to avoid this for the majority of the time.The weakness of the film is the fact it that it does try to cover a lifetime and occasionally there isn't enough plot to do that well.  I know it would have been difficult but I do feel that the film could have been either a little tighter or filled to overflowing with plot to make it feel shorter. As it is it is still enjoyable but it does feel a little wandering at times  but I guess that's like life in a way.  When the climax comes though it is hard not to be a little moved by the lesson that the film is teaching us.However, the reason for the success of the film is also the reason for it's Oscar nomination  Richard Dreyfuss on good form.  He kept me watching even when the material was stretched.  He is totally believable in the role  for a microcosm of his performance watch his face when the announcement is made about the surprise they have prepared for him  his emotion got me right away!  He deserved his nomination for this as he is captivating over the whole film.  He even ages very convincingly and make up should be congratulated.  However while makeup were concentrating on Dreyfuss they totally forgot about Headly who doesn't age a bit until the final time period (apart from looking a bit tired).  She is badly miscast and she doesn't fit the role at all.  Thomas, Macy, Dukakis and Anderson (as the teenage Cole) all do well in support  but this is Dreyfuss' movie.Overall I enjoyed this.  I usually struggle with things like this because they pile the sentiment on thick like a daytime TVM.  Happily this script avoids that are the majority of the flaws are compensated for by a strong performance from Dreyfuss.",,Anonymous,Music
Heroes Among Us,"I have had a look at the comments posted here, both for and against it.Some of them are using such harsh and strongly worded language, that one may think they are talking about a life and death situation, or maybe the future of our planet, as we know it. Some others are so inane, that they are pathetic.We are talking here about movies, folks! You know those things which make you dole out a few bucks to be entertained. Of course, those bucks add up together to really BIG money and BIG business. In fact, movie producers may well be the highest rollers and gamblers in the world. Authorizing millions and millions of dollars to put together a bunch of snippets, which nobody can predict will bomb, or be a hit at the box office.Some viewers have dissected the minutae to such an extent, that it makes you think they just want to show off their knowledge of the movie making industry ,and its inner workings. Some others have elaborated extensively on the psychological aspects of the movie, making one wonder whether they are Freudians or Jungians.For me, this is a simple story of an ordinary man, trying to do the right thing, and doing his best to play the life  game by its rules, even if he has to let go in  a matter of minutes, his deepest dreams and aspirations, just for the sake of being decent. And that's where the real tour de force is, making such a great movie out of a common situation.There are many Mr Hollands amongst us, we just don't see them.I found it to be highly entertaining, and was surprised when 3 hours went by so quickly.I have no doubts that many others will feel the same way....",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A ""real"" story, if not a true one.","There are many profound places in this movie.  The best thing, for me, is that it doesn't over-glorify the subject matter.  Holland is never portrayed as a superteacher.  If he does find peace in his life choices, it's a process that takes years and years.  Another thing I liked is the transitioning from decade to decade.  We can't help but see that time is slipping by for Mr. Holland...and for all of us!I also appreciate that the school is shown as an average one.  It isn't a sparkling architectural gem, as in John Hughes' films, nor is it a pit of squalor, as in the first act of ""Lean on Me.""  The bureaucrats who oppose Holland are not villains.  The students are neither budding prodigies (in most cases); nor are they pitiful caterpillars struggling vainly to emerge from their cocoons.  In sort, Holland, his colleagues, his wife, son and students, are all REAL.Anyone who appreciates music (or who didn't appreciate their music teachers enough) will enjoy the singing (well, maybe not Richard's, but...)Glenne Headley was outstanding, too./r",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Symphony of the Heart,"I've now seen this movie twice.  I went to the theater to see it in 1995, and just watched it on cable again.  Though each viewing affected in a different way, I enjoyed both times immensely.  The first time I was fresh out of high school, a former high school music student myself, and found much to relate to in the high school/music aspect of the movie.  Now I'm 27 years old, and able to understand the movie in a much more ""adult"" fashion. This movie is a touching reminder that money and fame aren't necessary to achieve success in life.  Richard Dreyfuss plays his role as the reluctant high school music teacher as if he was born to it.  I love the way world events of the time periods (the movie begins in the 1960's and ends in the ""present"") are brought into the storyline.  Especially beautiful is the way John Lennon's death serves to bring Holland and his son together in a way they've never been able to be.  I personally think that Glenne Headley holds the movie together perfectly.  Her portrayal of Holland's wife is superb, lending the movie believability and heart.  I love the movie, but wouldn't recommend watching it often.  The ending makes the whole movie worthwhile, but leaves the audience in tears.  That's always the mark of a great movie in my book.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
lots of problems with this film,"I am immediately skeptical when a movie about music or a musician is made. That is not to say that such a movie can't be made well; Milos Forman's Amadeus (1984) was both entertaining AND accurate, at least in terms of script details which pertained to music theory, performance and literature. Mr. Holland's Opus, however, falls miles short of this goal.The myriad factual mistakes in the movie only lower my opinion.  For one thing, it IS normal (in fact, necessary) to empty the spit valve of a brass instrument in mid-performance.  For another thing, Mr. Holland lectures his students about Beethoven's deafness as if it were complete and nearly life-long, which it wasn't.Mr. Holland himself is, as a character, unlikable through the entire movie. He is a less-than-stellar teacher who lacks the patience to do anything besides yell at his less-than-stellar students.  He appears to be hard at work for a huge chunk of his life on this magnificent ""opus.""  Upon hearing his work at the end, his composition is revealed to sound like something a dime-a-dozen Hollywood filmscore writer would vomit out in a couple of hours time.This movie was made to appeal to devoted (however uneducated) music lovers. It's message is mixed, and therefor weak; at the end, the music program is cut from the school, resulting in not a victory for the community, but rather a tiny, meaningless, symbolic ""victory"" for Mr. Holland (who emerges only as victorious as finally hearing his mediocre ""opus"" performed live can make him).  Furthermore, the young clarinetist who Mr. Holland tries so hard to cultivate ends up a politician rather than a musician, which suggests to me that Mr. Holland's stint as an educator has been completely fruitless.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

The whole cast was wonderful, and you actually felt like you were in the 60s and 70s, unlike other films set in that time period.How often does a film come out that generations relate to; and a film so touching about a teacher who cares about his students, and vice versa?

Absolutely away from the regular cliches, every moment in the film wants you to know more and learn more... just like the films belief "" To teach is to learn twice"". Every time u feel that it is the end and from within u want more... the director gives it to u. Not only does the film teach u to respect your teachers but also opens your eyes to see the need for music and other arts as an important part of our curriculums. It speaks of not only a tear jerking relationship between Cole and Mr. Holland but also of his effect on the various characters he comes across. How he not only changes their lives for the better but also accomplishes in achieving his own dreams.

Being a high school band director myself I was surprised when I saw that Hollywood was doing a movie about a band director... not just the ""do good"" teacher, but a music teacher.Much of the movie stuck a familiar chord with me -- the ""free summers"" to make music (HAH!!), the arguments about how much time is spent away from the family. THe one part I found really unbelievable (at least for me) was the band and the football team SHARING the football field! LOL!! That doesn't happen for a lot of band directors I know!!WHen the movie came out this movie was all about my high school band director.

Richard Dreyfuss's best performance,"Sure. I'll admit, it was sappy. However, this movie is successful in that field. A lot of movies try to make you feel for characters (Autumn In New York) who are fantasy type characters that no one in real life is actually like. However, here, they've managed to give us a real person vibe in Glenn Holland. Holland, played like a God by Richard Dreyfuss, music composer by night, has just accepted a job teaching music at the John F. Kennedy High School in his town. His wife (Glenne Headley) is naturally happy for them. As time progresses more and more, Holland becomes more grounded in the profession he started off hating. Life begins to throw curveballs at Mr. Holland, one big one in the form of his son (which I won't spoil for you). Even Mr. Holland's brief encounter with one of his students is played out so well that you almost cry for both of them. The end is everything we've built up to. Some people may even cry. I just found the whole movie to be perfect. It was exactly what I look for in a movie, and I'll watch it again and again. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful movie.....,"I found this to be an uplifting movie and not at all tragic.It's about a man who has life happen to him while he's making other plans.Richard Dreyfuss shows again what a gifted character actor he is. From ""What about Bob?"" to ""Mr.Holland's Opus"", we see his incredible range from drama to comedy. He is one of the great character actors of his generation.Dreyfuss really puts his heart into this performance, like when he sings to Cole. You can see the sweat on his brow, and although he's no John Lennon, I thought his singing was pretty good.Also, in this age of techno wizadry, you can't always trust what you see on the screen, but it looked to me like he was actually playing the piano, in which case, another facet of this talented man.His character agonizes over a potentital relationship with a beautiful and talented student in a midlife crisis, but at the end makes the right decision.And the ending, it was so moving that even the cast had tears in their eyes, and I somehow don't think that was fake.The timeline of events from the 60's to the 90's was also excellent.Overall, a beautiful movie, and everyone put in a great performance.

Saved By Richard Dreyfuss,"Long, soggy gag fest that is nevertheless watchable thanks to the Herculean efforts of Richard Dreyfuss in the title role to make the rampant sentimentality bearable.Dreyfuss plays a music teacher who has a son and then acts like an ass toward him because he was born deaf. Much mucusy Hallmark soul searching follows, with father and son of course reconciling before the movie's over. And boy does it take forever for the movie to be over; director Stephen Herek takes what should have been a small character study and expands it to bloated epic proportions.Much to do is made about the magnificent opus of the film's title, supposedly Mr. Holland's masterpiece.

**** Required for All Teachers,"Finally, a realistic picture about teaching.Richard Dreyfuss is memorable as a new teacher in Mr. Holland's Opus.He begins a 30 year career as a music teacher in a large high school. He comes across his principal, Mrs. Jacobs, who demands a month of lesson plans in advance on her desk in the morning. Any teacher can understand what that is. Then, there is an assistant principal, devilishly played by, William H. Macy, who takes an instant dislike to Mr. Holland. He can't wait to""rat"" him out to Mrs. Jacobs.Seeing that traditional teaching methods are not working, Holland tries unorthodox ways which of course riles Macy.The irony that a music teacher would have a child who is deaf. Beethoven could best understand that frustration.When Mrs. Jacobs informs Holland of her retirement, she says something to him that all teachers would love to hear: ""You were my favorite teacher."" Of course, Macy becomes the principal and as the years pass,the two still have a contentious relationship, as their hair turns gray.Holland works on that forever opus and is almost ready to give everything up and run away with a student until common sense prevails.After 30 years, there are budget cuts and the Music Department will be eliminated. Sounds familiar in today's climate?Mr. Holland will be forced into retirement but not before a rousing tribute by his present and former pupils. One very special student appears and it's a delight to see how far she has come.Richard Dreyfuss, in a memorable Oscar nominated performance, is magnificent. He conveys the ideals of a teacher and what we have to go through.This is truly a welcomed film for its reality and emotions shown.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The finale literally gives me chills every time.I think the character of Mr. Holland resonated with me so much because he reminded me of several great music teachers who had a profound influence on my life (1970's). In a larger sense, he was typical of a LOT of the teachers in my day: dedicated, idealistic baby-boomers who were going to change the world by affecting one student at a time.The film succeeds in utilizing as its backdrop the American cultural & political landscape of the 1960s-1990's (Vietnam, civil rights movement, Watergate, etc).Kudos to the director and everyone else involved for getting most of the music stuff ""right"" - I'm a musician and I usually look for bad fake playing, inaccuracies, and anachronisms.Cheers to the late, great Michael Kamen for his wonderful score & especially ""Glen Holland's"" American Symphony: it contains musical ""quotes"" ranging from Copeland to Gershwin; to the final note from The Beatles' ""A Day In The Life""....yes, I realize John Lennon wasn't American ;-) ....One minor plot flaw: why couldn't The Governor just issue an Executive Order to restore Music Education funding?

Worse, it would have made me feel as if I'd taught my students nothing ... that they'd grown up to become tight-fisted penny-pinching hypocrites who would deny their own children the same experiences they themselves claimed to appreciate.

We are to think that Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is one of life's unsung heroes for changing the lives of young people through music, but he is merely unsung, a man of little achievement who does little more than feed our tax coffers while doing what those who cannot do, do: teach.Dreyfuss, who owes most of his carer to the overrated The Goodbye Girl (1977), tries, and fails yet again, to deliver an Oscar-worthy performance. Had he won for this performance, I would have lobbied stronger for making one actor a year give the award back.Here we get the story of a touring musician who settles into a teaching job for financial stability, and so he can compose music in his spare time, only to learn that teaching is fulfilling all its own. On the other hand, we don't see successful musicians or composers giving up their lives for teaching, so the entire premise is flawed. This guy is not a success, and is simply making the most out of failure, while the children he ""inspires"" are making the most out of their indentured servitude in the education system. The supporting cast, which includes the equally overrated Olympia Dukakis as the principal, makes this one of the worst big-budget films of all time.Not only do I recommend not watching it, but also disowning anyone who ever decides to play it when you have no choice but to watch it (such as if you are stuck at a friend's house and can't jump out the window to avoid it). If you must watch this film, please set your sights higher than the loser of a lead character did, and don't ever convince yourself you are so happy with so little.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful tale of one man's life,"To the person who ripped this movie because of its supposed injustice to music, I think you totally missed the point. This movie isn't about music and how it's taught. It wouldn't matter if Mr. Holland was a math, English, science, or music teacher. The whole point of the movie is to show the evolution of Mr. Holland as a man and teacher. Mr. Holland had a passion for music, he shared with others around him, and touched their lives. What is so wrong with that? And, I would have loved to have heard more of his composition, but do you really think it would be logical to spend 20 minutes of the movie listening to it? Yes it was a very important part of his journey, but this is still a movie, not a trip to the symphony. I thought it was a fabulous movie. It touches my heart every time I watch it and I would recommend it to anyone. As someone who is about to enter the teaching world, I think it is a wonderful example of how teachers who are passionate about their subject can influence and effect not only their students, but the community as well.",,Anonymous,Music
i have a question,What is the name of the song that Mr. Holland helps the girl practice. The one scene where she says the only thing that ever made her happy was because of her hair because it made her father happy. What was the name of that song she was practicing to play for the band later on in the movie. I would really like to know. I really enjoyed this film and the transition Richard Dreyfuess made from young to old. I feel he was a very great person for this part and showed audiences that he can still hold a movie on his own. I thought the music was especially well chosen. And one of my favorite scenes was the one where he taught that girl. I liked how he showed her how to play with out even telling her just let her think a moment and just take in the music.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
I loved it!,"This is my all time favorite movie, and I am NOT one to go for the sappy mush!  I think it was highly underrated!This is the story of one man.

Not perfect but a gem of a movie,"I wish to laud this film first for its structure as it could have slipped so easily into your standard TV-movie sentimentality--and it escaped.This is achieved by the superb acting by Richard Dreyfuss, and with a very strong and balanced supporting cast.  True, some of the characters were cliche but they were played ably.  I agree with someone here that Glenne Headly did an excellent job.  She was on an even playing field with Dreyfuss--great acting don't come into singletons usually.It is a movie not as much about accuracy in music as a gentle  condolences of all the unfinished dreams in all of us.  It is not about the opportunities we missed, the talents we ignored.  I will venture to say it doesn't matter if Mr. Holland had real talent or not.  To me, I see Dreyfuss' character not as a teacher intent on inspiring all his students into kodak ""aw shucks moments"", but a person who stuck to his decisions in life with integrity.Many cliches, ""pass the tissue"" moments were played with subdued thoughtfulness by Dreyfuss.  Great job!If anyone is accusing the movie as being manipulative while describing ""Forest Gump"" as ""emotionally honest"", then I will stand guilty and taste the sinful pleasure.  I, as an average joe, will identify more with Dreyfuss infinitely more than an unrealistic caricature (of human goodness) that Hollywood assembled.  Perhaps I have some inexplicable bias towards ""Gump"" due to it being a Hollywood fantasy about human goodness (with everyone around Gump flawed in some way but somehow redeemed by his purity), which is the diametrical opposite to ""Holland""--a realistic portrait of a less-than-perfect human.",,Anonymous,Music
Simply one of the finest movies made.,"Once in a generation a film comes along that reminds us about that special person who makes such an impact on our lives, and the lives of so many others, while remaining unaware of the effect that they have had. In the 1930's it was ""Goodbye Mr. Chips."" In the 1940's is was ""Good Morning Miss Dove."" And now comes ""Mr. Holland's Opus."" These three films have one thing in common. They cover a lifetime of teaching and the effect it has on the teacher as well as the students they have come into contact with.Richard Dreyfus creates a bravura performance as Glenn Holland, and should have won the best actor Oscar for his role, even as Robet Donat did in ""Goodbye Mr. Chips."" This film was special to me for two reasons. I had a chorus teacher in high school had affected me in such a way as Mr. Holland did his students. And years later I had the opportunity to work with and teach Drama to young people from age six up. I have seen this story from both sides, and it still affects me so very much.My only argument with the film is in the final scene. If the Governor was so dedicated to Mr. Holland why did she not do something about retaining the music program in that school? It is a small plot point, but I was curious. All in all though this is a wonderful film, and should be in everyone's film library. It earns two thumbs up from me.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Poignant film,"Mr Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a frustrated musician and composer. He is frustrated at his teaching job. It was supposed to be temporary to pay the bills. But the years pass, his life passes, and he feels he has achieved nothing. But what he discovers is that his life has meaning for all those he has touched over years.This is definitely one of those feel good movies. The individual stories are memorable. The feeling of lost palpable. The moment when he finally connects with his deaf child. That was powerful. All the stories are poignant. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly suited as the old disillusioned teacher. It's a good cry movie all the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

another feel-good film,"'Mr. Holland's Opus' is the classic student-teacher relationship film. (This film is similar to 'Renaissance Man'; replace a few keywords in the plot, and you basically get the same story.) Mr. Holland feels like a failure, and he has the desire to create a musical masterpiece. In order to pay the bills, he gets a job as a teacher at a school, and he teaches them how to appreciate music; this allows them to learn how to appreciate life. Simply, this film is another example of one of those feel-good films that fills you with a lot of hope. It moves a little slowly, but I think it succeeds in providing the viewer with a sense of hope. Not an excellent film, but it is not a great one either.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is my favorite in the world!,This movie is wonderful because it touched me by my heart and I am proud to be deaf.

That movie is showing us more respectful to us deaf people out there that makes us very happy and touched by our hearts and proud to be a deaf person signs like Cole is. ASL is the best language for us deaf people out there to communicate easily. We are proud to be deaf since birth and growing up to communicate with the hearing people to be friends and teach them how to sign. It's fun.

Great film that brought back a lot or memories,"I think this is probably the best thing Richard Dreyfus has done. The story was great and reminded me of a teacher I had in high school who taught me the most important lesson of my entire life, as did Mr. Holland with Gertrude.The scene of the funeral and later the death of John Lennon were very apropos to the story line. And when Holland learns that his own son loves music its just gets that much better.I have and will continue to recommend this movie to anyone who will listen. Its a wonderful story of a man trying to cope with life and ending up impacting 100's of lives along the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The script, the actors and the performance was wonderful and the tears flowed as the time passed until the delightful ending. The loss of dedicated individuals in the teaching profession was so clearly shown and demonstrated as the story unfolded. Many  will have a Mr. Holland who helped form there approach to life.

For Music Lovers,"I've read some of the reviews here and I'm inclined to think a group of crabby, miserable no-life's got together and decided to low-rate and bash this movie on silly, ridiculous grounds. Some say they ""hate"" this movie and are ""offended"" by it. Um, really? This is among the most non-controversial movies you will ever see, lol. To ""hate"" something so light-hearted says A LOT more about you than it does this film. But I digress...I just caught this movie on television and was reminded of how much I enjoyed it back in '95 when it was released. What a delight. As Mr. Holland says in the movie, music is not something you ""know,"" it's something you appreciate, something you feel. I think this is a sentiment that especially applies to those commenters who ""hate"" the movie because it's historically inaccurate. My response: WHO CARES? The supposed inaccuracy does NOT take away from the theme or the intention of the film. The film is intended to evoke inspiration and sentimentalism and it does precisely that. It's a smart movie, but it's not at its core a ""thinking"" film--it is a FEELING person's movie. Like most great movies, its power is that it touches you on the inside. You totally miss the boat if you think about it too much or nit-pick here and there.If you love music and learning and passion and reflection, this movie is for you. Please don't be fooled by the ridiculous low-rating of 7 here. It's an absolute tear-jerker--I cried twice and I'm not a boo-hooer--and a feel-gooder. If you have a pulse and you're not an ""accuracy"" snob, you WILL enjoy this film and I recommend adding it to your DVD collection.

Beautiful and touching,"Mr. Holland's Opus is a lovely and engaging film about a musician and composer forced by life to get a 'real job'. The movie skillfully takes place over many decades and is tied together by the music of each generation.

Movie about life not about teaching music,"This movie - while it says a lot about the profound effect music and music teachers can have upon people - has more to do with Holland's life as it relates to those with whom he's interacted. I don't discount the need for the music profession to need a movie to stand up for it. In fact, those who haven't had experience with this area of education may find the movie enables them to relate to the meaning music has played in others' lives.However, I encourage all who read this post to investigate the possibility that a modern movie can speak to the magic of life itself, and the meaning thereof. I won't give away the story, but I think all who watch with this perspective will find the movie more deep than at first glance.

For People Who Love Music,"Mr. Holland's Opus is very entertaining movie to watch.  This movie is perfect for people who enjoy music and love to perform it.

"Brainless, and therefore unemotional","Our society seems to care much more about sport than about music.  Compare the relative prestige of Mr. Dreyfuss and the football coach.  Hell will freeze over before the latter will be forced to suffer the indignities of the former.  But `Mr. Holland's Opus' is just one more indignity - yet another illustration of our lack of respect towards music.Mr. Holland's opus - titled `American Symphony', as if no American had ever written a symphony before - is a bare two minutes long.  It's also twaddle. Holland has reinforced an ordinary, unchallenging tune with schlocky drum beat as if he's afraid we won't be able to tell where the bar lines fall without help.  THIS is what he's been working on all his life?  Ten minutes, MINIMUM, is what we should have had to sit through - ten minutes of GOOD music - if the film was going to be at all serious about paying music the kind of respect we pay sport.It's for this reason we're glad that Mr. Holland gives up his pipe-dream of being a professional composer and in favour of a profession where he might actually do some good; the trouble is, he's not a very good teacher, either. Yes, people are inspired by him, but that's because the script is rigged. Observe:(1)  As his music reveals he has no quality control.  His supposedly enlightened appreciation of the Beatles, for instance, carries no weight at all, since he's one of those tiresome people who like everything.(2)  He's forever having stupid ideas.  He gives a concert for the deaf - BEFORE political correctness of this kind was fashionable enough to give him some kind of an excuse.  He wastes public money on a ludicrous screen of flashing coloured light bulbs that's meant to give deaf people some idea what they're missing ... I mean, really.(3)  He confuses Stravinsky with Shostakovich.(4)  He gives absurd - nay, incomprehensible - advice to students, asking a clarinettist to imagine a sunset and then `play the sunset'.  I can imagine the composer bounding into the room and bellowing, `I wrote a SONATA, not a damned sunset.'The entire movie is just a re-statement of the old chestnut about music being an expression of emotion.  Well, that's NOT what music is.  Music is an intellectual art.  Even the `simple' delight we take in a good tune - not that the film provides us with very many of those - is an intellectual pleasure.  And here's the rub: because we are never called upon to use our brains, because the film never shows us the complicated mechanics of REAL musical instruction or music, we can't understand Mr. Holland's emotional involvement to his craft, either.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie about dreams,"Okay, I know this movie goes off the sentimentality, sappy, manipulation chart, and I should be ashamed to be a big 51 year old man fighting the tears when I watch it by myself on my big screen TV down in the basement, but -- well, sue me -- I like this movie.  As someone once said, what is happiness but your dreams?  Those of us who are a little older may reflect on the unrealized dreams of our youth, but although some of those dreams went unrealized, some of life's events still turned out to be a lot richer than we would have ever expected.  The look on Glenne Headley's Iris as she comes to grips with who ""Rowena"" is (see the movie and remember her look) gave me chills.  When Glenn Holland later says ""I love you"" and she says ""I know"" -- now that's a realized dream that beats being on stage at Carnegie Hall.  Relax, don't be too critical and enjoy.  I give it an 8.9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Music
An excellent movie,"This is a film you can watch several times over. It covers thirty years in the life of Mr. Holland, a musician who turns to teaching in a high school in 1965, to give himself time to compose. But of course the teaching takes over.RIchard Dreyfus does a great job portraying a man who loves music, and learns that he loves teaching, as well. William H. Macy is perfect as the vice-principal we all knew and could not stand. The rest of the cast, and the music, is very enjoyable. A nice ending.The film is long, and takes its time developing the characters and the times. Impatient types may get fidgety. There are many good scenes reflecting '65, '75, '85 and '95 in high schools. Including the budget crunch in our schools and the cut of arts and music programs.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Riveting ""Over the top"" tear-jerking formula.","How many ""teachers save our youth"" movies can you watch? ""To Sir with Love"", Blackboard Jungle"", ""Saving Forester"", and so on and so on. Since you ask, At least one more time.Mr. Holland wants to write music and believes that teaching will give him free time to compose. Slowly he gets sucked into the teaching environment and eventually, this becomes his focus to the exclusion of his deaf son. Will he see what he is doing? Will he care? Or maybe skip town with a talented singer (Rowena)?This well-paced film does not save hooligans but enriches an otherwise droll school experience and encourages more than just the basics.A twist on the standard formula is the emphasis from the beginning of Holland more than a student or two. We see how he learns from the school environment and incorporates his life into the life of the school. Richard Dreyfuss is the main character who may overshadow good acting by Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy among others. There are several inspiring moments and some sobering moments.In all, it is worth the time and you will want to watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Dreyfuss, Tried And True","I felt that this Dreyfuss film offered quite a poignant look at the responsibility of a personal sacrifice and impact a teacher can have on his students beyond any classroom. It's not like the movie 'Stand and Deliver' at all, but it does remind me of 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Richard Dreyfuss gives the performance of his lifetime, as he did in his movies 'Always' and 'The Golden Girl'. In 'Mr. Holland's Opus', Dreyfuss plays the wily Glenn Holland who often is frustrated and breathes life into the character. The film, itself, seems to play Glenn as this flawed individual, especially in regards to his inappropriate relationship with a student named Rowena (actress Jean Louisa Kelly) and this of course leads to him not paying attention to his son Cole's social development. The movie is definitely worth watching, particularly during those moments of inspiration when Holland discovers his love of teaching.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Baby Boomer's Opus,"Mr. Holland's life is punctuated by the overtly boomer exponent of Vietnam, and John Lennon is constantly revisited like a worn out coda. Yet the producers try to instill some musical integrity by making a reference to John Coltrane, an irrelevant figure for most boomers and especially Mr. Holland as not one Coltrane song figures in this movie. But more importantly Elvis's death goes unmentioned, who arguably influenced rock and roll far more than the over-commercialized, chocolate box, Brit-pop of the Beatles or the period pieces of the anti-war activists of the late 60s and early 70s.Why is this? First, Elvis only spoke to the very earliest of the baby boomers as he himself actually preceded the boomers. By the 60s he was largely making movies and had been replaced by the British Invasion. Second, Elvis was intensely patriotic by most boomer standards having served his draft notice instead of burning the card. And yet I have a hard time distinguishing Mr. Holland from his boomer pupils.The biggest irony is Mr. Holland's performance of Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy"" which serves as a reconciliation with Cole. Not only does it raise serious questions about Mr. Holland's inspiration since he borrows someone else's material to express his deepest emotions, but Lennon released this song on his last album before his death which he wrote for his son, Sean, not the estranged Julian. And juxtaposed to this is Julian Lennon's performance of ""Cole's Song"" which also raises more questions than it answers.Thus, it is easy to see that Mr. Holland and his students are merely archetypes for John Lennon and his boomer fans. Plain and simple. Whatever that has to do with Beethoven, music in general, or inspirational teaching for that matter, I have no idea.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Richard Dreyfuss' Best,"Richard Dreyfuss received an Oscar nomination in 1995 as the title character, a man who decides to teach so he will have more time to write music and conduct.  Of course he learns real quick that teaching is time-consuming and that he has no extra time at all.  The plan to teach for a few years turns into a career and the audience gets to experience all of the teacher's ups (a son being born, learning to love his work, creating a top-notch music and arts department) and downs (learning his son is deaf, learning of the death of one of his former students in Vietnam, and learning that his department's funding will likely be cut, forcing him to retire before he wants to).  ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" works because of a great performance by Dreyfuss.  He makes everyone else in the film better as well (Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas, Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, and Louisa Kelly).  The direction is strong and the screenplay is even stronger.  A great film.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Music
A masterpiece not only for the music...,"I have heard a lot about this movie when it was aired on TV last spring. 2 months ago I finally had the chance of watching it full and, it surpassed my expectations a LOT.Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a frustrated composer that decides to switch to teaching. So he gets assumed in Kennedy High School (the movie begins in 1965) and the first times he wants to leave the job but is forced because of his economical situation after the birth of his son Cole. His dedication, however, will manage to earn the sympathy of his students to the point that headmaster Helen Jacobs convinces him to make the school band. All goes well until the parade: Holland's wife notices that their 3-year old son has become deaf. So Glenn works also in the summer as a driving instructor and his way of relating with students will cost him some trouble in the family. Towards the end (in 1995) he is forced to go in early retiring because of lack of school money, but all his most affectionate students will organize a concert where they play the symphony he never managed to play on stage.I loved this movie for the following reasons. The story was great and covered also 30 years of American history told by the perspective of a normal guy. The acting is phenomenal. Richard Dreyfuss has never been better than in this movie, and for me he should have won the Academy Award back then, while the others are all good. But what I loved most is the soundtrack that was more than great... it was MARVELLOUS! Especially the symphony at the end made me feel on the verge of tears it was that good.Not a biopic based on a real person, but overall a nice movie covering 30 years of a person's life with his highs and lows where you feel really concerned for the characters.

Heart-warming but flawed,"This is a lovely film, designed successfully to bring tears to the eyes of everyone seeing it. The acting is superb all the way around. Dreyfuss is a wonder. But there are quite a few historical flaws (see the goof section on this film) and mistakes. The lack of synchronization between the musicians and the music is maddening. The caliber of playing is far too high for the age-level of the players in the later stages of the film. And the absolutely stunning Jean Louisa Kelly was too old and too good to be a high school student. (She had recently graduated from Columbia University.) The film is also too long. A treacly bit about a black student who lacked rhythm and then died in Vietnam could easily have been skipped. By the way, at the funeral, the parents of the young man are shown in mourning. But sitting next to them, ostensibly a relative, is a young woman who is smiling during both shots of the family. That's the kind of carelessness that marred this otherwise fine film. One more thing: teachers will know that it isn't that easy to win the hearts and minds of young people. Mr. Holland as an educator must have doing things off camera.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Like reading a series of sentimental Hallmark cards with no substance behind them, no development that would make these moments seem real and authentic.

a thinking man's picture,"Clearly, Mr.  Holland's Opus is a film that intends to document the changes that occur throughout the life of a remarkable man.  In doing so, the film does rely heavily on improbable and schmaltzy plot devices (particularly the ending).  That said, this film is so well written and staged that only the most jaded viewer could avoid being swept along with the drama.Both the intentional use of real historical events, and the theme accidental and unintentional heroism beg a comparison to ""Forrest Gump"".  This film is infinitely superior to Gump, however, because it deals with success in terms of great moral acchievment.  ""Gump"", for all of its overrated praise, merely shows Gump gaining material wealth.  Moreover, ""Holland's"" bitter sweet ending is not merely tacked on, but is the logical result of the educational policies of this country.  This film celebrates the great American sense of community by elevating a teacher to heroic status.  This film is truly a wonderful acknowledegment of the hard work put forth every day on on behalf of our children by teachers.  This film is about real Americans, and needn't stray into the utterly fantastic to fill us with a se4nse of wonderment at the life led by Glen Holland.  This is ""Forrest Gump"" for thinking people.

"Okay, so it's predictable and sentimental","Maybe I just needed a break from watching too many Bergman movies, but I liked this sentimental and predictable movie covering thirty years in the life of a high school music teacher. High school being in my distant past, this movie brought back a lot of wistful memories. Even something as simple as remembering how the vacant hallways turn to chaotic madness at the sound of a bell was cause for nostalgia.The teacher in question, Glenn Holland, gets into the profession in order to have a day job while he works on composing. But the job eats up most of his time and, when he and his wife have a child, his early dreams have little chance of ever being realized. Many people back into life-long jobs and, as Mr. Holland, they grow into their professions and find them rewarding.Most everybody has memories of good teachers, and Glenn Holland will probably bring them to mind. That in itself makes this movie worth seeing. We don't have all that many movies about teachers, so there is room for one more. In fact we have very few movies that concentrate on any profession in a serious way. In many movies it is hard to figure out just how people are making their livings.Richard Dreyfus' performance is what raises this movie above the average. Tracing a life over a period of thirty years is always a challenge and that challenge was met here, both in terms of capturing the cultural changes from 1964 to 1995 and in terms of Dreyfus' physical appearance and emotional outlook.The story is pretty predictable, but, hey, think of all of those sports movies where the home team wins in the final scene. This movie has more substance than most of those movies that seem to be churned out on a weekly basis.I have to say that the talent in this high school far exceeds anything that I recall in my high school. Holland has his orchestra sounding like a first-rate community orchestra. And the Gershwin review was far from amateurish - enjoyable in its own right. In my high school of over 3,000 students we had nobody to compare with the voice and poise of Jean Kelly.There are some good scenes, like the one where Dreyfus urges Kelly to take the risk and follow her dreams and go to New York to pursue a singing career. That scene ends with Dreyfus staring into space with a melancholy gaze - is he regretting that he did not take the risk he is encouraging Kelly to take, or is he realizing that he never had a talent comparable to hers? I thought that Holland's having to struggle to teach the black kid how to find the beat was a good touch.If you can put your critical thinking on hold just a bit, you will enjoy this.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Someone got carried away after watching an episode of ""The Wonder Years.""","It is amazing that this movie is held in such high regard considering its abundant mediocrity. It does have an engaging cast, but the story and writing are unbelievable or cliché. There is more authenticity in any episode of ""The Wonder Years,"" which seems to have been a stimulus for the writer to scribe a high school teacher's soap opera set against the realism of the turbulent '60s. I would be astounded to find out that any part of this movie was based on anyone's actual experience as a teacher. As devoted as teachers may be to their thankless profession, the prospect of a teacher so removed and distant from his hearing impaired son is ludicrous. There is no believable explanation for this strained relationship. If Mr. Holland had a hang up because his son was deaf--guilt, anger, etc., the film makes no such connection.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
a gem,"This was one of Richard Dreyfuss's best roles to date. He gives a terrific performance in the title role as the film covers approximately 30 years in his career as a high school music teacher, a job he reluctantly takes when he can't seem to get his music published.

Orchestra teacher dying,"My daughters orchestra teacher is dying, Mr. Mark Sutterland. He has taught in Negaunee Michigan for over 20 years. He has taken the kids to England every 5 years. Mr Hollands Opus was his mantra. He loved(s) Richard Dreyfuss and has commented on him MANY times (and Opus) during performances and concerts. If there is any way for this message to reach him (Richard that is) please see that it does. He only has about a week or so to live, he was diagnosed with cancer when my daughter and the orchestra went to Europe several years ago. They thought they had cured it but it came back, very aggressive. His former student came up here to teach his classes because he meant so much to them. If you could call RIchard, or send a card anything.... for the years of dedication he has done we would ALL appreciate it. I must be perfectly honest in saying ""Always"" was my favorite movie. But Mr. Sutterlands was Opus, please, I don't know how to reach you, the church will be going over to his house this week to sing for him. the Orchestra class built him a ramp so that he could stay at home. If Mr. Dreyfuss reads this, please contact him. Mark Sutterland, Negaunee Michigan. Before, I submit this I must say that Mr. Sutterland is an amazing violinist. My daughter left his class the year he quit teaching permanently. He would hand out a batton (?sp) to all of the kids graduating from orchestra, Ashley had been there from 4th grade till 11th. It was very difficult for her to give up. Please if anyone see's this that know's Mr. Dryfuss...because I obviously don't, make contact with him....he deserves it, and has earned it.

"Not my normal cup of tea, but well done","My Age: 13Glenn Holland, played by Richard Dreyfuss, takes a job teaching music at John F.Kennedy High School to pay the rent while in his spare time he is composing a musical piece.  He struggles to settle in at first but then manages to get his students more interested in the subject.  The film takes place over several years of Mr Holland's life after that.I don't normally enjoy dramas, I prefer action movies or comedies, and there are only a select few dramas which I find to be good dramas, and this is one of them.  Along with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Apollo 13"", Mr Holland's Opus is one of the better dramas around.  It is a very well done film, with a good central performance by Richard Dreyfuss.

"Cliches, inept music, and bad acting - oh what fun.","My first complaint is one that can be applied to almost every popular movie about music, to whit, a movie about someone who has a passion for music should have competently written music in it. Also, there should be no flaws in musicology. If one is not going to get every detail right on music, one should make a movie about dinosaurs or middle-aged housewives meeting old college flames or hard-hearted cynics finding a spark of warmth in the world. One who is not willing to understand that in music, more than in any other field (besides rocket science), the devil is in the details.However, that having been said, there are movies (Amadeus comes to mind) where the history and music were inaccurately portrayed but still worked as movies. Mr. Holland does not make up for the shortcomings. It is clicheed, poorly scripted, and not well acted. I cannot say that there is a great movie about passion for music driving a composer. Probably because popular romantic notions about artists and composers are silly and wrong to begin with, a movie based on such a flawed premise is destined to fail. Music is interesting, so study music, study music theory, study music history. Learn what makes good music good and bad music bad (it is not all that subjective). Do not waste time on inane pap like Mr. Holland's Opus.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

A Nice Movie About the Importance of the Arts in Schools,"I like the intent behind this film. Having been a teacher for well over forty years, I know that there is a serious connection between success in school and life and arts education. This is a story of a dedicated teacher (although he is dedicated to the exclusion of just about anything else, including his family). He is played by Richard Dreyfuss and he does quite well, although Dreyfuss seems to play the exact same personality in just about everyone of his films. He touched on classical music before as a young pianist in ""The Competition"" with Amy Irving. Of course, his superhuman portrayal is almost a bit beyond the efforts of the most dedicated teachers. The one thing I do have trouble with is his close relationship with a couple female students. I know that even in the time of this film, Mr. Holland may not have an opus; he would have had another number in front of his picture. He was playing with fire. But all that aside, it portrays an excited, dedicated person who touched the lives of others.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Living with the sadness as well as the joy,"I can't think of too many movies that transition so beautifully over a long period of time. 30 years in the case of ""Mr Holland's Opus"".Much of this is down to Richard Dreyfuss as Mr Holland. He seems to age in an unselfconscious manner, covering not only the time span, but also the emotional range.Mr Holland starts out a little self-focused, but grows in character as he overcomes the hurdles life throws up. He wanted to be a composer, but becomes a music teacher. From an ordinary teacher he becomes a good one and then an inspirational one. His dreams for his only child are shattered, but eventually their relationship becomes stronger through adversity. As he begins to take his wife for granted, he is drawn to a young student whose freshness contrasts with the difficult period he is experiencing. However, he realises where his heart lies, and his relationship with his wife is strengthened.There are many lump in the throat moments in the film, because it's so easy to relate to.No doubt liberties were taken with some of Mr Holland's teaching methods, but the film celebrates a love of music as was Mr Holland's intention with his students.Along with the music of the era, Michael Kamen's score carries us seamlessly through the highs and the lows. I'm sure any film composer would have loved to have composed the music for the film as it is more integral to the story than most scoring assignments.Richard Dreyfuss has obviously handled some demons in his life, but he has also made some profound observations on the art of acting and filmmaking that sum it up better than just about anyone I've ever heard.His intuition and insightfulness helped him bring Mr Holland to life.""Mr Holland's Opus"" captures a truth that was summed up perfectly by Elia Kazan in discussing the work of playwright William Inge, ""He had learned from his own life that you have to accept limited happiness, because all happiness is limited, and to expect perfection is the most neurotic thing of all; you must live with the sadness as well as the joy.""",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Masterpiece,"An all-star cast headed by Richard Dreyfuss traces the 30 year career of a music teacher. Glen Holland is a composer who takes a job as a high school music teacher as a waystop. His initial days are a flop as he is unable to inspire his students. He begins to put more into his work and slowly but surely his classes and the school band become more time consuming and successful as his composing is pushed to a side project. He and his wife, played by Glenne Headly have a son who it turns out is deaf. This is a crushing blow to a man whose whole life revolves around the sound of music. He has no idea how to reach his son and neglects him. The years go by and the episodic events go on, but these are not just throwaway scenes as they advance the notion that one man's work is not just what he himself produces but what he inspires other's to do with their own lives.

Hatefully Trivial,"I didn't write about this film right after seeing it because it made me so mad that I knew I'd be overly harsh with it.It has now been many years, and I just looked over the comments already made, and I wasn't going to add anything until I saw one recommending lightening up on the film.Why? One reason given is that of course it's not musically accurate, but it's no more inaccurate than Star Trek or Star Wars is to actual science. I can't argue with the bare facts of that statement, but...I don't think anybody seriously believes there are Jedi running around fighting evil with light sabers or that there are hand held phasers out there. It's fantasy, and that's understood. Nearly everybody who isn't deprived of the ability to hear music knows about it, though.My chief hatred of this movie lies in the fact that it perverts what a lot of people think music is. I have had more than one student say something like, ""I thought I just had to play the sunset."" Many people with such impressions will give up when that fantasy is shattered, and some under my tutelage have.Star Trek and Star Wars never set a potential scientist on a false path like that. I even remember seeing specials on either the History Channel or A&E about scientists who were motivated by what they thought might be possible in those shows. The fantasy inspired in that case. It did not create a false expectation.What this movie has to say about music and being a musician is trivial when it is not dead wrong. That is not simply bad, it is hateful.A far better movie for dealing with this topic is a French one called ""Tous les matins du monde"", and I commented on that one at this address:http://imdb.com/title/tt0103110/usercomments-19It's not a film you can show your kids, but the whole musician conundrum is handled with far more subtlety and truth.I know that there are plenty of other examples of Hollywood inaccuracy as far as film topics go. James Bond has little to do with real espionage. Rambo is not anything close to realistic as far as being a soldier goes.Becoming a soldier or a spy, though, probably isn't something you try to become until long after such illusions are discarded. I have had adult students come to me thinking ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is completely accurate. One even asked me if I knew whatever became of Glenn Holland.The piece of music at the end is pretty bad too, but I figured that was going to happen. There's an awful lot of music I hate that the general populace seems to love, but that does not trigger my revulsion for this film. The lack of reality also doesn't do it. ""Amadeus"" doesn't have a lot of factual accuracy in it either, but I still find it entertaining.It is the trivialization of what music is and what being a musician means that gets to me. If they had just tried to make an entertaining movie, I probably would have found it OK, but this contemptible piece of twaddle trivializes something that needs more serious attention, and I can't forgive that.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Great struggle as a teacher,"Mr.Holland started his teaching career very poorly but as he went on he learned how to become a very good teacher. He wanted to go in and be a dictator, go in and tell the student's to do this and do that. But after speaking to his wife he learned how to make it fun by relating what he wanted to teach to things the students liked. The issue with the girl who was bad at playing the clarinet, he pulled her aside and used his time (i.e. After school) to teach the girl. I think this is a good way of getting students to catch up to the rest of the class. If you truly want to be a good teacher you have to put in the time during your own time. If I have students lagging behind I don't plan to stop the whole class and teach at their level because that is not fair to the smarter students. I would assign different work, give extra help to the students who are finding it tough until they have an understanding and do the same level of work the smart kids are. Mr.Holland was motivated by his wife, I can't recall their conversation but she said something to him that made him tick that he had to teach on a different level. I don't know how to get teachers who have lost interest in the job to become motivated again. Maybe for these teachers it is better if they give the job up and move onto something that they are highly motivated to do. Maybe they could ask the student's how they want to learn it could turn out that their definition of fun is yours and that could re-light the spark that has gone. I believe that this is a true interruption of teaching, of course not all teachers but I would bet that there were and are teachers who are completely frustrated by the job and want to give it in straight away without really giving it ago. That those teachers find something that makes them get up in the morning and really look forward to going to work and being infront of those students. I don't have the magic answer to what that is because I think that it is a personal thing that in no way is the same for everyone. We all need to find what makes us go, we are all here now learning to be teachers so we all have some sort of drive to be here, we just have to keep that drive going when we graduate and get a job and then I think we'll all make excellent teachers. I think I've gone on enough now, if anyone wants to discuss what I wrote I look forward to reading your letter. After all that's what this discussion list is all about.

One of the best movies,"This is a great movie and is one of my favorites. It is great about music and deaf people. This is the best Dreyfuss movie, I love how he played a teacher and a dad of a deaf son. To some people some parts of this movie could be emotional especially with the ceremony for a former student that got killed in war. The end is the best part. This was ranked as the best movie of 1995, I think Richard Dreyfuss did an excellent job on the role of Mr. Holland. It also has a couple funny things in it. I love the songs in this movie, I also like how it's based on a 30 year story. I love seeing how they age and how much the school changes from 1965-1995. This is a great story I recommend this movie to all families and definitely schools. This is a movie I never get tired of. This is a great movie for anyone to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I guess I'm just an old softy...,"... because I really love this film. If I have the opportunity to see it, I'll usually sit down and watch it every time. And I never played an instrument in my life and I can't read a note of music. I had some great teachers in my public school years, but they weren't music teachers. In fact, the music teachers I came in contact with were human oddities with scary hair trigger tempers. But I digress.Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a professional musician who decides to take a job teaching music at the recently renamed JFK High School in 1965. He did this not because he wanted to teach, but instead he wanted lots of free time to work on his own composition.But teaching turns out to be more than a 8-4 M-F job. There are lesson plans, students he is assigned to counsel, and lots of afterschool meetings. At first he bristles at this, but then as he is really failing to make a connection with his students, he figures if he doesn't care, how can he expect them to do so? So over a 30 year period he has a huge impact on many students' lives, many who don't go into music at all but were impacted by his passion and guidance, and he doesn't realize how much of an impact he had until the end of that career.Mr. Holland is not a perfect guy. Besides becoming a teacher for less than heroic reasons, he has to deal with the irony of being a man who loves music and having a son that is born deaf. He's not a saint when it comes to that situation, often neglecting his son for his students. Then at about midcareer there's a female student that has a huge crush on him that she thinks is love at a time when things are going particularly badly for him at home. He doesn't ever do anything overtly wrong, but he does probably crush back just a little. It's enough that his wife picks up the vibes and seems alarmed about it although she says nothing. Good acting by Glenn Headley as the wife.I thought that this was Richard Dreyfuss's best performance. I never really got what made his performance in ""Goodbye Girl"" worthy of a Best Actor Oscar. Besides that, the film rather bored me. Here he excels in a much better vehicle.Another good thing that the film did was not having the coach be a dumb racist jock stereotype who becomes Holland's nemesis, which happened a lot in movies like these and would be an easy and obvious thing to do. Instead, just the grind of daily life was Mr. Holland's nemesis, and the coach was actually an ally.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

It's Good!,"I do not agree with any of the critics on this page. Mr. Holland's Opus is a brilliant movie. It's intelligent, interesting and inspiring. You shouldn't tear it apart and analyse every minute detail about its musical accuracy. This is just a movie, but a very good one at that. Someone here by the nickname of ""spleen"" was the most wrong though: ""The entire movie is just a re-statement of the old chestnut about music being an expression of emotion. Well, that's NOT what music is. Music is an intellectual art."" That's total crap. Perhaps ""spleen"" learnt to play music for the wrong reasons (i.e. to show off, seem smarter/more inetellectual than others), you sir/ma'm, may have leart to play the classics but have not one musical fibre in your body, otherwise you wouldn't be so misguided. Any real musicians/songwriters know that music IS BORN out of EMOTION. Music is an expression of what comes from the deepest place within a person's heart and soul, and these internal emotions is what puts the pen to paper.  If you were to write a song that is not inspired by emotion, you'd have a lifeless ditty most often used for something like breakfast cereal commercials on TV. If you want real music you can't even start without emotion. To say that music is intellectual art, and nothing else is totally wrong. Anybody who has the talent can play and write music, it has nothing to do with intellect, or social class/status as ""spleen"" seem to apply.But enough about that and let's get back to the movie. Contrary to some of the other comments, I have found the acting to be of very high quality from all the actors, especially Richard Dreyfuss, who should have gotten an oscar for this performance. The script is well crafted, the story itself is very involving, and moving.The only flaw I found in the whole movie is at the end where we finally get to hear Mr. Holland's opus. Well, it certainly disappoints and if Mr. Holland really existed, his opus would be much much better than what we're presented with here, but again we're dealing with a movie here, movie makers don't really know/care about how to compose a really great song, they probably hired a budget composer to come up with the bit, which is a shame really as it adds a dent to this otherwise realistic, well thought-out movie.Overall Mr. Holland's Opus is a great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone. It is somewhat long, but considering the story and how it depicts 30 years in someone's life, the length is justified indeed (and at no point does it ever get boring).Mr. Holland's Opus is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy night, tucked in bed all nice and cosy. 9 out of 10 stars.",,Anonymous,Music

Shameless,"Richard Dreyfuss, director Stephen Herek and screenwriter Patrick Sheane Duncan attempt to pull off a cinematic hat-trick with ""Mr. Holland's Opus,"" yet this feat is impossible when none of them appears to know anything about music or high school music bands. Their film is pure sentiment, not existing as anything but a formula nosegay thanks to the built-in nostalgia factor and the 'emotional' score from Michael Kamen. Duncan's script is ostensibly about an indefatigable music teacher and his students, their scattered triumphs and lumpy relationships as seen through many years' time, though Herek turns the proceedings into a recycled lovefest.

Another good film about an outstanding teacher marking the lives of his students... another one.,"One of the things I like most about a film, in addition to telling a good story and positively entertaining us for an hour or two, is to reflect on different subjects and themes. This exercise of critical questioning, free and reachable to the public, much more attractive than a six-hundred-page book, is one of the most important qualities of cinema. And this film has lots of themes and topics worthy of our reflection.First, I should say that the film is very good! It is very forgotten today and deserves to be revisited. It is, I think, the best film of Stephen Herek, an average director, more focused on TV, actually. The merit of the film falls, largely, on the great quality of the script by Patrick Sheane Duncan, who created the story of a composer who becomes a music teacher at a high school to earn some income and ends up marking several generations of students, teaching them to love music while trying to protect and support their own son, who was born deaf.In addition to a deep and moving story, we have good actors working in a very committed way: Richard Dreyfuss may be an actor who is a little far from the spotlight, but he gives us an extraordinary performance in this film and was nominated for the Oscar (he lost to Nick Cage, who shone in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" in a more psychologically challenging role). Glenne Headly and a young Terrence Howard gave him welcome and very solid support.The film moves us with its story, highlighting the importance of music and the relevance of artistic education. In a society where, more and more, we are appreciated for the money we earn to our employers (or companies, or countries), the arts and human sciences (history and philosophy, for example) are underappreciated because they are considered to have very few professional opportunities and practical applicability. The situation could not be more unfair: the human sciences teach us to think, to have a critical conscience and a vast general culture, while the arts transmit us an aesthetic sense and a capacity for self-expression that, unlike writing, tends to be universally intelligible. It's a shame that human resources directors often turn out to be such obtuse people, with such short horizons. The film addresses deafness in an interesting way, showing us that even a deaf person can appreciate music and that deafness is no impediment to an active and happy life.The film has only two major problems: the first problem, and for me the most serious, is falling back on the older clichés about school films involving teachers, and all the impact they have. This was done, much more effectively, in ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Mona Lisa Smile"". At this point, the most essential of the plot, there is nothing original. The second problem is that unreasonable romantic tension between Holland and one of his young and seductive students. We all know that the relationship between a student and her teacher is one of the most appealing erotic fantasies among middle-aged men, and I can understand why they included that sub-plot, but it's beside the point and should never have been included in the final cut.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

And I don't believe for a second that anyone would crush on mr holland, and especially not a beautiful knockout like her. But I could listen to her sing all day long.All in all, Dreyfus ruins another movie, although a crappy one that I'm not sure anyone could save.

We follow the story of a young piano composer (Richard Dreyfuss), whose love for music leads him to become a music teacher. He inspires a love of music and artistic freedom in his students in the different seasons of his career while he deals with hardships at home. The story's memorable ending excellently closes this wonderfully engendered film. Alicia Witt, Terrence Howard, and Jean Louisa Kelly are the three particular students Dreyfuss connects with throughout his career, and Glenne Headly plays his wife. A winner.",,Anonymous,Music
30 years of a High School Music Teacher's Life,"I am from the era when the high school arts programs were thrown away and male athletics were not. Like Forest Gump with the music and events flowing together almost seamlessly. A movie I need to view about every five years, to remind me that life never goes exactly as planned for anyone. I have issues with three things about the film: He almost has an affair with a gifted singer (and we never find out if she ""makes it"" on Broadway). Ironically, his only child is born deaf and it takes Mr. Holland over 20 years to realize just how clever and smart his son is. His ""Magnum Opus"" American Symphony is barely 6 minutes long after 30 years of composition? At least they didn't ruin the ending by having musical funding miraculously restored at the last minute. Life doesn't work like that. A superior film, but not everyone will appreciate it. It reminds me of ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" and ""The Paper Chase"" which are both about charismatic college professors",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The intrinsic value,"Without doubt,Mr Holland's Opus,is a reminder that not all heroes wear capes.The true beauty of this film is in how it is paced correctly to tell a story of a man,and how this man without trying to ,touched others lives in a profound fashion,due to his one passion,music,teaching music is one of the five keys of life,and this film should be required inspirational must watch while being educated for all students world wide in my humble view,it gently reminds us of the consequences of war,yet does not dwell too long,Richard Dreyfuss is talent beyond talent,possibly the only reason he did not win the Oscar for best actor in this 1995 tale ,is quite possibly due to the fact that an Oscar for this performance,was simply not a fitting accolade to suit,or in other words,this story is in a class of its own as is the performance he delivered,so any award would be superfluous,such are the lessons to be learnt within,I passed my love of this film on to my children,for to do other would be a disservice as a parent.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"An offensive film, and insult to music educators","This movie dares to try and slap a feel-good ending onto a tragedy. It offended me in that way, and at the off-hand way it minimizes the effect of music on an entire community rather than a few select individuals.The best movies are either one person relating to many, or one person relating to one person. This movie tries to strike a balance and fails, miserably.Really kids, it's ok if you lose music in your school as long as you throw a party to show your teacher how much you'll miss him.

Sweet Moving Movie About a Teacher's Career,"I am truly surprised by the attacks on this movie. It is a very moving film reminiscent of Goodbye Mr. Chips, The Browning Version, Three Cheers for Miss Bishop, and even It's a Wonderful Life. In all of these movies (except the last), a teacher feels that his or her life is wasted because his or her ambition or (in Miss Bishop's case, grand love) was unrealized. However, the climax of the movie comes when the protagonist realizes that he/she has actually touched many lives for the better.Most of the negative comments below are about the musical knowledge shown in the movie. I'm sure that would not bother the average viewer. The movie is quite sentimental at heart, but is more realistic in showing the protagonist's frustrations and anger over his frustration than most of the ones listed above. It's a lovely movie, and the acting by Richard Dreyfus was fine.",,Anonymous,Music
Questioning the real importance of life,"""Mr. Holland's Opus"" was created in the spirit of Frank Capra, in which the story of the life of the main characters is a sort of alchemical process that leads to the knowledge that is most important in life.

Worth mentioning - unlike movies in which the younger actor's mask turns into an older one, Dreyfuss here was rejuvenated at the very beginning of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Symphony of Hidden Themes and Underrated Brilliance,"""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is more than just a movie; it's a symphony of life, love, and music. Beneath its seemingly straightforward narrative lies a rich tapestry of themes:Glenn Holland, portrayed brilliantly by Richard Dreyfuss, dedicates his life to teaching music. His commitment to his students transcends mere education; it's about investing in their dreams, nurturing their talents, and shaping their futures. The film reminds us that our impact on others can reverberate far beyond our own lifetime.As Holland navigates the challenges of teaching, composing, and parenting, he unknowingly weaves a legacy. His opus isn't just the symphony he dreams of-it's the lives he touches, the music he inspires, and the love he shares. The film invites us to consider what legacy we're leaving behind, both big and small. Holland grapples with his personal goals (composing) versus his selfless responsibility (teaching). His journey mirrors our own struggles-balancing dreams with duty, passion with practicality. It's a delicate dance, and the film encourages us to find harmony between the two.Music isn't merely notes on a page; it's a language that transcends barriers. Holland uses rock and roll to connect with his students, showing them that music isn't just for the elite-it's for everyone. The film celebrates the transformative magic of art and its ability to heal, inspire, and unite. Holland faces setbacks and unfulfilled dreams. Yet, he persists. His resilience teaches us that life's challenges don't define us; our response does. We witness the beauty of perseverance in the face of adversity.""Mr. Holland's Opus"" isn't just a movie; it's a mirror reflecting our own lives: Like Holland, we all have our opus-the thing that drives us, the melody we long to compose. Whether it's writing, painting, or teaching, the film encourages us to embrace our passions and create our own symphony. Holland's friendship with Coach Bill Meister and his unwavering love for his wife, Iris, remind us of the importance of relationships. Amid life's chaos, it's these connections that sustain us.The film celebrates the everyday heroes-the teachers, parents, and artists who shape lives quietly. It reminds us that our seemingly ordinary actions can have extraordinary impact.""Mr. Holland's Opus"" deserves more recognition. Its emotional depth, stellar performances, and timeless themes make it a classic that deserves a standing ovation. Let's raise our imaginary batons and celebrate this underrated gem! In the grand concert hall of cinema, ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" plays a symphony of the human spirit-a melody that lingers long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Uh, uh.I saw this film in September, 1997, and have since pretty well blocked out everything about it.  I do remember Dreyfuss working with the redhead girl; let me just say that if ya ain' got talent, no number of after-school sessions with a doofus teacher will make you any better.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"A little heavy-handed, but still charming.","There's no denying that the first and most prominent word that comes to mind when I think of Mr. Holland's Opus is ""schmaltz."" This movie does not hold back on the sentimentality even for a moment. There are a few scenes where it starts to get on my nerves, and most of that is related to his home life. While I can see what the film-makers were doing with the storyline of his son, and the rift in his marriage, almost all of these moments felt like added fluff that didn't need to be there, particularly considering the movie is already well over 2 hours. I was much more interested in the rest of the movie, which felt somewhat derivative of It's a Wonderful Life. The main character feels forced into a career (in this movie as a teacher,) but eventually learns how to do it well, and then he must be shown that his life had great value even if he wasn't always following his dreams. That's also part of why I didn't like the family detours, because at a certain point it feels like his wife and child resent his career. But the story works better if he is the one who is resenting his own career choices, and they remain supportive.That being said, I love every moment of this movie that involves Mr. Holland teaching his students. When he is challenging them, holding their hands as they overcome life's struggles, or just teaching them a love of music, I felt just as inspired as the kids in the film. Richard Dreyfuss does a marvelous job with the lead role, and is superb at slowly shifting the personality of the character based on how long he's been doing this job. There is also a solid supporting cast, many of whom are familiar faces that audiences will recognize, despite the fact that their names are a little less well-known. Mr. Holland's Opus is built to make you cry, and I'll admit that I did a few times even though I've seen the film before. There are a couple of moments which are overdone, and I started to feel like the tears were being forcibly extracted from my face, but otherwise the emotions come across as genuine. The music that they selected for the film is an eclectic mix, and I appreciate that. Most of the way through, Mr. Holland's Opus works well for me. It's a movie that I admire for how it exalts teachers, and touches on the value of the arts, even if the overall film is not a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Film,"Mr. Holland's Opus is a wonderful film that was released by Walt Disney Studio's sub-studio Hollywood Pictures in 1995 to attract a wider, more mature audience. Starring the talented Richard Dreyfus as the eponymous Glenn Holland, a musical artist who reluctantly takes a ""fall back"" job as a high school music and band teacher.Olympia Dukakis is extra charming as Principal Helen Jacobs, who is seen by Holland as strict but fair. The there is William H. Macy who plays the villain of the story, vice principal Wolters, a rather conniving foil to Holland. I rather liked Jay Thomas in this film and wish he had been in more films to showcase his talents. Glenne Headley, who plays Iris Holland however, I can't say I was really that impressed by her performance.As for Jean Louisa Kelly, she was stupendous in her role of Rowena Morgan. Kelly is a great singer, and I loved the Gershwin review scenes she shares with the football player/dancers. Speaking of music, the films soundtrack is full of great hits from Ray Charles, John Lennon and even Classical music like Johann Sebastian Bach.The film also makes people more aware of a community that's all around them that they may not be aware of, the deaf community, which the film deals heavily with. The main characters son, Cole is hearing impaired, and Mr. Holland has to come to terms to deal with the irony because he is a music teacher. The film also shows how hearing impaired children learn and speak differently with ASL, which is used throughout the story. Marlee Maitlin makes a cameo appearance as a deaf teacher.The film spans a 30 year time period from just after John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 to the mid 90s and is done with amazement by Stephen Herek who had previously only worked on horror and comedy films. This was Herek's first drama. The film is coming up on its own 30th anniversary, and many of the stars have sadly passed on. The only main star left is Richard Dreyfus.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Very moving and emotional, 30 years of a music teacher...","If you have Disney+, please take time to watch this movie. Richard Dreyfuss does a great job to portray this music teacher who guides several students to success in live (thus the ""compass"" theme once mentionned in the movie) and it's never too late to show love to your family, even if your child is deaf, but not dumb to make him understand that he knows more than his dad do...Watch it and let the tears flow...",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An Annoying Film,"This was a particularly vexing film to watch. Here is a frustrated young composer who doesn't have the gumption to make a commitment to his craft, and sheepishly takes a job as a high school music teacher, just to ""have something to fall back on.""  It's certainly depressing to see his character waist his life engaging in a second-choice activity, for fear of taking the necessary professional plunge and pursuing his dream. So he toils away for years until he's ready to retire--then he's rewarded with a cheering assembly full of high schoolers and treated to a performance of a musical composition he wrote (though we've seldom seen him working at his craft). Not that the piece is remarkable, just percussive, brassy and rhythmic. Talk about a downer film experience!",3.0,Anonymous,Music
I think some moviegoers take themselves way too seriously...,"Sure, this movie is emotionally manipulating - why else do we go to movies? Sure there are elements which are unbelievable - since when are movies a perfect duplicate of reality?  I thought the purpose of movies was to escape the reality of our lives and experience something different through someone else's eyes.  Mr. Holland's Opus does that - sure, from a musician's standpoint the final ""opus"" was lame, but who cares?  That's not the point of the movie.",,Anonymous,Music
Too Over-Whelming,"The same problem that plagued ""Akeelah and the Bee"" is present in ""Mr. Holland's Opus."" The various episodes that occurred through Holland's life are each played with the emotional intensity as appropriate for a climax.Thus, put together, the film is skewed by such a sequence of highly charged emotional ""peaks."" The result is that the drama's form is thrown off, and instead of a general rise to a climactic plateau, the entire conceit is full of too many peaks.By the time the last scene comes, there's no where to go but to pile on the emotion, straining what intensity there is left to the breaking point. If the scenario had been put together with less routinely occurring crises, it would have helped shape the drama more palatably. As it is, by the end I just wanted to say, ""Oh please, no more.""Richard Dryfuss puts his all into this effort, and his work is most commendable. It's the writer and director that let him down by not better shaping the film's broad structure. A pity, for this could have been a really significant piece of work set in the public schools.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Well worth the wait.,"I heard about this movie over a year before it was released. I waited for it, as patiently as I could, for that year. I had a teacher in high school very much like Mr. Holland.

When he actually signed C-O-L-E, I remember sort of looking at my best friend and we both started laughing. I guess it is because I didn't find him a very inspiring human being let alone an inspiring teacher. I need to watch it again in a few years and see how I've changed and how I relate to this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Entire Plot and emotional content can be summarized in a 45 second preview,"The main value of this film is for baby boomers to go out and see it and get all nostalgic.  For a nostalgia film it is not that well done.  The music of the various decades when Mr Holland is teaching is painfully shoved into a simplistic plot.  The emotional and inspirational interactions between students and teacher are similarly simple.If you see a preview for this at the beginning of another tape, then you have pretty much seen the movie.  The plot is the typical teacher believes in something and spreads his intensity to the students- Oh how sweet.  I am just touched by this heartwarming experience.  I sat around and mocked this with friends of mine who are heavily into band.  OK, so Mr Holland spent thirty years watching the band department fritter away and composing and opus made up of bits of classical music so well known that I, with no musical training could pick them out.  I mean gee itÕs not as if there arenÕt thousands of aspiring composers out there who could have provided.The bottom line is nostalgic gushy liberal people who like to think of themselves as artistic people or patrons of the arts will really like this, and the rest of us will have reactions ranging from vaguely bored to disgust.  At any rate a second viewing would be a waste of time, but once is worth a shot if you are a gooshy person.  If you are looking for something different this film is not for you.",,Anonymous,Music
So cliche,"The start of Mr Holland in class says it all. He begins his class with the unanswerable question: 'what is music'. If I would begin like that, students would no longer take me seriously. And of course (I hope I do not spoil anything) the girl who cannot play the clarinet, succeeds. First in playing the clarinet and later on in life.What I really disliked in the screenplay is the very fragmented way in which it is structured. The relationship with Mrs Jacobs is hardly elaborated on; what happens to the drummer happens all of a sudden. I think the director and scenarist took their jobs like Mr Holland took his initially: too light.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
a true band geek festival,"I was still in high school when ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" came out, and it was immediately popular with the ""band geek"" crowd.  A band geek is someone who has made all their friends through band, dated exclusively through band, and generally loves band.  Nerdy, yeah, it is, and I was one of that crowd. But we sure had fun.  That fun is displayed nicely in Opus, through Richard Dreyfuss's career as a high school band teacher.  My friends particularily enjoyed the scenes that depicted the common, everyday tribulations in the band room: learning how to hold your instrument, much less play it, staggering backwards in muted agony after that first unison note.Near the end, the music program at Glen Holland's school is put into jeopardy.  This is, unfortunately, a sad fact that happens ALL too often in our schools.  Dreyfuss has a line to the effect of, you'll cut band but I guarantee you'll never cut football.  My former high school struggled with that very same vicious arts vs. athletics debate not too long ago.  It seems sports are always paramount to creativity.  But that is a discussion, not a review. Anyway, the subplot involving Glen Holland and his student, Rowena Morgan--the musical star, is uncomfortable because that too can happen in real life.  Although student and teacher thankfully do NOT have a relationship in Opus, this problem is latent and real in our society.  We do not hear about it all that much, but honestly, one occurance is one too many.  The movie does a good job of letting the viewer realize what is going on, yet doesn't subject us to anything further. Lastly, Richard Dreyfuss is commendable as the aging music teacher, who goes from young and unwilling to teach to silver-haired and fighting to stay in the classroom.  The make up effects here are wholly believable and Dreyfuss's performance is one of the most realistic depictions of a high school music teacher.",,Anonymous,Music

"Note to director- stick with ""Mighty Ducks"" type movies","I received this movie along with one of those big tins of cheese, carmel, and buttered popcorn from a company Christmas raffle. I enjoyed the popcorn much, much more. I never felt any affection for Mr. Holland. He comes across as a selfish and egotistical little man. This guy treats his deaf son like a leper all his life and one sappy scene about John Lennon's death and we are supposed to believe their relationship is repaired. Also, Mr. Holland falls in love with a 17 year old student, lies to his wife about it and contemplates leaving with her for NYC. The ending is so unoriginal, I had to laugh. WH Macy's talent is totally wasted. ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is sore on the eyes and ears.",,Anonymous,Music
Snobbish and pretentious,"I can only recognize the fact that the actors are more than competent, that, technically, the film answers to most professional standards, but, instead of what should have been a tender and strong (not necessarily contradictory) statement about human relationship throughout the decades, we end up with a pretentious and hollow exercise in good intentions. The ending is, to my view, embarrassing; the rest of the movie loses steam almost from the start. I guess the production took on a big, huge gamble: a professor and his different flocks intertwined with recent American history. Too much.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Okay of a movie, but not one of my favorites","I enjoy this movie somewhat, but it really isn't one of my favorites.  For one thing, it gets rather long and shows different stages of the characters' lives. What they could have done instead was just show a few minutes of those segments and then forward a few years later.  There really is a good plot to it.  Richard Dreyfuss is wonderful as the high school band director. It shows how he and his wife have to struggle some with their deaf son.  If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you not watch it all at once unless you really get into it.  That's what I'll do the next time I rent this movie.",,Anonymous,Music
"Made to benefit serious musicians, Mr. Holland's Opus does this, but at the expense of including any artistic music in the film","Artistic composer Glenn Holland says: `I don't wanna be a studio musician.' Though it was 5 years ago, I still remember that I was the only person in the theater who laughed at this line. Why is it funny? Imagine a trained Shakespearian actor auditioning for Scooby Doo voice-overs. This is the sentiment behind Holland's subtly sardonic line.Though Opus tries to be serious concerning the struggles of America's artistic musicians, its lack of musical authenticity (the lack of truly artistic music within it) directs its voice towards non-musicians. This may well have been deliberate since much of the funding for musical art must come from such lay people. The underlying issue, however, reveals the fact that most Americans clearly are not in the least bit interested in serious music nor traditional (classical) music education. Most Americans prefer non-serious music.Nevertheless, Opus was made by producers who apparently wish to use the film's melodramatic chutzpah to interest the nation in music education & its funding needs. There is irony in the fact that many of today's popular music artists are much less musically devoted than they are well versed in the business of music. Here is where music entertainment, not music art, is revealed as America's predominant music culture. Aside from the line above, the film doesn't address this issue. What it does address is the related issue of public school music education. It is related because many of America's artistic musicians make their livings as music educators.There are reviewers below who disliked Opus while others are perplexed since they liked the film. The latter are correct; there is nothing wrong with a melodramatic film that is more melodramatic than it is faithful to musical ideology. But the fact that this melodramatic film with little insight into serious educational music was made into a political statement in defense of our nation's music education causes some of the musically faithful to call ""foul.""  Those offended are apparently unaware of the misrepresentation sometimes necessary in political attempts to influence people who need to be pushed into helping the needy & high minded.Everything about Opus is like a liberal campaign with the best of intentions & the ability to connive its way into the hearts of taxpaying citizens. The film was made not by devoted artistic/educational musicians but by experienced film businessmen. These entertainment industry men hired The Seattle Symphony Orchestra & The Young Musicians Foundation Orchestra so as obviously to make themselves appear affiliated with artistic and educational music culture. The film was ostensibly about a frustrated, unemployed music composer, but all of the actual music in the film was composed by a successful music businessman whose achievements include the ""Die Hard"" film soundtracks. A few die-hard purist musicians get upset (reviews below) over these inconsistencies. Yet the more upset they get, the more they may be biting the hands that are attempting to feed them.As I watched Dreyfuss making his speech on music education at the Oscars, I thought: That's an actor. What does he know about music? I had the same thoughts as I watched this film. This is the problem with being a musician who likes films. It's like being an astrophysicist trying to appreciate Star Wars.Clearly, Opus is not a film easily digested by us serious musicians, despite the fact that its political aspirations are an attempt to aid us. The ironies abound in this situation. Such musicians are apt to disagree with its tagline: `It's not about the direction you take. It's about the direction you give.' It's the individualism found amongst serious classical music composers that is at odds with this very American morale. Couple this dispute with our current ""we"" generation, its distaste for egocentricity, and we find such serious composers veritable outsiders, indeed degenerates, in the opinions of mainstream Americans. It is not a pretty place to live, and the first few scenes of Opus illustrate this hardship. Holland also said: ""I don't wanna be a music teacher,"" but he became one and in the end the community said ""no thanks, we don't want a music teacher."" Pretty tough stuff.For the political campaign to aid artistic & educational music, by all means see this film & afterwards contribute what you can to the cause. However, for real artistic & educational music, I recommend ""Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts"" & other such videos containing real artistic & educational music, many of which may be found listed here at IMDb.",,Anonymous,Music
