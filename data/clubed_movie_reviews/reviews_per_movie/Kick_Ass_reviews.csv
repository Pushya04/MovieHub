"It's funny, it's violent, and actually a breath of fresh air among all of the trite genre movies.","""Why hasn't anyone become a superhero?""That question is at the heart of Matthew Vaughn's ""Kick-Ass"", a deconstructionist superhero movie that sees awkward teenager Dave (Aaron Johnson) actually don the spandex and venture out onto the rooftops ... who then proceeds to promptly gets his ass kicked on more than one occasion.But the question gets away from Vaughn, as the movie introduces a larger narrative and centers on a violent pre-teen girl (Chloe Moretz) who, as the sidekick to the Batman-esque Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), eschews a normal childhood in favor of ACTUALLY kicking ass.For the most part, it's a fun ride. Cage gleefully chews the scenery in his gun-wielding Batman ripoff role (complete with Adam West dialogue impersonation). ""Kick-Ass"" features more bloody fight scenes than you can shake a stick at, with Moretz doing most of the anatomical damage. And unless you're Roger Ebert, there's some deliciously twisted humor to be found in those ass-kickings. And Mark Strong shines as the big bad guy crime boss (unexpectedly hilarious).There are moments of adolescent angst, the ""hero"" actually does get the girl (not really a spoiler, here) and the words, ""With no power comes no responsibility"" are actually uttered. What better time for this movie's release than at the height (I hope) of Hollywood's superhero fetish.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
With no power comes no responsibility,"It has been a long time since I have left a screening with endorphins pumping through my body and the strong urge to learn a martial art but Kick-Ass did exactly that; I felt like I could take on the world! An explosive ride that covers insane action sequences, intelligent superhero parodies and intense dramatic turns, Kick-Ass is a welcome addition to the realm of the comic-book movie.I was initially sceptical about the prospect of watching another superhero spoof movie, most recent attempts at the genre have been abysmal, but Kick-Ass completely transcends its predecessors through the use of intelligent pastiche which drives the story forward as well as providing laughs. The brilliantly choreographed action scenes would not feel out of place in a Spiderman film, or even a Tarantino script, in fact it feels like Spiderman and Kill Bill were put into a blender and Kick-Ass was the end result.The story focuses on Dave Lizewski, your average teenage nerd, whose obsession with comic books inspires him to create his very own superhero, Kick-Ass, despite his discernible lack of superpowers. Dave's attempts to become a vigilante crime fighter initially end in disaster but in the process of rescuing a cat his luck changes, propelling him into the public limelight and establishing him as a figure to be reckoned with.It is not long before other vigilantes surface, some desperate for the fame and attention, others out for revenge, and when Kick-Ass becomes embroiled in a crime lords devious plans, we are treated to a number of intense melees that gradually escalate in size and repercussions for those involved. There has been some controversy over the graphic violence depicted in these scenes, especially as the trailer is intended to appeal to a fairly young audience, and that comes as no surprise when a pre-teen girl decapitates villains on screen and uses the c*** word. Controversy aside, I cannot deny that this was very entertaining.Chloe Moretz easily steals the show as Hit Girl - the incredibly volatile young superhero with a penchant for explicit language, which will surely propel her into the realms of stardom. Nicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as her doting father, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is ever watchable as Red Mist. However it is Aaron Johnson who shows the most promise as Kick-Ass, with his convincing turn from a bumbling student to a brave and reckless crime fighter marking him as a talent to watch out for.An essential part of the film is its eclectic soundtrack, with choice tracks taken from excellent films such as 28 Days Later and For a few dollars more. Usually I would be concerned at such a prospect but the Kick-Ass soundtrack adapts the tracks brilliantly, making them feel like its own, alongside great songs from The Prodigy and Sparks to name a few. The choice of music fits perfectly with the high-octane action sequences and even adds emotional depth to key scenes - not bad for a superhero comedy movie!Kick-Ass is that rarest of films, a successful hybrid of two genres that delivers an almost perfect cinematic experience. My only criticism would be that some sequences near the end were slightly far-fetched but in a film where suspension of belief is required, maybe I'm being a little harsh. This is an essential film for all cinema-goers, catch it on the big screen and I guarantee you will be completely immersed in the explosive yet entertaining world of Kick-Ass9/10If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:Special, Spiderman, The Dark Knight and Superbad",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Superbad meets Kill Bill,"You know that rare feeling... happens every year or so... when you pour out of the cinema SO excited at the film you've just watched, and every other word is ""ohmygodilovedtwithbitwherethey""? Well 'Ding', Kick ass hits that sweet spot. Comprising teen comedy, kick-ass action (sorry) and a healthy dose of comic book style violence and gore, it rocks.It's Superbad meets Kill Bill.The film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the comic book, and where tweaks have been made, they make the plot more robust for the audience to empathise with.Kick-ass is stylish, fun, daring, and the dark surprise of violence and gore kept the balance of comic teen angst fresh: a delicious perk me up when you were settling into comedy mode. There was never a dull moment in the pace of the film, never a flimsy plot point, and actually the audience guffawed their way through the film. Did I mention it has a cool soundtrack to boot? I've already got it on my Phone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly Good Movie,"I saw the previews for this and thought this was going to be one of those slapstick stupid comedy movies (Superbad, Super Hero Movie). I came on IMDb and saw the rating and the reviews and I thought I'd reconsider after doing some research on this. I was very wrong with my initial assessment. Yes, there's some teen comedic elements to this movie, but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack, great fight scenes, acting was good, story was great and original. With a current IMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this, look's like I'm not alone on how I rated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her having a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of Natalie's role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you're into comic books, video games, in your teens/20's/30's and don't have a young kid, you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is killing people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad review because of that, do some research on a movie before you go see something that you think you won't like. I hate musicals and I'm not going to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here and complain that there was too much singing and dancing. It's clearly geared at a older teen/young adult audience and is rated R, what did you expect. In closing, one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Gget ready for the new classic superhero movie!,"In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack of idea, ""Kick Ass"" bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations in it's wake. You're on this page because you think it's gonna be good? Wrong. Or you're here because you think it looks a decent or a good superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD wrong. Reason being, is ""Kick Ass""doesn't want to be good or above average, ""Kick Ass"" wants to be great and it has the balls to want to be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where we've already glimpsed Mark Millar's signature style in ""Wanted"", but ""Kick Ass"" is all about the unexpected.Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to what Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems determined to honour the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies entertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies have done that but ""Kick Ass"" ain't giving that up either. It's script is razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of ""the burden of heroism"" crippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actions rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to know and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by keeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more you know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all relatable so we're with Dave 100% of the way, it doesn't just have to functional.The real visual joy of ""Kick Ass"" is it's desire to keep it simple but not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things, instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. That's why they exude coolness, despite Dave's almost humdrum existence. This is the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to; not a guy from another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine almost straight out of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong days stuns us in a way no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn't zing and churns them into a finely balanced flawless brew.Did I mention it's feel good? From it's inspired use of music (again utterly relatable) right down to it's outstanding score, like ""Get Carter"" for superheroes; I could say more but there's surprises in store.In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any James Cameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his menacing and humorous turn as D'Amico, a career best. Christopher Mintz Plasse follows ""Role Models"" by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolised Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movie she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she's in, no easy task considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job of all. Being an original uber-geek after Michael Cera set the standard (anyone who's seen ""Zombieland"" knows it's hard to write an original geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it and OWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast where even the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. It's quite an ensemble. A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one and complementing the film's fun style.Watching ""Kick Ass"" is ultimately like being on a thrill-ride, it doesn't just want to dazzle you, it's wants to draw you in, ride the wave and leave the cinema on a high. And it doesn't do that with gimmicks or tried and tested formula's, it breaks the mold, shakes conventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all the movies you already love. It's not just a movie, it's a standard, one that promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heart and brain.And ultimately you'll be leaving the screen thinking ""Wow, let's do that again"" no matter how many agains come before it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-Ass,"A great adaptation of the source material makes for a very entertaining and violent ride. Begs the question, what would a superhero be like in real life?

Kick-Ass: 7/10,"Dave is a loser with a nerdy comicy brain. No one knew him at his school and his friends are just a bunch of losers. One day he saw a guy being beat up by a bunch of thugs and decided to jump in a help with his superhero costume. The video was captured and became an internet phenomenon. Everyone tried to figure out who was this guy and named his Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass became a pop icon just in days. After hearing about Kick-Ass, hit men Big Daddy & Hit Girl decided to go after him to join him with their group. Going through lots of violence and profanity, Kick-Ass finally got that these two don't kid around. They kill mercilessly, they enjoy taking lives, and they cuss like a bunch of New Yorkers. Kick-Ass is a refreshingly new film that adds to the comic-action-films genre. Kudos to strong performances from crazyass Nicolas Cage and the fouled-mouth Chloe Moretz.

KICK-ASS kicked my ass,"This is definitely the best movie of 2010 so far, hands down. Not only is it insanely funny throughout, it has a great story and in-your-face action that will (pun intended) kick your ass.It's the story of a high school comic book nerd who decides he's going to take up being a costumed hero because no one else will. Early on he discovers that society could care less about the evils that be, and he takes it upon himself to do something about it. But of course none of the ""super heroes"" in the movie actually have powers, because it's about real people kicking real ass. Early on you'll find the protagonist, Dave, is a pushover and even as his costumed alter-ego, Kick-Ass, he can't succeed in anything he does. He comes off as an extremely unlikable character, but as the story unfolds and he gets mixed up with other costumed heroes who really do kick ass, he slowly becomes the perfect anti-hero and a character which will most likely be a new icon in popular culture.The script for the film is remarkably well written and it managed to combine hilarious comedy with incredibly graphic, stylized violence. Never have I seen a movie that combined the two so well. One moment, you'll be crying from laughter and the next you'll be squinching at a little girl slaughtering grown men with the slightest of ease.The directing was top-notch and this is the first film i've seen from Matthew Vaughn. If Kick-Ass doesn't put him on the map as one of the most sought after directors in Hollywood then I don't know what will.The acting was superb from the entire cast, especially from veteran Nicolas Cage. He played his part perfectly and I couldn't see any one else as Big Daddy. As impressed as I was with Cage's performance, I was blown away with how well Chloe Moretz, Hit-Girl, played her part. She definitely stole the show.I honestly couldn't recommend this movie more, and it has become one of my new personal favorites. Kick-Ass is a film about finding your identity and daring to do something no one else will. Yet it's also an intricate tale of revenge, which is masterfully crafted to be one of the most entertaining pieces of fiction I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.10 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
wild ride,"The heroes in 'Kick-Ass' are not made of special forms of matter and are not un-breakable. They try however to live to the ambitions of the super-heroes myth in a world which seems to believe in myths, and take the superhero life-style paths. Of course, when regular people act as super-heroes they can also get hurt, especially as they are at different levels of evolution in their training. A dad and his 11 years daughter seem to be the most advanced, with a high-school teenager who is actually the main hero following them bravely on the same path. Another teenager rather seems to be on the dark side, but he also tries the funny costumes and the weapons of the trade. The names of the heroes are Big Daddy, Hit Girl, Kick-Ass which seem like warnings not to take things too much seriously. There are some background explanations, but these do not count too much. The general tone of the film is on the comic register, a combination of superheroes parody and teenager growing pains comedy but the mix becomes lethal when it comes to action scenes. These are actually as violent as you can get in a Tarantino movie, and the scenes featuring the father training his 11 years daughter to become a killing machine (even if for the good cause of justice) risk to upset anybody who stops for a second to reflect at what is presented on the screen, and takes the subject too seriously and out of the nonsense territory.The film does also belong to another genre - the 'how could Nicholas Cage pick such a role?' one. With all due respect for the film, which is actually a well made, well paced and entertaining movie if you can overcome or you do not care about the moral aspects, Cage's presence in a supporting role in which he walks most of the time with a ridiculous thick make-up is wasted time for his enormous talent. That's certainly just a (big) fan opinion. Otherwise you can accept the convention and just enjoy the wild ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Funny and different,This is an unusually interesting comic book adaptation movie. It's got action but it's actually part comedy romance and part teen movie. It's quite story driven too with interesting amusing dialog and voice overs. IT doesn't take itself too seriously which is good. The violence is there but it's not as bad as some of the new movies.The leads are appealing Aaron Johnson has an expressive face and suits the role. Lyndsy Fonseca is quite a charming love interest. Chloe Moretz makes a rather controversial role quite cute as the violent kid. Nicholas Cage is in a supporting role.Quite watchable and different.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick Ass is Bad Ass,"Anyone who has ever wished to be a superhero, pretended to fly, super punch, turn invisible or just plain kick some ass but knew you never could...here's the movie for you!Although deserving it's 18A R rating, this movie will blow your mind with awesomeness, yes thats right AWESOMENESS. The main character Kick-Ass is both comedic, quirky, and relatable (weather to yourself or someone you know) to anyone who's ever been to high school. His friends, also comedic, also will remind any guy of their own little group of three musketeers talking about movies, sports, comics and of coarse girls. The other heroes, such as Hit-Girl (who alone could provides the R rating) and Big-Daddy act as a total sub plot to the film that eventually mashes together with Kick-ass's story. They provide the majority of the REAL ASS KICKING. Also the characters actually get so connected with you that by the end you will actually feel and sympathize with the obstacles and tragedies they have to go through. Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching moments in this film.In all, this movie rocked, it's not for kids, it'll blow your mind, the filming technique was great props to the director, the acting was good, the action was sweet, and the movie in total kicked some SERIOUS ASS!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant. Everything works perfectly in this amazing movie.,"Kick-ass tells the story of Dave, a common teenager without anything special about him. Through his sense of justice and some events he decides to become a ""Superhero"" and hardly tries to save innocent people.Why did I like this movie so much? Well, that's not easy to explain. The acting was flawless (in my opinion) with Aaron (Dave/Kick-ass), Chloe (Hit-girl) and Christopher (Chris/Red Mist) giving their best and shining throughout the entire movie. The storyline, even though it may not be the most original one, is amazingly well developed. The movie goes by at a perfect rhythm, combining comedy with action just perfectly. The music was amazingly well picked and combined 100% with every scene. and so on and so forth...When I left the theater I was so excited, so happy and so energetic, it looked like I just had a shot of adrenaline! And I couldn't stop talking about the movie. It's been a really long time since I felt this way about a movie.Now I know this movie is going to feed a lot of haters. It's normal. A lot of people walk into the theater with their mind already set, like ""This movie is for nerds. It's going to suck so much."", if you have that kind of mentality just save yourself the time and don't watch it. Why bother if throughout the whole movie you're just going to be looking for flaws or rolling your eyes at every joke.I loved this movie. I don't care about anything other people say.

"No Powers, No Training, No Problem","Mark Millar whom started out in the British Comic Book industry, writing for 2000AD and Sonic the Comic has become one of the biggest comic book writers around, writing for Marvel and DC with major characters like Spider-man, X-Men, Wolverine and Superman, before being able to create his own comics. His first film adaptation was the weak, dumbed down version of the Matrix, Wanted: but luckily Kick-Ass is a lot better.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a typical New York teenager, who is a comic-book fan, and not in any particular group in High School. He is ignored by girls, including Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca), the girl he fancies. Dave however fantasises about what it would be like to be a superhero and he makes an effort to make it happen. After his first attempt at vigilante justice Dave ends up having a big accident and his nerve endings are damage. But this gives him a high pain threshold and after being videotaped fighting three men at once Dave becomes a internet sensation and his alter-ego, Kick-Ass is born. But Dave as Kick-Ass gets in over his head when he meets two real heroes, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage), and his young girl Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz), a brilliant martial artist and skilled assassin. Big Daddy sets out to bring down the crime lord Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), taking down his organisation from the bottom up. As Kick-Ass Dave is brought into their violence world. As well as these superhero actives Dave has to hide his identity, whilst using his fame in the internet age to help people out through Myspace. He also finally get's Katie's attentions, but for all the wrong reasons.The director Matthew Vaughn had been touted to direct comic book conversions before. He was offered the chance to do X-Men: The Last Stand but left because of the rushed production and weak script, and missed out on directing Thor when his script turned out would have cost too much. He has proved to be a skilled director, having done the great gangster film Layer Cake and the fun fantasy romp Stardust. With Kick-Ass he is able to make a stylist, colourful comic-book conversion. It is fast-paced, action-packed, violence and very funny throughout. Vaughn was able to make a live action comic, with stylist vision trick, compared to Ang Lee who tried and failed with Hulk. An excellent film in vain of Frank Miller films like Sin City and 300. Vaughn shows how an action sequence should be directed, with Hit-Girl and her wide range of weapons making excellent viewing. Vaughn made the film like a violence parody of Spider-man, following similar plot elements, scenes like Dave designing his costume, having a similar score and basically plays on wider superhero conventions. But this was a parody which pays tribute and respects the genre it's lampooning, not aiming for cheap laughs.Aaron Johnson offers an excellent performance as Dave/Kick-Ass. He is like Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker, going through similar issues, using a voice-over throughout the film, and even sounds like Maguire. He is an actor with a bright future ahead of him. Vaughn is able to assemble a good supporting cast. Nicholas Cage is a known superhero fan and he missed out playing both Iron Man and Superman in the past. He is excellent as the man of action as Big Daddy, and is a deranged but loving father. He is one an important quest to take down Frank D'Amico. Mark Strong has been making headway in Hollywood recently, being in films like Body of Lies and Sherlock Holmes. He plays an effective villain, a gangster slowly becoming more violence and erratic because of the Kick-Ass phenomenon. He too is a deranged and loving father despite his business. But the real star out of the supporting actors is Chloe Moretz as the foul month 11-year-old assassin who is hard as nails, but also at times a sweet-natured girl and it is wonderfully played when the two characteristics are compared. She is one of the most fun characters in a film this year.Kick-Ass is not perfect, and it will not cater to everyone's tastes, but it is easily one of the most fun films of 2010.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Best original superhero movie to date,"When I first saw Kick Ass i was expecting more action than comedy. However, I was wrong with how surprisingly funny the movie turned out to be. I thought Hit Girl was what made the movie shine as she was cussing and slaughtering people. Aaron Johnson did a good job playing the lead role of Kick Ass and I thought Nicolas Cage was good at playing Big Daddy as it wasn't the typical Cage film. This movie beats a lot of those stupid high school movies and chick flicks that are trying to be funny but fail. This is a great combination of bloody action and comedy.

Quick review after seeing it back to back with the next one,"This an action comedy film addressed to younger audiences, heavy on gruesome violence and gleeful profanity.Main star is 12 y.o. Chloë Grace Moretz who steals all the attention with her performance and her action scenes. Nicolas Cage plays her father and looks and acts ridiculous even in some really disturbing scenes.This movie has a rather unique visual style. Unevenly Joyful to much the extremely bloody violence. In some fighting scenes looks like a multicolor version of the Matrix.The music and songs aren't always suitable but it seems like the director chose this tongue-in-chick approach to remind you that this is nothing more than plain entertainment.Overall: If you don't mind the gruesome violence and you have strong suspension of disbelief, check it out.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Good - not great.,"Seeing how the audience's standards seem to have lowered over the past decade, I generally expect a movie heralded as ""great"" to be decent, but almost never great.That's where Kick-Ass lies in my book. I enjoyed the ride, and as an incredibly picky viewer, that says something. The film is, however, far from perfect - which is forgivable. There were a number of things, however, that could've been avoided or addressed, that would've helped the film to be truly great.First, and most notably, is the film's outright identity crisis in theme. In a normal superhero or awesome vigilante tale, we expect a great amount of suspension of disbelief. Lots of things are going to happen that are totally unrealistic. That's fine. We expect that. Then, what amount of realism can be injected into the tale is a sort of treat - it helps with the immersion and seems to give the outlandish stuff some credibility... At least, enough to keep you involved.With Kick-Ass, however, it was the complete opposite. The first act of the movie stresses the idea that ""this story is grounded in a realistic world"". That's fine. But then, later, when the outlandish stuff goes on... It's cool, and I can enjoy it, but it ripped me out of the world I thought I had just been introduced to. Only now do we understand that this is more of a mish-mash of themes - that it's actually not much different at heart from other superhero tales. That's fine. But what gives? You got me to LIKE the ""realistic"" side of things. You got me invested in it. Did you really think you couldn't stick to that for the entire movie, still follow the same plot, and not have it walk away victorious? Sigh.The music has the same problems. One second we're immersed under hypnotically epic tracks from the films ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine"" - - then it turns around and prods a pop-rock track at us akin to a normal ""edgy teen flick"".In short, I found myself not knowing what to feel at a given moment, because I was too busy wondering how I should feel about the previous 20 minutes. Speaking of running time, with the amount of scenes that were drawn out for dramatic effect (only to be resolved in a minute or two by grandiose action), they could've developed one more superhero and had him/her die in a gritty, realistic manner. Would've helped.Worst of all was the final reveal of the ""secret weapon"", which, even though it exists in the real world, was seriously off the mark. I won't spoil anything, but if the ""secret weapon"" had been revealed to be a tricked-out grenade launcher, a single mini-gun, one of those armed robot rover things... Anything along those ends would've sufficed. What it actually turned out to be was just too much.All in all, I still found my attention fixed on the film, and I did find myself ""digging it"". The effort was noble. The result was well-done. For a little get-away into a movie on a Friday night, I supposed you couldn't ask for more.Kick-Ass kicks ass, but I'll have to stick with The Dark Knight as the best modern superhero flick ... for now. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Like Nothing I Expected,"I do remember hearing about KICK ASS on its release but for some inexplicable reason never got round to watching it until it was shown on Channel 4 tonight . I do recall it caused a bit of a stir along the lines of being a little bit violent but hey vigilante wannabes giving a few slaps to bad guys means we're not watching Walt Disney but did have the impression it was going to be a good natured movie that possibly the whole family could enjoy . I have totally embarrassed myself typing that last line and should have listened to the channel 4 announcer warn of violence , strong language and scenes some viewers might find offensiveWhat we have is John Woo meets Quintan Tarantino meets Hollywood obsession with comic book heroes and this isn't really a criticism but it does indicate that this is certainly not the family friendly fare I thought I might have been watching . It does have a good natured premise ripe for all types of dark humour where Dave Lizewski a gauche New York teenager suffering from existentialist angst decides he's had enough of being a nobody and decides to take on the criminal underworld as "" Kick Ass "" a real life superhero who is going to live up to his nameThis is how the early parts of the film play out and is blackly comical as Kick Ass has a quixotic plan to clean up the streets . Try and think of TAXI DRIVER where Scorsese cast a happy clappy Christian youth as Travis Bickle and you're on the right tracks . The amusing tone of the film then changes as we're introduced to Hit Girl a pre-pubescent child who spends much of the film dispatching bad guys in a variety of graphic ways . Let's be honest here if she was in her early 20s and played by Megan Fox no one would have blinked an eyelid and if we were to be even more honest she'd be some sort of masturbatory fantasy figure but because the character is eleven years old that changes the whole game and watching Hit Girl jump around in the style of THE MATRIX literally slicing and dicing gangsters does make for uncomfortable viewing and some cynics might say she is included to stir up controversyMatthew Vaughn proves himself as one of the most interesting directors and if you want to say that he's more style than substance then I won't disagree with you but will defend him on the grounds that if you're this talented when it comes to style who needs any substance . Like his earlier film LAYER CAKE there's a danger of the whole film collapsing in to one big bad mess but is directed with such directorial flourish this never happens . He does help his cause by including a great soundtrack and might be seen as a cheap trick but is very effectiveKICK ASS is a very enjoyable film for those in the mood for some stylish designer violence but I should emphasise it is a violent film and the fact that much of the violence is tongue in cheek might ironically alienate audience members more than it might have done if everything had been played in a slightly more serious way , but there's an energy here rarely seen in other films featuring vigilantes and superheroes",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Still excellent on my third viewing!...,"I must first say that it is a really well made film with some excellent stunt work. I thought the music chosen for the score was really great as well. Excellent performances from all of the leading cast, Aaron Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy is excellent, Chloe Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl (also superb), Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist and Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma.There is a lot of humour in this film, both spoken and visual. It's also very very violent, so I wouldn't recommend it to those of a nervous disposition. I don't usually enjoy teen comedies, but this is very original, very different and it's very refreshing to see a film that pushes the boundaries somewhat. It's a film that any superhero film fan should try to watch at least once a year, just to see how it should be done!SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
My Review After Preview,"Well where I can begin. I was invited to view the preview and write a short review over this movie KICKASS. I must say I entered the theatre with a very sceptical approach (i was assuming i would rate the movie 4/10), the tag line for the film did not appeal to me and I expected the aimed audience to be for teenagers.I was shocked to see unique character chemistry between nick and his little one (you will find out when u watch it people). This film is very exciting and I ended up giving it a rating of 7/10 because I must say I have not seen a movie like this before. I actually enjoyed this movie very much....after half way. But none the less it was very well choreographed with the fight and action scenes with good but rare humour. Is this film violent......YES! Is the film straight to the point with the action....YES? Is this film worth watching.....YES! Was I impressed....YES I must say I proudly flaunted the idea to my friends that I had the opportunity to see it first.But it took to long to start...""the film"" if you know what i meanI'm not a film critic hehe although I was sitting next to one at the time and he mirrored my feelings towards the movie.... He said at the end ""Well!! Did u like it?"" I replied...""hmmm very different and I would watch it again although it was slow paced to begin with"" He replied...""yeh could do with a bit of snipping, and then it would be just fine!"" And we talked over and over the scenes we couldn't get enough of, which I think every person will feel is the same after watching this movie.. it is like a modern day 300 heheSo don't expect me to be deep in detail because I am to busy saving the world right now.rating 7/10 people get out there and watch it!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Chloe Moretz steals the show,"The best scenes by far involve pint-sized Chloe Moretz in an homage to Uma Thurman of Kill Bill. In addition to her action scenes, there is some very funny dialog with her father, played by Nicolas Cage. Otherwise, it's a cute concept and interesting plot, but a lot of the dialog and acting fall flat. But there are enough exciting action scenes and moments of cleverness to keep you going through the boring, silly parts. Seeing a film like this makes you realize how great the writing was in the Kill Bills, and even in sappy movies like the Spiderman series. Part of why I saw this film was Christopher Mintz-Plasse in the cast, because of Superbad. His quirky personality adds something to the movie, but he's kind of wasted here. Here's hoping the sequel will be centered around Chloe Moretz!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"A Very Funny take on Superhero Movies,","Kick-Ass is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a very funny movie from start to finish, a great take on superhero movies, it isn't necessarily a parody, but more like a loving tribute, Matthew Vaughn's unique directing style is evident throughout and I don't think anyone could have done a better job than him, his technique suits the tone and wit of these comics, and he brings this world to life perfectly. The cast is superb and they all do a great job of portraying these characters, but I felt like some characters could have been developed more, obviously Kick-Ass is the most important character, but I felt like the movie didn't necessarily need to focus on him as much as it did, I would have loved to have seen more origins for Big Daddy, who was brilliantly portrayed by the very hit and miss Nicolas Cage, and more scenes for Frank D'Amico, the main villain superbly played by Mark Strong, would have been great. Even with all the comedy and action that is evident throughout, the film manages to never forget heart, we genuinely care for these characters and the journey they are on, movies like this normally forget to do that, we feel care for them and there are even some emotional moments that surprised me with how much sympathy I truly felt. Action packed, funny and topped off with a superb cast, I would recommend Kick-Ass to anyone looking for a good comedy or action.A boy with no skills or powers decides to become a superhero, making him a very wanted man by some dangerous men.Best Performance: Chloë Grace Moretz Worst Performance: Jason Flemyng",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick Ass cannot decide whether or not it's an action movie or a comedy.,"I'm really starting to loose faith in the American audience. While the premise of this film is very promising, this movie is absolute garbage. Kick Ass fails because the movie doesn't know what it wants to to be. Is it supposed to be a comedy with action, or an action movie with comedy? The answer to that question, however, is that it is neither. The movie fails because it tries to be both and ends up ruining the basic elements of either genre. The parts that were supposed to be cool were mixed in with comedy that completely resets the tone. I'm not saying that action movies cannot have funny parts, but the way in which this movie does it is all wrong. I can say so many bad things about this movie, but then I would end up writing a book.I'll leave it at this. Kick Ass is not only overrated, but it is also complete garbage. While watching this movie, I never found myself laughing because it felt almost out of place to laugh. If this film was meant to be a comedy, then I say that it took itself way too seriously. And if this movies was supposed to be an action movie, then it ruined all the cool stuff by adding humor at the worst possible moments. It makes me mad that people actually like this film. I believe in giving credit where credit is due, but this movie definitely does not deserve the critical acclaim that it's getting.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The subversive and daring superhero comic-noir that opened the door for Kingsman and Deadpool,"Daze Lizewski (Aaron-Taylor Johnson) is an average high schooler in New York City who by his own words has nothing special about him. Dave has a crush on his classmate Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) but lacking the confidence to engage her spends time with his two friends Marty (Clarke Duke) and Todd (Evan Peters) reading and discussing the minutia of comics. Dave wonders why no-one becomes a superhero in real life and decides to purchase a green wetsuit with yellow piping and matching mask to become a masked crime fighter. When his first attempt fails leaving him stabbed and injured, his injuries give him the benefit of deadening his nerve endings allowing him heightened tolerance to pain. Kick-Ass becomes a viral sensation while Dave gets the attention of his crush Katie only to find out she thinks he's gay. Meanwhile, Kick-Ass is not the only superhero vigilante as former cop Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage) and his daughter Mindy (Chloe Grace Moretz) also do vigilante activities as Big Daddy and Hit-Girl respectively intent on taking down crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) who framed Damon and caused a string of events that led to his wife's suicide. As Dave continues to fight as Kick-Ass and other heroes like Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) appear in the scene, Dave finds his world spiraling out of control with escalating violence and chaos.Kick-Ass is an adaptation of the creator owned comic written by Mark Millar and illustrated by John Romita Jr. Of the same name. The rights to the film were sold before a single issue of the comic was published as a chance encounter between Millar and director Matthew Vaughn at the premiere of Vaughn's sophomore feature Stardust lead to the two discussing Millar's concept which lead to Millar writing the comic and Vaughn and his writing partner Jane Goldman writing the script for the film. While studios were interested in the property, they wanted to either age up the characters (particularly Hit-Girl) or tone down the violence both of which Vaughn refused. This meant that financing was done independently with no studio set to distribute the film until Lionsgate finally acquired the film for a wide-release. The movie received terrific reviews from critics (with exceptions from some who decried the film's violence as ""morally reprehensible""). While Box Office for the film was okay, Lionsgate had expected due to the amount of internet traffic surrounding the film it would be on the level of something like Zombieland but ended more on a level similar to Kill Bill or one of the Punisher movies. The movie did however score some solid home media sales. Kick-Ass is an influential film that may not have been given its deserve audience recognition, but it's a daring an influential movie that laid the foundation for other challenging comic book adaptations like Kingsman and Deadpool.Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn have done a great job translating Mark Millar's work to film. I actually didn't like the Kick-Ass comic and despite it being one of Mark Millar's best known works, it's probably the one I least like (maybe Marvel's Civil War at a close second). The Kick-Ass comic is a very nasty mean spirited piece of work and it's not because of its violence (that I have no problem with), but because it's got a very nihilistic and misanthropic core to it that actively revels in a lot of elements that feel bitter, dark, and sometimes downright hateful (especially a twist involving Big Daddy that's thankfully been excised from the film). The comic also gave me the sense that it hated its main character with Dave often portrayed as kind of a weaselly and pathetic character who at one point stands around a location for three hours to talk to his dream girl and not to spoil anything but that dream girl, imagine the exact opposite of every mainstream love story you've seen then multiply it by a schadenfreude factor of five. Goldman and Vaughn's take on the character makes Dave a more relatable character and the movie feels like it believes in him and wants him to win in a way the comic never gave us. While Goldman and Vaughn do a good job of translating most of the core elements from the comic, they do struggle with one, the character of Red Mist. In both the comic and movie, Chris aka Red Mist, is the son of the main gangster bad guy who becomes instrumental Frank D'Amico's war against the costumed crimefighters. While Chris wasn't all that interesting or developed in the comics, his character did at least make sense within the story. Chris in the movie is very odd because he wants to be like his father Frank, but he also is shown to respect Kick-Ass (to a degree anyway) and at one point even tries to help Kick-Ass which puts the character in an odd place as he's got redeeming points to him while also still serving as an antagonist. The movie also keeps the ""gay misunderstanding"" subplot from the comic and I suppose it's handled a little better here than when it was in the comic, but there are still elements that are cringe inducing in hindsight such as the ""spray on tan"" scene. With that said I do prefer Goldman and Vaughn's take on the subplot over Mark Millar's so it's still a net improvement overall.Despite some hiccups in translating the material, the movie's cast does great with it. Nicolas Cage is amazing as Big Daddy with his trademark intensity coming through in all the best ways (especially in narrating a 3D rendered comic-book style original story of how he and his daughter became Big Daddy and Hit-Girl). Aaron-Taylor Johnson is a likable lead in the role of Dave/Kick-Ass and he shows a natural charm and charisma in his performance here. Mark Strong is also a lot of fun as our main antagonist Frank D'Amico who takes the very basic gangster archetype and plays up the humor from the frustration he feels at having costumed nuts ruining his business. But stealing every scene she's in is Chloe Grace Moretz as Mindy aka Hit-Girl whose action scenes are the highlight of the film as she unleashes bullets and foul language aplenty in sequences that are both darkly humorous and also quite thrilling.Kick-Ass is a strong and stylish superhero film that plays its concept of ""real world"" superheroes quite well both for dark as black humor as well as for action-noir. Matthew Vaughn stylishly directs the film with his and Jane Goldman's screenplay filing down the rougher edges of Mark Millar's source work while keeping the core appeal and the cast do a great job of bringing their characters to life. Kick-Ass is entertainingly violent and darkly humorous and if those are what you expect, you'll get them with a heaping helping of style and craft.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Which is decently good, but my god, i was totally wrong.Kick ass is something totally unexpected, and its very hard to describe. Its a light comedy, yet it has a lot of insane violence, you see people getting shot in the head, members going off the body, knives going trough hands, insane amounts of gunshots. How that mix of genres worked out?. Apparently very easy. Being original.The soundtrack will subtly drag you inside the movie, the plot its great, the cast couldn't be better, they are all very likable and convincing, specially Hit girl, i never saw something like that, the action secuences look like taken out from kill bill, blade, the dark knight and jackie chan movies.I hope this give you a vague idea about the movie.

A laundry list of things your parents DON'T want you to do...,"""Kick-Ass"" is a film that looks as if the film makers wanted to put everything into a film that parents would be horrified to have their kids see or do...and then they marketed it directly to these kids. Socially irresponsible? Sure...but also quite entertaining. Here is a brief listing of the things horrified parents will see in the film: profuse use of the f-word, lots of intense violence, super-heroes who brutally kill their prey, masturbatory references, brutality that surprised me, teens having hot and sweaty sex, severed limbs, etc.--all things kids are clearly told NOT to do and not to see. Yet much of the time, it IS being done by kids who are teens or even younger. Seeing an 11 year-old using such strong language and eviscerating villains with reckless abandon IS something you don't see every day!While I could analyze the movie or describe its plot, I won't, as there are 16 bazillion reviews for this film already. Instead, I want to direct this review to parents. While kids really DO talk the way they do in this movie (as a high school teacher, I know) and the film makers captured this well, even if you ignore the hard-core language I don't think you should let younger viewers see this film. My 20 year-old watched it and loved it, but I didn't let my soon to be 16 year-old--she is just not as mature as some kids her age. The violence is just something I think too many teens already are too comfortable with--and this film will only make this worse. Now if you have an older teen, then I say let them see it--or, the fact is, they might be old enough that it really doesn't matter what you say. Just be fore-warned--this is NOT a kids movie or even one for the average teen--it's just too full of stuff they are probably not mature enough to handle. Heck, I'm not even sure if I am!Coincidentally, last night I saw a Japanese film that was HIGHLY reminiscent of ""Kick-Ass"". ""Lady Snowblood"" is a tale of revenge concerning a baby who is raised to exact revenge for her parents--one of the same themes in ""Kick-Ass""--and the film is about equally violent and bloody. If you liked ""Kick-Ass"", then give this other film a look--it turned out to be Taratino's inspiration for the ""Kill Bill"" series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Good but I'd rather have a Big Daddy and Hit girl Movie!,"The first time I saw this film I was a bit disappointed I mean I loved the Big Daddy and Hit girl parts of the story I just didn't like the Kickass story all that much. His fight scenes were good but I just didn't care for the character or his group of friends the way I did for Big Daddy and Hit girl.The second time watching it he did grow on me more but that could be because in the time between veiwings I read both Kickass graphic novels, so now this film is quite near the top of my fave comic book films (The Dark Knight, Sin City, Watchmen, X-men First class, Scott Pilgrimm Versus The World, The Crow).This film did something something I thought o film could....it made Nicolas Cage cool again! 7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Hit Girl Kicks Ass,"Kick-Ass should really be called Hit Girl because she pretty much saves the movie and kind of inspires people around her to be stronger and badass, she steals every scene. At first I thought that this movie was a little uneven when it came to balancing laughs and hardcore violence and some of the jokes worked for me and some didn't even put a smirk on my face and it was pretty childish and over the top for the most part but everyones inner nerds fantasies are fulfilled and then some. In the beginning also I really didn't buy or take anything seriously in this film and thought to myself when are you guys going to back up the title instead of being dorky and strange, then Hit Girl comes and saves the day. When the ass kicking starts it comes in full and glorious fury with a action packed finale that was worth the wait and price of admission and that's when it earns it's name and my approval of being Kick-Ass! Overall it's very refreshing to see young kids and teenagers without superhuman powers kicking some major ass and becoming the mysterious superheroes it's almost controversial seeing them shed some blood and that's why I love it even more because it's kind of ballsy but it's pretty much a love it or hate it type of film. I say shut up, get off your ass and see Kick-Ass which will probably be the most fun time at the movies you'll have this year. More of a 3.5 out of 5 stars.

"Believe the hype, Kick-Ass delivers!","I wanted to like it... i really did.And you know what, i loved it!Opening scene although ruined as an opening joke by one of the trailers sets the tone for such bad taste comedy, its like the politically correct world we live in now never noticed this slip into cinemas! Hit Girl is the unintentional (or intentional you might say given the lines she has and her role in the plot) star of the film, but the beauty of it really is how they manage to keep the focus on kick ass. And although some may disagree i felt he was a likable character who i was really rooting for all the way.Cage as Big Daddy was a tad underused given the brilliance of the character (Cage back to his very best), his choice of voice for his superhero persona seemed lost on the rest of the audience around me as i began chuckling on my own! :P But he managed to play the comedy so deadpan that when the switch back and forth between heartwarming/emotive and comic book comedy occurs, you don't feel like its jerky or uneven.Hit Girl has all the best lines, and the actress who plays her (Chloe Moretz) does such a fantastic job its like she isn't actually only a child. A great future ahead of that one i think.Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico is an additional comedy turn in a film which is already brimming with them, but along with Mark Strong (who is in EVERYTHING right now it seems) make two 'interesting' villains.But its all about Aaron Johnson as Dave/Kick-Ass, and the juxtaposition between the polished fighting styles of the likes of Hit Girl, and Kick-Ass/Red Mist's more 'amateur' efforts are what gives this film its character.Its over the top cartoon violence, with comedy placed strategically around a plot that although might seem familiar and routine, is so full of nice little touches it just didn't matter.There will be plenty for those who wish to gripe about it to pick on, it is a walking controversy. But this is the comic book it's adapted from, with a few alterations that to me seem to improve on the story and make it more endearing (strange word for a film like this i know, but its true).To pigeon hole this into a genre beyond 'comic book adaptation' is impossible, as its got comedy, action, violence bordering on horror, and emotive moments of almost touching drama. It has a bit of everything, woven into a neat little parcel that never seems to waste a moment and revels in the fun of it all.A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Overrated movie,"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it wasn't as good as I had imagined, even though I kinda enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was interesting and kinda innovative. The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though it was very simple and easy to understand. The characters were interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable. The casting was nice and their acting was decent, Chloe's performance was excellent. At least, it was very intense movie, action-filled and the fight scenes were EPIC. Also, the killcount of the movie was very bloody and brutal, even though nothing explicit was shown. In my opinion, the apartment fight scene was probably the best part of the movie! Moreover, it was a kinda funny movie and there were many sex jokes. The ending scene was definitely predictable, adventurous and it was just fine. Overall, ""Kick-Ass"" was an average action movie, full of death scenes, insane fights and probably I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
It does kick ass,"Kick-Ass This comic book adaptation, full of violence, obscenity, computerized blood splashing, beatings, knifings, and wild stunts ends up as one of the best super hero comic adaptations I've seen. The half a billion-dollar Spiderman series directed by John Favreau could learn something from this simpler film. In part it's the great casting and cleverer attention to character. Obviously Favreau is hired to make sure the wise guy persona of Robert Downey and quality acting of the cast balance an effects laden production. But those performances still feel gratuitous and studied. Kick-Ass, on the other hand uses lesser-known actors to build more grounded characters, at least in the sense of nerds belying superheros. Its literal secret weapon is the outrageously wonderful 12 year old actress Chloe Grace Moretz (Let Me In) as Mindy/Hit Girl, and a cautiously underplayed Nicholas Cage as Her cartoonist-father/Big Daddy. Along with nerd specialist Christopher Mintz-Plasse, hunk-playing-geek Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass, and a ripe posse of convincing goons, the movie leaps wildly from wild violent choreography to sweet cartoonishness. The fresh cast combined with the extremes of emotional commitment to a ridiculous plot are satisfying and continually surprising.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-Ass.  It most certainly does.,"Greetings again from the darkness. Just when you are convinced the comic book movie thing has been overdone, in swoops director Matthew Vaughn (the excellent ""Layer Cake"") to reach an entirely new level through a unique, unconventional and twisted approach. It does't take but a few minutes to realize that clichés mixed with shocks will mess with your movie-processing mind!Somehow we are treated to teen angst,superhero-ism and most every human emotion and type between the two. WARNING: this movie is rated R and it is a strong R ... IT IS NOT FOR KIDS! The film slam-dances between ultra violence and uber-geekdom and satire driven slapstick. We get a 12 year old Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl, wielding weapons even more deadly than her shockingly adult tongue. Moretz was also a standout in last year's ""500 Days of Summer"". We get her revenge-driven ex-clean cop Big Daddy father (Nicolas Cage) in Batman costume mentoring her to the ways of a world class assassin. I busted out laughing when I realized that Mr. Cage's voice mannerism mimic that of the great Adam West while donning the black cape. A very nice touch. Our other home grown, would be superheros are Aaron Johnson as Kick-ass (replete with green scuba suit) and McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as Red Mist. Most of these characters are one step removed from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"".Of course a comic book story must have a top notch villain and these days there are few better than Mark Strong. He delivers another terrific dead-pan performance as a drug lord and father to Red Mist. Strong's character is the driving force behind Big Daddy's quest for revenge.Aaron Johnson's Kick-ass is an example of the clunky teenager who has a good heart and is desperate for attention from the girls. He even accepts being labeled as gay by the hot chick he adores just so he can spend time with her. He hangs at the comic book store with his equally geeky friends and then ""transforms"" into Kick-ass, a superhero with no powers other than a desire to do what's right and help those in need.Mark Millar's script balances many cultural and societal observations while delivering a visual parade of images and sounds (wondeful music and score ... including ELVIS) and moments that will keep the viewer unsettled. You might think it odd that an early scene lingers on a giant advertisement featuring Claudia Schiffer. Ms. Schiffer is married to the director and becomes one of many tributes and satires throughout the film. It is quite a different experience and one that not all will enjoy ... but it is to be admired for reaching for new levels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Kick Ass Kicks Ass,"Kick Ass is a superhero movie, and while it offers a satirical first act of what a superhero is, it rolls out as a true action movie by the time your watching the opening credits.That being said, you haven't seen this movie before. The situations are going to seem familiar, but the character are all brand new, especially the little 11 year old that takes the spotlight, Hit Girl brings in what I would like to guess is the next big Character Archetype. Now you've had little girls, and you've had bad ass little girls, Hit Girl fits into Bad ass little girl, but way different than before. She says a few bad words at the start, but it seems like that quickly dies out before the opening. What is not changed is that she is in the scenes were the most gratuitous violence is depicted and she is almost always the one committing gratuitous violence.Nicolas Cage works surprisingly perfect as a satire of Batman, and he ties in what unfortunately is probably a largely missed joke. Not going to spoil it here though.Ultimately, it sets off as a spoof, and works its way backwards into being one of the most awesome movies you're likely to see this year, and definitely the best so far this year.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Very Surprised!,"Either we live in the world where a skillful marketing can make everyone's mind about the movie and sell it or... I don't know!With quite interesting idea in its sleeve (a kid with no power becomes a 'superhero') the movie turns out to be a complete disaster. It's repetitive, boring, not that funny at all, has no likable characters (just psychos, dumb teens and even more dumb and psychotic 'villains') and is completely inconsistent in its form.The idea is to put lots of typical clichés from different genres (teen comedies like American Pie, buddy movies, bloody revenge movies) and rip-offs from other comic-books (Batman, Spiderman, Punisher and even Iron Man) and put everything into a bag of movie sh.. as the main focus is to pack the sliced and incoherent story with never-ending bloody fight and torture scenes involving a kid stabbing, slicing and crushing people.Hit Girl is stealing the show, right!?It's like telling a 3-year-old to say 'F..k' and laughing because it sounds sooo funny. Then maybe he or she can kill a cat with a knife because you don't often see many 3-year-olds doing such a thing. The wise producers could do another popcorn flick set in primary school about kids killing Nazis and necrophiliacs. Sure they've never ever done that before! But should they! Is it really that funny for general audience nowadays?Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against violence in movies if it has SOME point to the story or even if it's nicely stylized (Sin City, 300). But in times of Saws the sickening violence has no other point apart from 'pleasing the audience' and Kick-Ass might be at the top of this statement. It can really make someone feel that comic books are worthless, pointless and derivative piece of crap that base their originality on pushing the boundaries in showing the violence rather than coming up with some decent storytelling.

Kick-Ass follows a teenager in High School who wonders what it would be like to be a superhero and decides to be one himself: Kick-Ass. He stumbles upon other people following the same routine as him, but discovers its not that easy to pull it off in the real world.Like I said, if you had no idea what it was about.

The movie is the near flawless mix of Action, Comedy, and yes Drama. It redefines the Superhero Comedy Subgenre. I will see this movie again this weekend and I anticipate that it will grow legs due to all the positive word of mouth endorsements. But this movie is not for everyone, if you have a problem with kids ***cough 12 yr-old girls cough*** committing acts of violence then do not see this film. This film is NOT for kids.I recommend this film for ages 12+ and for those who liked Kill Bill and Spiderman.See this film you will love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Wild and Crazy Examination of the Human Condition,"I waited a really long time to see Kick Ass because I have a lot of comic book, fan boy friends who always gripe and complain about how inaccurate the adaptations are and how little attention is paid to details from the original story whenever we get together to watch one of these movies. Honestly, I would rather take a brutal ass kicking than sit through another movie with one of them painstakingly tearing the movie apart. It was for that reason that I stayed home when they went out and saw it and waited until now to get my own, unbiased and completely fan boy free opinion.The film takes great elements from good old run and gun Kung Fu shoot em' ups, blood soaked, gore fests and sadistic, dark comedies. It combines these elements with initially traditional hero and villain archetypes which audiences members are used to and creates a new, offbeat and non contemporary world where everyday citizens are afraid to face any kind of evil that lurks in the shadows.That is until a few misfits realize that there are no REAL superheros out there and there's a desperate need for change- as well as a bit of well placed retribution.In my opinion they cast the Kick Ass character perfectly. Aaron Johnson is the epitome of pathetic and invisible until he dons the skin green and yellow tight scuba suit and Timberlands and takes to the streets. Nick Cage is still Nick Cage, but I take back a few of the things I've said about him (only some). He really diluted himself and became something different than what we're all used to seeing. He didn't even have overtly goofy hair! But, it was really Chloe Moretz that took the cake. Her comedic timing was perfect and, out of all the characters, I felt for her the most. As Hit Girl she was a miniature Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. There are not many movies that come to mind when I think cold blooded killer and also prepubescent girl. It was new and different to see a girl portrayed in movie like this doing the kind of things she did.Overall, it's a fun movie. On the core it's a mixture of a few very different kind of films. It's both feel good, semi-comedy and also a commentary on society; while it still serves up enough gun Kata inspired violence and fighting to win over even the most stoic of movie nerds. It makes one consider the plight of the human condition when people will turn the other cheek when they see a mugging, although, it sends kind of a positive message that if people are pushed far enough they can do some pretty crazy, amazing things.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of the better superhero movies out there,"""Kick-Ass"" asks the question, ""What would happen if an ordinary guy decided to become a superhero?"" The answer is that he becomes a cultural phenomenon even though he basically sucks at crime-fighting. However, before long he crosses the path of a father and daughter team who really know what they're doing. Pretty soon he's in way over his head and has the local crime boss out to get him.The story is an interesting one even though it doesn't really live up to its potential. The title character is the least interesting character in the movie. Given that fact, it's probably a good thing that the more conventional superheroes Hit-Girl and Big Daddy show up. Of course, their introduction makes the story more akin to the usual superhero fare. Where this film really separates itself from the pack is in the R-rated violence, not the slightly-more-realistic-than-usual setup.The acting is in pretty good hands, at least for a superhero movie. Aaron Johnson is fairly unremarkable as the title character but, luckily, the show is stolen by pre-teen Chloe Moretz, who plays Hit-Girl. Nic Cage also gives an interesting performance as Big Daddy, Hit-Girl's father. Few others really stand out, mainly because most of the characters are clichéd and/or one-dimensional.The directorial style of Matthew Vaughan is energetic and well suited to the comic book material. The special effects are pretty decent as well though they're nothing to write home about. The soundtrack is pretty hip, too, but to me it seemed a bit overbearing.Overall, ""Kick-Ass"" is among the best superhero movies I've seen but it certainly isn't without its faults. The grit of the film goes a long way in covering up its shortcomings, though, and the character of Hit-Girl is destined for cult status. Some may find the action too violent but I think it only seems excessively violent in comparison with the usual PG-13 superhero fare.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Tarantino homage kicks out the violence jams,"Although exceptionally – perhaps even abhorrently, depending on your view – violent and wildly profane, Kick-Ass is terrific, a pulse-quickening superhero movie that somehow manages to have a subtle message about staying true to yourself, or something.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is just another anonymous geek in high school when he comes up with the idea of becoming a superhero. Not one with, you know, super powers or anything, just one with a mask and good intentions. Dave buys a wetsuit and costumes himself as the eponymous hero – and quickly finds himself on the wrong end of a knife. But that's okay, too, because the resulting surgeries implant metal in his body. You know, like Wolverine. Soon, he's back and, uh, kicking ass, and his exploits are all over YouTube.At the same time, a mob boss named D'Amico (Mark Strong) is running all sorts of deals all over the city: weapons, drugs, graft, murder, and so on. Then eight of his guys are knocked out by a costumed man, and D'Amico – with the help of his sniveling son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) – decides Kick-Ass is his man, since he's basically the only costumed hero anyone knows about. Soon D'Amico and his well-armed minions are after poor, hapless Dave. Turns out that the costumed man trying to take down D'Amico is Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), who, with his deceptively adorable daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), has been targeting D'Amico's operations in a sort of revenge game.There are a few wonderful themes being developed in this film. One is that ordinary guys can do extraordinary things. Another is that the geek can get the girl, as long as he's honest. A third is that even well-prepared heroes bleed from time to time. Kick-Ass is part Spider-Man and part Quentin Tarantino's World of Comic-Book Heroes. Now, it's true that these themes may not be all that unique, particularly to movies, but the essential take-away point is that the heroes here are infused with no small amount of humanity. They are in no way, shape, or form perfect people; they simply are.Dave Lizewski doesn't suddenly become awesome when he wears his Kick-Ass costume; he's a great person, daring to stand up for the little guy. When he sees the level of training that Hit Girl and Big Daddy have achieved, he knows he's in over his head. But the experience gives him the confidence to connect with a previously unattainable high-school hottie, Katie. Echoes of Spider-Man, sure, but somehow Johnson is a little more believable than Tobey Maguire.The violence is pretty visceral – bad guys are mowed down in cold-blooded fashion by ostensibly good guys – but what might really grab you is the incredibly adult performance by Moretz. She's 13, by the way, and she looks like she's 11, but here she talks like she's a grizzled pirate. Moretz uses all of the Carlin dirty words and some more you might not have heard of. It's a little off-putting to hear such a tiny little squirt use such language, especially while engaging in bloody, realistic combat, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that her role is viewed with some controversy. Moretz's Hit Girl is very reminiscent of Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill Vol. 1, but her Kewpie Doll looks serve an even greater contrast to her intentions and actions.Kick-Ass is both evocative and heart warming. It's not the kind of movie you watch while cuddling with a honey, though, as its sweeter side is mostly kept in the background. But it's those sweet moments that help prevent the film from being a rudderless mess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick Ass does exactly what it says on the label. Oh yeah.,"Now being a fan of Matthew Vaughn's last two films, Kick-Ass clearly seemed like his most controversial outing to date, without even comparing it to his other work. Both Layer Cake and Stardust both though enjoyable and well received felt like discrete nods to the distributors that this man can do a fine job of directing no matter what the genre and that he deserves the room for development, since showing he is capable of great potential.Then came along Kick-Ass, which easily is one of this years must see's, simply because it is nothing and everything like you expect. Example: Expect the costumes to look out of place, expect the C-word bomb from an 11 year old girl and expect a finale that almost makes the end of Kill Bill Volume 1 look like a fairytale. However what wasn't expected was the hilarious conversations between Big Daddy (Nic Cage as a Earless Batman) and his daughter Hit Girl (The awe inspiring Chloe Moretz) and the vast amount of violence, dark humour and the way it walks all over society like another blood splattered corpse of satisfaction.Dave Livewski (Aaron Johnson) struggles to understand why there is no active costumed vigilante's around in New York to stop crime, and through his comic inspired heroism decides to become Kick-Ass (The hero this time, not the film title). So with his cheesy green wetsuit, determination and lack of social life, Dave's roller-coaster begins. His near fatal experience's doesn't hinder his growing reputation or superhero buddies including Red Mist (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and the infamous father-daughter duo to bringing blood-blitzed peace to a crime-ridden city.Kick-Ass is a guilty pleasure that people shouldn't be ashamed to enjoy on the basis of the blaspheming and gore infested mass killings. There is a huge amount of likability for the leads who have all done justice to make the most of their characters capabilities; Chloe Moretz deserves particular credit to her notorious role by putting the 'Gonna blow your brains out' in well, just that. Matthew Vaughn has clearly established himself as a man of many talents and after this it's not hard to see why, there is certainly room for a sequel on the horizon, that's for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Fantastic Fun, The True Beginning of the Summer Season","Kick Ass is a film that has been hyped almost insurmountably. With fan praise, critical hype, and trailers that showed all kinds of fun, one wouldn't be mistaken to think this film might be over-hyped. But after seeing the film, one WOULD be mistaken to think this is anything but a great achievement for comic book films and summer blockbusters.By now, you should know the basic premise of Kick Ass: an average teenager decides to don a costume and become a superhero. There are no superpowers, no advanced martial arts training, and Kick Ass is no one man army. He's just a kid tired of no one doing anything about the bastards of the world. Helping him are Big Daddy and Hit Girl, two heroes who are highly trained and highly armed, and yes they kick a great deal of ass. Red Mist joins in on the fun halfway through. Together they aim to take down the big baddie of the film, the crime boss running most of NY.The film itself takes a standard formula for comic book films. There is the progression of becoming the hero: the training, the failures, the costume creation. The villain is introduced. There are a number of fights in between and a final battle that has probably the best action in the whole movie. However, what separates the film from others is both it's brutality and wit. This isn't as much of a fantasy film as say Spider-Man or Batman, where these guys parade around some fantasy version of their city and use it as a playground to take out fantastical villains. It's all grounded in reality. Several scenes are brutal, and even a bit gory, reminding you that this is all very much real. It doesn't feel all that exaggerated either. Although the conclusion is laughably over the top, most of the film is brutal enough that you feel what these characters are going through. Kick Ass' very first endeavor is a good example of this, when everything goes wrong and it lands him in the hospital for quite a long time. It's a reminder that this experience won't be like the others.It helps that the production is fantastic. All the actors do an excellent job in their respective parts. Aaron Johnson is perfect for the part as the seemingly nervous and nerdy Lizewski. There will no doubt be many comparisons to Peter Parker, as they share many similar qualities, but this one stands out because of his normalcy. As he explains in the film, he's no one special, and this makes him especially relatable. He's the normal guy who's simply fed up with being and seeing people get kicked around. The highlights of the film, however, are Chloe Moretz and Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy and Hit Girl, respectively. They steal the show, not just as their superhero alter ego's, but as a daughter and father. Their relationship is both a big part of the films humor and quite touching. As disturbed as one might be seeing how they are together, it's a sweet relationship that truly stands out. Mark Strong stands out as the mob boss villain. He could have played it over the top, but here he seems very fitting as he portrays an ugly villain that is quite suitable. My one issue is Christopher Plasse, who may be a bit oddly cast as Red Mist. While he does channel a little bit of his McLovin into the role, which seems to work, he seems a bit out of place, especially as the villains son.The rest of the production is admirable. The directing is quite well done and allows the fight scenes to actually be visible, thankfully, which is coupled with the editing, which is also excellent, the warehouse scene being a key highlight. The script is also highly enjoyable, with quite a bit of wit and humor with all the violence and drama.Kick Ass is an incredibly enjoyable film that sparks the new season of film. It stands as the first blockbuster and a testament to comic book films and what they can be. But above all, this is a fun film that brings memorable characters to the screen and should leave you smiling when it's all said and done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Disappointing,"At the start it looked as though Kick-Ass was going to be a funny and different film; it seemed like it would be a ""realistic"" superhero movie with an interesting plot. However, although the 'superhero' (Kick-Ass) remained as a normal (although with lots of crazy things happening to him) character living in New York, a lot of the other characters- namely the two actual super heroes he meets- completely change the film into an unrealistic, clichéd American action film.The thing I did like about this film however was that it wasn't afraid to be offensive. There was lots of violence, swearing and completely politically incorrect things that went on- which was all good! However, it was spoiled by a completely predictable plot and the fact that the director obviously didn't really know what kind of film he wanted it to be (realistic comedy or superhero movie). Also, the film at times seemed to be just an advert for Myspace and Apple as the product placement in it was just horrible!Kick-Ass did have it's moments but it really didn't live up to it's hype for me- save your money for something else!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
There is nothing fun about a 11 year murderer,"this movie has more free-violence than any war movie I call recall, and it's done by an cold blooded 11 year old. Also, the only superhero movie where the GOOD guys are more perverse than the actual bad guys. I know this is based on a comic book, but i'll wont bother to read it, i doubt it covers all the plot holes. Did i've said that the 11 murderer kills people who are already down? Or what about the super-smart Big Daddy making idiot moves when the bad written plot demands? The characters have no life, the only reason to be there is to make pure, cold violence. I had to stop the movie several times, thinking why i'm still watching this? DAMM WATCHMEN was violent too, but it gave a hard atmosphere and background. It shows how to make a 'real life' superheroes thing. Kick-ass, in it's colour dandy world, only shows how it is cool to kill people with cool moves, and dropping blood on the screen is cool too. So kids, go buy a comic and learn how to Kill people. There's even a scene where the camera go on First Person mode... like an video game! Don't let your kids wacth this. Or anyone you care about",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Go See this Movie,"One of the best movies I have seen in probably 2 years. In the end I truly did like it more than Avatar.The best part is I really did not know what was going to happen at every pivotal point in the movie. I won't get into any spoilers but you know some movies (IE. Green Zone) where you probably could script out the way the entire movie would play out after the first 20 minutes.... lets just say I did not know what would happen right down to the final scenes.It is brutally violent and at the same time funny, seamlessly transitioning back and forth maintaining just enough humour to dictate the overall feel of the film into a .... not quite happy but certainly lighter tone. It's important they did that for it was a truly serious movie people would over analyze the hell out of it.The actors were amazingly well cast and as many reviewers have already stated, they are really people you can emphasize with or at least relate to. The bad guys are actually seriously bad dudes.... its not a film in which the bad guys are just stupid and really not so bad in the end (IE. brutal Spider Man films)..... no they are actually kinda smart and people that will torture, kill, maim etc... Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy has his best role since his glory days of Face Off, Con Air, and The Rock.Action scenes are incredible with three in particular.... The first major Kick Ass fight, Big Daddy's fight, and well several of Hit Girls with one in particular that you will know when you see it.Its a full length two hour movie and honestly you wish it could have been 3 hours long because the script and story just meshed that well. Lots of action, lots of humor, good guys you really like and bad guys that are just as hilarious in their own brutal way.A funny/serious action movie with a plot like no movie I've ever seen.

Far out,"You know, a funny little thing happened on the way to see this film at the theatre. My friend drove me and he's a rough driver. For the whole trip, the car would go fast, then slow, stop quickly, and make sharp curves; all while loud music (mostly rock and rap) was playing. Relaxing in the car was impossible. Why am I telling you this? Because ""Kick-Ass"" is one of those flicks that also dares you to relax. In fact, it might as well put a gun to your head and dare you. I sure as hell don't mean this in a bad way, though, because ""Kick-Ass"" delivers with its humour, fast-paced action, and general awesomeness. It doesn't work the entire time, but I got what I wanted: pure escapism.I wish I could end the review right there, because this doesn't seem like the kind of film you should analyze and, instead, just enjoy with your buddies. Nonetheless, all films are fair game for reviewing. There are always reasons for liking or disliking a film. (Captain Obvious could tell you that.) So, let's dig deeper.We meet Dave Lizewski, a geeky high school student who decides to become a vigilante superhero, like in the comics. Well, not quite, as he doesn't have any superpowers or training. Still, he buys a green suit online and gives it a go. After trying to fight two car jacking thugs, one stabs him and he subsequently gets hit by a car in an amusing manner because of how unlucky he is. However, his luck changes for the better as he gets out of the hospital with nerve damage giving him the ability to not feel pain and his bones have been repaired with metal plates. Therefore, he tries again. One night, he walks around in public wearing his suit (lol) and finds some more thugs beating someone. This time, Dave successfully fights them off and since the fight is videotaped, his alter ego Kick-Ass becomes an overnight sensation and, well, the story has just begun.There are so many funny lines and moments that it would be ridiculous to name them all. The humour skews towards the kind you'd find in a Tarantino film; black. Right at the beginning of ""Kick-Ass"", a superhero wannabe jumps off of a tall building attempting to fly and, instead, plummets to his death. That immediately tells you this isn't gonna be a feel-good comedy. I have to admit I laughed at that, too. The most memorable scenes probably come from Mindy/Hit-Girl and her father Damon/Big Daddy. They're the utmost unusual parent-child pairing I think I've ever seen in a movie. Damon, played excellently by Nicolas Cage, trains Mindy to be a killing machine. This makes Mindy, herself, to be really bizarre for a child. In one scene, she cuts up a bunch of bad guys in a room, which is amazingly hyperreal and funny. It might even slightly remind you of the infamous restaurant fight scene in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"".""Kick-Ass"" is stylish, but also has substance. I found Dave and his friends to be relatable, since I actually have friends like them, including the guy who drove me. Mindy and Damon are given a backstory that's shown through a superbly animated comic. In spite of the film's unique quality, another film came out recently called ""Defendor"", also about a superhero wannabe, starring Woody Harrelson. I personally like that film more because it's abundant with humanity and I didn't feel overwhelmed during the last quarter as I unfortunately did with ""Kick-Ass"". The grand conclusion and the scenes prior to it didn't amuse or thrill me quite like the rest of the film. They're even sort of predictable. The good news is those are the only real complaints I have.""Kick-Ass"" is based on a series of comics, which I haven't read. Regardless, the film feels like it was written and directed by movie lovers. Props go to all the actors for helping to make it come alive. I'm going to close with a clichéd pun, but I don't give a f**k: ""Kick-Ass"" kicks ass.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Kick-Ass is the best superhero movie out there!,"I have seen my share of superhero movies, and while most are pretty good, they all follow the same storyline. You know, the one where something happens to them physically/mentally to make them the way they are, but with Kick-Ass, it does not follow the normal superhero rules.First of all the main character who is Kick-Ass is a geek. He is a nobody in school and has a group of geeky friends. He lives alone with his dad and even though he lives a pretty ordinary life, he is tired of being bullied by street thugs and he is also tired of the people who just watch and do nothing, so he decides to become Kick-Ass! Kick-Ass is an awesome character. He has no special skills and a terrible outfit to match. He tries to fight the thugs but is pretty much too much of a weakling to really fight back, but he has heart and he does not give up. In one of the fight scenes he meets Hit-Girl. She is the 11 year old everyone is talking about and she is the one who steals the show! She has amazing moves and is tougher than the Kick-Ass character.Don't be fooled by the fact that this is a comedy, even though there are some funny scenes, it is not one of those goofy comedies where you laugh through the whole movie. There is quite a few bloody/gore/violent scenes that I did not expect and the young girl in the movie curses often. Another thing I did not expect is a scene that is quite sad near the end. I don't want to give away anything so you will have to watch it and see.I am hoping there will be a sequel to this one that can live up to the first because it is such a good movie and with the way it ended, there could be a sequel. I'm hoping!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick Ass is the most fun you might have this year,"*** out of (****)""Kick Ass"" is the Matthew Vaughn directed action packed extravaganza that's based off the comic book series and spun a lot of controversy. A majority of the top critics thought it was truly repugnant to see an eleven year old spew out f bombs, kick ass, and take names. And yes, most strict Christians have complained about the film due to its graphic nature and vile profanity. Even without the strong controversy, I know this sounds heavily clichéd, but Kick Ass, kicks, well... ass. It sure kicked mine. How can you not love a film that has strong performances, a great story, and just awe-inspiring cinematography? To regard Kick Ass as another comic book film is like calling Alone in the Dark a cinematic masterpiece. I can't believe how utterly satisfied I was with this movie. This is probably one of the most electrifying and great film experiences I've had. Is this film Citizen Kane? No, but it's such a great film on its own merits, that it doesn't even matter.Kick Ass revolves around Dave (Johnson), who wonders what it would be like to be a superhero. So Dave decides to buy a heroic costume, scares off a group of street punks in the beginning of the film, and entitles himself ""Kick Ass"". Along the way, ""Kick Ass"" meets up with ""Hit Girl"" and ""Big Daddy"" who befriend him. However, the juvenile ""Red Mist"" is trying to take him down.First off, the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. The movie is so vibrant and rich with color, that it's like looking at an ancient art painting. The movie has so much texture and detail that it's almost like it jumps off the screen. Furthermore, the action is truly superb and is nothing short of awesome. Seriously folks, this is the best and most plausible action since ""The Matrix"". And yes, I went that far. Moreover, this movie has been talked about because of its graphic nature and doesn't disappoint in terms of gore. We get a human microwave explosion, a decapitated leg, a shot to the face, and several balls-to-the-wall action sequences. Additionally, the performances in this movie are simply terrific. Every character truly stands out, even the most insignificant of characters. Furthermore, the script is extremely fresh. The jokes pack a punch, the premise is fun, the subplots are great, and the movie's more drastic moments are simply tear-jerkers. Also, the pacing is fantastic. Scenes are paced pretty briskly and you will not be bored.While the pros outweigh the cons, there are still some flaws, but they are extremely minimal, and minor. First off, I thought before Hit Girl was introduced, the film wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, if Hit Girl wasn't in this movie, I'd give the movie a 5. It still was good, but things got a lot better when she kicked into gear. To add to that, I thought this movie could have been more fun. There were a little too many depressing moments, that would have made an otherwise non-stop fun escapist summer fare movie.Overall, Kick Ass is one of the most fun films of the year. It simply is inclusive to the elements of a great movie: terrific acting, story, direction, gore, action, cinematography, and script. Its flaws are so minor and minimal, that they are so easy to overlook. Not to mention, it's just a whole lot of fun. Really, I don't think this movie could have been any better. It shows that Matthew Vaughn doesn't want to make a good movie. He wants to make a great movie and he succeeded. If only directors would be this passionate and ambitious about their movies, then we'd get more films like ""Kick Ass"". ""Kick Ass"" is one of those rare movies that's fun and well-crafted.

SICKENING VIOLENCE: just the way you like it!,"How I would've loved to entitle this review ""Kick-Ass!"" (get the double meaning), because it was! It was truly unique and lived beyond my expectations. It just had something of everything. In a nutshell - revolutionary.Unfortunately this title is already consuming reviews in many variants. And though it's highly appropriate and a little contagious, it's just too easy to do. I'm fresh out of cinema, just having seen it in advanced screening. It was so good I'm still buzzing. I couldn't stop rambling about it to the friend I went to see it with, I enjoyed it so much. And by the way he wasn't able to stop talking about it either I guess he did too. I just had to review it! I've never read the comic by Mark Millar, I'm not really much of a comic book fan. However, I love a good movie. Having seen a trailer, I instantly thought this looked different to most of its genre. After seeing more trailers, it became one of my addictions. My interest keened on it. So I booked tickets as soon as I could and went to watch Kick-Ass.Enough of my autobiographical account of my run up to seeing the movie. Here's some of the things you can expect...Storywise Kick-Ass is quite simple. It brings us into the world of Dave Lizewski, a high school student and comic book nerd who yearns to become a real-life superhero. Not through some life changing event, neither through any actual superpowers. So he does. Despite parodying many, many superheroes who are referenced in the film (mainly by the protagonist himself (fittingly!)). It oddly retains a comic-book feel in structure from start to finish. Going as far as to use comic book captions throughout the film.I'd say that Kick-Ass is in one sense a teen film. Not a cheesy one though. It carries the whole feeling of typical teenage life at that age in the film. The desire to act irresponsibly, sexual curiosity, immature jokes and social cliques. They all feature. At the same time Kick-Ass has some surprisingly mature and realistic themes and moral questions.Now in other senses Kick-Ass is an action-comedy with hints of thriller and western. And it doesn't lay up on the action or comedy. Action is intense and brutal and often you can almost feel the hurt of the heroes. Comedy is top notch and should have you laughing at some daringly placed jokes. Or laughing inside at the nerdy/immature jokes. Use of some well known songs and movie themes at best-placed moments amplify Kick-Ass greatly. And though you'll most likely guess what's coming next, (some parts still come as a surprise) it's the way it's told that keeps you involved and loving it. My friend bought a large cup on Coke for the movie. He confessed afterwards that he was so taken in by the movie he'd completely forgotten about it!I struggle not to give this a 10, which is a pity. It's so close but I believe firmly that there'll never be a perfect movie. Why is it a pity exactly? I saw Avatar at the end of last year. As Christmas drew close. I loved it and wrote a review, giving it a 9/10. But Avatar only just scraped a 9/10 in my mind. Kick-Ass was so much better. So there's my verdict! Go grab tickets and enjoy this stand-out movie while it's still in cinemas.***Final Notes*** Though I guess some people may say this movie is ripping off Watchmen, they'd be very wrong. Though it has some basis in it, Watchmen was a very serious look at the idea of real-life superheroes. Kick-Ass is a lot more comical look at it.

Probably the worse thing I've ever seen. AVOID LIKE PLAGUE.,"I registered here to review this film, as I believe the high rating it has is a result of manipulation. I went to the cinema to see this after checking out the reviews here, and it has irreparrably damaged my confidence in IMDb. . .It is clear that the review system is being manipulated to give UTTER TRASH like this high ratings on IMDb.CHILD EXPLOITATIONI suppose if you're a Hollywood producer backed by enough money to market your product, you can exploit children in your film. You can also assist in the progressive de-sensitization of the masses to violence and pretend to be provocative and original by getting your child actress to act out scenes of murder and extreme violence. You can do all this and still get rave reviews in the mainstream media , who are getting payed by your bosses, so who cares about human values anymore? People who find this film funny, or good in any way have some serious problems, in my opinion. This is like a bunch of retarded, coked-up teenagers with lots of cash to burn trying to be as awful as Tarantino in his worse moments. If you think this would be funny somehow, you are mistaken. This juvenile, onanistic sh!t is like the worse straight-to-DVD American trash you can pick up for a buck in junk stores.The facts : this film is marketed to young people; has received rave reviews and has not been utterly condemned for its abusive, criminal exploitation of the worse parts of human nature and Amerikanised trash ""culture"" . Pretty depressing, and this has lots to say about the hopelessness of our ""civilisation"". It's funny if you have the humour of a sociopathic 13-year old boy from New Jersey. And it is precisely this demographic that should be kept away from films like this at all costs.Hollywood continues with its campaign to completely erode humane values and de-sensitize people to violence and torture. How come full-on sex scenes including genitals are taboo, but scenes of gory murder and torture are now so commonplace that even children can participate? How did we get here?Thugggish violence and shootings in schools by under-age psychopaths can be expected to continue with increased regularity thanks to films like this. Violence and torture are funny, yeah , as funny as a full-force baseball-bat hit to your genitals.Like another reviewer has said: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Enjoyable Surprise,"I had only seen one trailer before actually seeing Kick-Ass in its entirety. The unknown in this situation turned out to be the greatest asset in enjoying this film. The movie starts off a little slow, where I actually found myself getting a little bored during the base character development. Eventually I was able to relate to the characters and become attached to the story line. Somewhere after the first third of the film it begins to change its momentum. It began like an indie film and finished like another installment in the Spiderman series. I think the greatest appeal of this movie would be to not over advertise and numb a very good film. I was lucky enough to see this movie without any biases or judgments and the result was fantastic. I left the theater looking forward to a sequel with only a few questions on the ending of the movie, loose ends have always had a tendency to frustrate me. In order to enjoy this film I would recommend seeing it as soon as you can before any negative opinions can shadow an enjoyable movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Wonderful!,"I expected a lot. And I wasn't disappointed, at all.Come on, be honest with yourself. Who wouldn't at one time wish to have some kind of superpower and become a super hero? I personally love Iron Man and the X-Men series and always dream of becoming a superhero. This movie fulfills all kinds of fantasy.It's not the content that matters. It's how the director handles a very original concept, and breaths air into every character.I love Hit Girl. She is beyond my imagination. Not once did I ever imagine such disturbingly bloody scenes be performed by a young kid. Well done, girl, you are totally the best! Hope she will grow up into an excellent actress, because she sure has potential.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Fun action comedy with an everyday teen nerd becoming a masked vigilante,"Already this year, I've see a candidate for not just the best comic-book film of 2010 but the most entertaining one.Acting: Aaron Johnson, who plays the eponymous Kick-Ass is likable as an everyday nerd(and pulls off an American accent well - something Sam Worthington never could even if his life depended on it), Nicholas Cage delivers his lines with an intentional deadpan, soap-opera staccato that's quite humorous in places, Mark Strong(who seems to be continuously cast as villains) is really good and brutal as a drug lord, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is amusing as Red Mist, with a high-pitched voice but the person that steals the scenes is Hit Girl.Chloë Moretz plays her character as a precocious, resourceful, foul-mouthed (when she niftily dispatching her victims) and basically a kid assassin with attitude. Her incongruous behaviour(for her age) stems from this being a comic-book film, so she's wholly from a skewed version of reality, therefore should not cause any offence to informed individuals who understand this.Plot: There is a clear homage to Spider-Man here, plot-wise, but it's subversive in how it plays out, despite the familiar elements. It also works on different levels: a social commentary(on passive bystanders of crime), instant celebrity, responsibility, vengeance and as a entertaining action comedy. There's all sorts of in-jokes with references to comic-books here (as well as telly, film and video games), with a very tongue in cheek tone(with even serious scenes having some laughs from characters making amusing comments). I would've liked to see scenes where characters suffered the consequences of being injured more, but to a certain extent, it's cartoony style(that doesn't linger too long on bloody violence) works for it's tone it's going for.Cinematography and SFX: A colourfully pleasing look, with a dynamic, fast-paced style of choreographed violence that is rapidly edited and focuses more on the inventive skill of the heroes. I loved the 3D-looking animated comic book strip.There's a video-game inspired action (FPS influenced in one scene in particular) that are easier to follow than any Bay-directed action sequence. Those prone to photosensitive epilepsy should note a brief strobe lighting sequence.Score: The title song by Mika is an empowering, catchy pop song that captures the drive of the masked vigilantes in the film. Others songs used fittingly to create the right tone this film's going for - lively and no-nonsense. The score uses recognisable tracks from Sunshine and 28 Days Later.Overall: Like giving the middle-finger to conformity, Kick-Ass wears it's punk rock tone proudly, and addresses the dangers of playing dress up to fight crime while acknowledging the reasons such people could have for doing so. While I'm not inspired to become a masked vigilante anytime soon(the occupational hazard is just too high :D), I was very entertained by this and surprisingly even my middle-aged Mum(who the Daily Mail though would be enraged by such rebellion) loved it. A cool, moderately humorous experience indeed and a definite must-see at a cinema near you as it does exactly what it says on the tin and delivers it with panache - 7.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
I highly recommend watching this movie as it is certain to leave you with a smile on your face,"Before stepping into the auditorium of Kick-Ass i had heard many good things but was not expecting it to live up to the media hype.For the first half of the movie, even though i new i was watching a good film, i was left wondering where the media and fan based hype had come from as i thought Aaron Johnson's acting was less than an average performance and couldn't see how the story line would pick up without falling into the typical super hero formula which we have seen so often from films such as spider man and the fantastic four.However by the time i had left the cinema it was a different story. this film had brought a huge smile to my face for many reasons; the way comedy and action are fused together in an un-cheesy way which allows you to appreciate both, how a thirteen year old girl has been allowed to create so much gore, hoe it had left me and my friend so charmed and also for it being a movie in which Nicolas Cage isn't a terrible actor...for once!I urge you to watch this film as it easily made its way into my top 3 movies of 2010 so far which includes Hurt Locker, Shutter Island and now Kick-Ass.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Kick Ass Movie!,"This movie had all the right ingredients for a perfect movie; great writing, compelling characters, comedy, action, a little girl cursing and slicing off limbs. All around this movie was WAY more than I was expecting. Going into the theater, I thought I might have just wasted $10.50 on another movie trying to be cool for coolness sake. This movie isn't trying to be cool, it just is.This movie had a realness that is usually missing in most films made today. The movie plays very genuine and honest, even though most of what you're watching is unbelievable. At times in this movie I felt like I was watching a Tarantino movie. There is a lot of gory but nonetheless absolutely entertaining fight scenes that are balanced out with a lot of comedy and drama.Great cast, Aaron Johnson is believable. He doesn't magically transform into something he's not, but has a personal awakening. Clark Duke is funny as always and adds comedy at needed moments throughout. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was alright. He doesn't have everything I thought the red mist character should have, but he did a good enough job. We'll see how he plays it in a sequel. Nick Cage was better than I've seen him in awhile. Playing the doting father whose fathering tactics border on insane. And finally Chloe Moretz, of 500 days of summer fame. She absolutely stole the show. She is the best part of the movie. Hit girl just went to the top of my most B.A. characters of all time list. Keep an eye out for this chick in the future. She's already head and shoulders above most of the actresses in Hollywood.All in all, everything is there. There is something for everyone is this movie. You will not leave disappointed.

Both Insidius AND Fiendish,"I love this film. I can see why some parents are going crazy about the content, but frankly, if a parent has done his/her job, some superhero/comic book movie can't jade the kiddies as badly as folks are saying this one will. Get over yourselves, and enjoy the film for the care-free fun flick it is.Slick production style, relatively low budget, with high quality action sequences, and some awesome characterizations make for some really great movie moments. Although this stars one of the kiddies, this movie may not be appropriate for all ages. The starlet uses some horrible language and perpetrates some horrible actions, but the film is richer for it.Nicolas Cage's role is below tertiary, but it is wholly enjoyable seeing him in this endeavor. As usual, he contributes a beautiful aspect to the story's emotionality.All in all?

Smart Satire or Generic Genre Picture?,"""Kick-Ass"" sets out to lay waste to the archetypal superhero movie, but some see the film as just another addition to the superhero genre. Those who argue for satire point to the first half of the film, where Aaron Johnson's ""everyman"" character learns the hard way that becoming a superhero isn't as easy as it looks in movies like ""Spider-Man"" or ""Batman Begins."" You see, Kick-Ass earns a reputation as a superhero, but he lacks the skills of the more covert Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, who lurk in the shadows with high-grade weaponry and martial arts mastery. While Hit-Girl and Big Daddy fight crime, Kick Ass must deal with the everyday plagues of the American teen. In a funny bit, Kick Ass' alter ego, Dave Lizewski, learns that the ""love of his life"" wants him to be...well I won't spoil it, but I will say that it stands in the way of Dave's dreams for a little while.Bits like that one enrich the first half of Kick Ass with a dose of funny reality. Kick Ass comes off as kind of a loser, Hit-Girl looks way too young to be saying the things she says (and doing the things she does), and Nicolas Cage's Big Daddy stands as one of his funniest creations. He's like an overbearing Little League parent on steroids. Less funny are the villains. Mark Strong, an excellent actor, must play a fairly bland crime kingpin. He does his best to enliven his character's dialogue, but he still comes across as a cross between ""Daredevil's"" Kingpin and ""Iron Man's"" Obadiah Stane. This composite villain has an equally bland son, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse as a dull redux of McLovin. Still, in the first half of the film, these characters only slightly distract from the bold comedy surrounding the protagonists. Unfortunately, as Jackson Browne once sang, ""all god things must come to an end.""The good things in ""Kick-Ass"" come to an end when the story begins to embrace the formula it's supposed to be tearing apart. Director Matthew Vaughn abandons humor almost entirely as the film claws its way to a gun-crazy climax. There's nothing funny about a scene in which gangsters kidnap and plan to televise the execution of good, if misguided, characters. Vaughn seems eager to comment on his audience's potentially disturbing fascination with violence. This is clear in the film's first half when Kick-Ass enters a fight with high hopes, only to suffer real consequences. It's similarly clear early in the film, when Hit-Girl dispatches some baddies in gruesome and methodical fashion. Towards the end of the film, however, Vaughn seems to fall into the very trap on which he sought to comment.The encounters toward the end of the film drip with violence, but it's all very stylized. In order to grip the audience, Vaughn employs a type of violence that allows viewers o revel and cheer. This type of violence dominates most genre superhero films (just look t ""Iron Man's"" robotic smack-down, or at ""The Incredible Hulk's"" creature clash), so I would never expect it from a supposed ""satire"" of those films. Generic plot convention after generic plot convention, standard fight scene after standard fight scene, and ridiculous dialogue piece after ridiculous dialogue piece made the second half of Kick-Ass a huge disappointment That said, most of the action is well-shot, the pace still moved along well, and the film's ending has a certain charm to it.""Kick-Ass"" was not the film that it could have been. It starts off satirizing genre superhero movies, but it ends up becoming one. Still, the film works well on the whole. It has an exciting visual style, a number of cackle-worthy comedic bits, and some great hammy performances. It doesn't totally kick ass, but it just might kick butt.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Review of Movie,"When I picked up this movie from Redbox over the weekend, it wasn't my first choice. There were a lot of other movies out there that sparked my interest, but this was really the only one left that I had any interest to see. I am so happy I chose to watch this movie. I first thought this was going to be a funny, ad lib, joking around movie considering Mark Duke and Christopher Mintz-Plasse were in it. Then I started to watch, and become so engrossed in the sheer genius of how it all came together. I tell my friends this movie is from the perspective of ""What would happen if someone ACTUALLY put on a super hero costume and tried to fight crime?"" Not with all the fancy gadgets or super powers, but with everyday weapons. I was really impressed with all the cast, but especially Chloe Moretz. I mean, where did this girl come from?! Nicholas Cage and She did a wonderful job working together and really made the movie what it was.

"Great, shocking fun","I gotta say, when I first started watching this movie, I thought it was your typical teenage boy kinda movie; about growing pains, and being a loser, and suddenly turning into a winner. Even when the main character started dressing up as a hero, i still thought, alright...he's a little eccentric.However, a good ten to fifteen minutes in the movie, I found out I was dead wrong. The minute Nicolas Cage shoots his daughter (but she's fine) with a smile, i knew this was different than any movie I have ever seen. It was amplified double when those thugs stabbed Kick-Ass.This movie, in all, is one wild ride. I don't want to give too much away, since that will ruin the shock factor for viewers (The above doesn't really give anything away). Aaron Johnson is BRILLIANT as a nerdy, loserish high schooler who turns into Kick-Ass, an alter ego who gets himself into more than he expects. Eventually, he turns from scared pussycat into a ferocious tiger, willing to do what it takes to save people from harm. Chloe Grace Moretz and Nicolas Cage define excellence as Hit Girl and Big Daddy. Two roles that I was definitely not expecting to see. It shocked me and it thrilled me, and it definitely made the movie so much better. They should have won awards. If you don't see this movie for anything else, please see it for these forces of nature. Finally, Christopher Mintz Plasse also plays a great role as Red Mist.Overall, this movie is up on my top 5. I won't say too much about it overall, except: GO SEE IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"As corny as it may seem, this movie really does kick ass.","Not only is this movie ballsy, it really did beat my expectations. It's rare when a movie is way better than the trailer and this movie is just one of them. Sure there are a few flaws in other people's opinion, on how this isn't a plausible superhero movie, and more of a wannabe superhero's fantasy. And how the main protagonist Kick-Ass is overshadowed by other characters, mainly Hit-Girl who is so entertaining to watch on screen. Not only is this one of the best wannabe superhero movie out there, it also beats out a lot of superhero movies. It's been a while since I had some much fun in the theaters, I was thoroughly entertained. This really isn't a superhero movie for kids, but screw that. I don't really care cause this movie was ballsy and yet very entertaining to watch, plus there is plenty of good movies for kids out already. Also this movie probably isn't going to be the funniest movie of the year, but those holy crap moments are just so very cool, you can't help but laugh. It really did beat my expectation on every level and I can't wait to watch it again. I am glad the distributors decided not to dumb this movie down for the younger audiences, the director Matthew Vaughn has made some good movies in the past and I sure hope he keeps doing so. The soundtrack was rocking as well and it fit the scenes it needed to fit in. Nicolas Cage did a great job with his role as well, it's been a while since he was featured in a great movie that deserves to be seen in theaters and glad he ain't going to waste, he was entertaining to watch as well.8.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The Title of the Movie Says it All,"When it comes to Nicholas Cage, his recent movies have not usually been big hits. The movies ThevSoreceror's Apprentice and Season of the Witch were both awful. Recently, I watched the movie Drive Angry with him in it, and it wasn't very good either. But one movie that I can say without a doubt is my favorite of his is this one.The bulk of this movie follows Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), who is geeky, comic-loving seventeen year old. He wonders why no one has ever attempted to become a superhero in real life, so he decides to become the superhero Kick-Ass. At first, things do not go very well, but he eventually becomes an Internet celebrity and gets in way over his head. During all of this, he tries to impress Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca), a pretty girl in his class.A sub-plot, however follows a young girl, known as Hit Girl (Chole Grace Moretz), and her father, known as Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage). They are after the crime lord of the city, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), because he framed Big Daddy as a drug dealer, and it lead to the death of his wife.In a final sub-plot, Chris D'Amico (Chistopher Mintz-Plasse), the son of Frank, wants to become a mob boss like his father, but his father neglects his hopes to follow him.Everytihg about this movie is done very well. The characters are well developed, and you feel bad for them in some sense, and the actors who portrayed them did awesome. The action scenes are fun and graphic, with great choreography and special effects. The music is epic, helping to keep the mood throughout. The story, as explained above, does get more complex, but is never hard to follow, and is very realistic.I will say, I find it very refreshing to see a superhero movie that is so brutally realistic. You should definitely see this movie, if you love superhero, action, or comedies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Welcome Change to the Superhero Scene,"This superhero-ish movie was such a breath of fresh air. Not that I'm at all tired with the DC comics and Marvel productions because they are fantastic, it's just that I didn't want to be inundated with yet another superhero with the same talents but different than all the rest. Kick-Ass' most impressive talents were his ability to not feel pain during severe beatings.Kick-Ass was both humorous and exciting. I know that Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) was the star, but as far as I'm concerned, he can take a back seat for Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz). She made the movie. Without her it would have been a mildly funny action flick. With her it became a mildly funny action flick with some good action.

Be Ready for Graphic Violence from an 11-Year Old Girl!,"I never got to watch ""Kick Ass"" when it was first released in 2010. Now with the sequel in local theaters this week, several people recommend that I should probably watch this first installment first before I watch Part 2. So I did.I did not know exactly what this film was about so I was surprised when this film and its sequel had posters of what looked like kid superheroes, yet the rating is R-16! Now that I have finished watching Part 1, the answer is very clear.""Kick Ass"" tells the story of Dave Lizewsky, a nerdy guy who decide that he wanted to be a real superhero like those in the comic books he loves to read. He buys himself a dorky green uniform and tries to fight petty criminals around town as Kick Ass. Unfortunately he had absolutely no fighting skills.However, his exploits apparently inspired a ultra-war-freak father- daughter team to don superhero uniforms themselves as Big Daddy and Hit Girl. Can these new superheroes stand up to the very real threat of the evil crime boss Frank D'Amico, his son Chris (who also took on a superhero persona Red Mist) and their entire gangster organization?While Aaron Johnson does well as the titular character Dave/Kick Ass, the more memorable actor and character in this whole film is Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. It was disconcerting to see a real 11-year old girl do all the killing Hit Girl did because this film did NOT sugarcoat any violence. THIS IS GRAPHIC STUFF! OK, it is CG but still very bloody graphic. However for some perverse underlying reason, Hit Girl was great movie character!This movie sets up Part 2 very well, and yes, I am now quite excited to watch it as well. Now I know exactly what I am getting into. I am eager to see how the lessons Kick Ass and Hit Girl learned about being heroes here in Part 1 will affect their characters in Part 2.

Although it does feel disturbing because there is a little girl, that looks about 12, that murders, maims, and brutally kills people left and right and has no remorse.The movie is about a high school boy, Dave, whom wonders why there are no real life superheros, so he decides to invent one, Kick Ass. Only problem is he is a complete wimp whom has no fighting skills. He lucks out and saves a guy from some punks and it's caught on camera. He becomes an internet sensation. Soon he gets the affections of the girl he likes, slight problem is she thinks he's gay.There is the big bad crime boss, Frank, whom thinks Kick Ass is messing with his dealings. However it really is Big Daddy and Hit Girl, otherwise known as the killing machine.

There is the high school experience and the family life. Expect the unexpected, and the movie doesn't dumb you down. Superbad meets Kill Bill is an excellent analogy for this movie.

Terrorism for the eyes,"Based on British writer Mark Millar's comic book series, this is an ultraviolent satire from the writer/director team behind 2007's Stardust. Like that film, Kick-Ass tweaks the nipples of genre convention to create something bold, distinctive and memorable. Unlike that film, Kick-Ass's central love story is between a father and daughter, the former educating the latter by shooting her in the chest with a handgun from ten yards.The plot concerns a normal kid, Dave Lizewski (Nowhere Boy's Aaron Johnson) – not an uber-geek or a ruffian – who dreams of being a superhero. When a mugging leaves his nerve-endings ruined, he unwittingly finds himself allied with the twisted dream team of Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) as they seek to take down the vicious crime-lord, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). Impalements, over-sized microwaves and dual-handgun ballet ensue.If film-making is a process of small judgements adding up to a single whole then Goldman and Vaughan get most the decisions right. The pacing is superb, with the snappy, fabulously foul-mouthed script bridging a series of thrillingly inventive set-pieces, chief among which are Hit Girl's introduction as she splatters the walls of a drug den to The Banana Splits theme song (a possible reference to the grandfather of the modern superhero movie, Richard Donner), as well as a first-person perspective rescue mission played out to a re-working of John Murphy's ""Kaneda's Death"" theme from Danny Boyle's Sunshine.There are a couple of cons. D'Amico is a familiar mob boss with familiar patriarchal issues; he could have used a perversion or two aside from bloodlust. And Big Daddy's old police buddy (Omari Hardwick) is unfortunately sidelined, destined to remain perennial backup, as if too damn honest to spoil the party. And what about Xander Berkeley's sporadically glimpsed Gigante? Perhaps the sequel (""Balls to the Wall"") will share the love more evenly.Unlike the bloodless, toothless, sexless Scott Pilgrim Versus the World, Kick-Ass spits vile anarchy from every orifice. Both films are wish- fulfilment fantasies for grown-up geeks, but while Scott Pilgrim reduces the sub-genre to 8-bit whimsy, Kick-Ass enhances it to glorious, eye- gouging HD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This Movie was NOT and NEVER will be a superhero Movie,"I gave it a 1 out of 10 because I rated it as a Superhero movie. If it was rated as a gory blood fest with killings and guts etc then maybe I'd give it a 2.If you are a 15 year old - or somehow haven't matured enough in your 20's or 30's and still listen to Zane Lowe on radio 1 for your next CD to buy - then maybe it is for you. I hasten to add that even when I was 15 - I would need not only to have gone back in time but changed my entire physical self to some kind of moron that confuses a superhero movie with a dark comedy about gangsters with 'American Pie' characters. Just for the record when I was 15, 'Weird Science' was my best film.Let's get one thing straight before we begin - I love comics, the smell they have, how you hold them - the very look and experience of the fantasy and the magic. I understood why a teenager would want to be a superhero - so the movie starts with a good premise - but remains in a world void of that spirit. Give me Superman, Spiderman, Batman any day. It's fun - the comic book experience. It was NEVER about engaging with the readers to make them feel ill. It was never about offending sensitivities. It was about good overcoming evil. Simple. Check the ticket returns for a real superhero movie Vs 'this attempt'.I really felt that this movie insulted the genre of superhero films. If you wanted comedy - watch 'Mystery Men' - keeps the same dreams with misfit characters. This movie is violent just for the sake of pulling itself through each and every sordid scene. Luckily it sits by itself unable to be bench marked. I haven't logged into my IMDb account in such a long time, but felt it necessary to counter the positive reviews. Sorry! I needed to shout to anyone mature enough who enjoys comic adaptations (and yes I can see the oxymoron 'Mature = Comics') to make a reasoned judgement about watching this ""piece of filth"". I know that sounds like I work for the Daily Mail, but for the sake of freedom of expression - I would stop no one who wants to genuinely sit through this - then fine, but for perhaps parents who have children almost the age of Hit Girl say 11, and thinking her use of salty language is funny - forget it. If my daughter spoke like that I would be mortified - it's just not funny or cool or anything.This - people belongs on the top shelf with other adult publications - not comics. It's like the Viz comic, but no where near as funny. It's marketed and aimed at young adults (which of course will include school children) and it is definitely not suitable for them. This picture is sick and twisted and no impressionable youngsters should be viewing these images. Hollywood has an open weeping sore. It's not well. Another symptom of our fallen social morals.

Surprisingly Kick Ass-- Very Hilarious,"Saw this at an advanced screening today. Saw Kick Ass. It wasn't as good as I expected it to be but I expect it to be very popular. It is as good as the Hangover to comic book fans. Even if you don't like comic books it is pretty hilarious-- really hilarious. It is a tad bit vulgar but perfect for teens and young adults. Also, it is very similar to Tarantino and Taxi Driver, except more.. Hollywood. It's a bit different. Nic Cage is the same as ever. I didn't like Mintz-Plasse (McLovin) in this film, it wasn't quite his character. But I loved Hit Girl. It was like the director watched tons of comic book movies and tried to imitate the style but missed a bit as in there were moments when the film dragged. AMAZING fight scenes though like Repo Men.I think Hit Girl will soon have a very big fan club though. I believe in Hit Girl. (:",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A truly unique movie,"Kick-Ass may not be the best superhero movie ever made, but it does have one quality that sets it apart from all others. There have been so very many superhero origin movies, but most are set in comic book universes where superheroism is already known, and so the emergent protagonists are treated as merely the new kid on the block. In Kick-Ass we get to see the actual emergence of the first ever superheros, and the inevitable surprised and - at first - incredulous attitude of both the general populace and the ""bad guys"".This, for me, makes Kick-Ass probably the most original handing of superhero lore that has ever been presented.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Hit Girl kicks...well, you know","If the idea of a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughtering people is just too repugnant for you then do not watch Kick-Ass. If you are willing to accept such an idea then there is much for you to enjoy in this movie. This movie is gleefully over-the-top in every way. And it makes for a rollicking good time. The movie has great wit, action and, surprisingly for a movie which is absolutely drowning in blood, charm. But make no mistake, for all the movie has going for it the best thing it has to offer is that pint-sized, potty-mouthed terror, Hit Girl.But before we get to Hit Girl a word about Kick-Ass since the movie is after all entitled Kick-Ass. Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski, an ordinary, anonymous teenager who decides to become a real-life superhero. He buys himself a cheesy costume, christens himself Kick-Ass and takes to the streets to save the day. And proceeds to get his ass kicked. But soon enough he manages to become an internet sensation...who's still getting his ass kicked. Enter Hit Girl. Begin the slaughter. She's got a costume but, unlike Kick-Ass, she's also got skills. And no qualms about hacking off a bad guy's limbs. She's been trained by her father who dresses like Batman and calls himself Big Daddy. This is one deadly duo. They're going to team up with Kick-Ass who, all things considered, might want to go back to being plain old Dave Lizewski.There is much to like about the movie. It's funny, it's exciting, at times downright exhilarating. Not everything works perfectly. A subplot where Dave's dream girl, Katie, suddenly becomes interested in him because she mistakenly thinks he's gay doesn't add much to the proceedings. Mafia boss Frank D'Amico, the main villain for most of the film, is not the most exciting of antagonists. A movie this far out there (and boy is this movie far out there) needs a more compelling adversary for our heroes. Happily Red Mist enters the fray. Yes, another weirdo in a costume.The one flaw with the film which is most clear is that the central character is nowhere near as interesting as the supporting players. Johnson gives a reasonably fine performance as Dave/Kick-Ass but the character is a little flat. Happily Hit Girl is here to liven things up. This girl is dynamite and Chloë Grace Moretz plays the part perfectly. A star-making performance. Moretz looks every bit the action star and is utterly convincing with the dialogue (including the raunchy stuff) and emotional scenes as well. And Moretz works beautifully with Nicolas Cage, playing Big Daddy. Cage decided to go way, way over-the-top with his performance and in this movie that works perfectly. He hams it up and he should be hamming it up, it's that kind of movie. Christopher Mintz-Plasse brings a very unique personality to Red Mist and, though her character seems a bit extraneous, Lyndsy Fonseca plays the part of Katie well. This is a pretty good movie up to the point we first see Hit Girl in action. From there the movie kicks into a higher gear and never lets up. Embrace the violence, enjoy the carnage, cheer on Hit Girl, one of the unlikeliest heroes you'll ever see. She kicks ass.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Mine was nearly kicked (screen),"Just before the start of the movie, some young idiots tried to make me change my seat because they were a band, but I stand up and they had to split! In fact, this helps to understand what the movie is about: not really superheroes because in the real world, they don't exist but about courage because all of us can show it we wanted. That's why courage was perceived by my favorite writer (PKD) as the finest quality because without it, all the others qualities are useless. If you let bad things happens and do nothing, you are as guilty as the actual wrong doer. This movie is great telling this lesson because you see that there are only a few people awake and aware of their duties while all the others are passive.This movie is also a funny and accurate testimony about teens in the third millennium: Girls, wanking, comics-books are still present but now Internet, cellulars, social groups are part of the life and change it forever. Every moment in life becomes faster and as Bill Gates said, the world is right at the tip of your finger.As a comic fan, I particularly liked the sketches of JRJR (John Romita JR, the actual artist of the comic) that can be seen at the Big Daddy Hideout and in the comic montage even if his story was difficult to understand. I can't judge if this is a faithful adaptation or not because I don't have read the original comics yet.I can only say that it was great up to the online beating. The stroboscopic light was great and I think it would have been a terrific grand finale. But, the movie adds another reel after this and it was not ""Kick Ass"" anymore but a Bond movie with a lot of gadgets.But, I had fun overall and this new and cool cast worths paying attention!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Best movie of 2010,"This is by far the best movie that i saw in 2010 At first i was expecting a mediocre stupid movie but when i saw the note score on IMDb that was up than 8 i think i have to see it maybe its worth of it. Kick ass tells the story of a student that after seeing injustice transform himself in a superhero without powers it seems like its a little bored but after i watch the movie i realize it have most of i need: will, compassion, action, humor, good storyline, excellent cast and characters, excellent dialogues and in my opinion no other movie have all this in 2010. Another point i like to touch is that though i hate gory movies kick ass have the exact amount of violence to me though IMDb parental rate have gore 10/10 it isn't true for me its 5/10, this isn't saw or an horror movie but the shots and cuts looks a little realistic thats all besides the micro wave scene there's no scene that show gore and looks sadic. At some point of the movie it will rise your dreams of be a super-hero like we ever wanted to beWATCH IT IS WORTH OF IT !!! however the film is not for kids i warn you; through the movie you will find the Strong's points of it and they're that it have excellent humor, detailed and excite action scenes, good humor and besides the 4 or might i say 3 hero's will steal the movie: (kick ass) with his strong will,(hit girl) will steal ours hearts with her bad-@ss action moves and innocence, (big daddy) will make us cold with her love for her daughter and for his thirst of vengeance.If you ever readed a comic book or liked super hero's don't even think it GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE!! if you haven't then you will start to love hero's. I don't want to spoil the movie because its too good it make me remember that i still want to be a hero :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"We have ourselves a new action hero, and her name is Chloë Grace","I cannot stop thinking about it this movie. I am obsessed. I am going to see it a third time this week.I saw the trailer for it in the theater, and my immediate reaction was ""No f---ing way am I seeing that."" It had the stench of teen comedy all over it, and I hate teen comedies.Then the red band trailers sparked mild interest, but I cannot recommend those to you because they are spoilerific. Then came the early reviews from the UK, where it first opened, and they were quite positive. Then, largely positive scores from the review sites. So I saw it. I threw together a group of friends so that fun would be had no matter whether the movie sucked or not. It did not suck.I remember the feeling I had after I saw Die Hard. Wholly unexpected jubilation, and a strong desire to introduce others to a great film. I haven't experienced that feeling to that degree since. Until now.I won't/can't say much about the film itself or why it rocks so hard, and you have seen too many spoilers as it is, if you have expressed any interest at all. I will say that I want to give Nic Cage a hug. I will also say that, when Arnold retired from action film, I wondered who the next badass action hero would be. Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson? That was everyone's guess, but that didn't happen. Jackie Chan wants to do drama now. Jet Li is getting too old for wire work. Ray Stevenson was a great Punisher, but approximately six people saw that wonderful movie.I never thought that my next action-hero badass idol would be a twelve year old girl.The work of Macready/Moretz draws upon the speed and agility of Chan, the wire work of Jet Li, the pistol-handling ability of Chow Yun-Fat, the steely-eyed confidence of Clint Eastwood, and the relentless determination of Arnold. All while smiling with glee, like... no action hero I've ever seen before. I want more.Apparently I am not alone. In one of many positive reviews I've read, the reviewer mentions going home and immediately putting Hit Girl wallpaper on his computer. I did that too, and so will some of you I bet. It's not as creepy as you might think. You will understand if you see the movie.This could just be honeymoon phase. Die-Hard has withstood the 20 year test of time. So has Robocop, and so has Road Warrior. This film might withstand that same time test, and it might not. But at this moment, it is a favorite.It should be noted that all the casting is superb. Bravo to whoever did the casting.I laughed, and I generally hate comedies. I cried, and I haven't cried in a movie theater since I saw Old Yeller as a kid.This film is not for everyone! It is not for the squeamish; there are parts with a decent level of hack and slash violence. It is also NOT FOR KIDS. As Moretz herself says in an interview I read, it is R rated for a reason. cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Chloe-Moretz-Is-Hit-Girl-18116.htmlSchwarzenegger. Stallone. Chan. Yun-Fat. Moretz.Please, Hollywood, treat her well. Be kind.Everybody else who appreciates good action film: Please see this movie. Thanks!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Very cool movie,"Usually I don't like comic book movies but this one is really cool and interesting. Even Nicolas Cage, who I normally have some big issues with, makes a pretty solid effort.I must admit that without the character Hit Girl this movie would have scored less than now. But by no way could the movie be without Kick Ass, Red Mist or Big Daddy. In fact every character seems to be exactly what this movie needs and makes this something that you sooner or later need to watch.But again, Hit Girl is the new definition of COOL. I do not know much about Chloe Moretz who plays her but this could be to her little like Leon was to Natalie Portman (there are more than one similarities between ""Mathilda"" and ""Hit Girl"").This movie has many references to films like Kill Bill, Spiderman and many more. But strangely I think this movie somehow beats them all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""Kick-Ass"" is THE Superhero movie of the year!!!","Next month the first movie of the summer ""Iron Man 2"" arrives. But, if I may be so bold, the most awesome, thrilling, greatest super-hero movie of the year is in theaters right now! Sure, ""Iron Man 2"" will have more CG, bigger explosions and a 200 Million dollar budget; and you might even leave the theater with a smile on your face. But if Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' movies have taught us anything, it takes more than that to make a really awesome superhero movie. And ""Kick-Ass"" is a really awesome super-hero movie! The movie begins by introducing us to the central character, Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson: a slightly nerdy and extremely average high-school student. He likes comic-books; wishes girls would notice he exists; and, most of all, he is sick and tired of being mugged every other day and watching criminals run around doing whatever they want. He wishes crime-fighting super-heroes existed in the real world; and, hey, why not him? So, he orders a wetsuit off of E-Bay as a costume and goes out into the streets to fight crime as Kick-Ass. The problem is, he has no fighting skills, his only weaponry is a pair on numchucks and a taser-gun, and his physique is greatly inferior to literally every criminal he comes across. The only thing he has going in his favor is a higher tolerance for pain than the average citizen: he is the super-hero equivalent of that episode of ""The Simpsons"" where Homer becomes a successful boxer simply because he is able to get punched in the face a lot without it bothering him.Yet in spite of how bad he is at being a super-hero, he manages to become a media sensation when footage of him fighting bad-guys gets posted on Youtube. And this coincides with the arrival of two new masked crime-fighters, not nearly as famous as Kick-Ass, but infinitely better crime-fighters: Big Daddy and his 11 year old daughter, Hit-Girl.These two characters are the heart and soul of this movie. If this movie is Uma Thurman's heart in ""Pulp Fiction"", Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are the syringe full of adrenaline going into it.Big Daddy, played ideally by Nicholas Cage, spends his day as nebbish cartoonist Damon Macready; but at night, with far from subtle overtones to Bruce Wayne, he dons a Batman-like suit and uses the millions of dollars he has acquired from taking down organized crime to buy a spectacular array of military weaponry. His primary target, local crime lord, Frank D'amico.His protégé daughter, Hit-Girl, played by Chloe Moretz, has been trained since she was five to fight crime giving her the ability to run on walls, back flip through the air; and shoot guns like Chow-Yun Fat in a John Woo movie. She also a particular fondness for killing bad guys with butterfly knives.I won't say anymore about the plot of this movie because this is one of those rare instances where the trailer doesn't give too much away; and I'll be damned if I'm gonna ruin that. Suffice to say, that when this movie kicks into high-gear, you're gonna love it.My advice, see this movie soon and try to go when the theater is packed. Because this is not a movie that you simply watch. This is a movie that you laugh with, then clap at the screen; and then by the finale, you are simply yelling things like ""Fuck, Yeah!"" every few seconds and cheering until after the credits have started rolling.Plus, it ends with a very sweet set-up for a sequel. So, see this now. Because, if ""Iron Man 2"" is not gonna bring anything new to the table, I want my sequel to ""Kick-Ass""!",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Believe the hype - well most of it anyway,"It is clear that Mathew Vaughn is one of the most promising British directors at present. His debut, Layer Cake, showed the glossy veneer and seedy underbelly of London with a stylised high sheen look and showed flourishes of brilliance - the opening sequence reminiscent of Fincher and the action never replacing the narrative. Stardust showed that he could create an alternative reality that was believable considering its meagre budget. With Kick Ass, the action is rooted in reality. Posing the question ""why does nobody become a superhero?"" it follows a slightly different narrative than the comic book as its protagonist, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), considers the point with his friends and finally becomes one himself - Kick Ass. Foremost, Vaughn handles the action sequences with great competance: the shoot-outs are at times pure Hong-Kong action, other times truly original and the rescue scene is breathtakingly beautiful in its composition. We believe that a twelve year old Hit Girl could do all these things and you wince when the punches, blades and other assorted weapons are thrown. The action is also punctuated with dark and bloody humour throughout, you don't tire of seeing Kick Ass getting his ass kicked or Hit Girl impaling villains and uttering some truly blue language - much will be said of both, but this is a comic book film... fictional reality mean anything to Daily Mail readers? The casting of all characters is spot on, as a lover of the comic I was impressed at how they had translated the characters and their drama to the big screen. It is also worth noting that none of the sharp dialogue and spot on representation of teens is lost from the comics, they are believable teenagers that also look the age they are playing. However, Vaughn seems unsure as how to structure the film; one minute the death of a main character and the next, more laughs as Hit Girl swears and punches some more. The whole film seems disjointed, like reading a comic issue by issue and not as a book. One scene doesn't always appear to fit the next as if part of the previous scene was missing. Don't get me wrong, I thought the film was excellent but not perfect as I had expected from the hype surrounding it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Hit-Girl is as cool as Clint Eastwood in A Fistful Of Dollars,"I don't often write reviews but I just have to write this. Chloe Moretz absolutely owns every scene she's in as Hit-Girl in this movie. Every word that comes out of her mouth exudes coolness. The squint, the sneer, the pauses between words, the gestures. Who taught her to do that? Who was her acting coach? And the scene in the bowling ally with Nic Cage, where she started laughing just before she told him she was just messing with him, that expression was priceless. And the way she said ""I never play"" before the final confrontation, that little bit of a Christopher Walken mannerism, that was exquisite. I've seen Angelina Jolie in Mr and Mrs Smith and Wanted and let me tell you, as good as Jolie is, she's got nothing on this kid. Watching her reminds me the first time I watched Clint Eastwood in A Fistful Of Dollar. I kept telling myself, this guy must be the coolest guy ever to appear on screen. His every little gesture is absolutely magnetic. That's how I felt when I watch Chloe Moretz in Kick-Ass. Sadly there won't be a sequel, or so I hope, as she has grown too old to reprise the role.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
'Kick-Ass' is entertaining to watch but with mixed aftertaste,"In this film, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a high-schooler who isn't particularly popular or athletic, but loves comics. One day, he decides to don a superhero costume, name himself ""Kick Ass,"" and fight crime at night. After few mishaps, he succeeds, and becomes an instant celebrity. Then, he meets Big Daddy and the 11-year-old Hit Girl, couple of more capable (and secretive) masked vigilantes, who are trying to take down the crime boss Frank D'Amico. He winds up joining forces with them. Meanwhile, D'Amico hatches a plan to kill him.The film is directed stylishly by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake), based on a comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. The film starts off like a teen comedy with Dave and his friends talking about girls, comics, and how there aren't any heroes around. I really liked the premise of the film—the whole ""what if"" scenario of a normal person fighting crime in a real world (that is, without all the money that Bruce Wayne in Batman had), which is probably why I loved the first 30 minutes of it. Once the mafia and other heroes come in, it goes more into that superhero action movie mode with explosions and other stuff people pay for.Aaron Johnson plays his role as the geeky Dave with great conviction and sympathy. His character is heroic not because he is capable, but he has a heart of a hero. Chloe Moretz plays the 11-year old Hit Girl with a lot of attitude. There's certainly some shock value of a little kid cussing and vanquishing bad guys, but more on that later. Nicholas Cage brings a lot of dark humor playing the oddball father role as Big Daddy.The plot pretty much takes the initial premise and just runs with it, breaking many rules along the way. There's teen angst humor aplenty, the geek dialogue is a lot of fun, and there's occasional dark violence, which can be a mixed bag. There's a certain optimistic innocence to the character of Dave, which is nice in context of the story, but the limits of realism of the film's world can be rather unclear. Perhaps it's more for sake of realism (or is it?), but the heroes are allowed to kill people (well, at least the bad guys). I can imagine Sylvester Stallone from Judge Dredd screaming, ""I'm not under the law—I am the law!"" Traditionally, though, even up to the more realistic The Dark Knight, killing is the one rule that heroes often don't break—and they take it more seriously. Given the fact that this is a comic book movie, or at least a celebration of that genre, it's surprising that it's not at least addressed. But, it helps the action, so it's mostly glossed over.The action is fun to look at, quite well-edited, but rather unsettling, when one thinks about it. I take it the novelty here is seeing an 11-year old girl cussing and ruthlessly gunning down adults (yes, they're still bad guys) in stylistic, over-the-top fashion. I suppose it works within the context of a comic book movie, yet we see gore and blood and gunshots rather realistically. Quite a desensitized kid we have here. Now, imagine if we had a black kid playing this part. There would be a huge uproar and this film would be amongst the most controversial movies ever made (never mind that these are still bad guys getting killed). Of course, we don't really believe that a little girl could ever do that stuff in real life, which is why many are not as bothered by it. It's dismissed as usual comic book silliness (at least until we see a similar event happening in the news). Call me sensitive, but it left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth.This film, overall, was entertaining, unique, and certainly had no shortage of style. Some compared this movie to The Dark Knight—I guess they must've not liked The Dark Knight as much as I did. The Dark Knight had a lot more layer and Christopher Nolan's works are always more complex beyond the surface. I also prefer Watchmen and Spider-Man over this. This film is well-acted, the dialogue is interesting, and I liked the characters enough to wish they make it to the end. Beyond the surface, though, the film isn't quite as fun as I'd like it to be. On occasion, Dave sometimes did feel like second fiddle compared to Hit Girl and Big Daddy, who are the ones pushing the plot forward. And, of course, that mixed aftertaste I had.I recall a nice moment in the film where an onlooker at a window watches a mugging-in-progress, then merely looks away, not even calling the police—Dave then points out that average people have become desensitized about things like justice. I really appreciated that scene. I wondered what would've happened if the film expanded on that idea about society? Perhaps he'll discover we don't really need a costumed hero in allowing justice to be done. We can all be heroes by doing the bare minimum of looking out for each other. After all, desire for justice is one of the reasons we are inspired by superheroes. It certainly could've been a more interesting, multilayered movie. Overall, though, ** 1/2 out of **** stars.For more my article updates, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A great movie that has it all,"When I went to see this movie I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It seemed like it could have been either fun or just a corny satire of some sort. Well....this movie had it all...for me anyway. I was sucked in right from the beginning. I like the idea of regular people wanting to do good and try to be heroic.I was interested in the characters right away and wanted to see what would happen. Even after getting stabbed and run over by a car, Kick-ass just can't stop wanting to help. When he meets the resident masked heroes, he feels kind of inept. I love Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy. When he's in costume and speaks, he so reminds me of Adam West's delivery in the old Batman show. He's just quirky enough to do his part justice. My favorite of them all is Hit Girl. She's the most fascinating character. Her fight scenes are brilliant. Besides all this, there's some bad guys doing bad things that need to be stopped. There's also a personal vendetta against the big boss by Big Daddy and Hit Girl. I won't spoil anything, but the last fight is a work of beauty.I'm a fan of comic books, but someone who isn't can enjoy this movie just as much. The story is good and makes enough sense..the action is exciting and the characters are interesting. I absolutely recommend this movie for viewing. Personally, I'd like to see a movie about Hit Girl. Maybe how she became the unstoppable, killing machine that she is. It would be a nice to see Big Daddy raising her. Anyway...go see this movie.

"""At some point in our lives we all wanna be a superhero.""","For the past hundred years (more or less), superhero lore has emerged as a type of modern day mythology, depicting these fantastic tales of romanticized vigilantism where all the heroes have some kind of incredible power and they use it for the greater good. But let's be serious: there is no such thing as a real superhero. In this day and age, however, some people have been inspired by the comics and films and have taken to the streets, dressed in costumes, to fight crime and help the communities.In light of this, ""Kick-Ass"" is a story that eschews the fantasy and candidly faces the facts. This is not a world where people like Batman, Superman, the X-Men, or whoever can save the day and get the girl completely unscathed. Nor is it a world where everything is a concrete black-and-white good-vs-evil affair. Crimes happen and people often just look on without bothering to intervene. Real heroes get the snot beaten out of them, and can even die; there is no invincibility, only vulnerabilities. The film shows all of this straight-up, approaching the subject of masked vigilantism in a light that's far more realistic than most other superhero films to date (a few other good contenders being ""Super"" and ""Watchmen"").However, this film is not all about the realism. In fact, realism in superhero lore is just something the film harps on sarcastically. The film has its share of crazy action, extreme violence, and includes some scenes that are just too crazy to happen in real life. The film is also quite the comedy, loaded up with funny lines and situations that are so sad that they're funny (or just plain funny). It pulls a lot of punches, delivering a shock and awe style of entertainment that will likely offend the most sensitive and conservative of viewers (this film will likely be forever notorious for showcasing an eleven-year-old girl cutting people up and cursing like an adult: you have been warned!). At the same time, the film is colorful and upbeat, contrasting heavily with the messed-up violence and situations; the poignant combination of light and dark is part of what makes the film so funny, so provocative, and so thrilling.No matter how offensive or unbelievable things get, the story still matters, and it is quite strong. With the premise mentioned above, it does invoke some thought concerning masked vigilantism. It also ties in with the character and helps weave a tale of the characters' origins. The film follows the comic pretty closely, with only a few liberties taken (including an alternate take on the love interest, which I find better in the film than in the comic).The film is certainly stylish, with quality photography and unique editing effects. There is one scene I find quite erratic with its use of strobe lighting, but it is mercifully short. Acting is good: Aaron Johnson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Nicholas Cage, and Mark Strong all fulfill their respective roles really well. Exceptional praise goes to Chloe Moretz, whose performance for Hit Girl shows remarkable physical aptitude and skillful nuance (in addition to putting up with the vulgar script). Writing is not bad, cursing and all. This is one of those movies that looks more expensive than it is; all of the sets, props, and costumes look snazzy, with just a few weak spots. There is a plethora of interesting musical choices in this film, and they all help in the experience.While I find that the vast majority of superhero films entertain one way or another, ""Kick-Ass"" is a one-of-a-kind feature that entertains by shattering the standard conventions and smacking the viewers upside the head.

Kick ass of a movie,"We all have desire to be a hero. This movie takes it to the next level.A kid who's a total nobody in high school decides to play his fantasy out and buys a super hero costume.

One night he runs into a real deal vigilante team that kills off eight gangs in two minutes in front of his eyes and takes all the drug money.

Superhero Movie Royalty,"I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of superhero films. But recent ones such as Watchmen and The Dark Knight have stood out to me and I have loved them. Kick-Ass is no different.Kick-Ass skillfully combines audiences' love of comic books, movies and action to churn out the opposite of what you'd expect from a superhero movie. Although it has its serious moments, Kick-Ass has a mostly humorous and satirical edge to it, with well-choreographed action thrown into the mixture.Although the movie as a whole is stunning, there are many things that stand out. One of these things is the acting, particularly young Chloe Moretz, who plays Mindy Mcready/Hit Girl. Kick-Ass does mot aim to be politically correct; Mindy is not your average pre-teen. As famed critic Roger Ebert put it, the role of Mindy is ""morally reprehensible,"" and you can't disagree. Mindy dishes out a lot of the carnage in the film and uses language you may not expect from a stereotypical eleven year old girl. Most people who aren't nit-picky will realize that these things improve the entertainment factor and deliver an extreme use of shock tactics and will love Mindy's seriousness. I certainly did.Christopher Mintz-Plasse is also excellent in the role of Red Mist, the nerdy, yet evil superhero son of baddie Frank D'Amico.Thanks to these superb performances, direction under Matthew Vaughn, an amazing script and lovable characters it was inevitable that I would love this movie. If you're someone who is skeptical about the moral reprehensibility of the film, watch the red band trailer first. But if you enjoy an entertaining, well-written movie, then Kick-Ass is a must see film. Definitely the best film of 2010 so far Great screenplay + superb acting + amazing directing + a great storyline = brilliant, entertaining movie.100% Absolutely Stunning, Must-See 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
I can't read your mind. But I can kick your ass.,"""How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?"" When Dave Lizewski dons a wetsuit to become the no-nonsense vigilante, Kick-Ass, he soon finds an answer to his own question: because it hurts. But, overcoming all the odds, Dave quickly becomes a phenomenon, capturing the imagination of the public. However, he's not the only superhero out there – the father-daughter crime-fighting duo, Big Daddy and Hit Girl, have been taking down the criminal empire of local Mafioso, Frank D'Amico. And, as Kick-Ass gets drawn into their world of bullets and bloodletting with Frank's son, Chris, the stage is set for a final showdown between the forces of good and evil - in which the DIY hero will have to live up to his name. Or die trying...KICK-ASS is one of those movies that is difficult to market to the mainstream audience, especially since the opening weekend for this film was disappointing. It has a lot of bloody violence along with a little girl who makes people think that this is a kiddie flick and the fact that this film is rated R just brings a whole lot of mess and confusion to the table of what this film really is. The best way I can describe what this film is is SPIDER MAN mixed with ZOMBIELAND without the zombies.Unlike the title of the film might suggest, Kick-Ass does end up being overshadowed by the characters of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. In fact, I'll even go as far to say that Hit Girl herself made the movie what it is. She's such a fantastic, awesome, wild, brilliant, colorful, bad-ass character that I liked her more than Kick-Ass. Chloe Moretz plays the said character so well, that she lightens up the screen every time she comes on. You thought the profanity-mouthed kid in ROLE MODELS was shocking? You haven't seen anything yet.However, saying that, Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass did a great job as well. I can relate to the nerd-type character he plays. Nicolas Cage is a mixed-bag. In some scenes, he's brilliant, while in others, he's rather weird. Mark Strong as the villain is more of the same from SHERLOCK HOLMES a couple of months back. Still, he has some great scenes with comic timing. Christopher Mintz-Plasse doesn't have much screen time as the trailers suggested, but he's good for the amount of time he appears in the film.It's apparent the main goal of the film is to entertain its audience and it succeeds at that. The film is filled with bloody violence, vulgar language, and big laughs, most coming from my favorite character Hit Girl. Because of this, however, the many themes touched upon in this film is never fully explored, which could have made the movie a so much better. There are some really moving scenes as well, along with suspense in the fantastically shot action scenes.The main flaw of the film comes from the tone. It found a hard time whether to be a straight-up comedy or a dramedy because somewhere in this film, it does get serious and dark, unlike the marketing might have suggested. In some parts of the film, I didn't know when to laugh or not. Because of this, I didn't enjoy the film as much as I would have enjoyed it.However, with these flaws aside, director Matthew Vaughn successfully delivers to the audience an action-packed popcorn flick with great characters. I found the movie to be ludicrously entertaining from beginning to end with a lot of big laughs and some bad ass action scenes. This is the very definition of an awesome movie. I know I'm not the first person to say this but KICK-ASS kicks ass (for the most part).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""Kick-Ass"" blew me away!","""Kick-Ass"" blew me away! Right from the moment I saw the trailer I knew that I wanted to see this movie. It is easily the best movie I have seen this year! Not being a big comic book reader for years now, I didn't need to compare the story to the anything. Although I may have to source the ""Kick-Ass"" issues to see what I have been missing. I watch movies for the sheer entertainment value and I was entertained indeed. Where people tell me that a book ""is a really good read"", ""Kick-Ass"" is ""a really good watch"". The characters were so much fun and the action was awesome. Chloë Grace Moretz definitely stole the show. How couldn't you love her wit and sarcasm, not to mention the action scenes? Last year ""Zombieland"" was my runaway favourite for its quirkiness, originality and fun. It looks like ""Kick-Ass"" will be it this year. Hopefully we will see more great stuff from Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The Perfect balance of hilarity and violence held by a more than great storyline,"When I heard about Kick-Ass, I thought: ""Ah, just another Cheap flick from the expired taste of the Scary Movie Crew."" However when I saw the crew who were behind it (SuperBad, Knocked Up) I ate my words and kept chewing until the opening night.It was on that night when my friends and I went into view Kick Ass, expectations at a medium and pessimism at an all time high having suffered the multiple messes brought about by recent superhero movies (ala Spiderman 3 and Gi Joe). We certainly did not expect the hilarity that was to come!Now, I'm not going to talk about any background regarding the brilliantly casted characters or the more than fun story line, however what I will tell you is that Kick Ass is worth the expensive ticket. Believe the reviews. It's just brilliant!Combine the humour of Superbad with an irregular Superhero plot and watch in pleasure as Kick Ass is born. Lets just put it this way, there's a reason why IMDb rating reads: 8.8/10. You should not be disappointed!Overall rating10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-ass kicked ass,"Unique!! That is my word choice for this movie. It is pure brilliance, and genius. It perfectly mixed seriousness and comedy unlike any other movie that I have seen in a long time. It's certainly not like any other superhero out there today. An average teenager with no super-powers just decides to become a superhero, only to realize how hard it is. Meets other superheroes, and they go to war with a drug-dealer. Perfect. It really got me excited for part 2. Mark Strong as Frank Damico was perfect. Could not have asked for a better performance from him. Seeing this movie made me want to be a superhero, and it gives the belief that anyone can be a hero if they put their mind to it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""Wait till they get a load of me""  Ho-Ho","I can't claim to be an aficionado of the comic-book Kick-Ass, written by Mark Millar and John Romita (and in case you don't remember, don't worry, their names pop up as characters read the comic-book on screen, good tie in, I mean, in-joke), and I can't even speak entirely for what the man's talents as a writer are completely (other exposure would include his Superman: Red Son comic, which was a fantastic 'elseworld' book, and the adaptation of Wanted from 2008, which was... decent). But what is here is the film, directed by Matthew Vaughn, on a rather gigantic wave of fan-boy buzz and hype. Character posters have appeared in subway stations and on internet sites, commercial emphasize the ""Kick-Ass""-ed nature of the characters, and the trailer is juiced up to pump up the audience like there's no tomorrow. As a red-blooded 20-something going into the film, I had no expectations as to the total quality of the film, but I hoped for the best.As it turns out, Kick-Ass is... just OK. That might be the worst thing Vaughn would want to hear, but it's what happens when one shoots so high with a high concept while also, as a director, not taking into account something as, say, originality. I don't mean in the premise itself, per-say, which concerns a teenage kid, Dave, who is just an average nerdy dude who gets picked on and whose mother died rather un-tragically from an aneurysm (oh, and he masturbates a lot, just thought I'd share that). He decides one day, 'hey, why doesn't someone just become a superhero?' Dave throws on a scuba suit, goes out into the world, and... gets his ass beaten down, a lot, like emergency-room suitable. But, as he says, like a good serial killer, he can't let go, and keeps going out, getting his ass kicked (and kicking a little bit here and there), and a video sparks him into the momentary flavor of the moment.There is some satire present here in this concept, and with some of the other characters, like Mr. McCready and his daughter, Mindy, the former training the latter since birth to fight and, on occasion, be shot at like it's going to the park (""It's like getting punched in the chest,"" kindly Damon says). Whether this is all really top-notch satire it's hard to say; from the looks of material in Kick-Ass and Millar's previous adaptation Wanted it's easy to say that he's a big Fight Club flavor, really, just a big comics fan since naturally he writes for them and wants to toy and see what makes the conventions kick. In fact I wasn't bothered so much by the Big Daddy/Hit Girl relationship... actually, that's a white lie. It is disturbing, particularly when set, at least at first, in something that really resembles a ""real"" world in the scope of a movie. But it's handled well in the sense that it's interesting.I actually would want to see more of that, and see more of Hit Girl/Mindy developed. But then again, why have development (playing Devil's Advocate here) when you can just have Hit Girl by way of her father/mentor go around killing lots of people without much background in character. What ultimately comes up in the film is a sense of a shallow interpretation of the material, of it sliding into a weird region where it loses sense of any kind of reality based in its satire and becomes a derivative fan-boy genre wet dream. And I'm not trying to make hyperbole with that; Vaughn transforms his film, in the second half, after what has been a curious mixed-up but sometimes very funny story of misguided outcasts living vicariously through fantasy, into a genre knock-off. And not even that, but a Tarantino knock-off. By the time the Morricone music came up and the masses of guards arrived, only one thought creeped in my mind: At what point does Hit Girl join the Deadly Vipers?The loss of originality in the direction, and moments of humor that fall flat, could be made up by the performances. As luck would have it, Nicolas Cage does really rise up to the occasion (perhaps as he's such a comic-book fan himself that he really does get what Millar and Romita went for). He puts on a strange William Shatner type of inflection for stretches of time, and puts some serious emphasis into his characters own vendetta - his story makes up the crux of the film, getting vengeance at the gangster played by Mark Strong - and he gives a genuine piece of work, at times howlingly hysterical and dead-pan. Those who fare less well are Hit Girl, played by Chloe Moretz (though she does what she can), and especially the guy playing Kick-Ass. Even in scenes where I wanted to get behind the jokes, like the running side-story with Dave and the girl who thinks he's gay (a creep thing to do, but hey, he's a teen), I couldn't because it's just an unconvincing performance. Mint-Plasse as Red Mist doesn't fare much better, but the character is one-note anyway.I wish I could get behind the film a lot more than I did. Yet, the longer it lingers in my mind after watching it, the less I think of it, favorably or negatively really. It will probably give its already solidified fans of the comic something to chew on, and maybe Vaughn can bring a few more into his cinematic fold. Little sparks of a fantastic commentary show up (perhaps media attention, which has some basis in fact, re: the story a year ago in Cincinatti where an actual guy named ""Shadow Hare"" went out to try and fight crime, could have given some better focus). But overall, it doesn't really make its mark as its own genuine article, which is a shame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"An Excellent,Action-Packed,Hilarious,Over The Top Superhero Action-Comedy And One Of The Best Superhero Films Ever Made.","Kick-Ass is an excellent,entertaining and hilarious Superhero/Comic Book film that's filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,amazing Action,laugh out loud Comedy and a great score and soundtrack makes Kick-Ass one of the best Superhero films ever made and a Cult Classic.Based on the Comic Book by Mark Miller and John Romita Jr. and Set in New York City,Kick-Ass tells the story of teenager Dave Lizewski,an outcast who has nothing in his life going for except for his love for Comic Books and Superheros. Dave's love for Comic Books and Superheros inspire Dave to become a crime fighter and calling himself Kick-Ass and becomes a sensation. However,when Kick-Ass angers local crime boss Frank D'Amico(Mark Strong),D'Amico wants Kick-Ass dead. Now,with the help of other crime fighters Hit-Girl(Chloe Grace Moretz)and her Father Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage),Kick-Ass has to stop D'Amico and end come out on top.Kick-Ass is a brilliant,Action-packed and funny superhero film that wears it's over the top spirit on it's sleeve and gives viewers a film that mocks and reconstructs the Superhero genre and a movie that is violent,hilarious and offbeat and a true Cult Classic. One of the main reasons Kick-Ass is a great movie is that it takes the Superhero Comic Book genre and turns it on it's head taking aim at classic and iconic Superheros such as Batman,Superman and Spider-Man and the film's that associated with them taking all of the trademarks and familiar things and giving them a demented twist that is funny and stylish. Imagine the movie Watchmen if it was a Black Comedy. The Comedy and Humor is truly hilarious and done with a dark satirical glee that goes so over the top that you never know what's going to happen next whether it's with the film's characters or the violence and you as the viewer are pulled into a bizarre world where anything can and will happen. The Action and fight scenes in the film are fantastic and flawlessly executed with great skill and detail and fits in with the film's wild Comic Book energy. The violence is bloody and brutal but done in a funny way. While Kick-Ass takes place in a realistic setting the look of the film has a Surrealistic Comic Book style and look throughout the film with bright colors such as red,green and blue almost a Comic Book coming to life on the screen and it's just beautiful and visually stunning to look at. The screenplay by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman is just amazing and fresh with great dialog that is truly memorable and stylish and at the same time funny and quotable with very interesting characters that will stay in your mind after you have watched it. The film's main characters Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl are amazing,memorable characters that are fascinating to watch because of who they are and how different the two are from each other. Kick-Ass is a remarkable character because he is not like other Comic Book crime fighters or Superheros because Dave Lizweski(Kick-Ass' alter ego)does not become the hero Kick-Ass for the sake of revenge or because of something awful happening to his parents,Dave is just and awkward teenage kid who just wanted to be Kick-Ass because he wanted to know what it is like to be a Superhero and fight crime. And while Kick-Ass does not always succeed in kicking ass like much better and superior Superheros, Kick-Ass believes in what he's doing and you applaud him for what he tries to do even if he fails more than he succeeds. While the character Kick-Ass called himself Kick-Ass but in my opinion the real Kick-Ass was Hit-Girl. Hit-Girl is such an amazing character because despite Hit-Girl being 11 years old and a little bit small she can fight with anybody anytime and can handle herself without hesitation or doubt,using either guns,knives or her own fists. Where as Kick-Ass just became a crime fighter with no fighting skills,Hit-Girl was taught to fight criminals by her crime fighter Father Big Daddy so Hit-Girl can learn how to handle herself when she's all alone with the criminals. Hit-Girl is a character you will remember after watching the film. The most talked about and controversial thing about Kick-Ass is Hit-girl's use of harsh language and violence that she does in the film which will offend most viewers. And while I admit the cursing from Hit-Girl is shocking at times it does not offend me and I find Hit-Girl cursing funny because it's in the context of Comedy and the surreal Comic Book universe. The ending of Kick-Ass is amazing and Action-packed and will leave viewers with a smile. A great ending.The whole cast is amazing. Aaron Johnson is excellent as Kick-Ass/Dave Lizewski,with Johnson bringing humor and likability to the role. Chloe Grace Mortez is brilliant as Hit-Girl/Mindy Macready,with Mortez bringing toughness,laughs and depth to the role. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fantastic and funny as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist,Frank D'Amico's son. Nicholas Cage is great and over the top as Big Daddy/Damon Macready,Hit-Girl/Mindy's Father. Mark Strong is amazing and hilarious as Frank D'Amico,a local crime boss. Lindsay Fonseca is wonderful and sexy as Katie,Dave's crush. Clarke Duke(Marty),Evan Peters(Todd),Omari Hardwick(Sergant Marcus Williams),Michael Rispoli(Big Joe),Stu Riley(Big Goon)and Yancy Butler(Angie D'Amico)give good performances as well.The direction by Matthew Vaughn is excellent and stylish,with Vaughn always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace,wonderful energy and visual style and also does a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Vaughn.The score by Marius De Vries,IIan Eshken,Henry Jackman and John Murphy is fantastic,epic and big and matches the tone of the film. A great score. There is also amazing songs on the soundtrack from Elvis Presley(Battle Hymm Of The Republic)The Dickies(Banana Splits),Joan Jett(Bad Reputation)and Ennio Morricone(For A Few Dollar More Theme).In final word,if you love Superhero Films,Comic Book films,Action films or Comedies,I highly suggest you see Kick-Ass,an Action-packed and hilarious Superhero film and Cult Classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Entertainingly violent and care-free if not as smart or as funny as it wants to be,"Kick-Ass caused a fair bit of hand-wringing when it came out in the UK – and of course most of it was from the media outlets such as the Daily Mail where all their commentary only appears to have two modes – (1) hand-wringing and (2) smug superiority. Anyway, the issue appeared to be that this was a very violent film with very strong language and that it contained a child actor involved in all of it. On one hand one could question the decision by the parents to let a child do this even in play-acting, but to be honest the film is so gloriously over-the-top that it never takes itself seriously and is unlike to bring about the collapse of society that Tooky predicted in his review.This level of attack has unfortunately sparked the opposite extreme – where those that like the film feel they have to love the film and praise it as much as the detractors hate it. This is unfortunate because the film does not deserve to be either blamed for society's woes or to be praised to the high-heavens as if it were the most clever subversive film ever made. The truth is that Kick-Ass is very entertaining in an excessive and ridiculous way. Taken as a response to the darker comic-book movies of recent years, Kick-Ass revels in the ridiculousness of it all, having little pops at the genre clichés and taking everything to a silly excess. In doing this it is consistently funny and entertaining in a trashy way.The references will probably date it somewhat in time, but the nods towards other genre films and things such as Modern Warfare 2 will be appreciated by the target audience. The violence may be condemned for being excessive and gratuitous but doing so is a matter of taste since this is really the point of it – it is supposed to be OTT and it is weirdly enjoyable for it. I don't agree with those that would have this be something it is not though and it is not a film that makes full use of the potential to be smart and make comment. The potential is there though but if it does start out with some clever ideas, these are generally surrendered as the film goes along – it doesn't affect how entertaining it is, but it prevents it being as clever and as memorable a film as it could have been.The cast buy into the excessive nature of it very much and it is they that help carry it along. Johnson in the lead plays his geeky part well, although he was always going to be in the shadow of Mortez, who delivers with great presence and charisma throughout the film. True there is a strange air to seeing a child do what she does but this does not detract from her performance and it is not her fault the material did not make slightly more intelligent use of her character being in this excessive mode. Cage is the big name and is he good playing it for gentle laughs – his imitation of Adam West when in character is a great touch. Supporting is roundly good (and within the tone of the rest of the film) from Strong, Mintz-Plasse, Rispoli and others.Kick-Ass is not the anti-Christ but neither is it the wonderfully brilliant film that others would claim as it doesn't deliver on the potential to be clever and to be subversive. However the resulting excessive comic-book movie is still very enjoyable and funny and if this is what you are looking for then it does deliver on that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Almost there,"Thanks to it's unique atmosphere, good pacing, the delightful cast and the almost fantastic fact, that Kick-Ass absolutely has the balls to push the envelope as it is not desperately craving for ratings and family friendliness, like - you could expect from a mainstream movie - This is one of the most charming, enjoyable and entertaining movies I've seen this year.But. Having all this together, the possibilities would have been at least to make one of the the most original movies in this genre ever, an opportunity that Matthew Vaughn decides to miss. The startup is hilarious and keeping up that tendency probably would have got this movie into history, but at a certain point, it takes a different direction where people (let me quote) ""...have the expensive s*** that does not exist..."" and the 11 year old girl's beating up crowds of ripped crack dealers and professional criminals with ease. Which - after setting up its own rules to not do exatly that - was a major letdown for me. Also Kick-Ass occasionally suffers from some seriously bad dialog. Watching it the second time around, without awaiting a wonder, I liked it more though and by the way, the comic book narrative is really well executed.Bring on the sequel, but please, without prostituting the whole thing to do better at the box office.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

a monster with two heads,"1. OK. stars are stupid but it got your attention. 2. I feel strongly about this pic. I've paid to see it three times in 7 days. 3. basic description: there is a core story and then there are layers of commentary overlaid: a prologue (guy on building),and epilogue (returning to normal life), a soundtrack, and a voice-over narration. 4.

The function of the ""commentaries"" seems to me to undermine the impact of the story, to say everything is no big deal. But, saying something is funny doesn't make it funny. and saying it's no big deal doesn't make it no big deal. The ""commentaries"" only confuse, by attempting to trivialize what is profound on its face.

But the last (third!) time I saw it I absolutely cringed at every line of the voice-over. What a load of b.s.

LMAO! Great Comic Interpretation Of Superhero Movies!!,"This movie was F'n magnificent. It was more than that. The plot, it's not as simple as some people may think. Matter of fact I will not give any idea about what's going on but I will say the screenplay was simply great... Things you will like about kick-ass besides the plot, is the dialogue which is funny and intelligently built, you will love the action scenes which are pretty awesome made and the delivery of this superhero satire. It's funny, It's hilarious, it's creative, it's not clicheic and definitely it deserves the appreciation.The movie was edited very well and the cinematography used in this movie gave it a big personality. You would see a lot of scenes taken from different action movies not only superhero ones just to mention some: ""28 Months Later"", ""Smokin"" Aces"", ""Bourne Identity"", ""Scarface"" or ""Kill Bill"". Isn't that awesomely weird? The acting in this movie was great for this type, I really felt the vibe, I mean, I really liked Cage in this movie though he looked a lot like Harvey (The Lovely Bones) portrayed by Stanley Tucci.The score used for this movie was HUGE! I mean you had the ""28 Months Later"" version remade, ""The Dark Knight"" score by Hans Zimmer remade, and a lot of other movies but I mention only these just to give you an info on how good this movie actually is.Things you may find disturbing: 1.

"Well, Is It?: A Review of Kick-Ass","Once upon a time, in 2008, we were young, and foolish. With the release of Iron Man, we felt that the perfect not-too serious, non-stop entertainment superhero film had been achieved. We were wrong. Now, it is 2010, and the bar has been set yet again. And more than that, the bar hasn't just been set higher, the bar has been raced out of the old building into a new one with 5000 more floors and placed at the very top. Such is the new film by director Matthew Vaughn starring new comer Aaron Johnson, Kick-Ass.The film tells the story of Dave Lizewski, a nerdy teenager with an astoundingly unexciting life. One day, out of sheer boredom, he decides to become a superhero. He dons a painted wetsuit and mask and becomes Kick-Ass. However, things don't go very well for him the first time out, and he contemplates quitting. But he figure he ought to keep on keeping on and tries it again, this time with some semblance of success. Through his adventures, he comes into contact with professional vigilantes Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage, in a truly amazing career turnaround) and Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz, proving there are still great child actors out there). They're out to stop drug kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and Kick-Ass—in a way only an untrained buffoon like him could—gets involved. As for all the rest of the plot and various sub-plots: you'll have to see the movie to find out.First off, let's get out some things that could be considered problems. One: the violence. Don't let the kid-friendly trailers fool you, this movie is brutal. Blood splatters, bodies explode, and limbs get hacked off. The more touch types aren't going to be fans, and it might throw off people who just saw the trailers. Two: the juxtaposition of said violence with raunchy, zany comedy. This is another thing that might throw people off. Seeing a guy pretending to be gay to hang out with a girl he likes isn't something you expect to see in the same movie wherein drug dealers explode a dude in an industrial-sized microwave. It's another thing that a lot of people won't be expecting, and it could cause confusion. Make no mistake, even tough the violence is graphic, it's still over-the-top, and should not be taken seriously.That's pretty much it for potential problems. So, do either of those things actually detract from the film's watch ability? No. Not even a little. The movie just works, plain and simple, it works. And it works beautifully. It manages to be a great satire of superhero movies while at the same time being a great superhero movie itself. Every single frame oozes visual style and reminds the viewer why they go to the movies: to be entertained. To be entertained and to be entertained in a way that doesn't involve you making fun of bad characters' actions or turning your brain off. Pure cinematic escapism, dare to say, on a par with the original 1933 King Kong. It's serious when it needs to be, funny when it needs to be, and incredibly exciting when it needs to be. This brings us to another great thing about this film, the action sequences. Some of the most mind-blowing, pulse-pounding action you will ever see, you will see in Kick-Ass. It's a brutal ballet. Think if Dancing with the Stars involved chopping opponents into ribbons. Let's see Robert Downey Jr. do that with the Iron Man armor.Finally, we talk about the absolute best part of this film (although saying anything is ""best"" in this film is like saying there's a ""best"" part of eating the world's greatest ice cream), the characters, and by extension, the actors. There is no such thing as a weak character in Kick-Ass. Everybody here is fleshed out and fantastic to watch. Even Dave Lizewski's girlfriend, whom one would think to be boring, and yet she's not, you actually get attached to her despite her limited screen time. The same goes to Dave's friends, who provide some of the best laughs in the film. That's thanks to both a great script and great acting. Everybody here brings their A-Game. Johnson does a great job portraying the title character, and Christopher-Mintz-Plasse (Superbad's McLovin') is quite entertaining as Red Mist. But the two characters that everybody will love come in the form of Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. Already, I established that Chloë Moretz and Nicholas Cage do a great job in their respective roles, but on top of that, both characters are the perfect blend of loving father and daughter and awesome crime-fighters. There's something inherently hilarious about Nic Cage impersonating Adam West as Batman, and who doesn't want to see an 11-year-old girl spouting profanities and committing acts that would make John McClain green with envy? And of course, this film goes the extra mile to give us glimpses into these character's back stories and gives the audience something more to latch onto than a few laughs.So, in short, Kick-Ass knows exactly what it's doing: creating a well-told tale that makes you wish all superhero movies were like it. It's exciting, emotional, hilarious, and overall incredible. A perfect five Godzillas. You must see this movie.Oh, and in case you were wondering: it does, indeed, kick ass.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of the best superhero type movies I have seen,"I thought this movie was gonna suck, it looked like a repeat of superhero movie (the main hero even has a similar costume) instead I got one of the funniest most entertaining movies I've seen in a while. I don't know how but I actually cared about the characters in this movie, unlike in most parodies, and some super hero movies (cough, cough, Fantastic Four.) This movie was actually better than most huge budget blockbuster superhero movies (this is coming from a big superhero fan.) I mean they made a move about a comic book geeks, Nicolas Cage, Mclovin, and a tiny ninja (I can't think of any better way to describe her) not seem so stupid you wanted to bang your head against a table. I don't think I should really tell much of the story all I can say is see it (just be warned it is violent and bloody, so not a little kid superhero movie.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This film has made my life greater - Ultra Violent and Perfectly Paced,"Let us all Bow down to Matthew Vaughn for what he's done hereI saw Kick-Ass three times at the cinemas, and that ain't enough The first time I saw it. I went to the Coffee shop to finish the coffee I had left with them before seeing the film My eyes were wide beyond belief, I had seen a film with so many great things it felt like more than one movie.The cast was absolutely ace, every one of them. No doubt Chloe Grace Moretz steals the show, and lets remember it's her talent that makes this fully work. No doubt the material is great, but she has the dramatic backbone to hit the beats (even if those beats are saying the word 'C@nt') Nic Cage is a revelation doing an Adam West, Aaron Johnson slides into the role brilliantly, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse proves he can be more than just Mclovin showing genuine acting skills and has a me rooting for him to succeed. Mark Strong is just fantastic as the bad boss.To be frank when I was in the coffee shop, this film felt so great it was like it was unfair. But it does exist, it's not going to go away, and as I type this there is already a sequel announcedLife has become greater because of it I cannot thank all those involved enough for it :):):):):):):):)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The Next Generation of Superhero Films,"I loved this movie! It has a perfect combination of stylized violence and witty humor, something other films have tried and failed at. The acting was superb, as was the storyline.""Kick-Ass"" is the story of Dave Lizewski, your average high school comic book geek. He decides to become a costumed hero and fight crime because no one else has bothered to. He fails miserably and is severely injured, resulting in surgery in which his bones are mended with metal plates and nerve damage diminishes his ability to feel pain. However, Dave is unfazed and goes out on patrol as Kick-Ass almost immediately after recovering. He breaks up a fight in which one man is being beaten by several others, and a video taken by a bystander becomes a viral sensation.Later in the film, Kick-Ass meets fellow superheroes Red Mist, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl. Red Mist, like Kick-Ass, is a teen, but he has a dark secret. Big Daddy and Hit Girl are a father-daughter superhero team, Big Daddy being a man of middle age and Hit Girl being his preteen daughter who is a formidable foe and an expert at killing. They unite to take down mobster Frank D'Amico.My favorite character was Hit Girl. Chloe Moretz did a great job as this foulmouthed, vicious, preteen superhero for an actress of her age. Hit Girl easily stole the show and this movie wouldn't have been the same without her.My only complaint about this film is that the Big Daddy character wasn't developed very much. Despite Nicolas Cage presenting an impressive performance as the vigilante dressed as Batman, I couldn't help but notice that not much happens with him throughout the film.In your average superhero movie, the heroes are merciful defenders of the innocent public, and the villains seem like pure evil but they have good inside of their hearts and they change their ways. ""Kick-Ass"" portrays heroes and villains as they would be like in real life: brutal, ruthless, and determined. Frank D'Amico is ruthless. The ""heroes"" do not spare the villains' lives, they gun them down without a second thought.""Kick-Ass"" is the next generation of superhero movies. It portrays the dark side of human nature as well as just how far some people will go to stand up for what they believe in. The first thought that raced through my mind after seeing ""Kick-Ass"" was: ""Sequel.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Looking forwards to ""KA 2""","On paper, this must have looked like a distinctly dubious proposition: a pastiche of the super-hero movie, with teenage kids played by unknown actors taking most of the lead roles, and a script involving foul language and lots of graphic violence. Yet it works a treat with terrific action sequences and splendid humour. The language and the violence are presented in a comic book context that makes them outrageously entertaining rather than in any way offensive or upsetting.The main credit for this success should go to the British Matthew Vaughan who is both director and co-writer (the other co-writer is Jane Goldman aka Mrs Jonathan Ross), previously known for his direction of Daniel Craig in ""Layer Cake"". Although Nicolas Cage and Mark Strong provide strong acting ballast, most of the key roles are taken by youngsters who acquit themselves well: Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the eponymous Kick- Ass, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist, and the wonderful, diminutive 11 year old Chloë Grace Moretz as the purple-wigged Hit-Girl. Excellent soundtrack too.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
It kicks at least one cheek of the ass.,"I am a big comic book and action movie nerd, and in no way am I a movie snob to the action genre. I'm the kind of guy who let things like the dance sequence in Spiderman 3 not get to me or the nuke the fridge scene in Indian Jones 4 bother me. Even though those scenes are incredibly stupid I try to look at the film as a whole, and worry more about story, characters, and action to be the big factor of whats good and whats bad. With that said Kick-ass has some of the best ideas, and characterization of any super-hero movie.The main character Dave who becomes Kick-ass, is the likable nerd that we've seen in a hundred movies. However, it makes him very relate-able, and it makes the idea of being a real life super hero seem more realistic. His love interest thinks he's gay and only hangs out with him because of sympathy, and he only becomes a super hero just to see if it could be done. The action scenes with Kick-ass are great, because it truly looks like somebody not knowing what their doing trying to fight street thugs, and every hit looks painful, brutal, and realistic. The story gets really interesting seeing him fighting crime, because it brings on a chain reaction through the media, his social life, other heroes, and organized crime. There are some very serious and shocking moments and some highly comedic moments in the film which help give it even more realism. Real life isn't always comical or serious it is a blend of both.So where does this movie go wrong for me? Two words. Hit Girl. Before you start flaming me hear me out. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong with the film until every problem I could think of generally came back to her. For one thing she completely steals the show. She gets the most action scenes by far, and making her 11 years old adds to the shock value of her fowl mouth and her massacre of bad guys. To me it started losing it's charm once she was killing waves and waves of people. I understand it is supposed to be ironic, satirical, and funny but neither of those things work for me. Not only that but it takes away from the realism and the humor of Kick-ass's story. Everything seems to be in the realm of possibility. I could see an average high school student wanting to be a super-hero. I'm sure it has crossed a lot of people's minds. But having a 11 year old girl being trained her whole life to kill is suddenly thrown in to that plot really breaks up the rhythm of the film.I also found the ending entertaining and funny, but I didn't think it was good. It just got even more ridiculous, and I didn't like what they did with Red Mist's character, but I don't want to spoil it for you. So bottom line. This isn't the new Dark Knight, or Citizen Kane of Super Hero films some people are making it out to be. It is simply a good action movie with some cool ideas, and some enjoyable yet completely ludicrous scenes. I think other film makers should take some ideas from the good parts, and people who like these movies and just want to veg out should see it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Hilarious,Well its title is should be enough to watch it just love it,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Cynical and far too easy to misunderstand,"Kick-Ass attempts to cynically deconstruct the superhero genre, and at that level it doesn't quite make it for me. Watchmen - clearly the graphic novel, but the movie too - did so much more intelligently. The sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek attitude with which the gruesome violence is shown fails to make it any less gruesome, and is all too easily taken at face value, especially by younger viewers, thus missing completely the point Vaughn was trying to make.On the entertainment and style fronts, Kick-Ass is more successful, and it manages to create a truly fresh cinematic superhero look, a more colorful contrast to The Dark Knight's gritty realism. The acting for the most part is mediocre at best, except for the wonderful Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl and Nicolas Cage - who hasn't been this good in a long time - as bad-ass vigilante Big Daddy. It doesn't really matter though, because Kick-Ass is all about style and action scenes; the dialog-based scenes are weak and dull enough as they are, filling up the gaps in-between coolness. For comics and superhero fans, including ex-fans who long ago dropped their interest in the costumed vigilantes, this is a great piece of entertainment, but not a whole lot more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Unexpectably Kicked My Ass into the seat.,"When a friend called me on a wet, cold, rainy day to watch this movie ""Kick Ass"", my first reaction was slightly hesitant. The reason being that the only information in which I had heard about this film was that it was a comedic superhero medium film with this ""new teenage awkward nerdy character being the protagonist"", in which yes is funny but I believe this type of film could be wearing a bit thin in my taste. My preconceived notion that I was preparing myself to sit through two hours of Seth Rogan puffing and yelling in amazement that he got out of a some ridiculous situation somehow and talking in his blunt humorous voice to some sort of funny secondary character, or Michael Cera talking awkwardly to some unbelievable good looking American teenage girl. The movie would be funny yes, but I wasn't in the mood, as I had kind of already seen this movie in my mind, if you know what I mean. But how wrong I was.Enough of my story, the movie started and the narration by the protagonist clearly showed that the writer knew his/hers comic books, not that I know a whole lot but enough to understand this movie will create a fine comic movie, as it is a hard thing to do and there are various ways in which to attack this genre (also that Rogan and Cera were not casted). And I was right as the movie provided iconic references and provides us with a new feel to the comic book stories. The story line is quite simple but retains originality; nerd kid wants to be superhero but is falling and eventually succeeds, ruthless drug dealer villains whom which a man on a quest of revenge with his daughter and is all combined quite well. At the beginning of the movie the comedy of the teenage nerd and his friends was fairly prominent and I thought that this would be the extent of the film. The usual predictable things were happening, e.g., glorifying that dressing up as a hero is idiotic and we laugh at this boy trying to become a superhero, etc. For me so far the movie was OK to watch, but as soon as the protagonist attempts to stop a carjacking and is actually brutally stabbed in the stomach, the movie turned and started to become a real comic book action movie started to emerge as we met other vigilantes, Nick cage (this role was probably his dream role and provided a great performance) and his daughter and their very exaggerated was of killing, moving, planning and access to resources, which we all love in the fantasy world of superhero stories. Other great aspects that indulge us into the comic book world such as long shots of New York, the media's reaction to these heroes, explanation of subplot and some of the cinematography looked like we were watching Batman.I will try not to reveal any more about the plot of this dark comedy in which I originally thought will be a ""Judd Apatow"" comedy. The characters and their stories play an integral role into which why we laugh or do not turn away as the absolute brutal violence is thrown in front of us. It may be the ""cool"" feeling we receive with the ""cool"" weaponry (strobe light gun), the secondary characters providing as good comedic reliefs, or just the director manages to let us actually go into the world of comics, (where the exaggerated violence is acceptable) as the violence might even go past the movies limits but no one would ever feel it. Maybe all three? Either way the film is a brilliant dark comedy in my opinion, as at times I even forgot it was a comedy and felt quite tense. I still prefer my serious superhero movies and my Coen Bros dark comedies, but in terms of if you're looking for something a little more whacking, having a few more laughs and some really, really cool, action scenes and soundtrack (Titoli- Ennio Morricone, (A Few Dollars More) caused me to sit up in excitement as the 11 year old girl guns her way through some expendable villains), this movie you will enjoy immensely.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Funny, violent and awesome!!","This film is really let down by it's DVD cover, the cover makes it look like a childish moronic superhero movie trying to be better than it actually is. However, don't take one look at the cover and turn away, this film is possibly my favourite film ever. This film combines gore, violence, comedy and sex. So, in actual fact, it's more adult than childish although I was only 13 when i first saw it and i thoroughly enjoyed it as did my 42 year-old dad who is very critical about most films so this really says something. As for the foul-mouthed 12-year old, do not be put off by this as this may not be entertaining but this makes the film what it is and you kind of just have to ignore the use of the C-word in one of the scenes. Even though this film is classed as comedy, it is very dark and even made me cry at one point. The intense blend of action with background music is amazing.

a refreshingly funny and wickedly entertaining spectacle that warrants the whole franchise of masked teenagers to come,"Aptly titled Kick-Ass is an excellent comic book adaptation that proves that there is no stagnation in a superhero genre whatsoever. Based on Mark Millar's violent tale Kick-Ass is directed by Matthew Vaughn, the filmmaker who happens to have a real knack for both action movies (Layer Cake) and teen fantasies (Stardust). It's more than evident in Kick-Ass and although the film has some problems with selecting the proper tone: it verges between campy comedy, dramatic piece and action spectacle, this is a gripping ride from start to finish.Vaughn's direction is nothing less than clever and kinetic. By employing video game techniques inspired by Shoot 'Em Up and Crank movies, Vaughn really excels at showing highly-stylized bloody violence on screen. As for the script, the main concept of an ordinary teenager who chooses to become a superhero is downright effective evoking loads of laughs and our sympathy. Aaron Johnson's cool, unrestrained performance also helps a great deal.The film revitalizes the genre by undermining its rules. The characters involved have no special powers, most of them, no necessary backstory and no turning point that resulted in them becoming superheroes, much like in Watchmen. Despite this, the movie establishes its own pantheon of heroes and the director knows that there's nothing more fascinating than the battle between good and evil shown in a vivid, exciting fashion.What's controversial about the film is the extensive use of pitch-black humor including the character of 11-year-old Mindy McReady aka Hit-Girl who has been trained from the early years to become a killing machine by her loving father aka Big Daddy. The whole subplot may be immoral for some who don't understand this kind of cinema, yet it's surprisingly plausible due to a tongue-in-cheek writing and acting talents of Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage who are as subversive in their respective parts as you can get. Last but not least, the artist formerly known as McLovin' channels a wannabe villain named Red Mist. You may be actually surprised by how smart he is in his plotting.Overall, Kick-Ass is a refreshingly funny and wickedly entertaining spectacle that warrants the whole franchise of masked teenagers to come. 9/10 (A-)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Grate and enjoyable,"In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack of idea, ""Kick Ass"" bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations in it's wake. You're on this page because you think it's gonna be good? Wrong. Or you're here because you think it looks a decent or a good superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD wrong. Reason being, is ""Kick Ass""dozen't want to be good or above average, ""Kick Ass"" wants to be great and it has the balls to want to be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where we've already glimpsed Mark Millar's signature style in ""Wanted"", but ""Kick Ass"" is all about the unexpected.Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to what Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems determined to Honor the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies entertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies have done that but ""Kick Ass"" ain't giving that up either. It's script is razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of ""the burden of heroism"" crippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actions rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to know and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by keeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more you know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all ratable so we're with Dave 100% of the way, it dozen't just have to functional.The real visual joy of ""Kick Ass"" is it's desire to keep it simple but not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things, instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. That's why they exude coolness, despite Dave's almost humdrum existence. This is the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to; not a guy from another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine almost straight out of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong days stuns us in a way no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn't zing and churns them into a finely balanced flawless brew.Did I mention it's feel good? From it's inspired use of music (again utterly ratable) right down to it's outstanding score, like ""Get Carter"" for superheroes; I could say more but there's surprises in store.In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any James Cameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his menacing and humorous turn as D'Amico, a career best. Christopher Mintz Plasse follows ""Role Models"" by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolized Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movie she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she's in, no easy task considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job of all. Being an original umber-geek after Michael Cera set the standard (anyone who's seen ""Zombieland"" knows it's hard to write an original geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it and OWNS it. He leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast where even the smallest roles are fully fleshed out. It's quite an ensemble. A renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one and complementing the film's fun style.Watching ""Kick Ass"" is ultimately like being on a thrill-ride, it dozen't just want to dazzle you, it's wants to draw you in, ride the wave and leave the cinema on a high. And it dozen't do that with gimmicks or tried and tested formula's, it breaks the mold, shakes conventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all the movies you already love. It's not just a movie, it's a standard, one that promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heart and brain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Something is very fishy here!!!,"Don't believe the rating of this movie – at least take it with a grain of salt. As many, I like to check ratings of movies before I go. Kick-Ass opened today (April 16, 2010), and it already has 7,900 votes. Yes, I understand that it may have opened in some markets early. While it may be an 8.5 star movie, I am wondering if the box has not been stuffed. What concerns me is that while females in the range 18-29 gave it an 8.5, and females 45+ gave it 8.0, I note that females under 18 gave it a 5.2, and females 30-44 gave it a 5.8. Maybe whoever was stuffing the box was trying to add ""random"" high and low stars, this is just statistically not plausible. Sure, there may be this kind of range from young to old, but I repeat, here the inner age group, 30-44 gave it 5.8, the shouldering age groups both gave it better than 8! Something is very fishy here.Granted, this may be all legit, some statistical anomaly, but? And, or course, on reading this, maybe future ballot stuffers will be more adept. Then how are we to know?

"A superhero movie, minus the super.","Kick-Ass isn't your average superhero movie. Unlike Spiderman or Batman, there are no superpowers or crazy gadgets, well except for maybe one device used at the climax. This isn't a movie making a mockery of superheroes either. The main character, Kick-Ass doesn't live up to his name. The characters don't feel artificial because there's real and sometimes gruesome consequences to their actions throughout the film. Mathew Vaughn, director of Layer Cake and Stardust, has crafted a film that indulges in violence and stays entertaining throughout. It's a hybrid movie that feels like Kill Bill, Superbad, and Spiderman were thrown into a blender. Kick-Ass is the end result, and I feel comfortable saying it actually does, to a certain extent.The relatively unknown Aaron Johnson plays Dave, a delusional, geeky teen who pretends to be a superhero when he puts on a ridiculous green costume. He has no superpowers and his intelligence and coordination are obviously lacking. However, in his delusion he is determined to stand up for what's right. As Kick-Ass, Dave is a laughable vigilante who gets lucky and becomes an online sensation when someone records him scuffling with some thugs. Throughout the film, Dave conceals the identity of Kick-Ass while his friends poke fun at him and his love interest thinks he's a flamer. As Kick-Ass grows in popularity, he gets the attention of crime-boss, Frank D'Amico, played by Mark Strong. Mark actually gives a ""strong"" performance as the film's antagonist. Kick-Ass befriends Frank's son played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who will forever be known as McLovin.The highlight of this film comes in the form of a father-daughter duo played by Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz. When they put on their costumes, they are Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. I found their background story very interesting and underdeveloped. They both elevate this movie from mediocrity and quite literally steal the show. Their relationship is entertaining and engaging. Cage adds depth to his small role through his bizarre speech and playful personality. Moretz, playing a foul-mouthed 11 year old, has an aura and panache about her that is quite unique.Other than Hit-Girl, I didn't find any other adolescent characters very interesting. Dave and his friends were mostly annoying and offered only a few amusing scenes together. I've seen dorky kids like these in countless other movies. I am pleased to say that the script isn't full of cliché's and the dialogue is pretty well-written. As with all action movies, suspension of disbelief is necessary as the body count grows. The violence is a little exaggerated but it fits the tone of the film and makes it more fun to watch.Just some food for thought: after countless hours of training with specialized weapons, fierce determination, a small stature, and a thirst for vengeance, anything might be possible. If you can't buy that justification, how would you know anyway? Everyday someone in this world goes against all odds and overcomes in something. Why not take a ""that's improbable but not impossible"" point of view! This was solid entertainment that doesn't become tiresome. Don't let the previews mislead you. This isn't your mindless superhero movie or a spoof on superhero movies. Kick-Ass is of a different breed and some (older) people might take offense while others won't find it very enjoyable. To those people: what the hell are you watching a movie titled ""Kick-Ass"" for?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"A Stylish, Daring, and Gory Action Comedy!","What Can I say about Kick-Ass. Well, for starters, it definitely lives up to it's name. It is also a very funny High School film that takes place in the world of superheroes (well, in their won world). The film has a clever and outrageous screenplay. It is daring and original in it's approach, and these days that is hard to come by. It reminds me of Sin City in it's totally unrated but fun tone, although in a lighter way. This film crosses so many different films, like Superbad, Kill Bill, Adventureland and combines them to this very entertaining and energetic film. I am not sure that every scene works, but that's because the film has incredibly contrasting tones at times. It is an action film, a comedy, a high school romance, and a crime film, and it succeeds in all of those genres. This film is definitely outlandish and will offend many people because of it's hard rating and the violence portrayed by kids and to kids. But this is a film that has ambition, and joins the ranks of the best comic book films in the last 10 years together with The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and Sin City, because like all of them, it is not merely satisfied with being your average Spider-Man film. Oh, and the soundtrack is KILLER!",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
WARNING! Adult men may fall in love with 13 year old girl,"There are few movies out there that just make you want to scream...in a good way. In all my years I never expected for a movie to come along like KICK-ASS and knock me on my own ass. There are scenes in this movie that made me literally grip my belly I was laughing so hard, and not to say the non-stop action that really makes you want to dress up as a super hero yourself. All of the actors in this movie did a great job, especially the lead who did a fantastic job of going from cool Englishmen in real life to a dorky lil high schooler. And Hit-Girl definitely stole the show in my opinion. Never have I seen a 13 year old girl in a movie and think to myself, ""She is totally the coolest mother f***er in the world."" I LOVED every last minute of this movie and you will too! (Unless you hate extensive gore and language, then you might just completely hate it).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Fun, but a little bit over-hyped.","Films like Kick-Ass are a fun escape from the usual super hero movies we have been bombarded with since the MCU rose to popularity. It sometimes feels producers forget that comics can be fun, and they don't have to carry the super-serious tone seen in Watchmen, or have the high-concept battles seen in Avengers. I think this is what Kick-Ass does best. It's a comedy, it has some drama, but it is designed to be fun.Cage and Moretz play off each other so well here. Honestly this film would probably be a throwaway without their awesome dynamic. It's a bit funny to me, but this might be my favorite role I've seen Cage play.Ultimately though, Kick-Ass suffers from the same over-hype as films like Scott Pilgrim. Both are entertaining, funny, and worth the time to watch, but I think they are enjoyed more by fans of the comics they are based off. Kick-Ass still gets a ""watch it"" recommendation from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Will impress and speak the loudest to genre fans and comic-lovers,"Every comic-book fan has a fantasy lodged in the back of his or her head about what it would be like to be a superhero. ""Kick-Ass"" is the story of said average person and plays out that fantasy scenario under the most realistic conditions possible. How would being a superhero actually work in modern day? Perhaps ""Kick-Ass"" creator Mark Millar went overboard on the geek daydream by fusing as closely as possible both the world of classic comic fantasy and contemporary realism, but fans who hold the genre dear will convert easily to his wavelength and consequently will enjoy ""Kick-Ass"" far more than anyone else.The movie plays as both ode to and satire of the genre it holds dear, which is by far its greatest attribute. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) stars as a socially invisible high schooler who, as he begins the journey of manufacturing himself as the superhero Kick-Ass, draws numerous voice-over comparisons between himself and Peter Parker including the classic line ""without great power comes no responsibility."" He has a voice that puberty clearly left behind and he's insecure enough that he plays along with his crush thinking he's gay. His hesitation toward fighting crime reminds us exactly why no sane person would try this in our world.Staying true to genre convention, even the ""powerless"" Kick-Ass has an origin story. After donning a green wetsuit and setting up a My Space page, he decides to stop a car theft and ends up stabbed and plowed into by a car. Left with numb nerve endings and metal plates throughout his body which he appropriately comments reminds him of the adamantium inside Wolverine of the X-Men, he survives his next crime intervention and in the process becomes a YouTube phenomenon. The attention brings other superheroes out of the woodwork and their crusading generally involves killing people that work for crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), who has had enough with the masquerading and wants Kick-Ass among others dead.Charged with bringing this superhero film for superhero-lovers to life, director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake,"" ""Stardust"") plays with a myriad of techniques to create a genuine comic feel. He imagines the film in segments -- each done with one particular technique or effect and given a mood through a choice in music from video game beats to Ennio Morricone Western themes. One sequence has the 11-year-old girl assassin ""Hit Girl"" (Chloe Moretz) taking baddies down in slow motion, the other more quickly with a coyer camera. Instead of abusing one technique, Vaughn strives for each to stand out on its own.He also determines when he wants you to take ""Kick-Ass"" seriously and when he doesn't. As part spoof on the genre, he uses some clichéd techniques, but then to reflect Millar's choice to take the story down a darker more serious path, he'll make a choice that impresses you and makes you realize the writing goes above and beyond where the plot of most spoofs go.The subplot of heavy-artillery daddy-daughter combo Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl is a unique but essentially classic revenge story and the relationship between crime boss Frank and his son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who wants to look up to him creates an unexpected twist on another familiar dynamic. In other words, ""Kick-Ass"" is original storytelling rooted in classic comic traditions and archetypes.Part of bringing superhero realism to ""Kick-Ass"" also requires honest levels of violence, sexual references and foul language. R-rated film veterans will not be fazed by the level of violence and not deem it gratuitous. And even though much of it is carried out by a foul- mouthed child, Moretz carries an incredible amount of maturity in a performance that more or less steals the film.""Kick-Ass"" strives to give comic book and superhero fans something they can identify with. Pop culture references abound in this movie and rather than annoy, they help bring ""Kick- Ass"" to eye level with the fan base, as if to say ""we understand why you love these stories because we do too."" Those who don't feel that way about the genre will still find things to like about ""Kick-Ass,"" but will see it at face entertainment value, not as an homage to Hollywood's most powerful storytelling form in the last decade.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Way too overrated,"It was OK. I don't normally enjoy action films and this can be included. It is a very good action film but not a good film. The acting was good, the directing was really good, everything was good. I just didn't like the script and I just didn't enjoy it. I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't.I like films when the action scenes are well directed like 300 but I just felt it was all over the top. And the jet pack, Jesus Christ the jet pack. The premise was good and the cast was good, I just didn't feel like they went anywhere with it. They could've, but didn't. It tried to be funny and it wasn't as funny as it thought too which just annoyed me.Fans of action films will love this because, as I said, the action is very good. I mean, visually, it is great but logically, it just isn't. And I don't think it can compete with other action films, especially any film based off a graphic novel like 300 or Sin City.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"An Occasionally Fun, Mostly Juvenile Action/Comedy","Dave is a depressed nerd who can't understand why no one has every tried to be a super hero and decides to try it himself and call himself Kick Ass. While attempting to help out Katie Deauxma, his high school crush, he encounters two other vigilantes named Hit Girl and Big Daddy; a deranged father and daughter who are just a bit more serious about dolling out justice.Kick-Ass is not soul-shattering stuff. It mostly consists of vulgar jokes, gratuitous violence and super hero clichés. The characters aren't particularly interesting and outside of Chloe Moretz, who is actually pretty impressive as Hit Girl, the acting is sub par. The plot is a bit of a mess and it's hard to really follow or care about what is going on. Kick-Ass teeters between action and comedy and never really finds a happy medium. It's not funny enough to be a comedy and not action oriented enough to be a proper action movie.The music is good and some of the action sequences are impressive, even though suspension of disbelief is a must. I also have to commend Kick-Ass for it's originality and guts as Matthew Vaughn tried to combine many genres and include particularly shocking elements; a little girl slicing and dicing criminals with total relish. But, even though I appreciate him pushing the envelope I dislike the fact that it is used as a gimmick. It's as if Vaughn is saying; ""isn't a little girl killing people cool,"" instead it just being part of the story.Despite it's few good points Kick-Ass is a failure, mainly because of what it could have been. What was hailed as an ingenious retooling of the super hero genre feels very rehashed. You've heard these lines before, you've seen these characters before and the comedy; you've not laughed at before.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Don't Buy the HYPE!!!,"I hardly ever post a full review on this site. But this movie is getting WAY too many good reviews.Let me start by saying that I'm in my early twenties and I don't have children. So I wasn't bothered by the profanity, or the violence. It was the complete pointlessness of the profanity and violence that bothered me.This movie never knew which way it wanted to go. I don't think a film needs to keep the same tone throughout... but there should be a natural progression from one theme to the next. This movie tried to be everything all at once. Eventually I just stopped caring about the characters and the story altogether... which didn't make any difference, because the movie was so predictable, anyways.The acting was mediocre (and yes, that includes Nic Cage, who played the only interesting character) and the dialog was just plain dull. The only gut-laughs came from a few comic/movie references, and some ridiculous, over top sight gags that don't really work.So, despite what the commercials say, you actually DON'T have to see this movie. Instead, you should rent A Clockwork Orange or Kill Bill Volume 2, and see how violence and profanity can be used as a powerful storytelling device. This movie is just another vehicle for over-choreographed, slow-motion, super-stylized, ""300""style dance-fighting with techno music in the background. There is nothing original about it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Were gonna need a bigger review,"People say that superhero movies are only super if the heroes have powers, well this has an 11 year old saying the C word so screw you. Violent superhero movies usually work Watchmen was awesome, Super was pretty good, Defendor was decent, Kick-Ass is possibly the most bad ass movie ever to be made. Every single comic reader ever has considered donning a mask a cape and becoming a superhero. Kick-Ass addresses that and it's exactly what the main character Dave Lizewski does. He becomes an amateur superhero named KICK-ASS! So he goes out a couple of nights a week and fights crime. The movies average at this point and not really exciting, but certainly not boring. Then just before Kick-Ass is about to get beaten up Hit Girl arrives and massacres a load of guys, to the banana splits theme, with 2 samurai swords, whilst dressed as a superhero, at the age of 11! Before I saw this movie I thought that the most awesome movie character ever was The Comedian from Watchmen. Hit Girl makes The Comedian look like Scooby Doo, she's vulgar, she's deadly, she's totally bad ass and she's an 11 year old girl! But she's not on her own, Nicholas Cage himself plays her Batman like father who's secret superhero identity is Big Daddy. Big Daddy is obviously based on Batman, but he's a thousand times better.Aaron Johnson is Kick-Ass and he's brilliant never did he stop being believable, Lyndsy Fonseca is his girlfriend and isn't as good as everyone else, but good enough. Nicholas Cage who hasn't had a good role since Con Air is back and he's bad! Well actually he's good, but he's bad as in so awesome. But really this is Nicholas cage's best role of all time, and he was very good as the lead in Con Air, which is not surprising because the last really good film he was in before Kick-Ass was also Con Air. Christopher Mintz Plasse (aka Mclovin from Superbad) has a new best role of all time, not only is he funniest actor in the movie. But he's believable as a comic book nerd, because he always plays nerds, because he's so good at it! Mark Strong is his dad (in the movie) Frank D'Amico and he's just one of the best movie villains ever, that's a fact. Now onto the star of the show! Chloe Grace Moretz as Hit Girl, as far as I know Chloe Grace Moretz's career is going well.... very well. She's going to be Carrie, she was in a Johnny Depp film when she was 14 and has plans to star in a movie coming out in 2015. We can safely assume that her career is going well, and that her careers success is mainly down to Kick-Ass. Before Kick-Ass she had been in a few minor horror movies and Big Momma's House 2. Yes you read that right, Hit Girl was in Big Momma's House 2. If you looked at all the movies she's ever been in and charted it, the popularity would go up very quickly after Kick-Ass, the reason for this is that Hit Girl suits her. I'm not saying that Chloe Grace Moretz is a murdering superhero who's dad is Nicholas Cage, but her age and appearance is the same as the character. If they had got a 16 year old to play 11 year old Hit Girl so there wouldn't be too much controversy about all of the cussing. That would have taken the adventurousness out of the movie, and would have looked stupid! So overall the acting in Kick-Ass is more than Oscar worthy - it's awesomeness award worthy. Now onto the plot, it's awesome. Now onto the special effects, a movie with so much violence and gore as Kick-Ass has to have a lot of CGI in it, because most of the fights are impossible in real life. But they did a brilliant job and I'm going to have to give them an awesomeness award for that too. But come on, that scene in the burning warehouse was so realistic that I was cooking bacon on my TV screen. Music is always an important part of a film, in Watchmen the music is the main reason I love it. And Kick-Ass did not fail at this either, it has one of the best soundtracks of all time, and if you took the epic song in the background out of that scene where the person dies *NO SPOILERS* it would be much less emotional. (Clue to the people who have the seen the movie but still have no idea what I'm talking about - it's the bit with the slow motion the fire and the flashing light).Now I think I've covered most of the positive things I want to say about the movie - onto the negative points (point). I can only think of one negative comment on Kick-Ass and it's not even that bad. In my opinion the humour in Kick-Ass does not match the rest of the movie by way of awesomeness. That must be a bit hard to interpret if your not me. With Kick-Ass the stories awesome, the characters are awesome, the musics awesome, the special effects are awesome but the jokes are just pretty funny. I laughed more at Superbad than I did at Kick-Ass, but Kick-Ass is a better movie for different reasons. That is my only bad point about Kick-Ass, the jokes aren't as good as the rest of the film.So I give Kick-Ass a 9.5/10. it is the best superhero movie of all time (in my opinion). This is my 5th favourite movie of all time and I recommend it to everyone on the planet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kill Bill type movie with little kids? Really?.. and you think it is great?!?,"Let us see just how far we push it as a society! Yes, violence is a part of life. I am a realist and can enjoy a violent movie as much a anyone, but putting little kids in it and making them the killers, for any cause? Would this movie suffer at all if rather than featuring a little kid it had a young adult? What was the purpose? What is next, I venture to guess? First, they take ""Cars"" and turn a cute little movie for kids into a sequel where characters get blown up and tortured, aka James Bond (and get to keep the G rating!!!!) Now, trying to set a new milestone, comes ""Kick Ass"" which features a pre-teen little girl happily shooting, slicing and dicing other people, with utter enjoyment.Up next, I am sure, a Disney movie featuring two year old toddlers armed with bazookas and gatling guns defending the neighborhood playground from local gangs, featuring plenty of blood and gore, with little bodies strewn all over.If you really enjoyed ""Kick Ass"" without any reservations, take a good... deep.... look INSIDE yourself, and then ask yourself a few questions. It is not about how well it is made as a movie. It is about something utterly, fundamentally wrong with the entire premise for this movie, and the fact that most people accept it with little more than a shrug.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Close but no cigar...,"I went into Kick-Ass with high hopes. While I despise (and am quite tired of) Mark Millar's showboating, self-hype as well as outright lies, I'm quite a fan of his work.His two volumes of ""The Ultimates"" comics are perhaps the single highlight at Marvel Comics (for my sensibilities at least) in the last decade. Indeed, they are rightfully being used as the inspiration for the current stock of the ""Marvel Heroes"" (Iron Man/Cap/Hulk/Thor) films.While Wanted was horribly translated to film, Kick-Ass by all indications is a more faithful adaption. Probably helped by Millar producing the affair.That said, Kick-Ass, as has been criticised on many occasions by various reviewers I've recently read, tries to have its cake and eat it. It tries to force you to accept that this story takes place in our real world, and then goes back on this idea and tries to give you something out of Kill Bill. Pure fantasy fiction. A bit like Millar in that respect, promising one thing only to give you something else. If used properly this could be quite surprising and fresh, but unfortunately it's ultimately ineffective here as it just confuses the tone and theme and left me unsatisfied with the film as a whole.Is it entertaining? For sure! Does it have a decent soundtrack? You know it! Does it feel fresh? Hmmm, kinda. Is it ***hyper reality insane bubblegum superhero antics that changes things forever***? Not quite. There are some seconds where I had thought Millar had elevated comic book films to a new level...only to lose it a few seconds later.Think of it as Spiderman crossed with Kill Bill. Only less awesome than that sounds.I'm interested though, I'll look forward to Millar's next efforts/translations. Surely he can only improve? In the meantime, if you really want a film about what superheroes would be like in real life, try ""Super"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A surprise like never before...,"I heard about this film from my friend, and from what he told me and from the little I knew beforehand about the film, this is the picture I got:It would be a quite ordinary Hollywood film. Just another teen-comedy with some under-the-belt humor and some mediocre acting. Predictable, of course, perhaps tedious, and absolutely without a message or any depth.I figured I'd just watch it to pass some time, perhaps have a laugh or two, and if I got lucky; see some watch-worthy fight scenes. Now I can not begin to describe how entirely blown out of my seat I was. I had never expected any of what Kick-Ass was.With perfect pacing I was taken on a journey through really great scenes, nice cinematography, good acting, funny and refreshing dialog and _story_. Yes, above all story. I never would have thought this movie would have any sort of profound story, but oh man was I wrong. I started realizing, a bit into it, that this movie actually had story; that it had meaning. There was a background, a motivation for everything that happened. This movie was thought through.Then I was blown away again when Nicolas Cage popped up in the movie. I had no idea he was in it, and his role and his acting it just brought some... magnitude to the movie.Then I was blown away AGAIN when the ""gore"" scenes made their entrance. I sure didn't see that coming. It elevated the movie to a whole nother level.Then there I sat; shocked, thrilled, mesmerized. And I enjoyed my way through the movie as the story unfolded and took turns, as pleasant and thrilling, interesting or funny scene after scene rolled by.And at the end of the movie, as the credits started rolling, and as I started coming back to planet earth. And all that had happened was run through my head, I just thought: ""Man! What an experience!""That's what it was: it truly was an experience. And what still puzzles me... what I still can't really grasp, is this:This is a really light-weight movie - with a profound depth.Cause it truly is light-weight. This is no Schindler's List or Requiem for a Dream or any other movie that puts you out of phase and forces you to contemplate for a moment before you get back to reality.Still, at different points in this movie, some scenes, some lines, I was as deeply touched and emotionally engaged as I was during great films such as The Shawshank Redemption. And that just puzzles me... how can this, quite simple movie, have such an effect, such an impact?I guess that's just what you call great film-making.And for this, Kick-Ass earns a 10 from me. For it's sheer effect. The surprise, followed by the enthrallment that ended in stupefied delightfulness.Thanks to everyone who made this movie happen!

Interesting Comic Movie,"Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an awkward high school loser who dreams to be a superhero. So he dresses up as Kick-Ass to try to fight crime. When he tries to take down drug dealers, he's overmatched and gets rescued by Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and her father Damon Macready/Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has daddy issues with his crime boss father and dresses up as Red Mist.The high school guys are likable and his infatuation is charming. I like Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the dorky lead. His whole story is sweet and cute.Nicolas Cage is strangely odd. His halting speaking style gets really awkward. His chemistry with Chloë Grace Moretz is just too peculiar. I understand it's all dictated by the mannered writing, but it's just not natural.The movie does have an unusual take on the comic book hero movie. It's fun, violent, and irreverent.

You take the good with the bad and what do you get?,"You get Kick-Ass. Definitely a movie with more good than bad, Kick-Ass is far from a perfect film.Let me start by saying that this film is great fun, but not for everybody. While I personally had a fantastic time watching some of the more gratuitously violent scenes in film history, I would encourage anybody with a weak constitution for blood and dismemberment to skip this one (it is rated R for a very good reason).What Kick-Ass offers is a surprisingly intelligent take on the idea of costumed heroism and an incredibly violent spin on your typical coming of age teen comedy. Throughout the wry satire movie patrons will find themselves on a roller coaster of crime fighting fun. Unfortunately this works to the films disadvantage. Kick-Ass is ultimately too concept driven for mass appeal, and when you couple the movies bipolar jumps from ultra violence to teenage sexual frustration with a rather simple story and you have a film that will be incredibly hard-pressed to win over the art house film buffs. Kick-Ass is (much like the films protagonist) in an awkward spot between mature and adult and trite and juvenile.But if you fall into the films demographic you will find a very enjoyable experience. The acting is largely fantastic though I did find Christopher Mintz-Plasse's (Red Mist) performance to be very weak when placed next to Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl), who steels the show, and Nicholas Cage (Big Daddy), who delivers one of his best performances in recent years.Ultimately Kick-Ass is a fun violence filled romp that I personally look forward to adding into my movie collection. That being said it's a move that keeps closer company with Transformers than The Dark Knight. I cannot stress enough how this film is violent but if the idea of an 11 year old girl slaughtering people amuses you than Kick-Ass just might be the best way to spend your day at the moves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Entertaining but problematic,"Some movies get better with time, some movies get worse. Case in point, 2010's Kick- Ass. When I first saw the film, when it was playing theaters, I thought it was amazing. I thought it was a daring, original and groundbreaking entry in the comic book movie genre. Now that I've seen it again, for the first time in about two years, I definitely have to paddle back a little bit.The idea of a superhero movie set in the supposedly real world (or as real as the movies can get) was quite new at the time. And so the first scene of the movie sets up exactly that premise perfectly in a darkly comic way, when a self-proclaimed superhero plunges off a building, just to fall to his bloody death, all accompanied by the narration of the titular Kick- Ass aka Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson. He is a perfectly average high schooler, so average that he himself admits to not be the smartest, not the funniest, not the best at anything. And even though we don't know it yet at that point in the movie, but this is the first problem the film has, its main character. But let's look at the plot first, shall we?Dave, one day while hanging out with his nerdy friends at the comic book store, asks himself why there are no superheroes in real life, why nobody has ever attempted to fight crime as a masked vigilante. So off he goes, buys himself a bright green and yellow scuba suit and goes out on the street to become his alter ego, Kick-Ass. What then follows is a nice sendup of all the obligatory training montages we've seen in films like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. It's at that point that we are introduced to the highlights of the movie, Nicolas Cage and Chloë Grace Moretz as father-daughter duo Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. When Kick- Ass becomes a crime fighting sensation thanks to his inability to feel pain after a bad car accident, Big Daddy, Hit-Girl and him team up to fight crime lord Frank d'Amico, played reliably with his usual villain stick by Mark Strong.If I had to summarize the film in one word, it would be schizophrenic. It has two personalities, all the way through. While the first half does a fairly good job of parodying its genre, the second half succumbs to the tired genre tropes it so desperately wants to persiflage. The taste of formula right there is especially unpleasant, given the potential it fully delved into previously. The depiction of violence is another problem. There is an odd juxtaposition between cartoonish violence, such as when d'Amico's goons microwave a guy who then explodes into a giant bloody pulp, and a more realistic, and quite nasty, take on violence. Just watch the scene when Nicolas Cage's character gets horribly burnt to death (Hello spoilers!), that will definitely leave a bad taste in your mouth. And the sad part is, the film doesn't do a good job of presenting the heroes as the good guys. Either way, the villains and heroes are using the most brutal ways to hurt and kill each other, and it's hard to root for somebody when both sides' gritty methods of execution are indistinguishable from each other. Playing wildly catchy music over Hit-Girl's slicing people's limbs off is simply not enough to convince us that our heroes are doing the right thing. The movie's complete lack of reflection upon bloody killings really does stick out like a sore thumb. One can't help but start sounding like an old fart who complains that movies nowadays brainlessly celebrate violence and make it look cool.And I haven't even got started on my initially mentioned problem with our title character. Kick-Ass is so limited in his abilities, so bland as a character that he seems to disintegrate into the background every time another person is on screen with him. Again, since it is even mentioned in the dialogue how completely average he is, maybe it was all intentional, and Aaron Johnson is not a mediocre actor but is simply brilliant at being mediocre.These are all major flaws and you might think that I completely dislike Kick-Ass but let me tell you, you couldn't be further from the truth. There are plenty of redeeming factors the film has. While Aaron Johson is quite a letdown, the rest of the cast shines so much more. Grace Moretz is quick-witted as Hit-Girl, Nicolas Cage is a riot giving his best Adam West impression when in costume, and Mark Strong has fun being a badass while struggling to connect to his nerdy son, played solidly by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Director Matthew Vaugh keeps up the pace and makes sure that on a shallow level, the film is entertaining through and through. If only there would have been more brains applied in its context, Kick-Ass could have been the superhero movie to end all superhero movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

I did enjoy this movie thoroughly. Of course it had its downsides, but what movie doesn't? I see so many complaints about Chloe as Hit-Girl, and all I can do is praise her. Children tend to ruin movies for me, but, this was not that case. This movie was brilliant because of her. The amount of seriousness mixed with childishness was hilarious and entertaining as hell.Nicholas Cage, I will honestly say, every movie I have ever seen him in, I have no enjoyed. Movies such as, Ghost Rider, National Treasure, The Wicker Man, all these movies made me want to cry. But, in Kick Ass, I couldn't help but love him. He felt so cheesy and dumb, but, that's the kind of movie this is. He was a stereotype that people have seem to have forgotten, and he played it beautifully and he had me laughing whenever he was on screen. And not to mention, his action scene was pretty bad ass.Christopher Mintz-Plasse, I'm not a huge fan of. Superbad was a rather awful movie, and he didn't make me go crazy in this film. Something about this guy just makes me hate, it's probably his voice, and the goofy look that is ever present on his face. He could have easily been left out of this movie for all I cared.Aaron Johnson I think I will look forward to in the future. I liked the way he did the roll in this, his voice got a bit old and he seemed to be trying far to hard to have a geeky attitude, when we knew it was there. Overall, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It was funny, the action was good, and the story wasn't God awful. It didn't take itself too seriously, but when it did, it did it well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"The Dark Knight... Watchmen... Kick-Ass, that's comic elite!!!","One of the three best comic movies ever! In the beginning you may find it stupid, you may think of it as of some jackass teenage comedy. So just wait about eight minutes, because after those you'll be given a fantastic action/comedy/drama about bunch of kids playing superheros. But it's totally not for kids.In the beginning, this movie is very realistic, almost cruel. Later on it gets more action and surreal but still fu**ing awesome! It has one of the best action endings ever. Soundtrack is great, it fits with the movie perfectly.I can tell you - this movie rocked my world.

a lot of fun to watch if you can stomach the excessive violence *spoilers*,"bought this movie at the video store and finally sat down to watching it one evening and was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed this film. i usually have reservations about graphic novels being adapted for the big-screen but after seeing the trailer several times, decided to give it a go. while the trailer looks like a movie for kids, it is definitely not for kids due to the excessive amount of violence and coarse language spoken by the young adult stars. i do agree with one reviewer who said that the actress who plays the role of hit-girl steals almost every scene she is in. this is evident when she appears on screen during the apartment massacre and saves kick ass's life by single-handedly wiping out all the villains with her kung-fu style moves and and expert weaponry skills. a very cool scene with great background music to match. while nicholas cage didn't have a major role in the film i still liked his character 'big daddy'. you really get to see how he got into the business of becoming a superhero and vigilante of sorts through a comic book he created and how got his daughter involved. i loved his costume which greatly resembled batman's. i didn't get too into the character of kick ass who i thought was a wannabe superhero and hanger on. he didn't possess any physical abilities or hand to hand combat skills which is evident as he tries to fight off goons and thugs who cross his path. he doesn't have any specially made weapons or gadgets except for his two batons that he uses to beat up on criminals. his character was wimpy and kind of pathetic at times that i found it hard to sympathize with him. red mist was just okay as he was never a superhero but used as bait to lure kick-ass to the secret lair of hit-girl and big daddy and expose them as the real culprits behind all the slayings of the drug-lords in town. he had a pretty cool costume and drove a car that reminded me of the bat mobile. over-all i enjoyed the many action/fightings sequences which were excellently done. some witty and sharp dialogue and solid script. recommended to anyone looking for a good time and fun ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-Ass is a badass movie (but in a good way),"As a Marvel comic geek, you know what to expect in graphic books such as characters saving the world and defeating the bad guys, who sometime in most stories always gets the girl. But when a Marvel comic book gets turn into a live-action superflick movie, it gets a PG-13 rating right? Well all of them do....expect for one.That tile I would highly called is Kick-Ass. Why? Because not only does the hero kicks the bad boys' asses, he also gets his own ass kicked too. (So you can see why they gave it such a funny title lol)Based off the 2008 comics by Mark Millar, Kick-Ass tells the story about a high school kid named Dave who dreams about being a superhero, but it's not an easy job to do it. But once he does, he inspires others. Those others such as a father and a daughter named Damon and Mindy, who take up the names of Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, along with a kid around Dave's age named Chris who becomes Red Mist, but he isn't all what he appears to be.As the movie-going fans, we all love watching a good superheroes fighting crime and busting villains. But why can't we have those in real life?The creator's idea for Kick-Ass is quickly clever for coming up with an idea like that. Besides all of the action, and the blood gory fighting sequences, you would think that after seeing this movie, you were gonna wish you turn into a superhero yourself.But it is not your average hero movie so it gets an R rating because of the strong language and the extremely hard-gore battling parts. So if you're used to watching highly gun-shooting-saving-the-world or comedy movies, then Kick-Ass is the perfect time to go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kicking' It,"I really thought I'd like this movie more. I'd heard great things from enough people, superhero movies are my jam, especially when they take a different angle on the genre and the premise of this one is definitely fun.It just didn't quite land for me. That and the end really dragged me down. The world had been set up as pretty normal, seemingly, until the end when they introduce something that is completely world breaking to me. That and Cage's character came off as a lot creepy to me. Important to note, I thought Cage was actually pretty good and played exactly what he was meant to, his performance was great but the character itself is just a bit ew. I can only hear him being called Big Daddy by a little girl so many times before it's just weird.Anyhow, still an entertaining movie, it just shoots itself in the foot a bit, preventing it from being great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Bad Ass,"I got to say I was pleasantly shocked when I saw this movie. So, far it stands in my opinion, to be one of the best Comic book movies out there (next to Iron Man).Most comic book based movies always try to over commercialize. Trying to get the most money by appealing to all ages, as a result having to be rated G. That's what makes Kick Ass special. I really did appreciate how true to the Comic it was (sister a comic buff as reference). Things that did differ from the comics only enhanced the movie, and overall story, for the best. It was dirty, sexual, violent as all hell and you would be a horrible parent to take your 10 year old to this movie (yes, parents did to it and walked out 10 mins into it). As a result it was REAL.Probably one of the best aspects of the movie was majority of the acting and fight scenes. I will just name my favorites. Chloe Moretz aka Hit Girl is fu*king brilliant in this movie. Her acting as a 10 year old is so convincing, as well as her sudden bad ass persona as Hit Girl. She gets tons of props from me for all the physical aspects of her role. Moretz as Hit Girl has been the best casting I've ever seen for a superhero. She is honestly the heroine I never got growing up. I am not a big Nick Cage fan but he played Big Daddy fabulously. His and Moretz's quirky relationship as father and daughter is both endearing yet powerful. Best father and daughter duo! Christopher Mintz-Plasse aka Red Mist was loads of laughs and it was nice to see him in a different role, yet with the same Mintz-Plasse flare. Clark Duke aka Marty (Kick Asses friend) is hilarious as always, great comic relief, I would to see more of him in the next film. Surprisingly, Aaron Johnson aka Kick Ass, hardly made any impact on me as an actor. Yet, he was passable as Kick Ass, fitting the pathetic sorry persona, but then I feel that anyone could of played this character. His relationship w/ the character Katie, was funny then got stupid. The rest of the cast did decent to well enough to carry the story.Overall, I am very impressed at this movie. The director worked closely with the creator of the comic to create this movie, which lead to an astounding outcome. Sure, it didn't do that well in Box office for opening, but that's cause it pushed the envelope of most comic movies. This movie deserves to be watched and recognized cause it's pretty bad ass.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Common people becoming superheroes: ""Kick-Ass"" is a great lie","This is one of the most overrated movies ever. The film pretends to show common people becoming superheroes. That is obviously a great lie: we see a hyper-violent (and criminal) child who fights better than Batman or Daredevil! She is really super powerful (what are her jumps and speed in using weapons?!).Therefore, the greatest defect of the film is not technical, but that it is a great and meaningless lie.If you want to see what would happen if common people became superheroes, forget this overrated movie and watch the superb and much less famous ""Super"" or ""Defendor"".The only really nice thing in ""Kick-Ass"" are the spoof scenes and songs.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

I must have watched a different film,"I really feel like I shouldn't bother writing this. It's nearly 2013 and I've only just got round to watching Kick Ass. Since it was released everyone I've ever spoken to about it (and I speak to most people about films!) has said how great it is.I should leave the review there, with the words ""Everyone says it's great.""However, it just left me cold. There was something about it I didn't get. I thought it was going to be funnier. It's not that funny. It's also not action-packed enough to be an action film. The action is over-the-top as if it's trying to be silly, but 'silly' and 'action' don't really go together for me.That's about it from me. I didn't like it. I didn't like the characters. I didn't like the action or the attempts to crowbar some drama into something that's, for the most part, trying to be silly and take off the superhero genre. But I'm definitely the minority.

Kick-Ass,"Geeky ""Dave"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his two pals go through life at high school being bullied and reading comic books. Finally fed up being put upon, he buys a superhero suit online and heads out into the night hoping that his green lycra will deter the city's nasties. After his umpteenth beating he is rescued by a like-minded father and daughter team who take him under their own wing and set about training him. Meantime, the kingpin of crime ""D'Amico"" (Mark Strong) is running the town with a ruthless rod of iron, watched adoringly by his hapless son ""Chris"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Surprisingly, the former trio start to have some success against this arch-baddie so battle lines are soon drawn and, well you can guess the rest. Up to a point, this works. ATJ (especially with glasses and curly hair) is very easy on the eye and there is a degree of chemistry between his character and his cohort ""Mindy"" (Chloë Grace Moretz) all under the tutelage of a rather underplayed Nicolas Cage as her dad ""Damon"". Sadly, the initially quirky start that sees real people aspiring to make their community better - without the ability to fly or laser things with their eyes - peters out quite quickly and the jokes that are quite attitudinally sharp at the start just become a little more puerile and expletive-dependent. Mr. Strong isn't really much of a baddie and the combat scenes are well and truly prolonged to the point where they end up a bit repetitive and dull. It has it's moments, this movie - it's generally quite entertaining but at all but two hours in length it just runs out of ideas around the half way mark and only just struggles over the line.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A hard-ass dumb-ass.,"I loathe the fact that every summer for the past decade has been infested with comic-book superhero movies aimed at teenies with ADHD. Kick-Ass seemed to be an antidote for all that. It has enough self-aware humor without breaking the fourth wall (which I hate) but it superficially breezes through so much potential that, by the end of it, you don't feel like enough has happened.Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski, a totally average high school schmo who decides that there is too much apathy in world and that someone needs to stand up and be a real superhero. The problem is that zeal is his only weapon. He becomes Kick-Ass, and tries hard, and very gradually hones his skills while beating up petty thugs, before being noticed by Big Daddy and Hit-Girl (the ever-eccentric Nic Cage and Chloe Moretz); a father/daughter duo who are far more efficient at annihilating New York's mafioso. Kick-Ass' public appeal and media profile skyrocket while crime boss Frank D'Amico scours the city looking for him.There are some plot holes that bug me. I don't usually care much for nit-picking but Dave Lizewski doesn't appear to go to school with Chris D'Amico, though he recognizes him at the comic-book store. Then how on Earth does he not work out that Red Mist is Chris in disguise, thus leading to him willingly walking into a trap at the lumber yard? The film is very bright and colorful, shot in anamorphic Panavision, and it looks a hundred times better than most other comic-book movies shot in Super-35 (those awful Fantastic Four movies, Iron Man). Kiss-Ass also has re-watch value too, which sets it apart from the rest of the comic chaff. I just wish there was a bit more to it.Matthew Vaughn is also a far superior director to his chum Guy Ritchie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"This movie ""kicks ass"". In a comic book way.","I scoffed at first when this movie was released because of the tiny girl unrealistically kicking butt. But I finally saw the whole thing on cable which tuned-down the ultra-violence a little and I saw a great movie.Great story and unexpectedly funny. Great cinematography. It has a high-color comic-book look to it. Like someone laid the whole thing out comic-book style and then shot each frame for the movie. Storyboard I believe is what they call it.But in this case, the creators insisted that the look of the storyboard, the action, the feel, the look, they insisted that it go up that way on film or video or whatever digital-computer stuff they use now. Fantastic job. I'm sure the uncensored version is really sick, but to many people today ""sick"" is good.I did not know that Nick Cage was in this movie since it seemed that the star focus was on the young kids in the movie. Cage played his role very real. He passed onto the viewer the feeling that this is life in New York now and these things are really happening and he intends to do something about it. Like many good comic-books the movie is also funny. The New York Times called it ""giggle and guts entertainment"". That's it exactly.Of course, this movie was excellent for that demographic that Hollywood wants to watch this so they can spread the word to their friends. Great writing and movie-making talent here in this very good movie. And I'm not even a kid anymore, but in the comic-book genre little kids can kick-ass.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Hit-Girl is the show stealer, a super young girl doing all the super moves with courage like Rambo. Her impressive moves and almost ruthless heart contradict with her sweet and petite appearance, which makes her all the more memorable as a superhero.

"Never mind Kicking-Ass, Vaughn's latest is a kicking; screaming; thrashing assault on the senses which miraculously happens to be both pleasing and rather substantial.","Matthew Vaughn's outlandish and somewhat squeamish 2010 film Kick-Ass makes the grade for sheer energy and unabashed outlandishness, a near-on two hour assault through all things in bad taste and devilishly daring content, delivered through this somewhat perverse filter of dark reds; purples; light greens accompanied by streaks of yellows as well as coldly metallic whites blended with grey. The film isn't so much about the things that it wants to say as much as it is the way in which it goes about saying them, something that dogs the film come the final act but until then remains an unabashed and full on blackly comedic onslaught of sadistic gangsters; disgruntled young men; elusive young women; sickly amusing juxtapositions and a whole lot of off-the-cusp content.Kick-Ass tells the tale of two males, one coming out of adolescence as his high-school days fritter away and his life situation appears to get worse by the day; the other a much older man, a discontent ex-cop whom was wrongfully imprisoned and is now seeking revenge in the harsh, unforgiving, intimidating basin that is modern day New York City. The adolescent is David Lizewski (Johnson), a boy living with his father following his mother's passing, not in control of his hormones and mostly living a self-identified pathetic existence consisting of being rolled over by bullies; rejected by girls, particularly young Katie (Fonseca), and mixing it with his teen-aged friends at internet cafés and comic book shops. We observe him during a tracking shot down a school corridor, in slow motion, which accentuates their characteristics and place in life. They look around uneasily at their surroundings, sport nervous smiles which feign confidence and look a little weedy. His point of attack is generically reminiscent to that of your more bog-standard high-school comedy, during which the presence of Christopher Mintz-Plasse's Chris D'Amico, son of a local mafia kingpin, is encompassed with his own, more exquisite introduction seeing him step out of a limousine: he's been here before in 2007's Superbad, and consequently has his star-system reputation toyed with by the film as being a veteran to all this content.David shares some duality with a certain Damon Macready, played by Nicolas Cage. Macready cuts an odd figure, sporting prim glasses and a tall figure; his big, bushy moustache standing him out amidst proceedings as he encourages young daughter Mindy (Moretz) to learn the art of hand to hand combat via gunshots to well protected chests; pop quizzes on heavy artillery and lessons in using knifes. She goes on to become the purple-haired; skirt wearing; ninja weapon wielding Hit-Girl, one of the more eye-opening characters from a film from recent years. Both men fight a system, a large governing body of people too corrupt to especially care for the results of their actions, the system failing to clean up the neighbourhood which Dave inhabits, as well as incorrectly sentencing MacReady to a stretch in prison. When we discover what it is Macready is fighting for, in an affecting scene, Vaughn constructs a particular character's epiphany in discovering the true extent to what happened as if inadvertently uncovering a serial killer's lair, complete with mandatory diary full of disdain and hatred, and the desired reaction is accomplished.The nature of Dave's existence pushes him to order a costume over the Internet so as to enable him to go out and test a thesis he himself concocted more broadly linked to that of why it is super-heroes do not exist. The anger, dishevelment and frustrations born out of the hand life has dealt young Dave sees him long to escape such a persona, or existence, and venture out into another one: one is toothless and somewhat of a target to those whom prey; the other, complete with costume, a mysterious, overly bold, anonymous and quite violent creation born out of his situation in life. We feel Dave is at rock bottom and when he's on the roof top of a five story building practising leaping from top-to-top, before urgently pulling out of the final jump, we do still feel that that's a suicide attempt which doesn't materialise more than a potential vigilante practising super-heroism. Eventually, his popularity with the public sees his fame sky-rocket; his first taste at super-heroism sees him fail overall but his actions get him closer to Katie, so he continues.Later on, their framework encompasses the realising of the importance of sticking to one's true identity; Dave coming to reject his online, super-hero, 'fake' persona as Katie herself realises the shallowness of her own attitudes in initially deducing Dave to be 'of an ilk', before coming round to seeing what sort of guy he is after naturally bonding with him. The argument that it is a character piece and not an adolescent display of gratuity continues when we recall the early, slow track of Dave-plus-friends and match that up beside and a later composition of Dave looking beaten; bloodied; grubbier and less than smart following the plodding through his dangerous misadventure.Vaughn's film is a delicate balance of coming of age with the tale of full on revenge against a system, but to say it goes about exploring its themes, ideas and stories in a delicate manner would be wholly misleading; the film a jaunty and engrossing enough action/comedy tackling notions of one's identity in a contemporary, digitally driven universe and encompassing a fair deal of characterisation in the process, resulting in a film not really as substantial nor as adventurous as either of Vaughn's previous two pieces, but regardless something with the ability to stand on its own. He keeps both strands moving along at equal pace, Cage's is more engrossing; the film paying sly hint to knowing so when it utilises the concoction of Hit-Girl to drive the film's final act on behalf of Cage's plight. Moral panics and general outrage aside, Kick-Ass is an engrossing and substantial enough film to get involved in.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

most bad-ass and funniest movie I've seen in awhile,"when i went to see kick-ass, i thought for sure that it was gonna be another one of those awful spoof movies.....what i watched was definitely no spoof, it was mind-blowing.the director of this film did a superb job of casting, i honestly don't think he could have done better.

A riotously hilarious blood-soaked film that lives up to its namesake from start to finish,"Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is bored at school, bored with life. He is not quite a loser, but he is by no means popular either. He enjoys reading comics, and decides one day it may be a good idea to become a superhero and fight crime himself. After a rather messy mishap, he is soon caught on camera helping someone getting beat up, and becomes an internet sensation. And then he starts to meet other people wearing masks.Much like the comic/graphic novel it is based on, Kick-Ass is exactly that. It is a riotously enjoyable time from start to finish. I had originally thought Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman would run into more than their share of problems trying to adapt one of the most ridiculously violent comics in recent memory. But the independent funding and creation of the film seems to have worked in their favour, because the film has a go-for-broke style unlike most mainstream films.While I imagined it would be worse, Kick-Ass is an incredibly brutal and often disgustingly violent picture. People are chopped up, crushed, beaten, or shot, and the film revels in how red the screen quickly becomes. It does nowhere near equal the same insane amount of blood shed in the comics, but it does more than a worthwhile job attempting to come close. Some of the unique and creative angles and designs for some of the deaths are simply awesome all on their own. I am not overly squeamish, but the film is not for the weak of heart. This is a very hard R-rated film, and one that surprised me by how much made it through the censors.Unlike Robert Rodriguez and Zack Snyder before him, Vaughn has crafted a film that loosely follows the Kick-Ass series, but takes its own turns. I re-read the comics before seeing the film just as a refresher, and I found myself riveted at just the right intervals, whether they were originally in the books or the film's own deviation. A lot of the material and moments in the film feel just right, and help amplify the plot in some areas, and simplify it in others. I particularly enjoyed that they kept with the zany, Quentin Tarantino-style profanity-laden dialogue, and kept all the references to other comics. It would have been easy for Vaughn and Goldman just to re-create the comics, but making it their own without much sacrifice makes it feel and come off almost as great as the trailers do.If there is anything I do hold against their changes, it is the fact that some of the mean-spiritedness of the original story is missing here. Some of the changes, specifically with the character of Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) and to a point, the origins of Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), lack the power and the message found in the original works by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. The book was a dark mess of humour, satire and gruesome violence. But it was deadly serious in many areas. The film on the other hand, when it is not falling into second act ill paced melodrama (not necessarily bad, but not well paced either), never once takes itself serious. It just wants to be fun, and it wants to entertain the audience. A good chunk of the film's ending feels like it belongs in a comic book more than the material in the books themselves. I can respect this, but the two integral pieces of the original story I mentioned, seem like they should have been recreated here. I am all for the majority of changes made, but that vast majority kept with the integrity and style of the original work. Taking stuff like those mentioned out, seems like a disservice to the audience.Acting wise, everyone does a terrific job in their roles. Cage, almost unrecognizable, delivers a subtle and bizarre performance as Big Daddy. I figured he would ham it up for the majority of the film, and while he does, he manages to come off as a heartfelt and interesting character. This is not the typical off-the-rails performance Cage is usually known and loved for, but his strange twist on the fairly one-dimensional character is reason enough to see the film. Mark Strong is great as mob boss and primary villain Frank D'Amico, and rather surprisingly, Christopher Mintz-Plasse brings a life and energy to Chris D'Amico/Red Mist that I never knew he had. Yes, there are times when he is channeling McLovin, but he makes Chris the character he needs to be.The relatively unknown Johnson is a marvel as both Dave and Kick-Ass. His juggling act of trying to make something of himself while fighting with teenage angst is something we can all identify with, and is what makes the character so endearing in the first place. To see him brought to life so well and so realistically is simply magnificent. We feel his pain at every turn, and we understand all too well what his problems are. He is the real approximation of what it would be like for any one of us to act like Batman, and Johnson never once stops being that character. But unfortunately, the film really belongs to Moretz. She alternates at random between cute and cuddly Mindy Macready and the violently vicious assassin Hit Girl like a seasoned professional. She steals the show every chance she gets, and for good reason. Her dialogue, her actions, everything about her is amazing, and a testament to how incredible this young actor is now, and will quickly become.If you can stand the violence, Kick-Ass is an incredibly enjoyable time at the movies. What it lacks in seriousness, it more than makes up for in fun and humour. It is unlike any comic book movie you have seen, and likely, ever will see.8.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

It was a good movie with a few good laughs and some cool action scenes, but it no way did it deserve to be in the top 250 movies of all time on this website or any other for that matter. It had a mediocre plot and an okay script, but there is just something about a 12 year old cussing people out that kind of bothers me? I understand it is a movie and sometimes her lines were funny, but it was just awkward. A few one liners kept the laughs chugging along little by little, but overall everyone who's actually seen it says the same thing that it was pretty good nothing special and I agree. Comedy is getting lost now because apparently the new hilarious moments occur when the f word just flies all over the place. Cool effects though at times stupid sequences. It was a fun movie but overall it didn't deliver everything I thought it would.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The best superhero film ever,"I thought this film was so original and highly amusing as well. Every one should check it out. The themes in the film, although very adolescent in nature, take on a very macabre meaning for adults and youngsters alike. The struggles with growing up, the drug-pedaling gangsters taking lives and the simple meaning of the word family all come together to remind how easy it is to feel like a nobody in today's society. This film should be the example that prospective filmmakers follow to ensure they produce good quality, well-written and acted pieces of brilliance. Cleverly bordering on juvenile and downright grotesque, Kick-Ass delivers a very poignant message to its audience: stand up for what you believe in – and although it doesn't contain any real superheroes, this is easily the best superhero film out there.Having my own personal history of playing with weapons, I can easily tell you that anyone with a penchant for martial arts (or ass-kicking) will immediately fall for this little beauty. That said, it's not solely aimed at the fighters amongst you. There's a child in it, for one. An ass-kicking child, but a child nonetheless; one that will probably shove a heap of wind up your rear pipe if you're one of those people that think children should be wrapped in cotton wool. Or that children shouldn't be commended for fighting or using weaponry. If you find yourself falling into one of these categories, please stay away from this production. And don't be fooled by the little purple-haired wonder either – she'll break you and the horse you rode in on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A mediocre movie with an identity crisis,"Kick Ass is nothing but a mediocre film.It is not an awful movie, neither it's outstanding. Let's see:(1) The plot: a guys sees how the city is ruled by bad people and thinks ""it would be awesome that someone stood up and fought them... an average joe that decided to face them"". Our main character does that role. Not outstanding, bot awful. Just mediocre.(2) Performances: all the main actors fit their roles, all of them deliver. Though they are not outstanding, neither awful. They are just mediocre.(3) Camera arrangements: they are not excellent, neither bad. Simply mediocre.So, we have a movie that is simply mediocre.Now, why does it have an identity crisis? - Because the movie has some fun moments, but they are not fun enough to make you roll over the floor laughing.Because the movie has some action scenes, but they are mild. I mean you see blood (let me talk about that later), but there is no climax. You see some bullets fly, some kills, but no intensity.Because the movie has some gory situations, but not enough to call it a gore movie. I mean, you see some blood splats, but nothing else. No intensity.Because it tries to be a teenager movie (they typical class loser that wants to get the nice girl and can't), but it does not have the plot elements. No tension created. Suddenly from one moment to the other, the guy snaps his finger and gets the girl.Because there are no decent criminals. I mean, criminals are laughable, but not laughable enough for a comedy. They are wannabe bad-guys, but they are too serious too be in a comedy and too silly to be in a crime movie.For all these reasons, you finish watching the movie and you ask yourself: is this supposed to be a comedy, an action movie or what? Like in any mediocre film, when you end seeing it, you feel that you spent 90 minutes watching a movie that was like ""meh.... okay. Ummmm... got to take out the garbage. Yeah."". You don't complain saying it was a waste of time, but you neither say ""hell yeah.... this was good movie"".So, in the end, Kickass is condemned to fall into oblivion.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Nice movie,"I thought that ""Kick Ass"" was going to be more of a comedy that would leave you laughing your ass off.The story is pretty good, and have lots of interesting characters in it. Both main characters and supporting ones have been given good detail in being fleshed out on the screen.Now what surprised me the most was seeing Nicholas Cage in that role. I am not much of a fan of him, truth be told, but this time he was actually cool to look at. Especially the scene where he is toughening up the girl for a gunshot experience. I was laughing so hard at that scene.As for the effects and stuff, well they were nice. Lots of cool things going on in the movie.Another great 'superhero' movie without super powers. Although ""Kick Ass"" is cool, it just doesn't reach ""Defendor"" to the knees. But I don't think ""Kick Ass"" will leave you disappointed though.Lots of nice action and a good, steady flow to the story, so you are never left bored. And the scenes with Hit Girl in action, wow! That was amazing, a young girl like that doing those kinds of scenes, that was awesome. Actually, I was surprised at the amount of action and blood in the movie.""Kick Ass"" have something for everyone, so you should check out this movie. If you like this one, you might want to turn your attention to ""Defendor"" as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Failed attempt to spoof the super-hero genre,"Can ordinary humans become a super hero? that is the theme question which Kick-Ass tries to answer. And for the first half our of the movie, I was positively surprised at the witty, intelligent and funny way in which Kick-Ass tries to answer this question. We witness an average teen try and fail and try again to test this hypothesis. As he gets smarter with every attempt, his luck changes and he actually achieves his desired super-hero status about half way through the movie.At that point we get introduced to Super Daddy and Hit Girl, and the movie goes down hill form there onwards. These two characters completely overturn the central question - they are ordinary humans, but they do posses superpowers. They fight better than professional hit men, dodge bullets and cannot be knocked down or break their bones. The movie transforms into your average super-hero movie and becomes a parody of itself. Add to this your two-dimensional villain and all the clichés have been restored. What a shame.To top it off, the movie is filled with unnecessary gore and bad language. Unlike in movies like Pulp Fiction or Sin City, it does not add anything to the plot of Kick-Ass. Quite the opposite, it makes the Hit Girl character even more unlikely and the fight between good and evil unrealistically obvious. It seems to me that the director could not decide what to make: an intelligent comedy, a parody or a popcorn action movie.Still, Kick-Ass is not the worst movie ever. It was entertaining for the most part and did retain a touch of comedy throughout the second half. Just be sure to have your friends over and some beer in the fridge if you decide to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-ass is ASS-some,"I just got out of the cinema and I am ... stunned, stupefied, blown away by this picture which came out of nowhere and rocks everything away of 2010 so far ( even the admired GhostWriter or ShutterIsland ).The most interesting about the film would be that it came to us and all I knew was the silly front picture with Kick-ass on it and ... yeah ... I thought ""What the Hell ???"". Two days later I was sitting in the cinema in one of the first screenings with zero expectations and hoped the film would do what one needs on a Friday evening: To entertain.All I can say: IT DID MORE THAN THATThe first 30 to 40 minutes are a funny introduction into the characters that don't take themselves to serious; mainly Dave Lizewski ( portrayed by a convincing Aaron Johnson ) who is ""just a regular guy"". Later we get to know the best Father-Daughter duo in a long time: Big Daddy ( an excellent Nicolas Cage ) and *tatatata* HIT-GIRL ( a brilliant newcomer: Chloe Moretz ). Antagonists are Marc Strong ( who started off with films like ""Body of Lies"" or ""Stardust"" ) with one of his best performances yet and a good Christopher Mintz-Plasse to complete the cast. During this introduction-time the cinematography and atmosphere simply is one of the best in a long time.After this, the film starts to roll on, the laughs ( every joke sits perfectly ! ) get a little less and the director shows that he's able to shoot action scenes better than in many action films ( I haven't seen such breath-taking action scenes since The Bourne Ultimatum ).The film is full of small allusions to many other films: like comic-adaptations ( of course Batman, Spider-man or Superman ), but also other big, big movies ( like Star Wars, Scarface or Taxi Driver ).If that weren't enough, one also has to talk about the soundtrack who simply kicks ass. A great variety of all different sorts of music ( Prodigy to Morricone to Classical Music ) picked to underline every single scene perfectly and really setting a mood for all the film.One thing that would still have to be said would be a warning for all the parents who want to take their 12-year-old comic-loving son to the film: forget it ! The R-rating is appropriate, VERY appropriate. But for everyone else, I recommend to see this cinematic surprise, take all your friends, family, etc.KICK-ASS IS ASS-SOME",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Super Short Review,"Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who one day decides to become a super-hero, even though he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.Shortest review I ever wrote: Lyndsy Fonseca was great as Katie Deauxma, and I would like to see more of her. Clark Duke is already overexposed (between this film and ""Hot Tub Time Machine""). Please stop casting him, he is not the next Jonah Hill.Chloe Moretz is the best young actress in the business today, and while I already knew that years ago, films like this one and ""Let Me In"" are proving it. If you need a young actress and Dakota Fanning is too old, go Chloe Moretz. I do not care what Roger Ebert says about the violence, this film is great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-Ass,"Kick-Ass had its Scottish Premiere as part of the Glasgow Magners Comedy Festival, with stars Aaron Johnson, from 'Nowhere Boy' and Christopher Mintz-Plasse or Mclovin from 'Superbad' as he will eternally be known in attendance for a question and answer session along with the Scottish writer of the comic Mark Millar.Kick-Ass is the third outing for Matthew Vaughn as director, after making the gangster movie Guy Ritchie wishes he had made with 'Layer Cake' and then the fantasy star studded epic 'Stardust'. It seems Vaughn has made the transition from producer to director seamlessly. But getting his third movie off the ground was hard work.Hollywood loves all things comic book just now, but 'Kick-Ass' was not following the trend, they deemed that it wasn't a kids movie and it wasn't quite an adult movie. With a UK rating of 15 it falls in between and unless you are a true fan-boy, it might not be the kind of thing to appeal to most people. So the studios held back on backing it, but undeterred, Vaughn used his producer skills to raise the $35 million budget independently and in doing so it gave him the freedom to make the movie he wanted. And what a movie he has made, any predetermined conceptions of what this would be like are not just shattered they are blown away.Now with his third movie in the can, it should also prove to be his most successful and the gamble has paid off with talk from Millar of a sequel even before this goes out on general release. This confidence from Millar also shines throughout the movie from Vaughn's directing to some sublime performances that make you not just like this movie, but love it.Kick-Ass is a comic-book movie unlike any you will have seen; it is violent, funny and shocking at times but above all it is utterly entertaining! Based on the comic book of the same name by Mark Millar, the story revolves around an American high-school geek and comic fan Dave Lizewski (played by Johnson with a fantastic American accent) who dresses up as a superhero to fight crime and in doing so becomes an internet sensation. But it seems he is not the only vigilante out there, he soon finds out that father and daughter duo Big Daddy (played by Nicolas Cage, doing a fine Adam West impression) and Hit-Girl (13-year-old Chloe Moretz) are also doing their bit to fight crime.This pair steal the show from their brutal yet hilarious scene involving Cage teaching his daughter Mindy how to take a bullet while wearing her bulletproof vest. To a rather controversial scene that involves Hit-Girl's use of the 'C' word while wiping out a den of drug-dealers.This shows the freedom Vaughn had in making the movie, after he managed to secure funding. In turn freeing this movie from the restraints of a big studio and it really pays off. Vaughn has assembled an eclectic cast that reads like a who's who from his previous outings, with stars such as Mark Strong in fine form. But from all the performances the film will be remembered for Chloe Moretz's first major role. Her performance goes from cutesy Daddy's girl to foul mouthed superhero and she more than holds her own with such an ensemble cast, she steals every scene she is in.'Kick Ass' breaks the mould in superhero movies.It may be controversial but it is ultimately extremely funny. He may have incurred the wrath from such bastions of good taste as the Daily Mail, but Vaughn deserves plaudits for staying true to the comic book and giving us a superhero with a potty mouth.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

You want an original superhero film- you got one here.,Kick Ass came out of nowhere and stunned the critics as well as the public alike. It is probably as anti-superhero as one can get and it is visceral- which is something you do not see in risk averse big budget superhero films. Nicholas Cage is a worthy guru to Aaron Taylor and his sidekick- the ass kicking Chloe Moretz. Do not go in with any expectation and you will be pleasantly surprised. A special mention to the cinematography and fights department who really shine through. 7/10 (You want an original superhero film- you got one here).,,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Bad-ass or Good-ass,"It's been a while since I watched ""Kick-Ass"", Matthew Vaughn's 2010 adaptation of Mark Millars' graphic (in every sense) novel. I still enjoyed it, despite a few elements that don't sit quite as easy with me as they did a few years ago.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), frustrated by the injustices of daily life and inspired by comic books decides to don a costume and step out into night as 'Kick-Ass' and try and help people. Initially it has disastrous consequences, but eventually he saves a man from a beat down and achieves some celebrity. He learns of the existence of Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace-Moretz) - a father and daughter team trying to dismantle the operations of mob boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). D'Amico believes that 'Kick-Ass' is behind the attacks, so begins to target him.So, there are some who objected to the levels of violence or profanity, particularly when provided by, or administered to, a pre-teen girl. Personally, I was alright with that. I do think that pretending to be gay to gaslight a girl you like is pretty horrendous, and particularly uncool is the fact that it actually works. It does all feel rather childish, I have to admit though. With lots of CGI blood and violence, like a step along the way towards what we'd see in the ""Kingsman"" films. There's also returns for several of Vaughn's earlier acting troupe, with Tamer Hassan, Dexter Fletcher and Jason Flemyng from ""Layer Cake"" reappearing.It's the new cast though that are particularly memorable, with the film being breakthrough roles for Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloe Grace Moretz and an early appearance for Evan Peters. Nicolas Cage though is fulfilling all of his Batman fantasies, talking like Adam West in a black full length 'Dadsuit'.Despite not enjoying it as much as I did a decade or so ago, I did still enjoy ""Kick-Ass"" and I'm interested to learn about whatever these mystery sequels end up being, later this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Excellent,"Lot of negative reviews here, but most of them seethe that an 11 year old girl shouldn't be swearing (Remember when we were 11? Oh, we sure as hell swore, when we got away from our parents, didn't we?) Excellent mixture of action, drama, and a little teen drama.All in all, one of my favorite movies of 2010. Met a lot of people who hate this movie....but if you're a fan of unique films like Zombieland....you're going to love this one.If French love stories, with a lot of cuddling and emotion is more your thing......you probably won't like Kick Ass.It's simply a bad ass movie, that redefines the super hero Genre. Chloe Moretz is amazing, Nick Cage does a very good job, and while it's a bit cliché and trite...it's cliché and trite in a way nobody has dared to do before.It really raises the bar. It really sets a new standard....and I've watched this movie over and over. It's simply....really damn good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

An Amazing Balancing Act,"Kick-Ass (1:58, R) — Fantasy: Comics & Pulps, 2nd string, crossoverThe producers of Kick-Ass have a particular audience in mind — genus Fanboius, species komicbukii — and since I am a prime specimen of their intended target, I am pleased to say that they got me dead center with both barrels ... and also several knives, a stun gun, a few grenades, several well placed fists to the head and kicks to the groin, and a bazooka.This flick is a total trip from beginning to end. It gets the comic-book feel just right, doesn't wuss out by pulling any punches in the brutality department, is extremely well paced, keeps you guessing as to where it's going (a plus in my book), and features snappy, realistic dialog. Plus which, it's got more than its fair share of laff-out-loud moments.We open with a voice-over from average high-schooler Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), musing ""I always wondered why nobody ever did it before me."" as we see a cloaked figure spread his costume wings and plummet from the top of a tall building as the citizens below gape up in awe. Up to that point, Dave has been one of the faceless masses, lamenting ""My only superpower was being invisible to girls."".That's about to change, tho, as he decides he doesn't need superpowers to don a costume (a customized scuba wetsuit) and fight crime with only his bare hands, a brace of martial-arts batons, a taser, and ""a perfect combination of optimism and naiveté"". His 1st encounter in the heroic persona of Kick-Ass does not turn out well, however. But after they get done patching him back together, he's got lots of metal parts and enuf nerve damage to render him largely indifferent to pain. Thus his next big fight, defending a mugging victim against 3 thugs, works out somewhat better, tho he still takes a beating. But this time it's been captured on multiple cell-phone cameras and soon becomes an internet sensation.As it turns out, somebody else DID hit on this idea before Dave did, somebody who does a much better Batman imitation while leaving virtually no traces of who he is. That would be ex-con (and framed ex-cop) Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage, even quirkier than usual but highly effective as such), who goes by the nom de guerre Big Daddy. Oh, yeah, and then there's Big Daddy's little girl (literally a girl, about age 11) Mindy (Chloe Moretz), AKA Hit- Girl, who's quicker than a cobra, nimbler than an Olympic gymnast, less remorseful than a pit bull, and cuter than a litter of cocker spaniel puppies when she wants to be.Crime lord Frank D'Amico (the scarily effective Mark Strong) knows that somebody's been knocking over his drug deals and taking out his goons, but he doesn't believe the screaming pleas of his soon-to-be-ex henchmen that it was some kind of costumed vigilante. At least, he doesn't give it much credence until he sees the video of Kick-Ass, after which he figures he's identified his nemesis and orders his entire mob to track down and kill the costumed idiot.He's wrong, of course, it's been BD and HG (to quote their belt buckles) all along. However bold his attitude, Dave is still physically ineffectual (tho his love life is perking up a bit), but now he's a target. BD and HG effortlessly track him down, warn him how easy it was and what he's up against, and offer help if he really needs it.Shortly thereafter, another offer of assistance comes from a new costumed crime-fighter, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, trying hard to overcome the McLovin stereotype), but there's something a little hinky going on here.This movie is rated R and deserves it. It has no campy bam-biff-pow scenes, but there are blood, cruelty, and corpses galore. The crooks are played as total hard-asses. And yet there are funny scenes that don't cut the mood. Really, this is an amazing balancing act, but nobody ever steps off that thin little wire.It's clearly not a movie for everyone, but I thot it rocked, and what you get is my highly personal but totally honest opinion: dandy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
In a Nutshell: Kick Ass,"Kick Ass...Entertaining but a little less than its name!Once you see the trailer of this movie you know you're in for something special and a lot more than ordinary. Kick Ass is anything but ordinary. But beware, this is actually tailored to a certain chunk of the audience and for them it will really kick ass. For others it may be just OK and for many, trust me, it will be ridiculous.Kick Ass is about Dave, a high school nerd, unsurprisingly a fan of comic books, who decides to become a superhero since no one has done it before in the real world. As the story of him becoming a vigilante goes on, he meets other real world superheroes and gets involved in a quest of brining down a drug lord and his gang.As much as I enjoyed it, I have to say the ratings, which are through the roof, sort of ruined what could have been a more pleasant experience for me. It made my expectations go so high, I spent the whole movie on waiting mode, holding my breath for something magical to happen so that I can meet those expectations. America has always overrated whatever fell in what I call the rule of four: vampires, aliens, dinosaurs and blood (you thought I was gonna say superheroes, didn't you?). Kick Ass falls in the last category, with bad guys brutally murdered, burned, sliced and in one part grinded and that, for many, could be the main reason they'd watch a movie and actually laugh.Actors of Kick Ass are actually a great fit despite their diversity, mainly of age, which I believe is one of the reasons for the movie's great reception. The humour is also enjoyable for the most part. And what's special about it is that it actually has a story to follow which is usually a rare factor in similar films. But on a moral level, I'm just not sure that a 10 year old girl shooting and savagely killing big guys is a great idea. It is to some extent fun to watch, but may not be for everyone.In a nutshell, it is not one of the best movies ever, like listed on some websites but it is definitely funny and entertaining. It is rated R, so no kids (talk about irony). But if you are in the mood for some kids running around chasing bad guys, I say grab the pop corn and play this one on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of the best films I've seen in years,"Wasn't sure what to expect going into this one as I'm not a huge fan of superhero films and the adverts didn't give much away, but I was amazed at how good it was. Great soundtrack, really good acting and original storyline - somehow managed to be funny, dramatic and action-packed all in one without compromising any of them.Hit-girl definitely stole the show for me - something very amusing about a sweet and innocent looking little girl decapitating people and using profanity. Nicholas Cage was also very good in my opinion, as was Red Mist.Well worth a watch on the big screen for almost any film fan - just be warned that it's not as child-friendly as the trailers may appear. There are at least a couple of pretty gritty scenes which I would be uncomfortable really with any child seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Powerless superhero.,"Kick-Ass is an irreverent, tremendously violent, and hilarious satire on the quasi-porn world of comic books. Adapted from Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.'s comic book series. A wonderful mash-up of Kill Bill, Spider-Man, and Ghostbusters that results in something fantastically anarchic and irresponsible.Kick-Ass might address the ethics of bystanders ""provoking"" criminals. Vaughn and Goldman are masters of impropriety and pure provocation. An full episode, if not a series, of Radio 4's Moral Maze may have to be devoted to Kick-Ass.Kick-Ass is about a high school student who aspires to be a superhero. Aaron Johnson, who played a young John Lennon in Nowhere Boy, stars in the film. Other characters in the film include 11-year-old Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and her father, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). Kick-Ass, like Galaxy Quest, fantasizes about a meeting of want to be superheroes and actual people.

Bad First Instalment Film,I sort of understand a bit what the crew were thinking and trying to do when they were creating this first instalment film but it did not exactly fully work.

The cast selection was bad and and weak and could have been a whole lot better and stronger. They did not exactly fully commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters.

I'm not sure but Kick-Ass would, erm, kick its ass. Finally Nicholas Cage is back to form and his hammery is totally intentional and well-placed here. Finally Christopher Mintz-Plasse' eternal portrayal of McLovin' finds a role it's as well-suited for as, well, McLovin's. And Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl not only steals the show but sells it back to its producers then comes back in the middle of the night and steals it again, then she comes down your chimney and leaves it on the cookie plate covered in peanut M&Ms, bacon, and the creamy white stuff that fills Twinkies. If Mathilda and Gogo Yubari somehow produced an offspring, Hit Girl would, ahem, kick its ass.The movie is well-paced with ongoing comic relief, which is much welcomed between (and during) the numerous action sequences. Amazingly, each action set piece completely and utterly outdoes the previous one, whipping the viewer into an emulsion of frenzied froth until the climax, whence the weak of prostate may actually do so.This may just be the best movie I've ever seen (so good that I am going to watch it again right after I get done typing this), and I've seen better movies than you have, so it's probably the best movie you'll ever see.

"KICK-ASS (Matthew Vaughn, 2010) ***1/2","If not for the high recommendation from a Maltese film-buff friend of mine a couple of days ago, I would probably have skipped an immediate viewing of this unheralded gem of a comic-strip spoof at the local cinema and waited for it to become available as a DVD rental; for the record, that same guy had loathed Zach Snyder's epic superhero movie WATCHMEN (2009) which I had really dug myself only recently...so, even if I decided to follow his advice, I had my reservations on just how right he could be!Needless to say, judging by my uncharacteristically high rating for a contemporary genre film, my final verdict on KICK-ASS was in complete agreement with the latter's – who, incidentally, had also opined that ""Quentin Tarantino would turn green with envy when he watches this""! Again, his comments were absolutely spot-on because here we also have a movie that is at once informed by – as well as being an analysis of – pop culture: naturally, in this case, the superhero/comic-strip phenomenon. But while in Tarantino's movies such wordy diatribes come off as vain show-offs by its fanboy writer-director by having them incongruously uttered by professional hit men or attractive chicks, in KICK-ASS they sound perfectly natural because it is nerdy schoolboys who deliver this kind of dialogue! Another Tarantinoesque trademark lifted wholesale (and utilized well) is the presence of an eclectic soundtrack, since throughout this movie we are treated to samples from Ennio Morricone's ""For A Few Dollars More"", ""The Banana Splits"" (one of my favorite TV shows from my long-gone childhood days!) and even the music playing over the opening credits of the ""Masters Of Horror"" TV-series.Anyway, the men behind this brilliantly disarming piece of entertainment were also fairly unknown to me: original source writer Mark Millar had already been the creator of WANTED (2008) and director Matthew Vaughn had made the British crime thriller LAYER CAKE (2004; starring a pre-James Bond Daniel Craig) and STARDUST (2007; with Robert De Niro, Peter O'Toole, etc.); for what it is worth, I intend to track them all down in the coming days. Equally unknown and impressive was the young cast: Aaron Johnson (a Keith Gordon lookalike) is Kick-ass, 12-year old Chloe Moretz (soon to be seen in Matt Reeves' Hollywood remake of 2008's Swedish horror revelation LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) practically steals the show as the foul-mouthed, ass-kicking ""Hit-Girl""; Lyndsy Fonseca is the lovely object of desire quietly lusted after by Kick-ass' geeky everyday alter-ego (and whom he only manages to hook up with by falsely ""coming out""!), Mark Strong (as the town's leading mobster Frank D'Amico) and Chistopher Mintz-Plasse (as his overprotected kid who ingeniously lures Kick-ass into a deadly trap by dressing up as rival superhero ""Red Mist""). The film also manages to accomplish a near-superhuman feat all of its own when it made me like Nicolas Cage as ""Big Daddy"" – Moretz' father and the one bona-fide article in the superhero stakes; Cage, an avowed comic-strip fan in real-life, had already appeared in the ludicrous GHOST RIDER (2007) next to Eva Mendeswith whom he has just appeared again in Werner Herzog's 2009 remake of THE BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL – NEW ORLEANS which, it goes without saying, I want to check out despite its dubious intent!While the single biggest laugh-out-loud moment in KICK-ASS for me comes at the very start of the film (with the ill-fated flight of another false 'superhero') and the sequel-inviting ending seemed somewhat misjudged – I would much rather have had the kid commit hara-kiri when he found the samurai sword, leaving the film to be a veritable one-off oddity – it is the sheerly audacious political incorrectness (having the young Moretz spitting four-letter words and hack limbs left, right and center, not to mention being punched in the face and thrown around rooms herself!) that arguably makes KICK-ASS the coolest and most enjoyable superhero movie ever made! Hell, if this attitude catches on, now might make it the right time for me (and my twin brother) to unleash our own decade-old 'objectionable' script onto a more open-minded world...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Shut Up. Kick-Ass.,"I have not read the comic book series Kick-Ass that was written by Mark Millar and illustrated by John Romita Jr, but the idea of someone wanting to be a superhero in the real world despite not having real powers sounded promising, along with making fun of itself comparing stuff that happens in the real life against what happens in a comic book. The movie Kick-Ass (2010) was a fun and funny comic book movie that both people who have and have not read the comic book will like.Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson was good; I liked how he questioned about why there were no real superheroes in real life, then turning himself into Kick-Ass for no reason while also not having any powers. Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl played by Chloe Grace Moretz was great to watch; she was uniquely skilled in fighting, and she was awesome to watch in action sequences to fight alongside Kick-Ass. Even though she fights alongside Kick-Ass, who she fights alongside with the most is her dad Damon Macready/Big Daddy played by Nicolas Cage, who was great in the movie and the way he acts and looks makes me think of Batman.The main antagonist Frank D'Amico played by Mark Strong was good, being both intimidating and funny; other than Frank D'Amico as the antagonist, there is also his son Chris D'Amico/Red Mist who is used to draw out Kick-Ass for his father while also acting self-absorbed when acting like a superhero. The movie was funny, and it was mostly because of the characters and the situations they got themselves into, along with there being good emotional moments. Some of the comedy does not fully work, but most of it does work involving them making fun of comic books and comparing them to the real world.The action sequences are fun to watch with Kick-Ass having some good fights, but most of the action scenes are from Hit-Girl who was awesome to watch taking people out. Hit-Girl in these action sequences was fun, brutal, and funny but it is cool seeing her using her skilled abilities, but there is also cool action involving Big Daddy taking out people which was also well done. Kick-Ass (2010) was a fun and funny comic book movie that people who read the comic book series would like, if you have not, you will still like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Much Better Than What I Thought it Would Be,"At first, when I saw the previews for Kick Ass, it didn't really look all that interesting...until I saw why it received an R rating. This movie was SO much better than what I thought it would be. The important thing to keep in mind is, don't take it TOO seriously and don't take it TOO personally. People complain about 11 year old Hit Girl having a filthy mouth, a high body count, and bloody murderous fight scenes...but seriously people, GET OVER IT. You see what it's rated R for so it goes without saying that Kick Ass is not for everyone...particularly those that get sick at the sight of blood. If you think a movie is going to be offensive to you...don't watch it...and therefore you won't have to bitch about it later.Kick Ass is bloody good fun, stylish, fast paced and not for the feint of heart. If you're not easily offended (or have a stick wedged up your ass) you're in for a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Only some scenes ""kicked ass""","The whole concept of the film was pretty interesting, but the writing for it was not that good. The story was pretty uneventful or in lament terms; stupid. Plus the fact they set the movie up to be non stop fighting and there really wasn't that much. So all you could ask for was the action to make up for it. Some of it did, but not really. Here is why I liked the movie though. I love the cast, a few scenes really did ""kick ass"" and the story did have potential even though it was not done right. I guess I couldn't help but like the film even though there were so many things wrong. The best cast member was Chloe Moretz. Her acting and fighting was so great, they could make a movie just about her. Aaron Johnson was decent as the main character. He is mostly a nerd who really couldn't fight. Then you have the villain who is Christopher Mintz-Plasse. He was pretty funny. Now Nicolas Cage was just OK and there is one scene that was so stupid I wanted to punch Cage in the face and say, ""why did you agree to this?"" So overall this is an interesting movie. I am sure they will make more and I think it has potential to do better. Just have to wait and see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Chloe shines,"Chloe Grace Moretz is Hit Girl, an eleven year old girl trained by her father, Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage) in the use of various weapons. She befriends a nerd named Dave who calls himself Kick Ass, after reading too many comic books. He makes a silly looking costume and becomes a ""superhero,"" and in his first encounter he is stabbed and run over by a car. He gets into a fight with Rasul, a drug dealer, and as he is being beaten, Hit Girl and her father come to the rescue and kill the criminal.The crime fighting duo, with the help of Big Daddy, an ex police officer who was framed as a drug dealer and therefore has a vendetta against his perpetrators. The plot is fairly complicated for a comic book inspired action film and although a kid leads the cast, the violence is too strong for young viewers. Moretz is someone to watch for, as she proved later in Let Me In, the American remake of the Swedish vampire movie, Let the Right One in. She and Cage make Kick Ass worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Great self-aware superhero movie for superhero fans,"If you see every superhero movie, if you appreciate Superman more than the average bear, if you get the sense that you have a little too much faith in superheroes, this might just be the movie for you. However, it'd probably be best if you like a film like ""Pulp Fiction"" and/or the ""Kill Bills"" too because there is lots of violence and lots of filthy language in this one. Confused yet?This film is about some regular-that is to say anonymous-high schoolers, who are frustrated in understanding girls, they like comic books, they mercilessly insult one another-but in a friendly way. Well, one of these boys, Dave (Aaron Johnson-likable in a shaggy-dog way and well-chosen for the part), in the midst of one the endless neurotic, intense conversations that teenagers have about the course of their lives, about members of the opposite sex, about things they like, concludes that there's no reason why a superhero shouldn't try and save the world. So he sets out to be that superhero, making his own hilariously tacky superhero costume and finding himself in over his head when he realizes that knives will still injure him. It's inspiring the degree to which he believes one person can make a difference and quite funny but as audience members, we obviously know that he doesn't really have any superpowers and that if his attempt to disarm the bad guys fail, that he will be seriously injured. Dave's sweet naiveté is the very trait however, which buys him the good-will that ensures we will root for and follow his adventures throughout the film.Like Tarantino, this film combines some rather mundane characters and some rather outrageous escapades. However, because the characters' reactions are so sensible and identifiable, we don't squirm or root against them. The things that they do and say seem like sensible responses to events which occur in their life. It is precisely the earthiness of the characters that keeps the plot from seeming exploitative or outrageous.As the movie continues, Dave knows that his superhero powers are limited but it doesn't diminish his desire to do some good. However, he is more realistic about the challenges he can surmount and after he lowers his expectations, he is able to do some good. In doing some good, he crosses paths with another young, would-be superhero, Hit-Girl (played with ruthless cuteness by the talented young actress Chloe Moretz, who I'm sure we will be hearing more of) who gallivants around town, attempting to right wrong although it turns out, her actions are not motivated simply by a desire to impose moral order in the world. Her father is Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage playing with abandon and panache and reminding us once again just how talented he can be when he decides not to cash in for an easy check) and he's the most immoral father you have ever seen on screen, I'd venture to guess. Also excellent in the film are Frank D'Amico as ruthless mob boss Mark Strong and his needy son Chris D'Amico (played with a wonderful playfulness by Chris Mintz-Plasse of ""McLovin"" fame). The supporting roles are also filled quite adequately by a variety of lesser lights.The tone of this film might be the most impressive thing over which director Matthew Arnold has control. On the one hand, the violence is so graphic that if one were to allow it without leavening it with fairly mundane characters, the film would be rather sensationalist. On the other hand, if he allowed his characters to talk and be neurotic too much, it would be just another neurotic fanboy film about teenagers much too obsessed with superheroes. As it is, the director has struck a nice balance, playing the naiveté of teenagers off the wild, anarchic results of some sensible decisions. The movie feels like a Tarantino film-intelligent people who like to discuss things combined with some graphic violence. Like Tarantino's flics, the choice of music is crucial and helpful in establishing the direction of the film also.The screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Arnold, and the (presumably) excellent comic book by John Romita Jr. and Mark Millar are, as said, very good. It would have been very easy to go wrong with the tone, and that Arnold captures regular people who recognize their limitations but who strive on all the same, often to hilarious and clever results, is a tribute to Arnold's management of the tone and direction of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Besides, I want to ask the film's writers and directors that what were they thinking when they were making an 11 year old child do all those gruesome acts in spite of realizing the fact that the movie would be rated R and children would not be able to see it.3) Sound: Actually the sound effects of this film were the only high point of this film and this was the fact why I tolerated this film.4) Violence: I am dead against such acts of violence committed by a child of 11 years of age.I even shudder at the mere fact that what these violent scenes must had an impact on the simple mind of an 11 year old and what bad effect these abuses might have in a later life.I fail to fathom the plight of this child.P.S. :- I was taken away by all the high Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb ratings and decided to see this movie.

Strong performance,"Over the last couple of years I've started to notice the rise of a great actor, Mark Strong. Sherlock Holmes, Body of Lies and RocknRolla - all 3 are worth checking out. And now we have the real stardom with his, pun-intended, strong performance in kick-ass. I just read one review noting the brilliance of the movie because of how it combines ""hilarious comedy with incredibly graphic, stylized violence"" (quote from pgtmatrix's review). Well it could not have been done without Mark Strong.On a side note, only Nicholas Cage can be the Jean Reno to Natalie Portman in a comic book style comedy. It was just enough character from him to prevent the movie from being over the top or just straight up goofy. He connected well with the style of humor in the movie although I can understand why someone would dislike Nicholas Cage in general.Usually critics rip apart ultra violent movies or rated R comedies. Nowadays trash talking and bloodshed is just not accepted by critics. It takes this type of movie to shut everyone up. Some critics need to face the fact that they just don't like movies with added profanity and unrealistic killing sprees. If you don't like it better off sticking to PG movies or those deep Tom Hanks movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Good Shallow Fun,"This movie turned out better then I thought it would, and really is better then advertised. The start of the film (about the first 30 minutes or so) was as bad as I was expecting. I found myself wishing for a fast-forward button but still managed to care where the story was going. Then, the plot became interesting as the ""Hit Girl"" and ""Big Daddy"" character arcs came in to play. The story still finishes in a shallow and unbelievable way but I have to admit that I was entertained. The kid committing violence controversy didn't affect me one way or the other. Being a comic book fan helps... seeing John Romita Jr's art on the silver screen during the ""Big Daddy"" origin sequence definitely made me smile. I love his work.

Kick-Ass in one word: Brilliant,"I went into the cinema with a very pessimistic attitude towards this film. Having been a fan of the comic for a good hour (I read the comic just before I went to watch it), I had a lot of doubts about the cast choices and the plot variations that the film makers would have had to make. nguage or you lack a sense of humour Boy was I wrong. Kick-Ass is one hundred per-cent cinematic gold, and I class myself as having very good taste in film. You will only be disappointed by this film if you do not like violence, bad language or you lack a sense of humour. I will not give away too much of the film but all of the actors are great, and I mean all of them. The script is fresh, funny and engaging. The action is impeccable.

Crazy,"Good fun. The ironic tropes are maybe a little overplayed, the convenience of the plot movements can be a bit cringey, and I always find there to be little emotional weight in the characters, but it is just damn good fun. A lot can be forgiven of a story that just enjoys itself - it's crazy, it's garish, it's full of holes, but it just drives on without leaving you too much time to pull it apart, and by the end you've had a good time.

Little more Realistic!!,"It was very interesting to see the more ""realistic"" superhero film.

The creativity in showing the more expensive side of heroship, along with the preferred martial art isn't something we see alot of in most hero films; and would be a fun addition here on out.

"Without meaning to sound Clichéd, this film Kicked-Ass.","Kick-Ass is by far not a normal superhero movie. First of all, there are no 'super'-heroes they are just normal people. All with motives and personal vendettas that are all perfectly explained through character development. Which is surprising when many characters are introduced as random points.The Plot of Kick-Ass is fairly simple. Aaron Johnson plays David Lewizski, a typical teenager even described by himself as: ""just existing."" (As a small note, he is the perfect protagonist for the target audience of this film.) He spends the majority of his time reading comic books and fanatically talking about trivial activities and fantasising about his female teachers. Being such a comic fanatic, David ponders why no one has ever tried being a super-hero. His friends quickly respond by insisting that they would get their ass kicked. (A nice in Joke to the title.) Un-deterred, David pursues his dream and buys his own costume and weapons. And dubs himself under the pseudonym ""Kick Ass."" This provides the premise for the rest of the film which involves small time crooks and larger mafia style gang warfare. The result is something like Spiderman 2 combined with Pulp Fiction. And by the way, the film totally 'Kicks-Ass'.The film has a gritty reality that is always present and constant during the course of the film. For example, during his first fight Kick Ass is stabbed and ran over. Rather than glamorising the life of a superhero it does quite the opposite by showing the harsh reality, pain and suffering. This is rather gruesomely shown in a scene in which Kick Ass and fellow superhero Bid Daddy are tortured by mobsters.Although this is a radical step away from normal convention in superhero movies, and the juxtaposition of superhero and normal person is brilliantly portrayed, this is unfortunately a weak spot in the movie for me. The gritty reality and message is thrown upon the audience without knowing.Think of it this way, the title ""Kick-Ass"" suggests a comic superhero movie that will predominately tongue in cheek. However, this film completely surprises you and offers no comedy but instead a torture scene comparable to perhaps reservoir dogs. It is like some kind of sick joke. The reaction of the people I saw this with were similar. How did this film become so dark humoured and taboo? Without saying too much, it is fair to say that there will almost certainly be a sequel to ""Kick-Ass"". The title? Perhaps ""Kick some more ass"". I don't know.Whilst I recommend you watch this film, I seriously recommend you expect the unexpected. Some things may come as a surprise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Weird but Effective,"Kick-Ass (2010)*** (out of 4)Dave (Aaron Johnson) is a loser in high school that does nothing but read comics, hang out with his loser friends and that's pretty much it as he couldn't get a girl to look at him even if he had money. One day he gets the bright idea to become a superhero but of course he doesn't have any special powers but his alter ego Kick-Ass hits the streets where he going to get beat to a pulp but soon a father (Nicolas Cage) and his daughter (Chloe Moretz) show up to lend a hand in bringing down a gangster. If you take this movie very serious then you're probably going to end up hating it like Roger Ebert did. I really can't blame anyone for not wanting to watch an 11-year-old girl kill multiple people and getting beaten to a pulp. Seeing kids killing or being abused isn't very entertaining but there's just something so weird, surreal and rather original about this movie that it works somehow. I personally can't think of another movie like this one and that's something hard to find and that reason alone makes this a must-see as long as you can put up with the subject matter. I think what makes the film work so well is that it really does take place in a real world where our ""heroes"" wear the funny costumes but they don't contain any super human strength or special powers. As much as one can enjoy comic book movies it's always common sense that you're watching something fake. That fakeness is pretty much taken away here and we're left with a rather realistic movie that manages to work because of how natural it is. I loved the scenes early on when Kick-Ass first goes out to clean up the streets only to get his head bashed in and nearly lose his life because he's simply not tough. It gets even better when the kids soon begins to build his strength as he finally gets the girl of his dreams only because there's a rumor going around school that he's gay and she wants a gay best friend. Even funnier is a few earlier scenes where Dave, soon to be Kick-Ass, talks about his pathetic life, which is nothing more than comics and looking at porn. All of these scenes come off very realistic and I thought the movie did a great job at making sure the characters here were humans first of all. It's the human aspect of their actions that makes the story work and without this you'd be left with something not nearly as impressive. I really enjoyed Johnson in the lead role and thought he made a very believable dork as well as a believable action hero. Moretz and her dirty mouth clearly steal the film as she also gets the best costume of all our heroes. Cage doesn't go as over-the-top as you'd expect but it's fun seeing an actor of his type in this kind of movie. I'm sure a long article could be written about an 11-year-old girl who kills without feelings and one whose father taught her to kill but I think that would be missing the point of the film. This wasn't meant to be any psychological drama about kids and violence so if you're unwilling to laugh then it's probably best that you skip this film. For me, the images were rather dark but at the same time they were rather playful, real and most importantly they were funny.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"OK, but didn't wow me like it did 590K people","Superheroes with powers is an original idea, but the movie didn't overly impress me. A 7.6/10 with 590 thousand reviews is abnormally high, and I just didn't get it. There was no over the top visuals or effects, a simple plot, not a lot of drama, the stereotypical simple but nothing memorable movie. Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy felt like a batman Mr. Miyagi to Taylor-Johnson's Kick-Ass. Mark Strong is once again a bad guy in a superhero movie, and it played it solidly but wasn't convincing enough to scare me like in other roles.

Great Story,"The first time I saw this ""Kick Ass,"" I really enjoyed it and would have rated it around 4 stars. I was younger, hadn't been to film school and some of its lesser qualities were lost on me.Now, while I still appreciate a lot of this film's better qualities, the bad acting especially bothers me. Chloe Grace Moretz (""Suspiria"" (2018)) is a fine actress but her portrayal of Hit Girl is so over the top that even in an over the top film. It has me cringing almost constantly. I know that will rub some of the fans of this movie the wrong way because Hit Girl is a very popular part of why people love ""Kick Ass"" What can I say? That's just how I feel about it.She is not the only offender here either. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance leaves a lot to be desired. He's great as Kick Ass but as Dave, he's boring and uninspired. I suppose that could be intentional but I suspect not. The scenes between him and high school love interest who thinks he's gay but falls for him anyway, Lyndsy Fonseca (""Hot Tub Time Machine""), are just one bad actor grabbing desperately for something authentic from another bad actor trying to recite their lines at the same time as they try to portray emotion. Y'know. They try acting.Luckily, the day is saved by Nic Cage (""Mandy"") and to a lesser extent Christopher Mintz-Plasse (""Superbad""), both of them turning in a couple of my favorite of their performances ever.Nicolas Cage plays Big Daddy, a former cop seeking revenge for his wife's murder by the mob. He has an impressive arsenal at his disposal and has schooled his young daughter Mindy to become Hit Girl, a sort of Robin to his Batman. Literally, Cage runs around in a Batman costume cutting down baddies with shotguns, pistols, and grenades like he's the grim reaper swinging his scythe.Yeah. Don't let the comic book veneer fool you. This is a hard R for violence. It is, however, meant to be played for humor most of the time as evidenced by the inspired Nic Cage crazy acting choice to do an Adam West Impression(Batman from the 60s TV series) whenever he is in costume.Therein lies my nitpick issue with the film, though. While on the one hand the high concept pitch is amazing and grounded: high school kid with no powers tries to be a superhero but doesn't have super powers; on the other hand it is in no way a grounded film, He literally flies a jet pack with mini-guns on it at one point and hit-girl is quite literally doing Wuxia martial arts moves complete with wire work.Which is it? Should we be laughing or empathizing? When Kick Ass first tries to fight crime he almost gets murdered when one of the thugs simply stabs him and they all beat the snot out of him, breaking his bones to pieces and sending him into rehab after an ambulance trip. Yet, it doesn't seem like we are really supposed to feel at all bad about all the other violence in the film or emotional disturbance and apparent mental illness in the film. I suppose that mix is what makes it fun but it also rubs me wrong a little bit so I think the balance is just slightly off for me. Like I said, a nitpick.The story really is the star here. Even almost 10 years later, this film still seems to have twists, turns, humor, and tender moments which play off common superhero tropes. I'm not sure how much of that is due to the movie's staying power or how much is because superhero films have evolved so little in the last ten years. Regardless, it's still fun and fresh feeling and a worthy addition to any comic book movie junkie's watch queue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Very pleasantly surprised and a wee bit shocked,"Yes readers, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, after reading all the hype and comment here (which lets face it we take with a pinch of salt) I decided to go see this movie and haven't laughed as much since Borat.Yes I must admit to being a wee bit shocked when the 11 Yr old uttered the now famous( or infamous) line but had to do a second take and turn to my viewing partners and ask what did she just say?

Didn't Disappoint,"I'm late to this film, but have always heard things good about it and basically knew the premise going into it. Kick-Ass didn't exceed my expectations, but it also didn't falter. It's exactlt what I thought it would be and I still enjoyed it. It used to be Spider-Man was one of the most relatable Superheroes, but he is dethroned by Kick-Ass. This depicts the realities of if someone were to really take the law into their own hands as a spandex wearing vigilante and I love that about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick ass review,"More of the same, basically. Kick ass starts off with a good premise. It develops the characters with a shallow approach and a few joke threats.After the initial introduction the film wanders off into pointless self indulgent garbage.It's definitely a 1 out of 10. I'll give it a one because i sketched a smile for about 3 seconds throughout the first half.i am also bothered to see the American movie industry releasing stuff like this. I thought it had reached the rock bottom but guess what... it's lowering standards still.Cheers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
fun movie,"Kick-Ass is definitely a funny movie. And somewhat special, when it comes to say about hero movies. This film starts with the simple hypothesis: what if I become a superhero? And Kick-Ass gives the answer for that with hilarious and cool actions. Hero from YouTube generation would be like this.I didn't try to find any lesson in this movie. I just wanted to watch something that could make me feel good and happy, and I made a right choice. Also, what I like about this movie is that all the scenes and figures are described fantastically. Especially sound effects and sound tracks are awesome! The eminent part of Kick-Ass goes to Hit Girl, I think.

It's Kick-Ass!,"Fans will always be loyal to their source material and criticisms can be boundless. Kick-Ass sets a tone that holds true to the novel, with some added flair for the movie going audience.If gore is unsettling, you may want to look away.. but keep watching. Fans will enjoy performances from some rising stars and crowd favourites like Nicholas Cage & Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Director Matthew Vaughn proves himself in the comic adaptation and continues to do so at the helms of X-men: First Class and the newest Mark Millar title, The Secret Service.Start to finish this movie turns the 'super-hero genre' expectations on it's head.

Kick-Ass a colorful violent movie,"Dave was a common teen studying in his school.But he was too common to be noticed.He didn't have the looks and wits to be a center of attraction in his school along with his friends.He was often bullied by the guys in the street,So one day he decided to become a super hero.Being a comics fan,he arranged his own attire and dressed himself to fight for the justice.he called himself Kick Ass.He became popular in medias during his fight against injustice.Though he failed in his initial encounter with injustice,his life changed when he accidentally met hit girl and her dad Big Daddy.But they had a mission larger than that of Kick Ass'.The father-daughter was well equipped and well arranged in their missions.But kick Ass ,being a normal guy became a part of their mission.What was their mission?Can Kick Ass perform well as a super hero he dreamed off?Rest of the movie deals with it.this movie too had violence scenes like other Hollywood action flicks.But a girl doing such violent and bloodful violence was critically considered by some viewers.Though it was an action/crime flick it also had its moments to laugh at.Mainly,with Kick Ass ,his friends and the villains son Red Mist.This movie performed well in Box office and my rating to this movie is 7/10!!More in www.movieholicviews.blogspot.in",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Serious/silly genre with a twist,"I won't get into the story here because it's abundantly covered pretty much everywhere else. So anyway, on to my opinion...Making a serious/silly genre film that firmly sits on the edge isn't easy. More so when the whole film revolves around this concept and thumbs its nose at superhero conventions (in a friendly way though).Kick-Ass manages this rare balance act and more, with a few cult scenes, a brilliant cast, fine styling, good cinematography, good music, a script that works, and it even has its share of quotable one liners (assuming you're a homicidal superhero).All in all it's a brilliant film that works for most segments of the public. It's at once a superhero film and a comedy, an adventure film and an action flick... the only people that might be put off will be a segment of the US public because of the abundant swearing, a lot of it uttered by a kid girl (which just makes it more fun for the rest of us).Remember that if you need them, the mayor has a special signal... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/trivia?tab=qt&item=qt1120995",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-Ass?! Are you kidding?,"Firstly, I must warn you people that this movie is not what you think it is. It's no comedy. It's no superhero movie. It's just a 2-hour bull. I don't know why was this movie made in the first place. It's a waste of time. Cage is wasted. The boy in tights is wasted. The chick is wasted.Was it ever funny? Was it ever truly kick-ass? Was it even made for worldwide audiences? Disastrous movie. I'm being very very very generous when I rate it 6 our of a scale of 10. It'd not even score 6 on a scale or 100.I think the makers were trying to make it a comedy but I guess the director grandma died and the script lost its humor.The action sequences seem so funny without the intent of being anywhere close to being funny. The script is damned. Our hero suddenly thinks he's some *man of steel*. Nicholas Cage is a cheap rip-off Batman. Chloe Moretz is still thinking that it's (500) Days Of Summer. Clark Duke is somewhere between Sex Drive & its sequel.Most funny of all, the actors are trying to look serious.Movie gone totally wrong.Believe me guys, you must not watch this movie just 'cos it's rated so highly on IMDb.

This movie is fun,"OK so if you're going into kick-ass expecting it to be on par with movies like ""citizen kane"" and "" there will be blood"" then wtf is wrong with you. By its name alone you know this isn't going to be some great masterpiece of the 21st century cinematic experience, but you should at least go into it with the hopes of just having a good time watching a movie. And trust me, most people will have a blast with this one. It's funny, very violent in a stylistic way, and overall pretty well shot when it comes to action and fighting scenes. The main character becoming a masked vigilante is handled in a comical but non-cheesy way, and overall the characters in this movie always add something to the experience when they are on screen, whether it be Nic Cage's role as the sweet but batsh!t father (I mean come on you should be sold on this movie by the fact alone that ole Nic is here ready to spread some crazy acting cheer), or the main character's nerdy but hilarious best friends.So that's a quick and basic summary of what I did like, now on to the issues. If you are madly in love with this movie and are going to hate someone else criticize it then this is where you should walk away from your keyboard and put your butt-plug back in. OK so first off the first scene of this movie is a dude jumping off a building to his death. Yeah not sure if that's a spoiler or not. Anyways, the way he landed after he feel is completely impossible (trust me I'm a scientist and nobody on the internet ever lies). Like I diagrammed it out and I'm pretty certain he couldn't have possibly landed the way he did. OK so that's more of a nitpick, so here's my real issues. This movie does one of those love story things. It's meant to be funny, but there comes a point where the characters act all lovey dovey and their dialogue is so cringe worthy and clichéd that I have no idea why it was put into the movie to begin with. Like seriously, I'm glad we got a minute long scene consisting of ""I care about you babe."", ""no babe, I care about YOU"". The movie also uses the 28 days/weeks later theme song during a fight scene, and it just feels completely out of place and awkward, at least to me. I'm sure some people will enjoy it. Alright rapping this semi-rant up, another spoiler is inbound. So during the end the characters fly away in a jetpack. This is fine and all, but the animators forgot to CGI cars onto the ground. Like one shot the street is empty, and then the next shot its completely filled with traffic. Like that's just bad attention to detail. So that's about it. This movie is what it wants to be and for the most part it is well done. I'd recommend it to any casual movie viewer wanting to have a fun movie night. 7.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The Title Says It All,"It was really only a matter of time. The culmination of decades of brainwashing, dumbing down and awful, awful artistry have resulted in ""Kick Ass."" Yes, it was also only a matter of time until someone produced a movie with that title. Now that another cultural barrier has crashed, look forward to movies with cherished words like ""Retard"" and ""Balls"" in their titles. Use your imagination- it's easy to envision really profound titles by sprinkling in all those formerly forbidden words.As for the movie itself, Hollywood takes its most prevalent theme- that of females beating up males- and speeds it up to a wharp factor. First, the female doing all that ass kicking is 11. ELEVEN. And she isn't content to knock them out with one punch from her dainty fists. No, she gruesomely kills them. While enjoying it immensely. She also enjoys mutilating them in the process.The fact that any audience, anywhere, finds this graphic filth- which should by all rights be considered child pornography- entertaining at all is yet another sad indication that our civilization is beyond all hope. The violence in this film is so gratuitous, so disturbing, especially because it involved such a young girl, that it really wouldn't be any more offensive if the preteen actress was wandering around naked and having sex with adults, instead of gleefully murdering them.If there is any justice in this world, ""Kick Ass"" will continue to under perform at the box office. The less money it makes, the better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant,"Kick Ass is my favorite movie revolving around teenagers. It reminds of me of my childhood and it's one of my most favorite comedies. All these characters are so likable and MY WORD THIS KID STEALS THE MOVIE. Usually I hate kids in movies but this one, Hit-Girl steals the show WoW!! She was great. A 9 year old can kick serious ass!! Kick Ass could've been bad, I mean it had Nicholas Cage in it. Hopefully it wasn't, It revolves around a major situation- The impact of movies on people. It covered it brilliantly. The chemistry between characters worked perfectly. This is one of my favorite superhero movies. Simply Brilliant!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Realistic movie,"That was some KICKASS movie. I had had enough of crap superhero movies before, and if you are like me you would expect 'kickass' to be one of those. But this one was like no other. The story is basically not much different from ordinary superhero stories. But its portrayed in a fairly realistic sense. Kickass, hit girl, Big daddy suddenly seem so possible unlike spiderman, superman or anyone of those heroes with SUPERPOWERS. Background score was great. The music blended perfectly with the movie.I especially liked the Prodigy's score where they introduce Aaron Johnson. Characters are also so comic-like. Aaron johnson was great playing kickass But my favorite character from the movie was hit girl. Especially her last action sequence. This movie could so be a real story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
I want to see a Kick-Ass with the strength of its convictions,"For some reason this annoyed me greatly. As a movie it poses a lot and pretends smarts it hasn't earned for itself. The idea to elevate a comic-book fantasy above comic-book fantasy so it can poke fun at superhero conventions is a pretension, when all the ""the mayor signals to us with a light the shape of a gigantic c-ck"" cuteness is played out Kick-Ass shows us the best movie it knows to be. It pokes fun at the contrived trauma that creates a vigilante, Dave before a tombstone saying ""I will avenge you mother"", then gives us the same for Hit Girl and Big Daddy in a big slab of backstory thrown at the audience. It gives us a love interest so bland and worthless as to make Loys Lane seem like an intriguing character. I don't like the type of cutesy quirky film defined by smug irony but since someone bothered to make this I want to see it have the strength of its convictions.I want to see a Kick-Ass with the balls to be what it needs to be. Play cute cheerie music over a scene where a little girl cuts up a bunch of thugs but don't give us a sirupy Big Daddy death. Don't give us b-llocks of realism about an ordinary guy who wears a wetsuit and plays the part of the superhero to dismal failure, then turn him into a jet pack flying cartoon by the end. It's all very half a##ed to me. ""Shockingly"" ironic when it needs to make fun of superhero clichés, then a superhero fantasy where justice is served and the good guy gets the girl to give us the vicarious fulfillment. Selectively poking fun at cliché then using it as a shorthand for character - there goes another awkward nerdy guy who can't get a girlfriend. Mainly I don't like this because it thinks it's smart enough to express itself through other peoples' work (I cringed when they randomly used Morricone) yet forgets to take a long hard look at its own mess.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A solid celebration and parody of the genera.,"With all the recent attempts to satirize and deconstruct super heroes in the modern day I was sort of expecting that going in. But instead I found a comedic and action packed celebration of superheroes. I was surprised that outside of intentionally comedic bits the plot is played fairly straight. I commend it for blending the two tones quite seamlessly. Fundamentally I think that the writers understood that a good origin story works with the tropes rather than pointing them out. Following our fairly geeky and bright eyed protagonist develop into a hero was nice. I will say that some of the acting was a bit hit or miss and further outside of the action scenes the camera work was a bit dull. Overall this is a competent and enjoyable watch, nothing groundbreaking but I would recommend for superhero fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Hilariously over-the-top!,"A hilariously over-the-top campy comic book adaptation. Aaron Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are pretty good in their dorky roles. But Chloe Moretz is awesome as Hit Girl and has some laugh-out-loud one-liners. She steals every scene she's in, complementing or offsetting Nicholas Cage's uneven performance as Big Daddy. The film also serves as an interesting social commentary about our passive, spectator YouTube culture, a satire about the glorification of violence and our modern devolution into a world of social apathy. Perhaps that is why the premise of the film -- real-life superheroes -- is so foreign to the audience at the outset until the extreme violence reminds you to sit back and enjoy: it's just a comic book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

It tells the story of Dave Lizewski, a teenager who becomes a vigilante superhero named ""Kick-Ass""When the movie was released, it garnered mixed reviews from critics.

Additionally, the film's action scenes are skillfully choreographed, providing plenty of excitement and thrills.""Kick-Ass"" is a satisfying movie that presents a novel take on the superhero genre.

One of the bests movies ever.,"I saw this film in June 2013 and I have to say I was a complete fool for not seen it before, I mean it, this movie is brilliant, it have all the elements to consider it a Classic, a Masterpiece, it's very well directed, very well written, with a blow-minded acting, a great plot, great balance, fantastic soundtrack, absolutely all the elements in the movie work perfectly, it have the most beautiful balance I've ever seen; If you likes movies and don't mind about explicit language, some violence, and politically incorrect sense of humor (all critics about the movie lay down on that), and you want to see that elements working in a brilliant way, this is the movie can give you all that, and more, Kick-Ass deliver us an epic performance of the young actress (soon a legend), Chloë Grace Moretz, this child with only 11 years old at the time of the movie was shooting, totally owns the screen, and i'm not to exaggerate about it, in my opinion she has the greatest performance for a kid of her age ever, totally amazing, and believe me, all the cast were absolutely awesome, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Nicolas Cage, Mark Strong, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Lindsy Fonseca, Clarke Duke, Michael Rispoli... they all did it beautiful, Nic Cage, Mark Strong and Aaron Taylor-Jhonson with significant roles, but she definitely steals the hole movie.I really don't want to ruin you the experience of see this movie for the very first time if you didn't see it before, with details and spoilers, but whatever you think this movie is, it's so much better than that, so much better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"As far as R rated superhero films go, this is one of the best ones. How does it hold up today?","""Kick-Ass"" (2010), when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I just thought to myself: ""eh, it just looks like another dumb raunchy slapstick film. How can this possibly be good?"" I didn't go and see it in a movie theater, and I really regret that. After it came out on DVD, I saw it on the store shelf and I said: ""why not?"" I put it on, and I was shocked to find myself hooked right from the beginning. Really, I'm not kidding, I was invested all the way through. As I watched it, I thought: ""man, why didn't I go see this in a theater? Shame on me!"" This movie has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is based off a comic series of the same name. I've never read any of the comics, but if this film is any indication, then I'll really have to check out the comics some day! Any way, the storyline is, a superhero-obsessed high schooler named Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, has big ambitions of becoming a superhero himself. So, he builds a costume and goes out to fight crime. A few witnesses see him, and he dons the name, Kick-Ass. From there, several other people get inspired to do the same thing and become superheroes themselves! Before I went to see this film, I checked out a spoiler-free synopsis of the plot, and thought: ""this is a clever idea! But, how is it executed?"" Like I said, when I watched it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. This film knows exactly what kind of movie it wants to be, it has fun with every aspect and it kept me excited and laughing all the way through. There are also big emotional scenes that I did not expect, but, all of the aspects flow smoothly and resulting a perfectly crafted movie! Plus, since it was directed by Matthew Vaughn, that also lifted my hopes for it to be good, as he has directed some great movies! As far as the acting goes, it's nothing short of stellar from the whole entire cast! They all really nail their respectable characters. My favorite performances come from Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, Chloe Grace Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl, Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist and Nicolas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy. Now, let me just bring some special attention to Aaron Taylor-Johnson. In most of the movies he stars in, his performances suck. But, there actually are a few of them where his acting is good and excellent in some circumstances. His role as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, in my opinion, is his all-time best performance. In fact, most of his earlier movies are good, compared to some of his later ones. *Cough ""Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)"" cough*. Overall, the acting is fantastic and the performances really help bring the story to life! All of the sets/locations are perfect and really give the film a great atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by John Murphy, Henry Jackman, Marius de Vries and Ilan Eshkeri is fantastic. Usually, most movies have one, maybe two film score composers. But, this one has four, no wonder it's so good! Now that's what I call working together, they nailed the score for this movie. It sets the perfect tone and brings the whole plot together. ""Kick-Ass"" is a masterpiece in the world of R rated superhero films. It actually almost found a spot on my top 10 list of my all-time favorite superhero movies! Now, it may not have made my exclusive list, but at the very least, it's deserves an honorable mention. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Kick-Ass"", go and see it today. Or else, Hit-Girl may make you her next target!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Kicks ass!,"When I first saw the trailer, I dismissed it thinking that it would be another gross out teen comedy but when some of friends asked if I wanted to see it, I decided to join them whilst going in with an open mind and the result is amazing! The film maintains being funny from start to finish whilst being able to have a very dark and sad scene at the same time.I watched this film over a week ago and thought carefully before giving it a 10 but the film deserves it. This is because it blends cool action scenes (Nicolas Cage has a great fight scene), witty dialogue and likable characters together.The story runs smoothly and I never found the story boring. Where the Spiderman films failed, this makes up for it. I have to say though that I enjoyed this film a lot more than the Spiderman, X-Men and Hulk films because Kick Ass' director, Matthew Vaughn, keeps you entertained by introducing something cool and interesting or something that you did not see coming.The acting is also great with Nicolas Cage giving a strong performance as Big Daddy, the super hero role that he was looking for and not Ghost Rider. Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl is also very good saying things that are indeed questionable but they are far and few between. Aaron Johnson as Kick Ass gives a very good performance in a role that will surely make him a recognisable star in good time.I strongly recommend this film to anyone looking for something that will be entertaining but also has a great story. There are a lot of cool action sequences such as one where they make reference Call of Duty, which I know will be more than enough to attract young people in. The director has a great understanding of how to use music in his films, similar to what he did in Layer Cake and he does it again here, assisting in making this a fantastic film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A little girl who graphically stabs her sharp long phallic appendages into the fleshly bodies of other supposedly criminal hence unpardonable humans. Or subhumans. Daddy will be SO proud. Awwww how adorable.The world totally need more senselessly-murdering psychopaths! Let's hope all little girls grow up ""strong"" like this one!

Soon after she ""came into her stab-happy self"" the entertainment stopped for me - here's just Tarantino's glorified murderous sociopaths in hot chick suits transposed into a glorified teenage psychopath, but with even less justification for blood.Kick Ass is but a ""reversed"" child snuff porn. And a contrived humorless one too. The way she kills, so casually and so smugly, the way she talks, so smart alec clever and super annoying, a kind of perverted soul-less little sister some lame-ass father or brother would love.Apparently that's all the movie producers could conjure of What Makes a Little Prepubescent Teenage Girl Interesting. If we can't make her have sex just yet, at least we could make her kill other adults. That would be fun! Girls secretly wish to kill everyone too, guys secretly get a kick out of alpha killer queens, people will love it! So they reckoned...The little girl is either an object to be raped and killed, or one who castrates and kills. Apparently that is SO COOL.For me....yawn.If I had a little sister or a daughter who thinks Chloe's casual-murdering behavior is so cool, or confuses vacuous smugness as profound cleverness, straight to the advanced psychotherapy ward she goes.1 star for humorless snuff pretending to be cute and heroic.

Do ya still wanna become a superhero?,"I've been lucky to see that movie yesterday on the special showing at the biggest Moscow theater before the official Russian release date. Though I'm not a real admirer of the films based on comic books due to it's tend to be boring and silly, there are some good pictures in that vein which I find rather good. For instance ''Iron Man'' or ''Dark Knight''. This time my scrupulous attention was attracted by the matter of fact that it's a kinda parody movie. I'm saying ''kinda'' because ''Kick Ass'' is also based on the comic book, but this book in comparing with others is fairly untypical mainly for the specific approaching to superhero idea and a comedy script. Seen references in press and comments of other people were quite good therefore I couldn't avoid the opportunity to see it.Have you ever dreamed to become a superhero in your childhood? I guess you did. But now try to remember what had always stopped you? Yes right! Even in our childhood we had a perception that in real life we will definitely be beaten, that somebody will obviously kick our ass. Dave Lizewski is the same guy with the same dreams, but the difference is that he attempted to make his dream come true. He bought a superhero costume in the internet shop and went out on the streets to struggle against a crime and establish the justice. Of course No wonder he's got clobbered twice, but despite of it he has rapidly become a famous star. Just because of his non-careless attitude.''I don't wanna be involved'', ''Why should I help someone?'', ''It's not my problem'' that's what constantly people thinking while somebody's in danger. And when they are eventually finding themselves in a tight corner, they start to complain of no one didn't try to help them. It's a deep and serious society problem, nobody cares 'bout each other issues, usually people even afraid to call the police. And even though this is a comedy ''Kick Ass'' tries to awake feeling that you always have a capacity to help, that you shouldn't keep yourself aloof from the real problems.But it was a lyrical digression. Of course this movie should be considered as funny comedy which parodies comic movies. Matthew Vaughn had satisfied almost all spectators' demands. Perpetual jokes permanently fuels during entire film, I was literally writhing in hysterics while watching it. Clumsy hero in stupid hydro costume, idiotic tandem of Nicholas Cage (who parodied the Batman) and his little daughter, stupid mafia made me laughing all the time. Definitely this is the funniest film of this year. Elaborately madden action scenes delighting eyes, since ''Kill Bill'' I don't remember so brutal, cruel with lotta blood and violence film. Another one good side is that ''Kick Ass'' ain't overextended like the most of such movies, it isn't become annoying in the middle.No doubt this is amazing stuff to spend vacations or after working evening greatly. The only one minus is that for obvious reasons you cannot take your children (if you have them) on this film. Rest of all is great, if you have an opportunity to see it, don't hesitate!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""Kick-Ass"" is mostly good","""Kick-Ass"" was a fun watch, for the most part. The movie is extremely different from most superhero movies, other than maybe ""Deadpool"" 1+2. This is something I am extremely happy with. Gone are the days of good Marvel movies. This movie stands out because of how adult the humor is. With good characters, good action, and good comedy, what's not to like?The thing that bothered me the most about this movie was the pacing. The movie can be split up into thirds, with the second third being the problem. A very long stretch of the movie goes by with very little action or even comedy for that matter, the two things that make this movie stand out. However, as soon as things start heating up again and we move into the third and final chunk, we are back in a familiar and welcome setting.Overall, the movie is pretty good. Is it going to be better than ""Deadpool"" at being a raunchy and hilarious superhero comedy? No. (Nothing will) But, this movie is still pretty good. I'd recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
My favorite movie! Seriously!,"OK I have been called out on this before but here me out. I didn't say it was the best movie ever. I said it was my favorite. I love movies like Fight club, the matrix, the god father, scarface, pulp fiction, shawshank redemption etc... And they are all masterpieces of cinematography. But Kick-ass is my favorite. Its funny, exciting, intense, and at time's emotional. It has a brilliant script which is brilliantly acted. Of course the movie belongs to Hit Girl,portrayed by the beautiful Chloe Grace Moretz. She is phenomenal in this, as she is in everything. She will make it far. While i will willingly admit that the Godfather is an epic masterpiece and Shawshank is a powerful tale of redemption, and I love them both, Kick-Ass is one of those I can watch any time anywhere without getting tired of it. Its the action, the comedy and the heart that gives it endless rewatchability and thats what makes it my favorite. Cant wait for Kick-Ass 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick Asses of Entertainment,"From Matthew Vaughn, director of Stardust and Layer Cake, the man takes a stab at the comic book genre, Kick-Ass. While the film bodes well for entertainment and the average Friday night visit to the movies, Kick-Ass doesn't offer any heart and soul to withstand any real social or film-making significance. Vaughn seems to be very inspired by Quentin Tarantino's film style but rather then use it as a foundation, he copies it in the most awkward way and delivers second rate results.With an ensemble of all up-and-comers, and Nicolas Cage, Kick-Ass enables its players to dig somewhat deep within themselves to bare real emotions, however, minimal delivery and story arch don't lead to any substantial moments. Of the players, Aaron Johnson who plays the brave superhero ""Kick-Ass"" carries the audiences affection. With his breakthrough performance in Nowhere Boy last year, Johnson will sure to be one of Hollywood's bright lights.Chloe Moretz as the vulgar and spunky ""Hit-Girl"" is surely a fan favorite character, however, I found her character completely annoying. Her fight sequences, as most of the film, are simply awesome and red hot fire, but as soon as dialogue is shared with any of her co-stars, worst of all Nicolas Cage as ""Big Daddy,"" eyes roll. And what Nicolas Cage seems to be doing these days is stop trying altogether on acting. He's showing an eclectic taste in choosing movie roles which I can appreciate but he's lost all sight of what he showed us in the mid-90's when he won his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. He's stopped chasing that moment again.Christopher Mintz-Plasse, or as you may know him better as ""McLovin"" from Superbad, remains his A-typical role with no acting range. As awesome as Mintz has been in his last roles, he seems to be locked in this type of ""struggling, teen depression angst"" performances. I'm waiting on something more.As this looks like a negative review of Vaughn's film, my experience is not a bad one by any means. Kick-Ass is pure entertainment though a tad too long but it gets chuckles and smiles along the way. It shows something different which is worthy for a look.**1/2/****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Well made film.,"This is a dynamic film, well shot and notoriously done with artistic freedom (which is always compromised when you're working with big studios).The story is well known and it is about the great dilemma of trying to be something above the concept that others have of us while finally seeking to make a difference in society. The star of the film is not our hero but the heroine and her father (the great Nicholas Cage). Shot with a solid cast, it's an excellent example of how to make an extreme action comedy. The villains, as always, follow the logic of being terrifying when handling weapons, but that's part of all the films. Good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-Ass deconstructs the superhero genre and assembles specific components to create outlandish action.,"Matthew Vaughn found his style with this film, a style that would later become a trademark for his most successful franchise 'Kingsman'. Excessively stylised action that excel in showcasing gratuitous violence with comedic flair. All blending into a light hearted story in the name of entertainment. Yet, Kick-Ass is slightly more intelligent in its execution than the average action flick. A high schooler is tired of being invisible, so he creates a superhero alter ego in a bid to fight crime and become noticeable. Utilising a standard formula for any superhero origin story and flipping it upside down by becoming a self-referential comedy. By allowing its own awareness to seep through the plot, it suddenly becomes hilarious and that is exactly what this film needed in order to differentiate itself from the clustered genre it resides in. Then applying Vaughn's glossy use of blood and guts spewing from every direction, the film suddenly becomes intelligent and entertaining simultaneously. It's just ludicrous fun. During its deconstruction of the genre, there are times that the plot succumbs to the clichés it sets to avoid and thus becomes predictable for the most part. Fortunately, an interesting cast list keeps the narrative flowing. Moretz is the foul-mouthed ""Hit Girl"", the always eccentric Cage is ""Big Daddy"" and Johnson the optimistic protagonist ""Kick-Ass"". Cage and Strong gave the best performances with natural comedic execution to their dialogue, particularly the former who forcefully communicates like a broken robot. Johnson played the alter ego well, but unfortunately didn't really suit the nerdy character of Dave. The action, for the most part, was well edited although certain scenes felt slightly haphazard, especially the final shootout which was crazily mental. Overall, I admire the intentions of Kick-Ass. It's light, fun and entertainingly humorous. A more exciting plot would've elevated the originality, but Kick-Ass definitely kicks ass.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The most entertaining film of the year,"In 2007, director Matthew Vaughan and writer Jane Goldman flipped the fantasy genre upside down and made it fresh with the brilliant Stardust. Three years later, they've done it to the superhero genre with Kick-Ass and it's bloody brilliant. There are swearing 11 year old girls, weedy kids in wetsuits decapitating henchmen, Nicolas Cage is actually pretty damn good and it's laugh out loud funny all the way through. It's simply a great piece of entertainment.The film's premise seems pretty familiar at first. Dave Lezweski (Aaron Johnson) is a nerdy teen with girl problems who wishes he was a superhero. In fact, the film even starts with him saying, ""Who am I? You sure you wanna know......."" in a blatant spoof of Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man and it sets the tone perfectly straight away. He orders a wetsuit from eBay, goes out to fight crime and quickly becomes a YouTube, Facebook and Myspace sensation. An unfortunate accident leads him to having metal plates in his bones, a clear nod to Wolverine. Eventually his antics get the attention of baddie Mafia boss Frank Di'Amico (Mark Strong) and he uses his son Red Mist (himself a wannabe superhero played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to try and stop Kick-Ass. The real concern for Di'Amico though is Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).Whilst we're on the topic of Big Daddy and Hit Girl, they're really quite brilliant. Cage's character is a former cop with a ridiculous moustache who's spent 11 years of his life training his daughter Moretz into a lethal assassin. During their escapades he resembles Batman and she is something entirely new. She dismembers her enemies, throws daggers into their faces and refers to them openly with the worst word in the English language (yes, the one that begins with c, it's quite funny). The two of them ar completely deranged, Big Daddy shoots his own daughter with a shotgun in combat training and in return for her perseverance he buys her an ice cream. It's some real crazy stuff.The casting, as in Stardust, is perfect. All the actors do a fantastic job. Aaron Johnson is perfectly cast and is fantastic in the role, Mark Strong is still the perfect villain in the whole film industry and Mintz-Plasse is also very strong. As you may well have guessed though, Cage and Moretz steal the show. Nicolas Cage is an absolute revelation. Years and years of looking dead bored in films like Knowing and National Treasure, he's clearly having great fun in the role. He also does a mean Alan West impersonation when he becomes his superhero alter-ego. Chloe Moretz though is absolutely terrific. An 11 year old saying ridiculous swear words should just be funny because it's an 11 year old saying ridiculous swear words, but her comic timing is so good that it's funny more from her perfect performance rather than just the fact that they're funny lines she gets to say. The Daily Mail will tell you otherwise, but she's a real hoot and a sure future star.I've focused a lot on Hit Girl and Big Daddy and this could've been a real problem for the film. They're such great characters that it would have been easy to neglect the main plot. Thankfully though, Jane Goldman has crafted a masterful script to go with the great characters and dialogue. The focus always goes back to Dave's story and there's even a nice little romance sub-plot that's been weaved effortlessly within all the great action and comedy.The action itself is actually pretty damn good too. There's plenty of blood and gore but it's all choreographed really well and is great to watch. There's hardly any CGI involved which is a fantastic change from overblown crap like Clash of the Titans.As good as the actors are and as good as Jane Goldman's script is, the director Matthew Vaughan is the real hero of the film. Stardust was fantastic but this takes him onto a whole new level and I'm sure plenty more Hollywood studios will come calling for him now. He's brought together a great cast and created the most entertaining film I've seen in a long time.Quite frankly, if I see anything more entertaining at the cinema this year then I'll eat a pair of socks dipped in guacamole.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Didn't Kick as much Ass as I wanted,"I have heard so many great things about this movie. About how it's one of the most original, funny, entertaining, vulgar comic book films ever. And I agree that it was unique, humorous, not boring, and was definitely vulgar. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed with the final product when I finally sat down and watched it, but that doesn't mean it's bad.I liked the main character, I liked the fact that he wasn't a jock, a science nerd, or a rich kid, he's just a normal, average guy. I loved Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, they kicked so much ass I wanted to see so much more of them.But for the most part, the movie doesn't really focus that much on the characters and more or less focuses on the action, which is fine.

Perfect !!!!,"honestly saying this movie is brilliant, in many ways, a masterpiece. it is packed with awesomeness, violence and crude humor, it is so far the most sensible superhero movie till now the story is simple, a geeky teen, fascinated by comics, one day decides to be a superhero, but unfortunately runs into a situation with a powerful drug dealer the screenplay is just beautiful and the acting is a stand out, the movie actually makes us to care for its characters and the intro of all the characters just makes u go like ""whoa, this is awesome"" the humor is topnotch and the violence is....well thats whats best in this movie, the violence is sometimes a bit too much but it never pulls of the experience with a disgust, say for just a small scene this is one of the best movies I've seen so far but haters would simply love to hate it, if u walk in the theater expecting ""spiderman"" or ""batman"" action sequences, well u could be disappointed, the action sequences in this movie are more realistic and not sequences with heroes flying and punching with superhuman strength the villain is likable and everything evolves in the movie, just perfectly well it certainly isn't a movie for young viewers but enough said,this is a must watch movie and your surely gonna love this superhero",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Good film just one large problem,"Undoubtedly Kick Ass exceeded my expectations for the film. I thought it was likely to be shallow and in most parts cheesy. However I was pleasantly surprised with a comic and relatively in depth plot. All was well in this film until the introduction of ""Big Daddy"" poorly casted as Nicholas Cage. Why oh why he keeps on taking on these ridiculous roles that do not suit his acting style beats me. For me he isn't a great actor and especially is NOT suited to this role! National Treasure is the only film bar maybe Face Off which Cage is decent. He defiantly is not in Kick Ass and as a whole does in my opinion let the film down.Apart from this Hick-up however the film is on the whole very good with a good mix of with the main plot and other sub narratives.

"Very Good Mix of Comedy, Action, and Some Drama","'Kick-Ass' brought an incredible hype with it when it came out in 2010. From that they were able to make the sequel, 'Kick-Ass 2'. So I went into 'Kick-Ass' with somewhat high expectations. It met if not exceeded my expectations.How was the acting?The acting in 'Kick-Ass' was very good. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did really well as Dave Lizewski and as Kick-Ass. He portrayed Dave Lizewski as a high school student and the character put on a different face for Kick-Ass. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was able to portray Kick-Ass differently, which is what the film was shooting for. Christopher Mintz-Plasse also did very well playing Chris D'Amico. I didn't see him as Fogell from Superbad. Chloe Grace Moretz did very well playing Mindy Macready and portrayed her well as an intimidating 11-year-old. Last of all, Nicholas Cage did extremely well playing Damon Macready. He probably did the best out of all of these actors and actresses. He was amazing in this film.How was the writing?The writing in 'Kick-Ass' seemed very realistic. There were many scenes with high school students, and the characters seemed like real high school students. They messed with each other, teased each other, and had comedic dialog throughout the film that was actually humorous. I liked many aspects of the film including the realistic tone of it. I liked how the protagonist, antagonist, and several of the main characters had at least more than one layer to them. I also enjoyed many of the plot events, especially near the end. In the end, there was also a fair amount of emotion in this mixed-genre film. For a usual mixed- genre film, it's just a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be. This film, though, separated the genre into different sections, which would seem lazy, but it actually made the film better. When it wasn't serious, it had comedic elements. When there were action sequences, it had moderately thrilling elements. In a few serious scenes, it had the right score in the background so that it's a drama.Did it have an interesting premise?In an action/comedy, one of the main flaws would be the premise. Luckily, this film had an alright premise. It wasn't necessarily good, but it definitely wasn't bad. I'll say it's above average, but somewhat good for what it was.Was it entertaining or boring?This film had slow parts near the beginning and middle, which sadly brought the rating down, but for the most part it was entertaining. I thought that they could have sped film up in those acts, but it tried to show too many characters. There were about four sets of characters, which made the film have to split camera time between them, making the scenes somewhat boring. It did pick up after a while, though.What things in particular did I like (that I haven't already covered)?'Kick-Ass' had very enjoyable and thrilling action sequences throughout the film. The layered characters were also aspects of the film that made the action sequences more thrilling. The ending of the film was also very satisfying to me. It mixed the right amount of drama and emotion to make the sequences great then.What things in particular did I dislike (that I haven't already covered)?The film was not as humorous as I thought it would be. It didn't have a big use of comedic elements, and the ones that were used stayed mostly the same, and got old by the third act of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A film that's all you could ever ask for.,"Simply said, such a great film. I won't give too much away but in essence, this film is about a young high school student who loves comic books and wonders the world has so much evil, yet people stand and do nothing. It's not so much the plot of this movie that is so intriguing but the way in which it is handled. Every aspect of this movie is taken realistically, in a way that leaves the audience with no questions of disbelief. The cast in this is incredible. Definitely a breakthrough performance from Aaron Johnson, and Chloe Moretz is hilarious. The biggest on-screen persona comes from none other than Nic Cage as Big Daddy. The patriarchal-revenge-crazy Cage is astounding to watch and the action throughout is immensely thrilling.

Superheros minus the superpowers,"Fed up with the complacency of everyone around him towards spiraling crime, a teenager decides to become a superhero in this well-paced mix of comedy and action from 'Kingsman' director Matthew Vaughn. Long before winning a Golden Globe for his scary performance in 'Nocturnal Animals', Aaron Taylor-Johnson is well cast as the near polar opposite protagonist who narrates his adventures with wit and fun pop culture references. The film also takes a surprisingly down-to-earth approach towards his quest as he only ends up being as effective as a superhero without skills, training, weaponry and powers would be. This down-to- earth air sadly evaporates as Nicolas Cage and Chloë Grace Moretz enter the picture as father and daughter trained superheroes. Both Cage and Moretz are a lot of fun to watch though with great banter and repartee and therefore it is hard to resent these less realistic characters coming into focus. Moretz steals every scene that she is in and while some blaring songs subtract from the immediacy of her combat scenes, she makes for a convincingly dangerous character despite her sweet looks. Much of the action here might be over-the-top, but with the comedic potential of the action so deliberately pronounced, it is easy to sit back and enjoy this speculative take on what might happen if more ordinary citizens chose to fight back.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Fun Movie,"I love this movie. I think the biggest appeal to the film is that it feels ""real"". Its about ordinary people, becoming heroes. They have no powers, no training, no nothing. Just an average person with courage to stand up to the bad guy. Because its the average man, yes that person can get hurt and yes its dangerous, and yet they are doing it. It makes the viewer feel like they could be a hero if they choose to be too.The movie has a comic book, comedy feel to it, mixed in with some classic R rated content and action that makes it fun to watch.

Great action comedy,"When I first saw this movie I was expecting it to be silly and ridiculous and don't get me wrong it was but it was still very good. The plot was a fresh new idea and the writing was good. The actors all did great and were funny(Except for Cage of course hes terrible). Some of the scenes were a little over the top though.This boy is about a young nerd who always gets picked on and mugged and sees all of this happening in his city. As a big fan of comic books he one day decides to dress up as a super hero and fight crime himself. Even though he has no training, weapons, or help that does not stop him from trying to make his city a better place.This movie is pretty good the only reason I didn't put it higher is probably because of the couple over the top scenes. I understand that its supposed to be comedy but comedy can be done through dialouge let the action be crisp and real.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Don't believe the hype.,"Don't believe the hype. The only things you haven't seen here before are a pretty funny Adam West impression from Cage, and the sight of an eleven year old girl killing henchmen (if that does it for you). The first hour is some pretty lame high-school American-Pie/Superbad-ish comedy that segues into some pretty ill-natured and nasty-edged violence (that is rarely justified). The film never really has the satirical bite it promises and it ends up becoming a pretty standard action movie heavily reliant on guns (I thought this was supposed to be a super-hero movie?!). It also quickly rejects its ""real world – real physics"" premise pretty quickly, which blunts the entire point of the film.By far the best thing about the film is the action scenes - which are pretty well made and fairly originally shot - though they tend to leave a bit of a bad taste in the mouth, owing to the fact there aren't any really likable characters in the film and the whole plot is pretty morally bankrupt. There is also a hugely uncomfortable scene with Hit- Girl in a school uniform which makes you feel like you've stumbled across an illegal website.In the end the film feels far too much like a too many other movies (though obviously genre references are essential) to have much of it's own identity (Watchmen, Spiderman, Superbad, Kill Bill, etc.) It's also not nearly funny enough to be a comedy - shoot me down but I honestly found the underrated Mystery Men funnier, and that was over ten years ago!I wasn't excited about this film until seeing the reviews, and having seen it, I'm now pretty confident that the fawning reviews of the UK media (it came out here a few weeks before US) have been heavily influenced by editors insistent on giving a film with so much UK talent (star, director, writer etc) good reviews. It all smacks of back- scratching/palm greasing. This is nowhere near a five star film, and I'm keeping my hopes up that the upcoming ""Defendor"" better delivers on the promise of a similar premise.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Do you  need renewal?,"Are you tired of the same old thing at the movies. Are you tired of the same old action sequences, often by the same old actors? Are you tired of being treated like an idiot-of-the-masses by movie businessmen? Then come to the cinema now and have your spirit renewed by Kick-Ass. Have restored that long jaded and dead part of the movie going experience that you loved (or at least appreciated) so long ago. Over the years, I have come to despise over-the-top action sequences, especially when they involve an invulnerable macho killing machine. I typically avoid movies that advertise these, and shake my head in disgust if I find myself forced to witness them. Can anybody say Rambo IV. However, Kick-Ass, primarily due to Hit Girl (Choloe Moretz) scenes, has brought back joy to me regarding action scenes. You can say this is due to a gimmick in using an 11 year old girl, but that is wrong. It is originality and style that has been missing. It is genuine creativity that is absent. Action scenes have become just canned commodities that the movie business judges as a profit vehicle. I just went to my 3rd viewing of Kick-Ass, and I have been more impressed by each viewing. There are many elements in this movie to be appreciated, which other reviewers have aptly described. I found the father daughter relationship between Cage and Moretz to be incredibly touching and heartfelt, despite it's ludicrous context. Action sequences are not even a priority for my movie-going experience. But they are done so well in this movie, that I had to point this out to others who have been jaded and discouraged like me. Go see Kick-Ass for any reason. But go see it for these incredible action sequences as well. They are clever, exciting, and stylistic. They are unique in all cinema, especially in this business-jaded age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Why you should and shouldn't see Kick-Ass,"Early in the story Kick-Ass does a good job of illustrating what would really happen if someone decided to be a superhero (i.e., lots of pain). Later it becomes increasingly clear that this is itself a superhero movie, and has begun playing by superhero-movie rules. Physics and happenstance conspire with increasing frequency in favor of the good guys, rendering the movie's original premise--why doesn't anyone really do this, and what would happen if they did--once again meaningless.Kick-Ass is funny, well-written and suspenseful throughout, though--just in different ways as the story turns. Hit-Girl is brilliant creation who forsakes all little-girl things in favor of her paramilitary training, jumps impossibly across all surfaces, and treats her enemies like fillets in a Japanese restaurant. But although she and Kick-Ass often have the amazing luck of Hollywood, be warned that they can get hurt.Why you should see it You're a superhero geek. You like action movies. You've been trying for years to get up the nerve to get that costume out of its hiding place in the attic and go fight some evil. Or at least start your training at the local gym.Why you should avoid it Cursing of any kind makes you say, ""oh, my goodness!,"" so hearing a 13-year-old girl using the ""f"" word would probably make you say, ""oh, my! What kind of movie is this?!?,"" turn red and run from the room.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Characters who are just so entertaining they ""Kick-Ass""","Why don't people just put on capes and try to be superheroes? Because they would likely get themselves killed on their first night out. We meet Dave (Aaron Johnson) in high school when reading too many comic books has given him the idea that he should become a superhero. He becomes ""Kick-Ass"".The character of Dave gives this movie the most brilliantly funny start to any movie even close to the comic book, or action, or even comedy genre. Writing that smart and that funny is not expected in a movie like this. And by ""this"", I mean a movie where bad guys have guns, and more bad guys have more guns, and then trained assassins have even more guns.The ""trained assassins"" part is where Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) come in. Most people like Cage in his annual action role, but this is better, his comedic delivery is a sort of self-mockery and it's perfect. Hit-Girl and young actress Moretz are what sets this film apart and will determine whether or not you'll like it. Hit-Girl kills people. That's all she knows how to do. Some reviewers, like Roger Ebert, don't think it's funny when 11 year-old girls kill people (a lot of people). I happen to agree with him, but this movie has a lot of fans that don't agree. Moretz is like a cute, young, female Jackie Chan. For fanboys who like martial arts movies that is like hitting the jackpot.I don't like comic books, I don't like comic book movies, and I really don't like martial arts movies. I can like action movies if they give me solid characters to believe in. That's what ""Kick-Ass"" did and I liked it.

Kick-Ass - title says all!,"Ass needs kicked like Vogue have declared it reject stock, and there is only one man who believes he is suited to the task. When I say man, I mean a New York High school student, and just because he believes he is the only one, does not make it so.From the outset we are lead into the idea of Superheroes and the Geek-favoured debate of 'why does nobody ever try to be a Superhero?'. Fair enough comment I'd say. The answer shortly comes along to Kick-Ass, that people are either too scared to react to criminal acts, or they will in fact get their asses handed to them on a plate. He thus takes it upon himself to intervene in a fight that is not his to be involved in.Joe Public uploads footage from this ass whopping, served up by Kick-Ass to a group of thugs, and notoriety follows, merchandise released and the introduction (though only to Kick Ass himself) of two other vigilante heroes. Big Daddy and Hit Girl.With a father-daughter relationship most father's would love to have, and daughters wouldn't, Big Daddy and Hit Girl are a hard-impacting, weapon-toting, deadly duo not to be reckoned with.Vengeance is the motive for this pair of silent killers. Having kept their hero persona's private, the sudden emergence of Kick-Ass to the 'lime light', firstly takes any suspicion that would be creeping up at them, away, but could prove to make their job harder. However, could Kick Ass be more of an advantage to them than they realise? With start to end action, quips aplenty, even a love story that does not make you gag, this is what geeks and nerds alike dream of, becoming a Superhero.Whether you are into comics or not, prefer romantic comedies to action films, this picture is a must-see by all. I dare you to watch and not laugh at least once. I dare you to not come away from this with your own hero outfit and name planned. Double Dare!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A brutish satire which gives inspiration that even the most dull and pathetic are capable of superb heroism.,"Why hasn't anyone actually become a superhero yet? The answer is simple: It's bad for your health! Kick-Ass satirizes the comic book superhero genre by juxtaposing the mundane with the hyper-violent and in doing so creates an non-virtuous delight.Boasting satisfying performances from a very efficient cast, with Chloë Grace Moretz (Hitgirl) being the most distinguished, captivating direction from Matthew Vaughn and a very rewarding story, Kick-Ass manages to make the near-death pummeling of an 11 year old girl entertaining. While the film faces evident shortfalls such as failing to fully realize key character development and holistic human characteristics, a father-daughter duo who goes on vengeful killing sprees with absolutely no remorse for their actions is a tad inhumane and unrealistic. The film also suffers from disoriented pacing, at times it feels a bit too carried away with itself. However, the ultra-violent action, well placed comedy and attention grabbing direction overcome these obstacles.While it is entertaining, the moral repercussions that this film attracts will prove inimical to its legacy. Everything from the reckless parenting of Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) , the foolish courage of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), the severe pounding that Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) unleashes on an 11 year old girl and that said girl's brutal murder streak coupled with complete remorselessness for her actions make this film immoral, corruptible and perverted to say the least.Nevertheless, Kick-Ass for what it truly is, is a brutish satire which gives inspiration that even the most dull and pathetic are capable of superb heroism. What stands out to me the most from this film is that practicality values much less than theatrics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Amazing Movie,"So there's two things i have to say.One, if you're watching this to see a super hero movie, and you're a big fan of action with tons of explosions you're not going to get that. It has plenty of action, but it's more fight scenes than explosions and such.Two, although i didn't originally see this movie in theaters because i thought it looked like more of a kids movie, i was wrong. This movie isn't for young children, lot's of blood, violence, references to sex. My personal opinion is kids under 12 shouldn't watch this. But that's obviously ultimately the parents decision.The movie was great, no problems with the directing. The pace of the movie keeps you drawn in, never any dull and boring moments like in movies such as 300, Avatar etc. This is easily in my top ten list of movies. I know it won't be firs, because that's taken by The Dark Knight, but i'll probably end up placing it in top five.Great movie. If you haven't seen it for any reason, try to watch it. It's a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Hit Girll makes it work,"OK this movie was a LITTLE bit different.Kick Ass plays with the expectations of the viewer. It has the look and feel of ""Spy Kids"", but strikes you as the ""The Boondock Saints"" with pure brutality from time to time. Sounds entertaining? Could have been... Most of the playtime u have to sit through the more or less boring teen life of Dave Lizewski a.k. KickA**. He is a great contrast to Hit Girl for sure by being such a normal high school looser teen, but it is overdone. I think the major flaw oft his movie is, that the story is just a custom unimaginative Hollywood commodity. Evil Man gets what he deserves by whatever... So why did I rate this sh** 6 Points? It is still fun and it has a unique look and feel, but most importantly Chloe Moretz performance was amazing. I am really looking forward to see more Movies with her.

"117 minutes of unadulterated, unashamed fun.","A loser who forms a superhero alter ego without having any actual superpowers. An 11 year old girl with a foul mouth who loves a shoot up. McLovin as Red Mist. What's not to like? And this is just what we saw in the shorts. To say Matthew Vaughn has delivered the goods promised in the trailer (not a certainty these days – yes G.I. Joe, we're looking at you) is an understatement. Less concerned with what audiences expect and more interested in taking the preconceptions of what a superhero movie should look like and warping them around his twisted little finger, Vaughn delights in taking the unexpected turn. From the opening guffaw about a winged crusader to the closing line taken straight from a fellow comic-book movie, Kick-Ass issues a swift kick up the backside of the audience for thinking they know better.Vaughn made a name for himself in the movie biz as the producer of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Spending that time with Guy Ritchie has reaped some obvious rewards, not least his flair for spectacular bloodshed. It's not just the ultra-violence itself that is done well though, it is the hyper-kinetic action set pieces surrounding it that really provide the eye-popping, awe-inducing entertainment. The slow motion scene where Hit Girl unleashes her rage on Big Daddy's captors is truly magnificent – a mesmeric scene to remember for years to come – whilst the claret-filled finale will have a smile on your face from ear to ear thanks to the inventive, tongue-in-cheek brutality. All off the action sequences are done so well that you may – to quote Po from Kung Fu Panda – go blind from over-exposure to pure awesomeness.Casting to perfection, Vaughn has assembled a group of actors that fit their roles completely. Johnson induces our sympathy and cheers all at once, his Dave is a typical teenage boy with geeky friends (played comically by Clark Duke and Evan Peters) and no chance with women, but thankfully isn't a sad sack or a little brat like majority of adolescent characters that feature in the movies. Hitting career-top form with the slightly crazy Big Daddy is Cage; the role flits between psycho vigilante and doting father which allows the Oscar winner to play with small tics and nuances, which is what he has always done best. Mintz-Plasse and Strong are also on solid form as the cowardly costumer Red Mist and vociferous gangster D'Amico respectively, Mintz-Plasse especially impressive as he breaks through the McLovin stereotype he's been cursed with for the last few years.Make no mistake though, there is one standout performance that soars above the rest. Only 11 years old when filming, Moretz plays Hit Girl with such confidence and panache that she single-handedly runs away with the film. Moretz sprouts off quotable dialogue with a fantastically smug expression, her pitch-perfect delivery resonates life experience well beyond her years. Her colourful language and uncompromisingly vicious fighting skills may have conservative groups getting their knickers in a twist, but for the rest of us it just makes her one of the coolest characters we've seen for a while – it is only a movie after all.Kick-Ass is 117 minutes of unadulterated, unashamed fun.

Been hit by a freight train yet?...,"No!... Then you haven't seen Kick-Ass.Watching this film is like getting a legal high. It will have an amazing effect on you physiologically. After you have watched it for the first time, you immediately want to watch it again. It will become addictive, you will get withdrawal symptoms if you go more than two days without your Kick-Ass fix.I have never before seen a movie that has such an effect on you.Why didn't you go to the theatre to watch it? Probably because you watched the trailer and thought it was a lame superhero movie and will wait to rent it on DVD. BIG MISTAKE.THIS MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.The trailer gives no clue about the emotional and adrenaline pumping experience you will get when you watch this film. By the end of the movie you will be a quivering mess wondering what just hit you.All the performances are outstanding and will no doubt receive a great deal more offers based on their performances in this film.However there is one performance that has to be seen to be believed. CHLOE MORETZ (11 years old at the time) plays Hit Girl. It is a performance that takes this film from the great to the truly unimaginably outstanding. When you watch her as either Mindy or Hit Girl you are witnessing something special. Compare Chloe to most (if not all) other Hollywood actors/actresses and you will see the difference. She ACTUALLY BECOMES THAT CHARACTER on set. Almost like a split-personality she actually seems to be able to completely block out her own personality and project the character she is playing like no-one else I have ever seen before. Watch her on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno or on Ellen (both can be seen on youtube). Her charisma and maturity at such a young age put most other so-called stars in the shade. The many clips of Chloe that are available on youtube are a must see. One of the best is the Hit Girl interview she does for Empire magazine on set in her Hit Girl outfit.

With no power comes no responsibility,"It has been a long time since I have left a screening with endorphins pumping through my body and the strong urge to learn a martial art but Kick-Ass did exactly that; I felt like I could take on the world! An explosive ride that covers insane action sequences, intelligent superhero parodies and intense dramatic turns, Kick-Ass is a welcome addition to the realm of the comic-book movie.I was initially sceptical about the prospect of watching another superhero spoof movie, most recent attempts at the genre have been abysmal, but Kick-Ass completely transcends its predecessors through the use of intelligent pastiche which drives the story forward as well as providing laughs. The brilliantly choreographed action scenes would not feel out of place in a Spiderman film, or even a Tarantino script, in fact it feels like Spiderman and Kill Bill were put into a blender and Kick-Ass was the end result.The story focuses on Dave Lizewski, your average teenage nerd, whose obsession with comic books inspires him to create his very own superhero, Kick-Ass, despite his discernible lack of superpowers. Dave's attempts to become a vigilante crime fighter initially end in disaster but in the process of rescuing a cat his luck changes, propelling him into the public limelight and establishing him as a figure to be reckoned with.It is not long before other vigilantes surface, some desperate for the fame and attention, others out for revenge, and when Kick-Ass becomes embroiled in a crime lords devious plans, we are treated to a number of intense melees that gradually escalate in size and repercussions for those involved. There has been some controversy over the graphic violence depicted in these scenes, especially as the trailer is intended to appeal to a fairly young audience, and that comes as no surprise when a pre-teen girl decapitates villains on screen and uses the c*** word. Controversy aside, I cannot deny that this was very entertaining.Chloe Moretz easily steals the show as Hit Girl - the incredibly volatile young superhero with a penchant for explicit language, which will surely propel her into the realms of stardom. Nicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as her doting father, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is ever watchable as Red Mist. However it is Aaron Johnson who shows the most promise as Kick-Ass, with his convincing turn from a bumbling student to a brave and reckless crime fighter marking him as a talent to watch out for.An essential part of the film is its eclectic soundtrack, with choice tracks taken from excellent films such as 28 Days Later and For a few dollars more. Usually I would be concerned at such a prospect but the Kick-Ass soundtrack adapts the tracks brilliantly, making them feel like its own, alongside great songs from The Prodigy and Sparks to name a few. The choice of music fits perfectly with the high-octane action sequences and even adds emotional depth to key scenes - not bad for a superhero comedy movie!Kick-Ass is that rarest of films, a successful hybrid of two genres that delivers an almost perfect cinematic experience. My only criticism would be that some sequences near the end were slightly far-fetched but in a film where suspension of belief is required, maybe I'm being a little harsh. This is an essential film for all cinema-goers, catch it on the big screen and I guarantee you will be completely immersed in the explosive yet entertaining world of Kick-Ass.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The most fun that can be had in a theater.,"I have been looking forward to kick-ass for a while. I actually heard of it because I am a Nic Cage fan. After reading reviews and watching trailers, I had no idea what to expect. I either thought it was going to be a total comedy or an obscene, vulgar, no-plot movie. It's actually a little of both. Kick-Ass has the perfect mix between a ""superhero"" flick and a comedy. It is pretty controversial, but I would expect nothing less. The story was the biggest surprise to me. This movie had a WONDERFUL story. It made me laugh and almost cry in parts. The directors also added some comedy into the most brutal scenes to keep them from being too harsh. Nic Cage is not himself at all in this movie. Most people will probably enjoy this. Aaron Johnson, to me, was alright (not perfect) but his quirkiness was quite charming. Mark Strong was a very cynical actor. I could keep going down the list, but Chloe Moretz stole the show. She was FANTASTIC. Overall the acting was stupendous. Kick-Ass just did everything right. Even the music made for a fun experience (The Banana Splits and Spaghetti Western music) was very fun during gory battles. This movie is also one that rarely drug. Most movies have that ""middle-section"" that just makes the viewer want to gouge out his or her eyes. Not here.

Worth the #250 list,"To tell you honestly, I first checked out its rating here before watching it. I said to my self. ""Why the heck does just about every hyped new movie is included in the top 250?"" But after watching it, it deserved to be in that list. If Spiderman, Sin City, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill are in the top 250, I see no reason why Kickass would not be. The movie was well made, the action sequence was well directed combined with the background music during fight scenes. And the most amazing part of the movie is the scene where Hitgirl ""sobbed"" subtly, the way she put out the fire, the way she said ""Good night"". It appears that even in her most traumatic and saddest moment, she was still as tough as what Big Daddy taught her to be. Should be nominated for best dramatic scene or best violent scene whichever you prefer.Sometimes old-timers like to hold on to their best movies of all times, they call every good new movie overrated. when in fact at times history is happening in front of their eyes.

Not....Good.  It's just not good.,"Maybe people enjoy being fed something for their target demographic, but this is just building on the ""loner-loser"" hipster fetish that seems to be in every movie released. The main character is just a Michael Cera look-alike for Christ's sake, doesn't anybody get tired of this emasculated male crap? I'm not a fanboy nor do I know the source material, but it shouldn't be required. This just wasn't a good movie. It's another in a long line of teen-themed hipster genre movies that pretends it has a meaningful undercurrent but instead just falls flat.It also hits on the same ""shocking"" notes as a lot of other films that look to be 'edgy' without putting in any effort for real social commentary. I've seen countless films in the last 3 or so years with casual cocaine use, children swearing/acting like adults, casual high school homosexuality, sudden knee-jerk violence, etc. It's not shocking, edgy, socially conscious or even fun any more. It's just tired and played out, unoriginal. Same old crap.Besides its ""edginess"" there's just a very hallow, very tired superhero plot arc, complete with boring fanfare music and worn out origin stories. They throw in elements from classic teen movies that play out exactly as you would expect. The narrative, or what most folks would call the merit of the movie, plays like it came out of an instruction manual. There's no creativity here.The violence isn't even as shocking or surprising as they pretend it is. I've seen cheap action movies from the 80s with more original graphic violence, not to say such a thing is high art or difficult to do.

Kick-Ass just kicks ass...,"Can I simply just say wow!.Now this is what I call a real superhero comedy movie. The story is simple to its core. It's about a geek who fantasies on becoming a superhero.The character, Dave, a fan of super-hero comic books one days wonders whether anyone would take a stance and fight against crime. And, thus comes Kick-Ass into the picture. The complexity of the character written for Dave is performed excellently by Aaron Johnson. Who doesn't dream of becoming a super-hero in reality. Dream of being special and do something incredible. The character Dave here is a superhero not because he has super powers, but because he brings the inspiration for turning into a superhero. He successfully shows his strength in fighting crime as a normal human.The next best thing is the comedy and the timing. A complete blast. This movie will just blow you away. It's not good. It's not great. It's totally awesome. Character Dave dressed up as Kick-Ass and leaves home to fight crime only to find him looking for a lost cat. And the music is the next best part. In the where they play ""For A Few Dollars More"" I just had this feeling like wow. I mean, for that part the music seemed fitting as such the other musical pieces in different parts of the movie. Yes, they seemed to fit well with the movie.Next, Nicholas Cage as the Big Daddy has his share of the movie. His appearance in this movie will be recognized well. This super-hero, he wants to wipe out the entire the criminal organization which took away his loving wife, shows the anger for his need to wipe out the crime as a human. Wouldn't you want to revenge on the person if he/she took the love of your life ? Nicholas Cage succeeds in showing both the human side as well as the superhero side struggling with the pain. The performance in this movie is class A.Next thing, my personal favorite, the amazing awesome Chloe Moretz as the Hit Girl. She completely steals away the entire movie. Every scene she's in is a complete delight to watch. Especially the last 25 minutes of the movie where the action sequences are spell-binding.I have seen lot of bad reviews. I don't care about them as it is impossible to satisfy the entire population of the world. I enjoyed this movie for what it was. A very bold attempt and it served it's purpose excellently well.

Go See This Movie!,"Like many I presume, after seeing the commercials and being dazzled by the bright colors and the pint-sized superhero I'd later learn was called Hit Girl I thought that this was perhaps a children's movie. But don't be fooled, Kick Ass is anything but for the young kids. This is a teen and grown up movie and should be regarded as such for the language and extreme violence.I really found Kick Ass to be an enjoyable movie. It held itself together reasonable well and I found little that I would've done differently. Mainly just toning down the most extreme violence and the sexual innuendos neither of which is my thing, and particularly the later I found myself squirming in the theater seat and wondering if I was the only one that felt both uncomfortable and like I was watching a throw back to the 80's when movies had that level of cheap sexual thrills.It was really entertaining watching our main protagonist, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), think he had what it took to become a superhero. Now I guess we know why most all superheroes have powers, some kind of ability or a gimmick. Generally speaking, they'd get their butt kicked if they didn't. While the movie started somewhat slow, and you perhaps couldn't help but roll your eyes at Dave's really cheesy superhero costume it was humorous to see him try and step up.But it's really Hit Girl (played by Chloe Grace Moretz) that just runs with the movie. Being swept up into the larger story of the running conflict between Hit Girl, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and big bad Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) you really get the sense that Dave ""Kick Ass"" Lizewski doesn't know what he got himself into and definitely didn't sign up for the events of the movie; but nevertheless does the right thing by the later part of the movie. The characters of Hit Girl and her father, Big Daddy, take themselves and what they do very seriously. And it's once they appear that the movie really takes on a new life and moves past being perhaps just a cheesy flick. It's the later story, involving these two that holds the entire movie together.With all going on in this movie, the extreme violence, the sexual innuendos, the perhaps question of is this a movie being marketed at kids to young (reference the colors) and whatever else I find it funny that critics take exception with the foul language (and one word in particular) uttered by the Hit Girl character. With everything else going on a single word is what the critics focus on? Perhaps they could've cleaned up her language some but they didn't have anything else to say about the movie? Chloe Grace Moretz will be known for this movie. She will undoubtedly go on to a great career in movies if he continues barring a really bad bomb of a future film. Perhaps I'm not alone in thinking that a Hit Girl centered movie would be a great idea, but would it be a sequel or a prequel? (I'd vote for either) The problem though (and probably why you'd have to go with a sequel) is that Ms. Moretz made this film almost two years ago when she was only eleven, and as seen most recently on the Tonight Show plugging this movie, now at age thirteen she's really grown and changed from her character Mindy ""Hit Girl"" MacReady. I applaud her for being a child star but wanting to skip the age appropriate, pop-corn fluff that is usually written for children and saying to the motion picture industry that kids and do action also.The only real problem I had with this movie was Katie, Dave's crush and ultimately to become his girlfriend. From crush to girlfriend is fine. But she sends Kick Ass to talk some sense into gang members causing her trouble and they don't explain how an innocent enough looking girl has some kind of relationship with a den of drug dealing gang members? Talk about a hole in your script and a lack of detail.KB",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Good Movie,"I loved it because, this lil girl can really ""Hit"" bad guys. Lotsa action...I gave it a 7 because they could have done more with ""Big Daddy."" If you like just plain old violence and killing, then this movie would be it. Really no story, just gratuitous ""Ass Kicking"" by a 12 year old girl... Loved it...lol Kick Ass really doesn't sell to me. He could have done a little more with his character other than being a lame somewhat of a super-hero crime fighter vigilante with really no skills at all, who by luck happened to appear winning at a losing battle in the early part of the show. He could have done a little more with his character, but I guess it's supposed to be a comedy too. It was an okay movie, the only real thing I liked about this movie is ""Hit Girl"", and her action moves. She was really good. I wouldn't want my daughter to have her foul mouth, but I wouldn't mind her being able to protect herself and have the confidence and ability to conquer like she does. Good movie, could have been a better story. I don't really know which age group this story was for in the beginning, but with a title like that, and the pure adrenaline violence and foul language...It isn't something you would take your 12 year old daughter, or even so to go see...Strictly adult content.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

This movie pulls no punches in terms of violence and dialogue, especially when you watch a 12-year old girl slice up gangsters like cold cuts while using language that would make your mother cringe. I'm not sure who played Kick-Ass in this movie but Michael Cera and McLovin don't have the awkward teen market cornered anymore.

Kick-Ass is a really funny movie,This movie is very funny and good. The humor is well done and delivered very well by the cast. The story itself is also very interesting. I had a lot of fun watching this movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This movie brings out the hero in all of us!,"Need of escape of the real world? Try comic books. Need of a local super hero? Count on Kick-Ass! Here you have a teen named Dave Lizweski (Aaron Johnson), quiet, awkward, invisible to girls who has an obsession with comic books. He lives with his father, after his mother died at the breakfast table, he descends into total silence with himself. It took some reading of comic books which would make him something interesting; a superhero. But his friends thinks he's out there. Maybe. But one day when he and his pal get robbed, Dave goes into this mode that changes his persona for the better of mankind: Kick-Ass. When he meets the same thugs, he gets attack and stabbed. The second time, he becomes a sensation of New York. After that, he inspires more people to become a superhero. A father(Nicholas Cage) and his daughter become HitGirl and Big Daddy. Hit Girl was total bad. She kills without remorse and so does her sidekick father. The result of that; police corruption that lead to his wife's death, and his imprisonment by a corrupt detective(Xander Berkley). When the heroes collide against the thugs, it's a blood fest waiting to happen. This movie has plenty of action, plenty of comedy, and plenty of crudeness which is not surprising. If you want to live your inner hero, check out Kick-Ass!! 5 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of my favourites,"This movie is pure awesomeness. I have no idea why I love this movie, but it is just so enjoyable to watch in all aspects. I watched it countless times now and it gets better each time. I seriously have no clue what makes this film so great. All I have to say is see this film for yourself and experience the awesomeness of it.No feelings can be explained in this film, they can only be felt. It is like falling in love, where we feel a warm gut wrenching, heart breaking satisfying feeling linger within us. We don't know why and we don't know how, but something is just phenomenally right. I don't know what else to say.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Not worthy of all the buzz,"This film tells the story of an ordinary teenager, Dave Lizewski, who sets out to become a real-life superhero calling himself Kick-Ass. Dave gets caught up in a bigger fight when he meets Big Daddy, a former cop who, in his quest to bring down the evil drug lord Frank D'Amico, has trained his eleven-year-old daughter to be the ruthless vigilante Hit-Girl.Whenever there's a lot of hype an buzz around a film, I always tend to be suspicious. When there's so much talk about a film before its release, that is usually due to extensive marketing and publicity by the studios and not an indicator of the film's quality. In fact, most of the time, a lot of hype means a shallow and low quality Hollywood blockbuster (i.e. Avatar).And that's precisely the case with Kick-Ass. A somewhat entertaining film but at the same time extremely flawed.Despite an original premise, the story couldn't be more predictable,it's almost insulting in fact. The dialog isn't that great either and most characters are caricatures.There's also an awful lot of over-acting. As a comedy the film fails miserably, most of the jokes are incredibly plain, simple and above all, very, very silly and it doesn't help that the film shifts tones constantly. What's to enjoy? A few well done action scenes and some of the interactions between Hit-Girl and her father.I'm sure some people will be offended by the strong language used by Hit Girl, after all the actress playing the part was only 11 years old at the time Kick-Ass was being filmed but to be honest, I don't think anything she said is too offensive. In conclusion, the film is decent enough to be watched until the end but I think it is a very poor effort and a film you should probably skip. Definitely not worthy of all the buzz.6/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kicked Butt,Kick Ass definitely kicked some butt. An unexpectedly good action film that takes a slightly funny and creative approach to the typical superhero movie. It was entertaining throughout and each character/story line had its own development that ultimately all made sense and connected by the end. The action was pretty solid and the comic relief was needed and a great addition. The acting was also pretty good and the characters were all likable. I would definitely recommend this movie as one to watch. IMDb does need to get rid of this character minimum though. Its way too excessive and unnecessary.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Amazing !!!,"Amazing is what I think about this movie right now.If truth be told, Matthew Vaughn's 'Kick-Ass' has given us a new edge in the comic based movies.Actions are fast and gritty still it has the essence of some comic relief in between to have some light moments.The story is simple, where a regular teenager round the block decides to be a super hero calling himself as 'Kick-Ass' and faces the reality of what it takes to be a 'Hero'. Circumstances changes when he comes across vigilante father and daughter team who call themselves as 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit Girl'; who clean the streets by killing the men working for powerful drug Lord Frank D'Amico. Well... I will not go into any further details because it surly will give away the plot and I don't wish to do so for those who haven't seen this movie yet.Aaron Johnson as 'Kick Ass' has really done a great job, but the main lure for this movie is Chloë Moretz as 'Hit Girl'; she is simply awesome. Nicolas Cage as 'Big Daddy' or rather the side kick had been perfect and revived himself in a much better way than what we have seen in his earlier title at 'Ghost Rider'.Remember 'Sin City' this movie too has lots of profanity and violence; no doubt this got 'R' rating but I will not at all be complaining because this movie has offered us exactly what we wanted to see.The soundtrack is also soothing and by the time the credit rolls the song 'Kick Ass' by Mika will be lingering in the mind for quite some time. This movie is surly not to be missed. So far 2010 start has offered some good movies, apart from 'Shutter Island' I can say 'Kick- Ass' can too join the league of success.I don't know whether any sequel will be upcoming or not but as a stand alone title this will unquestionably win the universal movie goers heart and support.This movie really KICKS ASS!!!! In every literal senseWell ""Shut Up. Kick-Ass"" :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Corny hack version of a children version of kill bill,"Not sure how this got good reviews, the acting was just pitiful and the lines and storyline corny and just all over the place. The characters were not well developed, the attempt at some kind of dark and subtle humor came across more like a bunch of script writers who could not come up with anything good. Not sure what Nicolas Cage was doing in this movie, but he needs to stop making movies.They tried to pull off a kill bill type film but failed horribly. If you are going to pay for a movie ticket just go see something else and come in and watch the final fight scene with the little girl, that was the only thing mildly entertaining and it only lasted about 10 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

It's a very darkly humorous movie and if you find a 10 year old slaughtering gangsters then don't watch the movie and go give it a bad review. The cinematography was great the acting was good and the screenplay was funny and very real. Some of the characters are very relatable and the movie isn't so unrealistic that it ruins the movie.

Best film I've seen in aaaaages,"I went to the cinema to see this film last night with my friends, and to be honest we picked it because we turned up at the complex quite late and this was the only showing we could see. But I love it when this happens - you go to see a film you knew nothing about, and you come out so grateful for having seen it! It was the funniest film I have seen in ages. One of those films where the time literally whizzes past because you're enjoying it so much. Every scene was comic in one way or another, and the action scenes were great. Not only did the film contain comedy, action (including lots of violence and swearing) there was also some emotional scenes in there, as well as a great deal of teenage angst. Fab. Seeing it in a packed cinema was awesome as well, as the whole cinema was either laughing together, or making noises such as 'oooh!' or 'ouch!'. A great soundtrack, fantastic scripting and a really original idea for a story. Go see this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A well done film worth seeing.,"The naysayers missed the point and context. This movie is NOT for kids, the R-Rating is proof enough.Hit Girl is an awesome movie.. er... I mean Kick-Ass. The positive comments say it all. Well done film that gets so much right that it is easy to overlook the very few minor flaws. It is based on a comic book, so some artistic liberty is allowed, yes?The character Kick-Ass is well developed and is the one person who ties the whole movie together. The main storyline is more about Hit Girl and Big Daddy. The theme is created by Kick-Ass and his vision of people standing up for what is right. The movie has a noticeable Tarrentino influence. It does quote other movies and mocks it in a dead pan style that does not say, ""hey we are mocking this film now"". You have to catch the references.Was a little disappointed in the turn out on a Saturday night of the opening weekend. Probably 60 people in a 850 capacity theatre. It may be a late bloomer or a sleeper in the theatres. It is worth seeing on the big screen. Very entertaining and has some good funny moments. There are a few jaw dropping moments when you say, ""no they did not just do that"". It has a few surprises that will make you laugh or cringe and chuckle. The few obvious set ups on what will happen next won't make you feel disappointed (oh boy that was predictable), but you will find yourself wanting to see how it turns out and anticipating the next scene or twist.Well done with good chemistry among the cast. The tempo, editing, cinematography, writing, and directing mixed very well together. It is one of the better films, technically speaking, that has been out in a while.The first 15 min of character development pays off in the last 30 minutes of the film. It makes you cheer for the main characters. The sound track makes it fun. The ending does set it up for a potential sequel, but not in an annoying way, the plot lines are all tied up. Normally I would not see a movie twice, but this one would be good to see with a group of people. It will be fun to discuss afterwords over dinner or coffee.See the film and decide for yourself. Don't take the kids. Bring friends.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Pointless violence for sociopath teens.,"Dave Levinsky is one of those lame teenagers who spend 99% of their times jerking off, and the rest of time reading comic books. He soon starts fantasizing about becoming a superhero vigilante under the pseudonym ""Kick Ass"". Unfortunately his high expectations are not supported by superpowers or extraordinary capabilities.After an appearance on TV, David ""Kick Ass"" is contacted by 2 hyper-violent vigilantes, which are of much higher level, and are doing real harm to the local drug mafia. Indeed, those 2 characters do not hesitate to use the most deadly weapons, or to even sell drugs, to fight the crime their own way...This movie is very disappointing. It is marketed as a teenage movie, with a blend of American Pie, Superbad and Spiderman. Sadly, ""Kick-Ass"" ends up being not so funny, and becomes a tribute to heavy gun violence and self-justice and broken ethics. For example, the 2 superheros resell drugs to fund their armory, which is not what you would expect from ""good"" guys. Did I mention, those 2 superheroes are father and daughter, the later (11-year old girl) skipping school to practice guns and kung-fu?The film production is also deeply disappointing, the screenplay is minimal, the special effects being very visible and exaggerated. The acting is very poor, you can hear laughs in the auditory when Nicolas Cage is narrating the death of his beloved pregnant wife. The ""bad"" guys have absolutely no presence.Finally like many recent blockbuster movies, the director makes sure to keep one the bad guy alive, in order to leave the door opened for a very profitable sequel (Kick-Ass 2 is already scheduled for 2012).To be avoided. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
From no powers comes no responsibility...except...that wasn't true,"If you wanna here's a review entered by an unlucky Italian who had to go to England to watch this movie because in Italy it has not been released yet (I think it won't never be) because of the great costs. Well, at first I'd say that in the last years I've always been let down by a lot of movies which seemed quite interesting but which never impressed me. Maybe because of trite plots, maybe because of the lost passion for cinema of the directors whose interests concern just money, because of the dammit sequels and so on... I was praying God for not being let down even by this movie and...He realized my wish. OK, I'm pretty mad I had been travelling for two hours by plane but...it was WORTH! Then if I say so I think you have probably already understood how I thought this movie was. The first thing that leaps to the eyes is characters. I completely fell in love with Kick Ass, Hit Girl and overall Red Mist (I could be gay for him lol). The plot, even if it concerns a super-hero story, it's different from the traditional ones 'cause here everything's real (you may see youtube, played songs that really exist in everyday life, and the REAL kick-ass comic book) and it's not so exaggerate as traditional ones: no superpowers, just the normal strength of (quite) normal people. Special effects are worth of a special mention overall for fighting scenes (I love Hit-Girl ""parkour"" and her acrobatic actions). I am just disappointed because of the fact that a lot of fantastic movies are often not published in many countries and that's a great pity. I won't add anything more, I just say if you haven't watched it yet, DO IT!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Awesome!,"This is an almost perfect movie (I say 'almost' only because I don't believe there could ever be a perfect movie).Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are the Batman and Robin analogy of your dreams with Big Daddy's - at first strange, then very captivating - take on Adam West, and the very human and complex relationship they share.But then all the performances are dead on, and everyone involved really seems to know their comic book stuff while making this movie very accessible to everyone. I feel sorry for the Iron Man franchise, it's great but it was beat by The Dark Knight, and now Kick-Ass.This genuinely feels like how it would be if superheroes existed in the real world, but with much awesomeness. A touching, exciting, extremely well made film that surprises you with every turn. My favourite film of the year. Kick-Ass.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

(for those who seen it). this movie isn't Hollywood at all and for that reason is why I'm such a huge fan of it. the director of the movie gathered all the funds himself because it was turned down by 7 studios, who thought it was a little much. honestly WHO CARES.. its a movie, and its not like these people will actually go out and do it. the movie overall, is exactly as put.. its ""kill bill meets superbad"".I recommended that people go and support this movie, for it is art and these people put their hearts and souls into it. you will not be disappointing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever,"This comic book made into a movie is not only the best adaptation I have ever seen but is a fantastic movie in its own right. If you think about movie characters in general as being somewhat one-dimensional by necessity, it stands to reason that comic book characters do not suffer by being brought to life. Indeed, a comic book is already more or less a screenplay waiting to be made into a movie. So what does Kick-Ass have to offer? Great major and minor characters, excellent dialog, a sense of humor and a lot of guns. Somewhere along the way you will be drawn into the story line which, even if somewhat predictable, nonetheless will have you on the edge of your seat. Has it ever been done before? Sure, but what movie hasn't? There is nothing new under the sun.

"Does This Movie Kick Ass?   Yes, mostly.","A few dozen films come out every year that are hyped up to the point where you hear about them at least 20 times a day up until their theatrical release. ""Kick-Ass"" is definitely one of those films. I was excited to see it, but I tried desperately to keep the preparation to be disappointed just so not to be let down. So without reading any reviews beforehand (which, for me, was like being on a deserted island and trying not to think about water), I kept this question in mind before and after the movie: Does ""Kick-Ass"", in fact, kick ass?There were things I loved about ""Kick-Ass"", most notably the story. The best way to really enjoy this film is if you know as little about it as possible, because the film has so many plot twists that would be shocking enough had it not been for the violence in this film. I'm a big action film fan myself, and there was seldom an action sequence in this film, aided by special effects or not, that didn't make me flinch. If you know nothing about this film going in, you will be entertained by the action alone, provided you're not faint of heart.I also love the premise of this movie, which was really well executed. I liked the idea that despite comic book movies being the biggest box office draw of the last decade (if you don't count ""Avatar"" (2009), although that could have been based on a comic), very few real life people really have tried to be super heroes. There's a great dialogue in the beginning between high school geek and Kick-Ass to be Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) and his comic book loving pals (Clark Duke and Evan Peters) about why no one has really tried it in real life. They delve beyond the obvious reason (i.e. because no one really has super powers), and make some very good points that also remained hilarious.Dave, despite not being athletic in the slightest or knowing any fighting skills of any kind, somehow becomes motivated enough to buy a green and yellow wetsuit online, and use that as his superhero costume. Without giving too much away, he never really wins a fight, but becomes a YouTube sensation, attracting the unwanted attention of a mob boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), and perhaps the wanted attention of real life superheroes Hit-Girl (11-year-old Chloe Grace Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage).It's when this father and daughter team come into the story that the film delves into unpredictable territory and enhances the story. A lot of controversy has been made about Moretz's language in the film. Truth be told, she only says about three or four swear words throughout the film. Some reviews I couldn't avoid made her out to have Joe Pesci dialogue. Truth be told, the scenes where she's killing people are far more intense than her PG-13 language. Overall, though, Moretz was a welcome presence on screen whose was well developed as a character and exhibited a lot of charm throughout the film. She was funny and unexpectedly warm in ""500 Days of Summer"" (2009), and she's the same in this movie on a different level.I also didn't expect to like Cage's character as much as I did. The scenes between him and Moretz are never dull, often times funny, and surprisingly poignant even when he shoots her point blank in the chest (you have to see the movie). Cage really could have hammed this role up to the extreme, and given that he wears glasses in this film, I half expected him to use that annoying nasally voice he used in ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" (1986). Fortunately, his performance in this movie was over the top enough so much so that you still cared enough about the character. There's even a great scene that's animated comic book style which gives the background of Cage's character. Once you see that scene, which tells an awesome story in and of itself, your sympathy points are hooked on Big Daddy and never let go.Soon enough, another faux superhero falls into the mix, namely Kick-Ass' high school acquaintance Chris D'Amico, who becomes Red Mist by night and is played by Christopher ""McLovin"" Mintz-Plasse. As much as I thought Mintz-Plasse was funny in films like ""Superbad"" (2007), I felt like here he was miscast. There's a twist to his character that you learn not from watching the previews, but one quarter of the way through the film. His character is important and adds to the story, but I found myself not knowing whether he was supposed to be funny or not, and neither did the people who were in the theater with me. I felt as though the lines he spoke that were meant to be funny fell flat, and the nasally voice that worked for him as McLovin felt out of place here. I didn't feel he was meant to be a nerdy character in this movie, and he just felt out of place. Another actor could have played him better.Revealing more about this film would take away the sheer thrill of it. Skip the reviews (except this one, of course) and go see it. There is seldom a dull moment in this film. The violence is very graphic, but always contributes to the story. The acting is very good so much so that you care about all the characters. I thought a few lines felt flat and uninspired here and there, but I recommend ""Kick-Ass"" because it kicked ass for the most part. It's violent and vulgar in many areas, making its R-rating well deserved. It's still entertaining as hell without succumbing to mindlessness, and should be viewed on the big screen. I recommend it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Old hero in a new costume,"The mood was elevated in the cinema house when I saw a pre-release of this movie the other night. People were at several times applauding the screen. I'm not sure, because I was heading out for the restrooms, but people might have been doing a standing ovation during the credits.So what do I know, right? I got a similar reaction to District 9 which was a movie that people were overwhelmed with, despite the fact that it really had not one single new concept and no real impressive sign of originality to match what people had been saying. District 9 did for the sci-fi genre kind of what this movie, Kick-Ass, is trying to do with the superhero movie I think. District 9 was still a good film though. I don't think Kick-Ass is a particularly good film. And I doubt people will hail it as a masterwork of originality.The plot of the movie: Nerdy high school guy becomes famous superhero, fights street thugs, teams up with high tech gadget doctor (sic), takes on an evil empire, in this case a drug lord, they fight, get caught, fight, get caught. Big booms. Oh, and yeah he gets a girlfriend and all of that too. The movie is stylish and flashy and consistently self- apologetic, the beginning of the movie starts out with such a distance to the superhero genre that you almost believe you are watching a spoof. A kid wants to become a superhero, calls himself Kick-Ass and gets dressed up and starts walking the streets. As it is said in the movie, he should change his name to ""ass-kick"" because that's all he gets. Thus he joins the likes of Blankman and the Mystery Men. Kick-Ass, though, is the first superhero pastische that people seem to like.Or so I thought halfway into the movie, before the forty minute mark or so when it gets all carried away in itself, leaves spoof land and invisibly attempts to raise it's own stakes. Suddenly you are expected to care for these characters that have been presented as stereotypes. I mean, take it somewhat seriously. This is in particular strange; Nicholas Cage is being hysterically good as a daddy training him and his ten year old girl to become superheroes. Are they any good? Uh-huh. The kid is the movie's real showstopper. This is the first ten year old you've seen that can cut a head open whilst emptying up humanity's worst vocabulary along with the ammo of her automatic weapon. Cage is also all dressed up with. An. Adam West. Imp. Ression. That is. Quite amusing. In... Deed?But there comes a time when the movie wants me to simply buy these characters emotionally and somewhat realistically. I buy them as jokes, as parodies, as an outrageous bloody comedy. But do I have to consider that this would be an actual kid and that this would be her actual dad? Am I suppose to believe this fairly far-fetched idea of a local superhero getting famous over the Internet? And why should I care? And if this plot is worth actually devoting your serious interest in, why does it start off like some kind of realistically laid out spoof? Kick- Ass begins with a world that makes a deal of how real it is, life's dull and normal circumstances and how a self-made superhero gets stabbed in the guts. But it all ends up with dodging bullets and flying in jet-packs anyway. I did enjoy the first part of the movie, it was basically a very amusing take on the superhero genre which is getting pretty tiring by now anyhow. But the most ironic thing about Kick-Ass is that despite the visual costume, it turns out it really is just another superhero movie. It really offers zip to the genre. It wants more than anything else to be what it is making fun of. The plot is intended to be taken seriously, until it stops and makes fun of itself, then continues, then stops for a joke. It really does resemble a little kid dressed as a superhero, making the story up as he goes along.Now I know what you are saying, isn't this just simply a lot of fun? Oh, I'm using my brain again? This isn't a thinking man's superhero movie? I should just shut up and enjoy the violence? Well, I don't know, that is something I cannot do. It's been a long time since I was impressed solely by bright flashy things and a lot of blood and guts. I might be getting too old for this bleep.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Original, Funny and Very, Very Violent...","I saw this film when it first came out in the cinema and really enjoyed it. This week it came to our TV screens in a slightly cut version (about 4 minutes shorter than the theatrical release) but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of it. It was one of the best films I saw last year and the filmmakers will have to work hard to beat it again this year! If anything, I enjoyed it more second time around (if that's possible!). But enough of my prattling on, here's a short summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please practice swearing with Hit Girl while I write the next paragraph).Dave Lizewski is an average teenage school kid, he says he has one superpower, he's invisible to girls. He and his friends, Marty and Todd, are into comic books and after hanging out one evening they are mugged by a couple of scumbags. It seems this is not the first time this has happened and Dave is getting a little fed-up with it. He goes online and gets himself a costume, a green wet-suit. After a bit of self-training, he decides he's ready and 'Kick-Ass' is born. He decides to confront the two muggers who held up him and his friends but things don't go well and he ends up having his ass kicked. After recovering in hospital and being screwed together with metal plates he finds his nerve endings are a bit damaged, which means he can take a bit more of a beating than before. Meanwhile, a real Superhero known as 'Big Daddy' is training his eleven year old daughter, 'Hit Girl'. They have a grudge against crime boss Frank D'Amico who framed 'Big Daddy' some years before. D'Amico's son, Chris is disillusioned with his father and decides to become a Superhero himself, called Red Mist in order to lure Kick-Ass out of hiding. They blame Kick-Ass for some losses they have been suffering recently. Kick-Ass eventually gains notoriety when he beats up three guys picking on another guy. The fight is filmed and put up on the internet, bringing a lot of media interest in Kick-Ass. Dave is also noticed by Katie Deauxma, although she doesn't know his secret identity, and thinks he's gay. I won't say too much more, but needless to say all of these various characters are destined to meet, and when they do I'll have to leave it there or I'll be having a knock at the door from the 'Spoiler Police' (& I don't want that).I must first say that it is a really well made film with some excellent stunt work. I thought the music chosen for the score was really great as well. Excellent performances from all of the leading cast, Aaron Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cage as Damon Macready/Big Daddy, Chloe Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl, Mark Strong as Frank D'Amico, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist and Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma.There is a lot of humour in this film, both spoken and visual. It's also very very violent, so I wouldn't recommend it to those of a nervous disposition. I don't usually enjoy teen comedies, but this is very original, very different and it's very refreshing to see a film that pushes the boundaries somewhat. It's a film that any superhero film fan should try to watch at least once a year and I recommend it very highly! My score: 9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Big Daddy and Hit-Girl own this film!!,"Kick-Ass. When I first saw the trailer when I was at the th eaters, viewing Sherlock Holmes with a friend, I wasn't too sure. At first glance, with the original green band trailer, I felt that it would be a comedy that would fall flat in the likes of Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, those who came up with the horrible Epic Fail (did I just say fail? I meant Epic Movie), with the okay Meet the Spartans and this bad disaster film, Disaster Movie. Eventually, my friend invited me this weekend (opening week-end) to see Kick-Ass, and since I just had a bit of money to spend, I sighed and said ''Why not?''. So, Saturday night (I went on Sunday), I you-tubed videos of Kick-Ass, and looked especially at the red-band trailer. And that's when I knew it was going to be a hell of a ride.For those who have only seen the Green-band trailer (Which is horrible, by the way and does not do the film justice), Kick-Ass seems horrible. Thankfully, the horrible parts of this trailer only appear in the first fifteen minutes of the movie (at one point I felt like leaving because I thought I had just been fooled. Everyone in the auditorium seemed to be laughing when this dude crashes on top of the car, except me). But I am really glad that I did stay to see this film. The typical teen dilemma that happens surrounding Dave (Aaron Johnson) feels highly realistic (and yes, I am a teen, therefore I could relate a bit to Dave when he wasn't wearing his Kick-Ass costume).The actors were all pretty good. Aaron Johnson is convincing enough as Dave, and Mark Strong is also awesome (except I felt like I had seen him do better in other movies, for instance, Sherlock Holmes). Christopher Mintz-Plasse, whom most of you will recognize as McLovin, from Superbad, has a terrific performance as Red Mist, whom I will not spoil too much on. But the main performances I felt were awesome were Nicholas Cage (Big Daddy, a.k.a Damon Macready) and his supporter, Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz, a.k.a Mindy Macready). I couldn't understand where all the controversy surrounding her character, because when I was her age, my friends and I would cuss frequently and play war and kill many people in different manners in our heads). Hit-Girl got many laugh out louds from both the audience and myself, whereas Big Daddy had the most awesome scenes. Heck, I felt like watching an action movie whenever Big Daddy was on screen.Big Daddy's scenes were the best because whenever Nicholas Cage would wear the costume (basically a look-alike of Batman's costume), you would feel his intensity (Big Daddy does not fight every criminal, only the ones he feels interfere with his cause, because he has a specific cause). The music chosen in the background could create with any scene either an atmosphere of intensity like in the warehouse scene where Big Daddy kills a lot of bad guys, or a comedic atmosphere, like Dave most of the time when he does not wear the Kick-Ass costume. Nicholas Cage is also incredible when it comes to creating many funny moments with his daughter Mindy. Their chemistry works perfect.Story: Dave is a teen who does not know why nobody has ever tried to be a superhero. He buys a scuba suit off the internet, and decides he will become Kick-Ass, a crime fighter. Eventually, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), a mobster, hears about Kick-Ass, he decides he will try to stop him once and for all. Kick-Ass meets with Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, and they all team up to fight D'Amico. Perhaps the best thing about Kick-Ass is that it's different. Nobody has ever really tried to make a real, laugh-out-loud comedy based on superheroes. The actors work perfectly, the style is different, the laughs come and go all the time and perhaps the best is the way the action scenes were filmed. Perhaps Kick-Ass is a bit too early to be called a blockbuster yet but if Kick-Ass were to open the blockbuster season, I can definitely predict an awesome summer. If you are fan of hero movies such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Watchmen, etc... then you will find a few winks here and there. Long live Kick-Ass, and I definitely hope for a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Nothing you expect but everything that you want,"Kick Ass serves up the goods in an original and raw but stylish and well executed manner. The first trailers seem to downplay the intensity of this film but make no mistake, Kick Ass is as intense and gutsy as they come.This movie that will make you cringe, laugh(a lot), smile and overall feel thoroughly entertained. It's loaded with superb action sequences, raw violence, engaging humor and just plain awesomeness. Every character is well developed and the acting is excellent. Chloe Moretz steals the show but every actor is spot on with their performance.My advice would be the less you know about this film going into it the more enjoyable it will be. So if you like action and comedy and can stomach graphic violence and crude humor this is a must see. Don't watch anymore trailers just go see it!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
America the sick......................and getting sicker!,"I cannot begin to convey the depth of chagrin one feels when reading the reviews about this movie. The film is being hailed as a masterpiece and the next great painting that hangs in The Louvre. America is a sick nation. Mentally. Spiritually. Culturally. And it's getting more ill as time goes by. The deterioration has been rapid. Due to the now rapid dissemination of information, the problem is that the rest of the world will follow.I exhort, nay, I beseech all normal people and especially parents around the world to resist this malady that is seemingly omnipotent and omnipresent. I make this plea to you because the internet now allows export of this malady to all corners of the globe effortlessly. The malady is in the form of acculturation to deaden our senses to violence, feminism, devaluation of parents and debauchery, and this malady is what currently governs American thinking.Resist in your minds the temptation to be overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Resist in your hearts the impulse of accepting these deleterious, inane movies, as real films, simply because they are being touted as being made by the United States.This film is one thing only: Evil incarnate. I say it again, unequivocally and without hesitation. This movie is evil. And I urge all governments to ban it forthwith! ""There is nothing truly good or bad, only that we make it so."" - A liar made this statement long ago when the world was still able to distinguish right and wrong. Perhaps that is why he never gave his name to this quote.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Does this film Kick-Ass? You bet!,"Kick-Ass is one of the most original films to come out in years, particularly in the superhero genre. Forget Batman, Spiderman and Superman. Kick-Ass is the new hero in cinema. Aaron Johnson played nerdy Dave desperate to be a superhero though he has no ounce of powers and is just a normal fifteen year old as he asks how far would go to protect someone you don't know being hurt? Would you stop to help them or just look the other way? He's also longing for a beautiful girl in school called Kate. He teams up with Hit-Girl, a very cool and superbly acted part played by Chloe Moretz and Big Dadddy, Nicolas Cage (seriously) dressed up like Batman with the exact replica voice of Adam West to take down a drug lord played excellently by Mark Strong who also has a son who dresses up as a hero calling himself Red Mist.Chloe Moretz steals the show in my opinion as she is the one who truly kicks ass, taught by her dad to shoot, fight and kill with swords (grown up men!) This is a fantastic film that takes you by the balls and takes you on a roller-coaster ride of your life. All expectations of what you think this film will be like is thrown out of the window. With a superb script and acting. (Nicolas Cage being back on form after his less than average performances of recent). Kick-Ass is so outrageously daft in a brilliant way making it deliciously daring and absolutely hilarious and it dosen't pretend to be otherwise as it makes great fun of itself. The action sequences are also crafted with an expert eye. My jaw dropped when I first saw it. It's that amazingly done. But be warned though it is funny it's also extremely crude and violent so if you don't like guts steer clear.The movie is intelligent in my opinion with such originality and daftness. Kids becoming superheroes with no powers! I absolutely loved it and Matthew Vaughn knows how to keep the pace of the film going, not by endless expanded scenes but keeping the characters moving and transitioning the film from romance to action to comedy and drama ceaselessly which is no easy task. There is the definite possibility of a sequel on it's way. If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? GO!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Verdict: 'Evil'?!!,"From out of nowhere comes what could possibly be the most vibrant, satirical, subversive comic-genre movie since Paul Verhoeven's 'Robocop'. This very violent, and very funny, superhero romp's cheerful exterior is littered with booby traps that will sucker punch you into submission.Superbly adapted by director Vaughn and co-writer Goldman from Mark Millar & John Romita's graphic-novel of the same name, this razor-sharp concoction of comedy and bone-crunching action takes bang-on-target swipes at the Youtube/X-Factor generation to deliver a timely snapshot of this (seemingly) never-ending, reality-TV/Celebrity obsessed era.Johnson's no-mark, schoolboy wallflower turned angst-free costumed crime fighter with no purpose/powers, is a welcome breath of fresh air to this over stuffed genre, as real life repeatedly crashes in on his Spiderman attempts at super-heroics - ie: he gets seriously, seriously hurt.But the fun really begins when he finds himself truly out of his depth when he unwittingly locks horns with the real deal: Cage's superb Batman send-up 'Big Daddy', and the much hyped, controversial, murderous tot - 'Hitgirl'. Add Mark Strong's vicious hoodlum and pseudo-superhero son 'Red Mist' (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to the colour-coded mix, and you have one of the most engaging and entertaining bunch of characters to waltz across the screen since 'Superbad' (which this movie draws favourable comparisons with).And finally, any piece of celluloid that has the Daily Mail's resident, right-wing knee-jerker film 'critic' (Christopher Tookey) foaming at the mouth about it's 'Disturbing' content, has got to be a serious contender for movie of the century!Verdict: Awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Legendary Cinematic Experience.,"Kick-Ass is one the best cinematic experiences I will never forget. Period... Now onto the review!The story of Kick-Ass is quite simple yet extremely original that makes for a fantastic movie going experience. The film takes the concept of a Bruce Wayne, or a Tony Stark esquire concept and projects it in a literal form. It asks the question: what would happen if an average Joe...or teenager in this case would pose as a masked vigilante and decide to fight crime? The main character in this film, High School comic book geek Dave, played by the wonderful Aaron Johnson, decides to put this question to the test and decides to pose as Kick-Ass. His motive for this task as I said before is to answer the inevitable question and decides to stand up to crime when other people don't. When taking on the responsibility of Kick-Ass he finally gets a chance to fight crime against three hoodlums. When fighting them a crowd is gathered around a fight filming Kick Ass with their camera phones, Youtube Gear what have you. This video of Kick Ass fighting crime causes a Youtube sensation and gains much popularity. Little dos Kick Ass know though, that he has just entered a realm of other masked vigilantes. These other crime fighters are Big Daddy played in prime form by Mr. Nick Cage. And Big Daddy's daughter Hit Girl, which is a surreal performance by the new young comer Chloe Moretz. These two vigilantes have a mission themselves to stop a local Drug Lord in town played by Mark Strong(whom by the way is the main villain) who Bigg Daddy has personal beef with. Something i wont spoil. Oh and how could I forget the hilarious Red Mist played by the charming Mclov'n himself, Chris Mintz Plasse. All these characters and stories tie in a very clever manner that is blast to sit through.So what do you get with Kick-Ass? A movie that in my opinion is one of the only movies I have ever seen to coming close to perfection. Call my boasting propaganda but I seriously have no complaints here. This film has essentially everything that makes a film enjoyable; great directing, great writing, great acting, and memorable characters. Sure the story has no real deep intellectual moral behind it aside from telling to stand for others when others don't, but it's how this story is told about a few characters whom we come to love and care about. We care about their actions and we feel connected to them. Vaughn has somehow grounded this film in reality yet takes us on a journey larger than life. And succeeds in doing so. So in summary what is Kick-Ass? It is simply put the best super-hero movie ever made if not one of the best movies ever made in general. Period.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
I wanna be a superhero!,"I went to see this afternoon and wow this kicked ass!! It was fantastic. It was fast, funny and very entertaining. The pace of the film was spot on, i was never once looking at my watch/phone, I was glued. The comedy was spot it, it was so funny. The kids in the film, to be fair there is only the girl i would say qualified as a child but they were fantastic, what a great set of young actors and the young girl she was spot on too, I loved her. Nick Cage as always was great as the dad. I cant say anything wrong about this film at all. I enjoyed it so much. Yeah there is a lot of violence and swearing so if your offended then stay away. But it isn't misplaced and fits in well with the film both in a serious and comical way. The final scene when kick ass really does kick ass is just thrilling and I do hope the way they left this means there will be a well written and put together sequel, a film as well written and put together as this. I really want to be a superhero, if kick ass can do it, so can I.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""Kick-Ass"": They're Not Who We Thought They Were","""Original"" and ""Unconventional"" seem to be the common words used to describe ""Kick-Ass"". The movie climbed to the number one spot in the box office opening weekend, climbed up the prestigious IMDb Top 250 Movies of All Time, and has climbed into the hearts of moviegoers across the country. Unfortunately, all of this, especially the premise of the movie itself, is completely misleading.A painfully mediocre high school student wants to make a difference in his own dull life and in the violence-ridden streets of his own city. Our antihero wants to become a superhero. The story starts off on the right note, getting us engaged and bringing on some good laughs in the process. He has no revenge story, no Martial Arts training, no money to get a hold on any cool gadgets. However, what begins as an ""unconventional"" and ""original"" superhero story, takes a turn and becomes the same typical, cliché, and generic superhero story it intends and claims to drift away from.By some freak accident, he acquires a damaged nerve system that significantly decreases the sensation of pain, and even gets some cool metal plates integrated into his skeleton. Cool! Like accidentally getting bitten by a radioactive spider.Then he meets Bid Daddy and Hit Girl. People love Hit Girl, and what's not to love? She's an 11-year old kid who can say bad words, dodge bullets, and kill a dozen bad guys at once. People say this movie has no gimmicks. An 11-year-old kid who can say bad words, dodge bullets, and kill a dozen bad guys at once is a total gimmick. Big Daddy is a supercop with a vendetta and Hit Girl is his daughter who has learned everything a supercop knows. They have a revenge story, and even have a ton of money which allows them to buy a bunch of fancy new weapons. Cool! Just like Batman.Sure there may be some entertainment value in it for you, (if you're into a couple masturbation scenes and an 11-year old girl getting shot at) and the acting is convincing enough, given the ridiculousness of the story. The movie only falls short in being something other than what it claims to be. ""Kick-Ass"" is not ""original"" (see Blankman) and is not ""unconventional"" (see Spider-Man and Batman).The last I checked, at the bottom of the Top 250 List was ""Toy Story 2,"" which is more than a hundred spots short of the place ""Kick-Ass"" landed so quickly. If you want to see a movie that's a hundred times more original and unconventional than ""Kick-Ass"", see the movie that's at the bottom of the list.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Greatest ever ""Super-hero"" movie??","Went to see this the other day after months and months of waiting...I had wanted to see this since the first time I read anything about it. I had it hyped up big time in my own mind, especially after seeing the amazing reviews that it had already got on IMDb.I think it's pretty safe to say that I was not disappointed by this film. I loved it. Kick-ass is a great character and is played well by Aaron Johnson. Christopher Mintze=Plasse was great as Red Mist and I didn't think about 'McLovin' at all when watching him. Chloe Moretz is a great young actress and her portrayal of Hit Girl was just amazing! But my personal favourite character was Big Daddy...Nic Cage was wonderful in this film...right down to the way he spoke like Adam West's Batman when he was dressed as Big Daddy. Brilliant.The film plot was great too, we all want to be a super-hero right?? I know I have thought it at some point! This film takes that and puts it into a reality...well, in a movie, but you know what I mean. The actors played their roles really well, the young ones still acted like they were young even when they were trying to kill bad guys...showing fear at times and being strong when they needed to be.The only problems I had with this film...I had hyped it too much in my mind, sometimes the soundtrack didn't work with certain scenes of the movie and at times it was a little slow paced for my liking...but that didn't take away from how great this was.All in all this is the best film of the year so far.

"Brilliant, funny and action packed.","I went into this film half wary, too many films in recent times have shown promise of being funny new age epics but fallen so short of the line. I was in no way disappointed here.The film builds up the main character very well, as a nerdy teen who just wants to get along, but is constantly hounded by bullies and embarrassed in social situations. It shows how he hates people for not getting involved to help others, how people just stand by and how this motivates him to become a super hero. The film goes great lengths to connect you with him.Then we have his nemesis introduced as a boy who just wants his fathers approval and is willing to do anything to get it, and prove himself. This comes out brilliantly later in the film.Then introduced are Hit Girl and her father Big Daddy, they are introduced in a way which shows their determination and portrays them as humorous and bad-ass.All the characters in this film are amazing, and the action pieces keep you on the edge of your seat and amazed. Plus the use of soundtrack is almost to perfection here.

you guys it kicks Spidy in the ass!!,"the reason why I gave this movie a 9 is, because even though the trailer of the movie made it look as if it was a mediocre but funny parody on all the bad super hero movies of our time. It was actually seriously KICK ASS.The movie was refreshingly good and has a 10 for originality and had a better plot than most super hero movies(batman was still better of course). The plot was really cool because it mixed complete absurdity with realistic events and even tough the whole movie was unrealistic you really get sucked as if your a little kid looking at your first action movie ever. but the action and violence in this movie is better then in any other SHM(super hero movie) I have ever see.

A rare occasion of a film living up to its name in a good way. Kick-Ass is the most fun you'll have at the cinema in 2010 - –you'll want to watch it again and again.,"Kick-Ass is the best film you will see this year – a lofty claim with not even half of the year under our collective belts, I know, but it has already blown everything else in 2010 out of the water. Don't read this review – go see it now. But if you need convincing, then read on.What if superheroes were real? Or, more accurately, what if ordinary people were so inspired by fictional heroes that they decided to become ones themselves? After all, as narrator and protagonist Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) points out, villains are certainly real enough.Dave, a 17-year-old New Yorker, is the poster boy for mundane. He claims his only superpower is being invisible to girls, especially long-term crush Katie Deauxma (Lyndsey Fonseca) and that he's not even the funny one among his friends. He's an easy target for muggers and bullies, and hates how no one seems willing to stand up for anyone else.After one injustice too many, he decides its time to take action, and sets about turning himself into a superhero, with the aid of eBay and MySpace, dubbing himself the optimistic Kick-Ass. But it's YouTube that really does the trick, when a video of an unexpected victory goes viral and propels him into the hearts and minds of disillusioned New Yorkers. While Dave has just a handful of MySpace friends, Kick-Ass has 16,000 and counting.Unbeknown to the budding superhero, however, there's a more dangerous game being played, between crime lord Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and father-daughter vigilante duo, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz). When one of Kick-Ass' deeds lands him in the middle of the real action, he has to decide whether to give up his one-man quest for justice or join he big ""boys"".Kick-Ass is like so many films, yet entirely original. Dave and pals Marty (Clark Duke) and Cody (Dexter Fletcher) – and their quest for girls out of their league – wouldn't be out of place in Superbad. The makeshift costuming is reminiscent of Mystery Men. A number of conversations could have been inserted into Pulp Fiction. But it all comes together smoothly and inventively, adding up to an emotional roller-coaster – hilarious, thrilling, tense, romantic and exuberant, sometimes all at once.Set in a real city with realistic characters, the film walks a fine line between plausibility and outlandishness – but it pulls it off as skilfully as a Cirque de Soleil acrobat on a tightrope. It earns its jaw-dropping moments, from a return from death to a superhero flying as high as a skyscraper.This is mostly thanks to the fresh writing and fast pacing – and the surprisingly spot-on casting. I was doubtful the dreamy Johnson could be the geek Dave was meant to be – it seemed as if they were going to remove his glasses to reveal Superman perfection at some point. But I needn't have worried – Johnson has excellent comic timing and immense likability. The glasses do come off, but Dave stays true to his trajectory, becoming heroic in a believable way.Furthermore, Johnson's nasal narration enhances the film, as he delivers self-deprecating observations and clever pop cultural nods – at one point he reminds the audience not to be so confident about his fate, as narrators can talk from beyond the grave, as in Sin City and American Beauty.Even Strong (last seen in Robin Hood) as yet another villain won me over and Cage was on good form, allowing the spotlight to focus on his younger co-stars. After her sparkly turn in Hot Tub Time Machine, Fonseca again proves herself to be an entertaining love interest, while Christopher Mintz-Plasse, as Frank's wannabe ganger son, proves an ideal foil for Kick-Ass.But the true star of the show is Moretz, to whom I award the title of Least Annoying Child Star Ever. Hit Girl is what you would get Kill Bill's The Bride raised Leon's Matilda. I foresee little (and big) girls dressing up in purple wigs and kilts for Halloween. Hopefully they'll forgo the switch-blades.Besides Hit Girl's profanity, the gore is likely to incite the most controversy. One especially gruesome incident involves a man in an industrial microwave, and the body count is through the roof. Still, it doesn't feel unnecessary – the violence either serves to heighten tension or has artistic merit.In fact, Kick-Ass does much to de-glamorize violence. Dave, as Big Daddy observes, might have done better to name himself Ass-Kick, as he's often the one being beaten. The characters feel real enough that when they are attacked, it's truly visceral and horrible – their bruises and aches don't disappear with the next scene. And the issue of Hit Girl being raised as a fighter is intelligently addressed.Among the film's other highlights are the energetic soundtrack – Mika, The Prodigy and Gnarls Barkley feature – and incorporation of comic book graphics, especially in one stunning sequence that explains Big Daddy's back-story, again tying the fantastic back into reality.What the film succeeds most in, though, is its thoughtful exploration of what means to be a hero. The answer may surprise you – especially as the answer won't be the same for every viewer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

I hated this movie,"I can see how ""Kick-Ass"" is gonna be popular...but, then, I can see how ""Transformers 2"" could be popular, too. Now that that's out of the way...If you're someone who thinks it might be a lark to watch an 11-year-old corner a defenceless woman and stab her twice through the chest, this movie might be for you. There's also a scene where she puts a guy in a trash compactor and we watch for a couple minutes as he's squished to death. The guy wasn't a character before this scene (and I don't remember what relevance he has to the movie), so we're not watching the payoff to a joke, we're just watching...a guy getting squished by a trash compactor. The brutality of the scene is immediately undercut with the 11-year-old employing some nasty profanity, an easy joke that'll get an immediate reaction, doing away with the conflict I imagine (hope?) a lot of the audience will be feeling after the scene that preceded it.The premise is: real people trying to be super-heroes (not a bad idea - I liked it in ""The Dark Knight""). Dave is a comic book geek modelled, I assume, on most of the movie's target audience. He actually bears a closer resemblance to a Michael Cera hero, but, I'll get to that later. Anyway, he likes comic books, he decides to start ""fighting crime"" (which is always just around the corner in these movies) so he orders a suit and goes at it. He's not very good, and his friends make fun of him for the idea.Meanwhile, an ex-cop (Nicolas Cage - very good) is turning his young daughter (the 11-year-old) into a cold-blooded killer, for our benefit. They're playing out a revenge scheme against the movie's chief villain, a mob boss played by Mark Strong. The plot in this movie sometimes feels like math: setup + action = payoff. Actually, that's exactly what it feels like. It's supposed satire is constantly undercut by its rigid obedience to its own formula. Since we can already guess, roughly, how everything will play out, I don't know why ""Kick-Ass"" spends so much time explaining itself.When you hear the premise - real people trying to be superheroes - it sounds good, but watching this movie makes you think there are really only a few ways to handle it. There's ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Iron Man"" way, which is, more or less, taking it seriously. Or you could go for a satirical/darkly comic tone, which this movie tries for. If you were to do that, the best way to handle the violence would be to make it convincing, wouldn't it? Since, as the movie opens, it seems to make itself very clear that it doesn't take place in some phony superhero world? Instead, people get shot, they fall dead and CGI blood squirts out. You've seen one guy squirt CGI blood, you've seen 'em all - and it happens over and over again. The violence in this movie packs no punch, it's thoughtless and, supposedly, fun!, which makes it all the more disheartening when it's directed at the defenceless woman.So it wasn't a very pleasant experience for me. Shift it an inch one way and you could've had a nice dark comedy (something by the Coens). An inch the other way you could've had a clever action movie (Crank & Crank 2). ""Kick-Ass"" is like a cautious kid, skirting the deep end without having the nerve to stick his toes in the water. It's not ballsy enough to take the father/daughter relationship to the logical, risky conclusion that it demands. It's not smart enough to question the motives of its boring protagonist - he's, basically, good (and he gets the girl). It's not original enough to offer us any ""evil"" that's not the cartoon kind we've already been tired of seeing in thousands of others movies. It's sense of humour is on the level of a disturbed child who likes to use swear words - which is one of its favourite jokes.I said the movie's about real people trying to be superheroes. Not quite. It's about the ""real people"" you see in Hollywood movies, becoming superheroes. The ""real people"" played by Michael Cera or Shia LaBoef or Miley Cyrus. The ones who live in a glossy, safe world where they get what they want in the end. In this case, it's to have sex and kill a bunch of people. That could make for a great joke, except that, like those glossy Hollywood movies, it doesn't have the confidence to get you to actually think about it.4/10 (Three points Nicolas Cage, one point Clark Duke.

The first five star film of the year. Contender for best film of the year,"I have to say that this film will get some peoples backs up, certainly the likes of certain media outlets who seem to have an agenda of stirring up anger and blaming life's complex shortfalls and problems on films as if they can't imagine a problem without an answer (or at least a problem with many different answers) anyway rant over. This film is absolutely unequivocally the best film I have seen since Inglorius. It's clever, funny, brutal, and geeky sometimes all at the same time. There are some great in-jokes (Adam west) and some beautiful visuals. Defo a 9 out of 10 movie for me, I am sure it will find it's way into the IMDb top 250. All I can is just see it for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Perfect. A Must-See,"My top movies include Dark Knight, V for Vendetta and now Kick-Ass. I'm not a huge comic book fan, but they do tell great stories and their graphical nature translates beautifully on screen. They make excellent screenplays, and Kick-Ass is exemplary.Kick-Ass differentiates itself from all the other graphic-novels and the movies thereafter. It's funny and it's action-packed, but the great thing is that this isn't a story about superheros. It's a story about someone who says, ""Enough is enough."" Kick-Ass is tired of people standing by and watching others become victims. Instead of helping, people whip out their phones to make a YouTube video. Fear. It consumes us. For Kick-Ass, his fear takes a back seat to naivety and wishful thinking. Thus a ""superhero"" is born.The other great thing is this isn't a kid's movie. It's rated R. Rightfully so. Even though there's GREAT comedic content - this movie is hilarious - it also has serious, gritty, adult content. The only reason to take the kids is to show them that being a superhero is no picnic. It's definitely not for everyone. I was surprised by the amount of violence, but it's nothing today's kids can't handle I suppose...It takes every fiber of my body to not dish out the fantastic detail, but I want to keep this spoiler-free and let you enjoy this great film - the first must-see movie of the year and one of my new personal favorites.I also review chick flicks @ RatedChick.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
I Got My Ass Kicked,"when i seen trailers for kick-ass i thought it was just the same old run of the mill teen comedy with super hero twist i really thought it was going to be a flop BUT due to the recent crappy weather i decided to check it out and guess what i could not have been any more wrong about the film.Kick-Ass starts of with Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) the typical unnoticed high school comic geek who fantasises of becoming a super hero. Dave sick of his unnoticed life decides to create an alter ego called kick ass and with very little training kick ass heads out to fight crime with positive and negative results on the positive side he shoots to fame on the internet and the negative he gets his ass kicked quite a lot.We are also introduced to characters such as son of a mob boss Chris D'Amico / Red Mist or mc lovin to superbad fans (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who really shows he can act when hes given the chance and crime fighting duo Mindy Macready / Hit-Girl and her father Damon Macready / Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) in my mind one of Nicolas cages better performances.my overall opinion is that kick ass is a truly great film it had the right amount of style,action,comedy,good story progression,likable characters which all together made a very entertaining movie.i simply cannot recommend this movie enough it really is a breath of fresh air from the crap that cinemas have been showing recently.so if your looking to get ass kicked by a good movie kick ass is that movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Absolutely amazing fun, kicks ass!","Wanted to see Kick Ass and after reading some of the reviews about how shocking it was, I just had to see it for myself. Some reviewers in the UK concentrated on the Hit Girl character. They seemed to forget she was character in a movie and there was some moral outrage over her.I like to judge movies for myself and bad reviews don't put me off going to see a movie. I had waited ages to see Kick-Ass, it had been out for a while but the theatre was packed.This is an amazing movie, exciting, interesting, very original script, brilliantly executed and also very funny. There were many laugh out loud moments and many other awesome moments. The actors, mostly unknown, apart from Nic Cage do a fantastic job.The real star of the show is New York, it provides a perfect backdrop for the action. Did I mention a cracking soundtrack? Well, it has that as well.My partner and I both loved the movie and we don't often agree on which movies to see. We left the theatre on a high, both of us being throughly entertained. There has to be a sequel! For a great night out, I would recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Great movie...,"Kick AssThis quirky American film took another boring hero movie into a ""kick ass"" movie. They showed how you don't have to be a superhero with super powers to help someone out. The characters were well matched up with the actors, and the costumes were phenomenal for the roles of heroes, a old Joe trying to save the world. Aaron Taylor Johnson had a role that with the movie it would evolved into something bigger and he did a great jobs demonstrating it, and Hit girl or Chloe Grace Moretz really kicked some ass. She proved that for being just at the beginning of her teenager years she can be an magnificent actress, and according to big daddy a great daughter. This movie not only covers all aspects of the movies but it also transfers a good message, this movie was definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
way too gruesome violent and exploitative to children,"its a shame that Americans have become so desensitized that we find it not only OK to have children murdering people in movies, but also cheering it on. Its really disturbing. I walked out of this movie cause I was repulsed and felt duped. the advertisements are VERY misleading, making it seem like children gain confidence and become super heros standing up for good things. I was way off. Instead its a ten year old girl killing anything and everything for no reason and doing it in a bloody and torturous way. Why people enjoy this? I have no idea. The only crowd I could actually see enjoying this would be the same Neanderthals that watch that fake wrestling....total insanity if you ask me. I was just looking around the theater in shock of all the kids that parents had taken with them and how the most bloody and sadistic acts didn't seem to even phase anyone at all. nothing seems to bother anyone anymore, not even children. what exactly do you gain from this movie besides naseau? thinking that its funny and awesome for children to murder people and to not need a reason....really positive contribution to Hollywood/slumville. movies have gone WAY down hill. scared to know what it will be like in 10 years....F",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Delivers on the promise of its title and revitalises a tired genre,"The premise of the movie isn't actually exciting for an adult...a movie about child superheroes? Sounds REALLY lame. However, watching a movie review TV show here in Australia it was mentioned that this movie is very violent and the male reviewer expressed concern about the scenes with the young girl superhero. Righto...this could be interesting!Kick Ass is a pastiche of movie genres...it has an indie cinema vibe to it early on (think ""Juno""), a teen sex comedy element (think of any number of American movies where teenage boys try to 'get laid'), adult comic vibe (superhero movies with 'dark' themes and scenes, like the all time classic ""Watchmen"") etc. And it all works very well together. You'll see scenes and be able to cross out stylistic 'borrowings'...be it ""The Matrix"" or the experience of playing a first person shooter video game (like ""Doom"", say).Anyway, the movie starts off like it is going to explore what would really happen if anyone tried to become a superhero. The reality is very violent, so it's not a movie I'd recommend for pre-teens. Sure, it has elements that would appeal to them, but the contrast between childish notions of superhero-dom and the 'reality' is very marked and unsuited to younger children...there's some confronting violence in this movie...by characters such as Hit-Girl and towards her character, for instance.Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass and is appropriately geeky as a wannabe superhero/lady's man. The movie contrasts a geek-boy fantasy of being a superhero with 'real' superheroes. In this way the movie is reasonably novel...the crowd after a 'pure' superhero movie may not be so much into these parts of the story.As for the real superheroes in this movie, Chloe Moretz (as ""Hit-Girl""...looking like a very young Dame Edna Everage!) is the REAL Kick Ass superhero. Recently superhero movies have been disappointing me...especially sequels (Transformers 2 is a big let-down). Moretz transforms and revitalises the genre with a vivacious performance. She has a really bright aura around her...whereas Batman was a dull character in The Dark Knight, overshadowed by Ledger's brilliant turn as ""The Joker"", Hit-Girl makes for an exciting heroine. And all round, this movie is superior to The Dark Knight...take Ledger out of that movie and it suffers for the loss. The incongruity of Hit-Girl (a pre-pubescent girl) in the superhero genre has really killed my fatigue with the genre. Getting a bit paternal, it would be great to see Moretz become a poster girl for climate change scientists or quantum mechanics...but hey, a career playing Hit-Girl would impress people more, I suspect.It should be noted though, that Hit-Girl uses very strong language, which is another reason this movie is unsuitable for very young children...perhaps. You could say that either Hit-Girl swears like a policeman or that she brings the language of the playground into movies. Of course, there was the similarly young Regan in ""The exorcist"", but her language was attributed to demonic possession...Hit-Girl can't blame supernatual entitities for her potty-mouth though...which is why it's embedded in realism.Speaking of Batman, Nicolas Cage channels Michael Keaton's Batman at times, in his role as superhero ""Big Daddy"".Was thinking of giving this movie 10/10. I'm sure that this movie will have great repeat viewing potential, but I'm just marking it down one point for the bits of pastiche that aren't as exciting as the comic book showdowns...I mean all that geeky stuff.In a way, the prospect of a sequel for this movie is very exciting...be great to see more of Hit-Girl. However, this is such a great fun movie you wonder if creating a sequel would sully its legacy...I doubt if I will see Transformers 3...the first sequel sucked so badly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"very silly, very violent but very good","I read the graphic novel and wondered how this would flesh out on the big screen, and it works very well, a lot more funnier than than the comic, which I didn't expect, plus the dark humour works well, for a super hero action film in this, which is rare, only Hancock managed too pull this off.At least it's not as bloody and violent as the comic itself, which is worth a read, get the hardback version. One of the films of the year as it's so crazy but it works. The costumes are accurate, simple and not really unbelievable, and plenty of guns, and weapons the like that Batman would never use.What makes this are the performances, Nicholas Cage is brilliant, his dry wit makes his character memorable, Mark Strong is topper too.We have Iron Man 2 and Prince of Persia, game to movie adaptations up next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Kick-ass,"I saw half of the film on HBO several months ago in the hotel room and it became another unfinished business which had been gnawing at me until yesterday I eventually watched it from A to Z, and my response is that it's really a kick-ass to all other major film studio comic superhero franchises!I don't intend to put a stance to appreciate this film just to feign that my heart is still as young as a schoolboy. I love this film from the bottom of my heart and I emphatically believe director Matthew Vaugh has done a stupendous job which almost alter the entire formula of the corny genre and what's more worth a round of standing ovation is that the film is killingly entertaining as well!Hit-girl is predestined to become a cult idol along with the film itself (and its box office fiasco is a bonus), the controversy she created has becoming a sensational impressiveness which stuns the youngster generation and some maturer age group like mine. A 12 year old slaughterer with an innocent loli's face and mind, which may not be original but definitive provocative, and the gratifying yet unsettling part is Chloë's steadfast-cum-innocuous performance, killing only could be such fun in a morally nontoxic way which a film is able to manifest and I can sense the surreal zest pervading in the air!Kick-ass (an unostentatious Aaron Johnson) by comparison, is a more empathizing character, which is also dealt with some realistic impetus to allow viewers to judge it by a more rational afterthought, a true hero never need the shield of ""super"" power, all one needs is training and proper equipment, a pragmatic truth (it's more convenient if you are as filthy rich as Iron Man or Batman).The film and the directing definitely crack into my top 10 list of the year and Chloë is among my top 3 supporting actress in 2010 as well. Also I feel a bit belated compassion that Matthew Vaugh's forte didn't been fully brought into play in the X-MEN: FIRST CLASS this year as sadly few could substantiate his true color under the mainstream Hollywood sway, especially for those newly-recruited.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Modern Classic,"Watching the trailer you may think ""yeah this could be a pretty funny comedy about super heroes but maybe all the funny bits were shown in the trailer"". WRONG!This is a very funny film but it is not a comedy, in fact it is very hard to put your finger on a genre that this lies in. I would probably call it a comic book, comedy, action movie but there's one thing for sure, that this movie will excite you beyond belief. It is one of the most pure adrenaline fuelled movies i have ever seen. So much so that there was multiple time where i just wanted to jump out of my seat and cheer in the middle of the cinema. This is not just because of the brilliant action sequences but mainly due to the fact that you have become completely attached to the characters and you are so happy that even though they have been through a lot they are totally ""KICKING ASS"".It is the character development that does this film the most justice, this is due to great script writing and equally great acting. You feel like you know the characters so in that respect the film can really play with your emotions by making you want to either cry or cheer when something substantial happens to one of the characters. All of which are great, one surprise was the character of hit girl who provided most of the laughs and winces thanks to her outrageous behaviour, her violent action sequences and her brilliant characterisation.The bottom line is you will enjoy this film. I can imagine when this comes out on DVD it will be one of my most watched films and it makes you wonder, why has no one tried to be a superhero before?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Don't Miss Out,"Kick-Ass lives up to the hype, and offers a whole lot more. With its cutting satire on the superhero genre, it has wit in abundance and packs a comedic punch that is unrivaled by any superhero film to date.Last years Watchmen did its best to portray super-heroes in an everyday world, however its main flaw was its lack of connection with the audience. With Kick-Ass set in the modern world, it has a platform to provide great social commentary and really engage the audience.Case in point: Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), our superhero, is propelled to internet stardom thanks to a little help from Youtube. Once he becomes famous, other masked vigilantes begin to reveal themselves. The plot may become a little obvious once the main details are in place; however the way each scene is executed is refreshing and exhilarating.The acting from the main cast is top notch, Chloe Moretz who plays Hit-Girl deserves a special mention. She does steal some of the best moments, but Kick-Ass, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Big Daddy (an on-form Nicolas Cage) all have their moments too.So while it may be a little cliché to say this film kicked ass, there's no other way of describing it that does it justice. It's a welcome addition to the super hero genre; don't miss out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Other than the girl, the cast was really good too.It was fun to see a super hero movie different than many of the others.Looking forward to a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-Ass easily lives up to its title.,"High school nobody and avid comic-book fan Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) decides to stop just reading about super-heroes and begins living the dream, but with no special powers, zero fighting skills, and a distinct lack of high tech gadgetry at his disposal, life as a self-styled crime fighter is harder than he imagined—particularly when hunted down by major-league bad-guy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and made to feel totally inadequate by the real-deal, crime-fighting duo Big Daddy and Hit-Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz).Kick-Ass is the perfect wake-up call for any comic fan who has ever toyed with the idea of donning a mask and taking to streets in the name of justice (don't tell me you've never imagined yourself in a cool spandex suit with natty matching cape!); rather than painting the fight against crime as a glamorous pursuit, the film graphically displays every ugly detail of life outside of the law and shows what might easily become of anyone foolhardy enough to take on vicious criminals without the proper training (eg., entire childhood spent in a monastery practising martial arts with mystical monks). Brutal stabbings, cold-blooded shootings, and chilling torture are all shown in unflinching detail, making the film a genuine eye-opener (especially for those who might have mistaken this sucker for a light-hearted action/comedy romp).What is even more surprising than Kick-Ass's ultra-violent content, for me at least, is that it was written, in part, by Jane Goldman, and directed by Matthew Vaughan, both of whom were also responsible for Stardust, a film so contrived and cloying that I would dearly love to erase it from my memory. Here, the pair redeem themselves fully, providing their audience with just shy of two hours of pure awesomeness that constantly delights with its witty, thoughtful script, and endless adrenaline-pumping action scenes (accompanied by a effective score and killer soundtrack).On top of the remarkable script (based on the comic by Mark Millar) and flawless direction (love the first person shooter style used during one scene), the film also benefits from a stand-out cast, all of whom deliver pitch-perfect performances: Johnson is both likable and believable as the idealistic teenager who turns his life upside down by following his dreams; Lyndsy Fonseca is simply mouth-watering as Katie Deauxma, the object of Dave's desire; Nic Cage puts in yet another seemingly effortless but extremely memorable performance as vengeful ex-cop turned masked avenger Big Daddy (Cage has a blast in his role, even mimicking Adam West's Batman speech mannerisms); and the amazing Moretz regularly steals the show with her confident turn as lethal, 11-year old killing machine Hit Girl (if this promising young actress doesn't go on to be a MAJOR star in the future, I'll eat my cape!).If, like me, you've grown a little tired of formulaic, big-budget, SFX packed super-hero flicks, I highly recommend checking out this alternative take on the genre, 'cos Kick-Ass easily lives up to its title.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Super Lock Stock and Three Smokin Batmans,"Dave Lizewski is a comic reading, invisible to girls, High School geek. Who has a dream to become a superhero, although there is one problem...he has no revenge mission, super powers or training...but he does have a scuba suit! He embarks on a mission to help fight crime as the superhero Kick Ass and in one night, as a civilian films him fighting a gang of criminals, he becomes an internet phenomenon. This prompts the world to take notice, including other superheroes Hit Girl and Big Daddy and the evil gangster Frank D'Amico and his son who realises the benefits of creating an alter ego.This is an excellent film jam packed with energy, jokes, action and great dialogue. The film starts out as a teen comedy in the vein of Superbad but quickly goes darker. Director Matthew Vaughn's history has been in gritty English gangster movies and this really shows through in the middle of the film. Genuinely nasty characters doing nasty things could quite easily be at home in Snatch or Layer Cake, make up the baddies for our superheroes to battle against. As soon as we are introduced to Hit Girl (an 11 year old knife wielding little ninja), her father Big Daddy (a betrayed ex cop looking for revenge) and Red Mist (the baddie alter ego of Frank D'Amico's son) you really start to feel you are watching a superhero movie. There are some great comic book references and they really help to remind you this is a superhero movie as at some parts the action is good enough to be a stand alone gangster flick and the jokes good enough for any comedy.Aaron Johnson is great as Kick Ass as he is geeky enough to warm to but edgy enough to be credible, Christopher Mintz-Plasse fresh from McLovin in Superbad is also great as Red Mist and Nicholas Cage is understated and as he plays the revengeful Big Daddy. But the show is stolen by Chloe Moretz as she plays the truly brilliant Hit Girl. I don't think many non animation films have featured such a young assassin and she certainly takes centre stage and is played brilliantly.The film crosses three genres of teen comedy, gangster movie and comic book superhero, a sort of 'Super Lock Stock and Three Smoking Batmans' if you like. I'll give you one bit of advice, you need to watch this film, it's cool, energetic and really slick. I can't wait for the sequel planned in 2012.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"""Kick-Ass"" - No superpowers?  No problem.  But he can still kick your a**...","""Kick-Ass"" is probably the most illogical logical comic book superhero movie ever made, and I say that in a good way. ""Kick-Ass"" takes the idea of the costumed superhero to its illogical, logical extremes by presenting us an everyday teenager named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), who takes his love of comic books a little too far and decides to become a real-life superhero, donning a costume out of a diving suit he bought off the Internet (eBay) and becoming embroiled in a deadly mob war as a result of his costumed theatrics.And thus begins ""Kick-Ass,"" Matthew Vaughn's over-the-top, if not totally stream-lined (and dare I say, slightly ""sanitized""), adaptation of the comic book series created by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. for Marvel Comics, under the company's Icon imprint. I've read the first volume of ""Kick-Ass"" comics in preparation for this movie and while I think the comics were way better (largely because of how vulgar, over-the-top, satirical, and violent the comics were), the movie is not half-bad. In fact, it's very good, despite the many red-flags it's raising.I laughed. My friend who was sitting beside me laughed, too. I laughed as blood and bodies hit the floor. I laughed as bad guys died horrible but fitting deaths. I laughed as a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughtered bad guys left & right. (Yes, you read that right, a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughters bad guys left & right.) I laughed at all the inappropriate times (there never is a real ""appropriate"" time to laugh at all during this picture.) I laughed at the utter insanity and absurdity of it all. (I laughed more-so at the comics, but that's a different matter altogether.)Lizewski, like most superheroes in their ordinary civilian lives (such as Peter Parker/Spider-Man), is not popular with the girls, is the target of bullies and street muggers alike, and is a nerd who reads too many comic books. Despite not having any superpowers (he wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider and he's not a refugee from a dying alien planet), it's nonetheless a wonder that he soon dons the Kick-Ass suit and makes a name for himself by taking down a trio of gang members. A bystander records the action on his cell phone and uploads it to the Internet, where it goes viral and Kick-Ass becomes an instant media sensation with a legion of devoted followers and copycats, such as Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, of ""Superbad""), who soon takes to the streets as Red Mist. And that foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl I was telling you about? Her name is Cindy Macready a.k.a. Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz), who is waging a deadly father-daughter war on organized crime with her father Damon/Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), a conflict that Kick-Ass is inevitably drawn into against his better judgment.""Kick-Ass"" is a deliriously entertaining, if overly violent and totally un-PC superhero flick. The movie shows the ""real world"" of superheroes and the logical consequences of their actions, which can include serious bodily injury and death, as Our Hero Kick-Ass quickly finds out. (And I thought My Hero Peter Parker/Spider-Man had it rough.) While I disliked some of the changes (both minor and major) made for the movie from the comics, I can say that ""Kick-Ass"" makes those changes work, including the hilarious nature of Dave's unusual relationship with a pretty classmate named Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca).I honestly can't wait for the sequel.

an appalling movie you don't need to see,"We watched the better part of Hollywood's latest pile of filth called ""Kick-Ass"", before its mindless, gratuitous violence drove me from the theater before it ended. As we went up the aisle to leave, I stole a glance at the dark faces in the theater and wondered if any of them chuckled in a similar manner when they saw videotaped beheadings of abductees in Iraq, where men screamed for prolonged periods of time because it took that long to saw through the bones in their necks. For many of all ages, this has actually become entertainment. Would it take something tragic like this to happen to someone in their own lives before they snap out of their misdirected notions of entertainment? People have become so insulated from reality that they've lost the concept of what torture and killing actually are.I never for a moment understood the appeal of slasher movies and I quit watching commercial TV because it is so permeated with jaded rot, but we all know about today's crime shows that depict the most gruesome killings imaginable, and a wildly popular show that actually glorifies serial killing. Hollywood even made a slasher musical that passes itself off as ""serious"" and ""artful"". But even a repulsive film like ""Sweeney Todd"" had some originality and cinematic virtue, endless scenes of slit throats and splattered blood notwithstanding. But ""Kick-Ass"" had none of this. ""Kick-Ass"" was just adolescent pap that laughs at torture. Nicholas Cage was nothing but a poor portrayal in a used Batman suit. Even more repulsive was corporate Hollywood's device of using a cute, trash-talking hero girl to draw in younger audiences (like my daughter, which is why we went). What it did instead was inspire my daughter to pledge to sell her Playstation 2 and its equally mindless depictions of violence. Not wanting to let a good thing pass by, I handed her instead a pick-axe and safety glasses, and she made the sparks fly off that piece-of-crap ""toy"". She made me proud.It is perplexing how otherwise intelligent and kind people that I know, love and somewhat respect, can be so easily misdirected into believing that moronic filth like ""Kick-Ass"" is entertainment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The Most Fun Movie Experience In Superheroes Genes.,"One of the most satisfying action movies I have seen in a very long time, so good that I actually forgot what other movies I have seen recently.Synopsis: Dave is a typical high school comic book nerd who one day decides to become a super hero, even though he has no powers. Things never go right from the start and only got worse when he got intertwine with the mafia who is out to kill him.What I love about this movie was it bases its story on reality. There are no super power, no nothing – just a simple geek pretend to be a super hero and basically everything that would happen if one pretends they are a superhero.Kick-Ass might not be the most original movie but it is among the best executed superhero movie ever created. I think the R rated really help bringing out the best of its story because it is so intelligence and so violent it is satisfying to watch (really tired to see this PG13 superhero movie).Anyway the casting got to be one of the highlight of the movie with the Hit Girl came out as the most lovable character with her sharp witted sarcasm and her ability to kill. By the end you seriously want more of her. Nic Cage did seriously surprise me here – Big Daddy totally rock! His solo fight got to be one of the best action sequences (Which later topple by a scene by Hit Girl save Big Daddy Scene). Dave (aka Kick-Ass) is one of the most realistic superhero. He is courageous but also very fragile.The movie also comes in with brilliant score and music that fitted perfectly with the mood and tone of the movie especially during the action sequences. I guess it is the good thing when the studio decides someone with great vision do the movie. Matthew Vaughn really turning himself into one of the most sought after director in Hollywood.Overall the movie fulfills my every expectation. One of the very few action movies that managed to do almost everything right. Totally fell in love with it.Recommendation: Yes, Get yourself a BlueRay !!Rating: A* Give it a 9/10 for too open ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of a kind genre bending at its best,"Incredible movie, I need awhile to get my mind around the genre bending of the story line.The main characters are your typical Super Bad bunch of nerds, dorks or geeks. The main story line is a tale of revenge with a bizarre mix of characters aimed at the local crime lord with overtones of a Guy Ritchie crime racket (or throw backs to the director's 'Layer Cake'). There is some brilliant black comedy but the main story is very dark and sinister plot involving a crime gang (think Sin City and Watchmen).A multi-layered movie, the director of 'Layer Cake' could well have called it an 'Upside Down Cake'. The super heroes have no super human powers, the real super hero is 11 years old and female, most of the characters have human weaknesses, the cake has some ridiculous looking icing or frosting (music and comedy) and the identities of the heroes becomes revealed to some of the players. Rather than depict super heroes, we see the absurdity of becoming a vigilante to solve the problems of crime. The problem won't be fixed by ""super power"" miracles nor will it be fixed with anarchy or vigilance. Our solution is somewhere within the opposite polar views or within our parameters of choice, but where?The main heroes are Big Daddy (and he was no 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof') and his side kick daughter Hit Girl (and she's no pop-star but a hit-man assassin dressed like a 'Little Miss Sunshine' and loaded with a mouthful of clanger killer lines). Meanwhile the nerds are at work discovering love in all the wrong places.Best part of the movie is the use of music (in totally inappropriate ways): 'The Barber of Seville Overture', playtime was never so much fun with '(Banana Splits) Tra La La Song', Elivis singing Battle Hymn of the Republic (Glory, glory, hallelujah) and 'Crazy' boogied out in a car seat on the way to a crime.It seemed to be mainly filmed in Toronto with scenes from New York to make it look like NY, NY.Highly recommended!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A sorely misunderstood masterpiece,"I am somewhat puzzled by all the negative reviews that Kick-Ass has received. I may be completely misinterpreting this movie, but as far as I can see, this is a tongue-in-cheek and refreshingly self-effacing piece of cinema. There is a gentle but respectful mocking of both the comic-book and action movie genres as well as an astute commentary on the gratuitous violence so prevalent in modern films. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just an indulgent infantile fantasy story with zero taste or subtlety.Kick-Ass would rank as one of the most original and well-executed comedies of recent years, featuring an excellent cast and some brilliant one-liners. Chloe Grace Moretz is a show-stopper but Aaron Taylor-Johnson also gives a great performance with a perfect blend of nerdiness, courage and reticence. There have been very few films in recent years with this balance of excitement, ingenuity and self-awareness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

You've gotta be kidding me,"Get in, sit down and buckle up for one of the worst movies of all time! Words cannot explain how bad this movie is. I don't know how it gets any decent ratings at all. Mix cheesy acting with an almost cliché type superhero movie and you have this. It was literally the worst movie I have seen this year. I was very apprehensive about watching another ""superhero"" movie. But through the reviews on here, and the actors in the movie, I thought I would really give it a go. Big mistake. It's not even worth TRYING to like. And the little girl in there swearing was not even remotely funny. It didn't add anything to the movie except maybe making a bunch of 12 year old viewers pee themselves. Speaking of 12 year olds, how come every male in that movie seemed to have a higher voice then most of the females? I mean it was just gut wrenching sitting there listening to 90 minutes of prepubescent punks whining. I mean I would have rather waited another couple years until they past puberty than listen to their annoying voices.All in all though, I think they really tried to attract an audience of young teenagers. The movie didn't appeal to me at all and I am pretty confident it wouldn't to a lot of adults out there.Now there's no point in revealing any spoilers - if you wanna waste 90 minutes of your life feel free to do that. But i don't even wanna call it spoilers. When u spoil something it means you made something go from good to bad. But this movie isn't good. It sucks! Well, I am threw ranting - it's been a long time since I watched a movie that made me feel like the Angry Video Game Nerd.Happy viewing!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
As apt and representative a title as any,"To paraphrase Zoolander: ""Superheroes - they're so hot right now"". And perhaps it is its chasing such a tide of success that makes Matthew Vaughn's Kick-Ass - part introspective examination of the 'real world' angle of superheroism and part joyful addition to the genre crammed with enough violence and questionable content to gleefully rattle the bars of political correctness - vaguely less remarkable than had it been released five to ten years prior. This is not to say that the quality of an otherwise outstanding movie is lowered simply due to the year of its release date (to fail to appreciate the comedic marvel that is Vaughn's film would be a spoiled audience indeed) but rather that the popularity of the genre which procured a mass release for such edgy material also somewhat does it a disservice in the sense of setting a standard one inevitably hopes the film will supersede, perhaps unrealistically.As such, those anticipating Kick-Ass providing thematic ruminations on the pros and cons of comic book culture and the repercussions of heroism in a 'real', internet age to exceed (or even equal) those of other such reflexive texts such as Watchmen may be disappointed. While the film introduces many such queries, they are often left under-explored, leaving the film feeling somewhat thematically weak as well as not quite managing to 'say' anything exceptionally innovative in reference to its genre.But let's be honest - one would be hard pressed finding the average audience member to lamenting the lack of truly in-depth genre existentialism to the point of ignoring kinetic fight scenes, and such notions as theme, while interesting, feel largely incidental in favour of the film's sense of high-octane fun. Kick-Ass is a film which truly delivers what it promises, from carrying over the glorious carnage and hilarity of its preview material to living up to its title. Nonetheless, as riotously enjoyable as the film is, such a quality does again provide a niggling complaint - the film is awesome, granted, but always just as awesome as one would expect, rather than truly taking audiences off guard or pushing the envelope well past the point of hype. You do get what you pay for, for better or for worse.Thankfully, what you pay for is almost resoundingly for better. Despite a slow start in which the film riffs a touch too obviously on established superhero films (particularly Sam Raimi's Spider-Man), toeing the line of 'Epic Movie' style winks at times, Vaughn quickly finds his momentum and subsequently ramps up the pace, mayhem and fun to satisfying overdrive. With a fascinating colour aesthetic (contrasting the murky greys and browns of the city with the Crayola Technicolour of the heroes) and delightfully whimsical and effective musical score (often setting brutal violence or slapstick humour to classical music, achieving an innovative stylistic deadpan) and a snappy script keeping the tone lively, Vaughn's film demonstrates plenty to love and appreciate.But then come the fight scenes. Whirling cascades of intricate choreography, gritty brutality (particularly Kick-Ass' first attempts at combating crime) and blazing gunfire (particularly jarring for a superhero film) intertwining to become some of the most simultaneously cathartic, uncomfortable yet gleefully fun violent interludes in recent cinema, managing to both mock and relish the sadistic fun of movie violence, and ramping up to one of the most ludicrously enjoyable final payoff showdowns in ages. Kick- Ass could almost function as an exploration of the role and purpose of cinematic violence as much as comic book culture, but whether treated as probing or entertaining, Vaughn's hard- hitting tone is exceedingly difficult to shake or to not enjoy.Particular quality is extracted from the film's magnificent cast, as charismatic rising star Aaron Johnson effortlessly delivers overblown goofiness while remaining intensely likable as the titular Kick-Ass, warmly centring the film whether as exasperated nerd or wide-eyed superhero. Christopher Mintz-Plasse adds a welcome wounded resentment to his customary gawky cockiness as spoiled rich kid superhero Red Mist, and the reliable Mark Strong offers another creation of credibly stern villainy. However, the film's real triumph lies in its unlikely background heroes. Nicholas Cage shreds expectations with sublimely hilarious work as Batman-ripoff heroic patriarch 'Big Daddy', his performance pitched perfectly between manic hysteria and hokey charm (and a voice deliciously pantomiming Adam West's unforgettable fragmented Batman dialect). Equally, Chloe Grace Moretz is a comedic revelation, stealing the show as hard-as-nails vigilante Hit-Girl, and never failing to astound with exactly how far her role will push the boundaries of political correctness. Vaughn also collects a bevy of background players who deliver compelling characterisations for a change, the only exception being Lyndsy Fonseca as Kick-Ass' romantic interest, who, despite a charming performance, feels like an ultimately mishandled and incidental character, decentring the film's emotional arc somewhat.Wild, wacky and daring, Kick-Ass triumphs through managing to dredge up genuine heart, exhilaration and sentiment in the midst of occasional contrivance or excessive convention. A definitive comment on or twist of the superhero genre? Not quite. An enormous array of pulsating, tremendous fun (ultimately the point of the picture)? A vehement and blood- spattered ""HELL YES""!-8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
HK Neo Reviews: Kiss-Ass,"A fresh and innovative take on comic book heroes...Comic Book heroes can be fun and Kick-Ass delivers because it is fun. Without any superpowers, can you be a super hero. The answer to this movie is yes, but on the way to the top, you need a car accident, meet some real life superheroes and some fancy gadgets, then you are almost there. Still, the movie plays with the audience's mind. I am sure, that a majority of you that grown up watching comic book heroes, dreamt of the day – saving the world, killing bad guys and getting the girl across the horizon near the sunset. Such is the simplicity and fun that Kick-Ass generates. They are pretentious, but rather director Matthew Vaughn, combines sleek action, colourful characters, witty dialogue and even a tone of emotional core and in return creating a kick-ass of a movie.Aaron Johnson plays the lead role of an ordinary high schooler, who longs and dreams of one day being a superhero. He is a likable character that never seems over the top. While, it may well be unintentional, I believe that his comic timing is spot on. One scene that catches the eye is when he confesses to the girl of his dreams (played by Lyndsy Fonseca). Nicholas Cage plays a supporting role as the father and a real life superhero, avenging the death of his wife. Sounds cliché, but his character is nothing but cliché. Cage makes his character mysterious and despite the violence that he preaches, one can imagine that only Cage can pull off such a character. However, the highlight of the whole extravagant must be the emergence of Chloe Grace Moretz (the wise kid from 500 Days of Summer). Chloe easily plays a character beyond her age and whether her moves are effects or stunts enhanced or not, she is the highlight of the movie. In one scene, when she entered the evil corporation with a school uniform, it reminds me of Kill Bill. There is no doubt that this kid have potential and rarely can killing one person after another still equates plenty of fun.All in all, Kick-Ass is a great movie. For all it is worth, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the ride. It is light-hearted, fun, bloody, realistic, bombastic and finally true to the blue of comic books. There is even can allusion to John Woo in a question that Cage asks his daughter, but even without that line, the famous 2 handed gun sequences is already Woo enough. Kick-Ass is a kind of movie that you either like it or hate it and luckily, I am the latter. Maybe, I also dream about being a superhero, but till that day, Kick-Ass works for me...(Neo 2010)I rate it 8/10www.thehkneo.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"No fun, even if you don't take it seriously","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningTired of being a nerd who gets pushed around all the time, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) takes his love of comic books to new lengths by donning a lame suit and calling himself Kick Ass. Despite proving woefully incompetent when facing real, tough bad guys, he just about manages to maintain a steely resolve- but after a while the assistance of 11 year old superhero prodigy Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) starts to come quite in handy. But Hit Girl's father and superhero father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) has vengeful issues of his own to deal with and they've all managed to rub the city's top crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) up the wrong way, as things draw to a brutal, action packed conclusion.In a world of genuine artistic vision, where a lot of directors see their work as a labour of love with which they are genuinely trying to convey something deep and meaningful to the audience, it's great and refreshing to see films that just were not meant to be taken seriously at all. Kick Ass falls slam bang into that category, but somehow still manages to miss it's target by about a mile.It's most notable for being from the scribe of Johnathan Ross's missus Jane Goldman (he couldn't give a fair review!) as well as being co written and directed by Matthew Vaughn, who strangely managed a more fun and easy flowing tone with the darker and more serious Layer Cake. Performances wise, Johnson is adequately geeky and self depreciating as the weedy man turned hero and has sassy support from Moretz in the most controversial role in the film as the foul mouthed, multiple killing child. And in the most surprising role of the film, comic book enthusiast Cage lets his zany persona run wild (as he always does!) but still hasn't notched up a decent film. Strong is a good choice as the lead villain, but he'd have pulled it off better being given darker material than the flimsier stuff he has here. The film pays subtle homage to the likes of True Lies and even has a subtle commentary in a scene towards the end on the modern phenomenon of internet torture and executions.Designed with the sole intention of being disposable fun and p!ssing Middle England off, Kick Ass is wild, self referring and fairly slick...it just isn't much fun. The similarly titled Shoot 'Em Up springs to mind for something more worthy. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

I was disappointed to see Nicolas Cage (hands down, my least favorite actor, especially since he robbed Sean Penn of his first Oscar—I mean, ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" REALLY? Anyway, I digress) in this film, but I was satisfied with his fate.

A Kick ass movie!,"Need I say what I said in the summary? Kick ass was funny and graphic as hell, the story main focused on a comic book fan Dave Lizewski who is tired of being bullied around and tired of thinking why people are not super hero's in real life. So he orders a suit online with some wooden batons (it is never revealed where he got them from) and goes out into the night to Kick some Ass!, and it ends up horribly! While on a run he meets ""Hit Girl"" and ""Big Daddy"" they team up only to face a dreaded fate against New York gang owner Frank D'Amico. This movie has the ending that you have to see for self!

"A great mixture of action, comedy and drama","I heard of Kick-Ass for a long time and when I finally got the chance, I saw it. What can I say? I enjoyed this film throughout its entirety. This is a popcorn flick that remains humourous and fun all the way through.Kick-Ass tells the story of Dave, a comic book lover who wants to become a superhero but arrives into trouble with a man known as Frank D'Amico. In a parallel story, two other people want to exact revenge from D'Amico after what he did to them.In our lives, we must have thought at least once how much fun it would be to become a superhero. This simple idea is what makes Kick-Ass so relatable. From the opening, I connected with the protagonist as I shared the same thought. The writing in this film is so good. Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn make the film feel as realistic as possible. The opening also sets the tone. This film isn't meant to be taken seriously and both writers capitalise on that aspect really well. The jokes are hilarious and keep this film from being a bore. The characters are simple but well realised and the motivations for each one makes sense. Vaughn's direction has a lot of style. The action sequences are shot really well and are awesome to witness.The acting is brillant. Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems like a high school teen and portrays both Kick-Ass and Dave well. Mark Strong did a good job as the villain. I always remembered Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fogell from Superbad but he managed to shrug off that label here. The two best parts of the movie hand down were Chloë Grace Moretz and Nicolas Cage. Both of them did a tremendous job with their roles.Whilst the film is very funny and contains stellar action, the first half feels a bit slow but it does pick up during the second half. The film is predictable and towards the end there were some cliché elements but at the same time, there is so much entertainment that you're ready to forgive these issues.Kick-Ass is a wonderful experience. It definitely feels refreshing after seeing the abundance of other serious superhero flicks. The characters are well written, the acting is great, the premise is innovative and is just a delightful, hilarious movie that can be watched many times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
I would vote 0 but 1 was the lowest score you could vote LAME,"this movie is LAME LAME LAME.

I can only recommend this movie to pubescent, horny, raunchy, perverted morons that enjoy watching other guys wack off while they surf porn site ""nipple slip"" (um, grow up please) and talk about ""TITS"" non stop. I guess one area they did excel was insulting the female audience and making some of us ladies squirm at the awkward unnecessary scenes. I think that idiot Eli roth and the national lampoons directors got together and conjured up something like this ""ok guys, what can we think of that is degrading, sexist, gross, and will show the biggest lack of class? hmmmmm"" then they came up with this stupid movie. If you are a big moron, like movies with no substance, many sexist and degrading moments in regards to women, enjoy tit and nipple talk, are a horny pubescent teen who cant get laid other than rubbing your genitals between a playboy magazine and like watching guys jerking the turkey, then this is a must see.

Ultraviolent Shoot-'Em-Up from Page to Screen,"Surprisingly good and rewatchable--I've seen it a few times now. That might have to do a lot with the cartoony violence and the upbeat scoring, including reusing John Murphy's ""Adagio in D Minor"" during the most dramatic shootout. A powerful tune, it'd already played in ""Sunshine"" (2007) before here and thereafter in every other movie trailer. ""Kick-Ass"" is a clever superhero comic-book flick, too, though.We get three superheroes--all of them of different origins. The eponymous one is an ordinary guy and comic-book geek (à la ""Special"" (2006), ""Defendor"" (2009) ""Super"" (2010)) who fantasizes of turning the comic books he reads into his ""reality."" Indeed, coming full circle, he becomes his own comic book--the very comic books that this movie is based on--and serves as narrator to the movie at large. Big Daddy, meanwhile, turns his reality into a comic book, as shown in a novel bit of backstory fill-in. He makes his vigilantism into ""a game."" Both are relatively believable non-supernatural superheroes: Kick-Ass painfully so, and the other's skill may be explained by his being a former policeman and his vendetta obsession--unlikely, sure, but not out of the realm of possibility. Not a teenager swinging between skyscrapers by slinging spider silk from his wrists, not a flying alien shooting lasers out of his eyes, or even a billionaire playboy who's also a martial-arts expert and fights clowns in hand-to-hand combat while dressed as a bat--not implausible nonsense like that.Yet, the third superhero here, Hit-Girl, is born of a comic book. What she does really is impossible, cartoony, and not only a little disconcerting, and she ultimately steals the show. It may be the only defense--and maybe not even then--for the ultraviolent scenes that include depicting a child being punched by a grown man, among all the rest of the brutality and knife and gun play, as well as the lack of distance from sexualizing superheroes in general. Not only that such comic-book figures tend to be physically fit, running around doing cosplay in tights and underwear, or that even some such as Wonder Woman largely began as BDSM, there's also considerable sexual content in ""Kick-Ass,"" around the older, titular teenage character, at least, including his masturbation fantasies and sex with his girlfriend.Anyways, add to the reflexivity some quality mobster baddies and the creation of a reactionary supervillain, the use of TV, the internet and film as surveillance, putting on night-vision goggles to turn POV shots into akin to a first-person shooter video game at one point, and the attending a movie theatre at another, and this is a deconstruction of superhero comic books that may be smarter than it appears at first glance. Even the trope of pretending to be gay to win the girl, as well as the fake Red Mist superhero business, works to double the inherent mistaken-identity theme of superheroes and their alter egos. The cast is uniformly good, including both Quicksilvers, to boot. Besides, something that knowingly ends by visually quoting ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903) by way of ""Goodfellas"" (1990) has a good chance of winning me over.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Death Wish 3 for the in-crowd,"This might be the post modern version of Death Wish 3! It even ends with an unconventional use of a missile launcher which may be a sly tribute to that unintentionally great film.Kick Ass is far less entertaining however. Voice overs are seldom a good idea in movies, and here we have one of the most annoying, full of the endless pop culture references which have become the norm. Nicolas Cage does a funny impression of Adam West in costume but otherwise I don't see why this would be described as hilarious.The violence is among the brutal I've ever seen and the heroes completely unsympathetic. These are actually not superheroes but masked vigilantes and, despite the usual 'ironic' defence, their bloody vengeance is seen as a good, or at least cool, thing. One scene in particular left me numb; this was not the notorious c-word outburst (actually one of the milder things in this film) but seeing a helpless man handcuffed in a car being intentionally crushed to death -by the superheroes!With the sole exception of the pre-pubescent Hitgirl, all the other females in this film are mere sex objects for the gratification of the males. Interestingly, all mother figures are unceremoniously killed off-screen, their deaths being mentioned only in one line of dialogue. KickAss's mum died from cancer while Hitgirl's in childbirth. Neither is shown the slightest degree of sympathy.This lack of empathy to women (or any one) and grotesque violence made me assume that the original author must had been an adolescent. On consulting wikipedia, to my surprise he was in his late thirties. No doubt this is a demonstration of how infantilised our culture has become.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Refreshing take on the superhero concept.,"Kick-Ass is one of the best ""superhero"" movies ever. I put quotes around the word ""superhero"" because it is not your traditional superhero film. The entire concept behind it is very unique and refreshing, the characters are not archetypal at all, the acting is good enough, and the style is very in-your-face. Granted, that in-your-face, overly graphic and profane style will certainly rub many people the wrong way. This is not a film for everyone. The only weak element of the film, and it's also part of its strength, is the ridiculousness of certain scenes and action sequences. I can't know it for that because the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously is also part of its appeal but there are times when aggravation occurs. Overall, this is a great movie that, while everyone won't enjoy, those that do will certainly love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

wanna go fight some crime?,"Well I went and saw this movie opening night on our local mega screen. I was happy that I did and this movie was worth the money. The acting was excellent. I was very surprised with ""hit girl"" performance. Some of the things you see are a little out there but well done none the less. The plot actually had some meaning and depth and turned into quite a serious movie. Nicholas Cage doesn't share too much screen time but when he does it is quite memorable. The music and atmosphere would get intense at times which gave the movie more props. If you watched the trailer you are getting something more than you would expect as that is all I have seen and knew nothing else about it. It contained a lot of teen humor and adult humor. The action sequences and gun fights were excellent. There were only a few moments in the movie where I thought ""ok now this would never happen"" but it didn't take away too much from my viewing pleasure.

Very good movie,"The movie is very good. It's funny, has good action scenes and a ok plot. But like every great movie it has its flaws. The movie should have been longer. Instead of spending 30 minutes on the backstory they should spend 1 hour and 30 minutes on the backstory, so that you can show a little bit more of the other important characters backstory's. Then after that you should take 2 hours to tell the main story so that you can expand it a little bit more. Then after the main plot is done you should take 30 minutes to tell what happens after the main plot. Then the movie is about 4 hours and much better.8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

One of the Best Superhero Movies Out There,"I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie, nor had I heard a heck of a lot about it. It looked like fun, so I decided to check it out.This is easily one of the best, if not the best, superhero movie out there.Kick-Ass is creative. Yeah sure, unlikely hero idea has been used, but the way this movie carries it out makes it feel much more original. It doesn't use the typical Hollywood movie formula which makes it stray from the unoriginality of other movies. It never takes anything too seriously, and when you think you know what's going to happen (thanks to our lovely formula), you quickly realize you don't. That doesn't mean it's completely unpredictable, but it switches it up enough to keep you interested.The movie is hilarious. Enough said.The movie actually makes you care about the characters. It's not just aimless action and humor, you actually care about the well- being of who's carrying you through this 117 minute epic, which is something modern movies often lack. It does something similar to Edgar Wright's 'Cornetto' trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End) in that it develops the characters through humor. And it actually works really well. I wanted to see the characters succeed, over being neutral about it which often happens these days.Overall, Kick-Ass is great. It's original, funny, and inventive with well-developed characters. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to modern superhero movies which makes this one seem that much better, but either way, check it out. It'll definitely be worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Bloody and Funny,"Kick-Ass is bloody, funny, original, and everything you could want in an action-comedy. Aaron Johnson plays Dave, a high school loser who decides to become a superhero, aka Kick-Ass. Aaron Johnson had a terrific performance and really nailed the character. He was nerdy and just a loser in general, and was so funny when he was using his little batons. The other standout performance was by Chloe Moretz, who plays the foul- mouthed Hit-Girl. Her father, aka Big-Daddy played by Nicholas Cage, has been training her to shoot guns, use crazy knife weapons, and just kill people. Chloe Moretz is definitely a young actress to keep an eye on; I read that she went to circus school to train for her role. Overall, this movie is fresh with some awesome action scenes that will make you wanting more. If there is a part 2, you can bet that I will be first in line to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
My 325th Review: Way OTT film for the fans of fast freaky fun....,"A lot of reviewers here are more concerned about others morals than just simply enjoying a film for what it is - if they went in expecting a superhero movie and didn't like le théâtre du grand-Guignol approach should have done their research.This is not a film for dose whose only knowledge of comics and superheroes comes from knowing who and not what Spiderman, Superman are. This is a movie for those who know and have read Sandman and Mus, it's for those whose sense of irony and action is more in the Shoot'Em up, Wanted mould. I didn't find it that ""violent"", though it is, but it is as I said Guignol rather than action thriller, there are OTT bullets and knives aplenty around by the end.The first half is really just about ordinary guy who dons a costume and messes up, but it is the second story of the cocaine mafia and Hit Girl that completely takes over and triumphantly steals the show.This reminded more of the Tick than Superman, it is about a YouTube, Fark generation and it is fun, funny, and hip.Not perfect by any means it is the best action film around at the moment and it full of self-irony and nods to a bunch of post-modern sensibilities.All in all, surprisingly both stupid and intelligent, and well, just plain fun...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Amazing Movie That Totally Kicks Ass,"This is an amazing movie filled with action as well as comedy. The name of the movie basically sums it up ""Kick Ass"". Aaron Taylor Johnson was awesome as Kick Ass and Chloë Grace Moretz played Hit Girl amazingly. There's just something weird about seeing a young girl swearing and chopping people up thats hilarious. Just me? Now this isn't the average movie you would see Nicholas Cage in but he surprised me at how well he play Big Daddy. Based on a comic book by Mark Millar, Kick-Ass follows the story of Dave Lizewski a high school student. Fan of comic books Dave decides to become his very own hero Kick-Ass. After performing a heroic deed Dave is the most viewed person on youtube. Others start to become superheroes including town rich kid Chris D'amico. This is an amazing example of how superhero movies are meant to be made.

"Fun, heart warming,  yet f-ed up!","I thought the controversy behind Kick Ass was overblown, but having watched it, I get it now. I expected to something goofy like Mystery Men, with Ben Stiller. It was more like the Professional, with the star turning performance by a pre-pubescent Natalie Portman.My friend and I watched it in shocked amazement. We kept saying, this is awesome but f-ed up! It's the same feeling you get watching The Professional, its heartwarming, the performances are great, the story is riveting...but its f-ing brutal and you're watching a child, a young girl be trained to be a psychopath! The difference here is its not voluntary, its a life she's born into. It seems right but its so sad and so wrong!It's definitely an interesting twist on what you'd think would be a straight forward goofy teenage comedy. Any way, if you have a daughter this may well offend you. But, if you're willing to stomach it, it's a hell of a fun ride!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Stupidly over the top,"Kick-Ass is a parody super hero movie, not the kind of one which writes the movie around the jokes. It's that weird situation where you ask yourself what if a real life superhero existed. Then they take that premise and take it to the craziest situation it can. The jokes are mostly awkward situational humour. The action is overly violent on purpose and definitely takes cues from the Matrix and similar movies. The overall plot is parody Spiderman. The music is great taking musical themes from Batman, Spiderman, lord of the rings and the good the bad and the ugly. With some pop tunes thrown in there to add some humour. Brilliant watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
With No Power Comes No Responsibility. Only if that were true.,"Kick Ass is pretty hilarious. And it's different from every other superhero movie.
I wish it had a better soundtrack though.
And it was difficult to watch a little girl getting beat up. I know it's a movie. But still.
And the romance between Kick Ass and his girlfriend was a bit rushed and didn't sync with the whole plot.

Outstanding,"Now and again a movie comes along that takes what should be a logical step forward, but is really a brave and totally blind leap of faith. Watcing this made me realise how banal and mundane every other movie of the last 20 years has been.This is simply the best movie I've ever seen, wrestling that title from Pulp Fiction which held it for 17 years. Kick Ass isn't necessarily a better movie, but it's refreshing and pushes boundaries that need to be pushed. We need film makers to innovate, not to rely on re-hashing old stories and special effects.Chloe Moretz is simply wonderful, in a role that must have been difficult to define based on the fact that there isn't really anything previous to go by. Mark Strong is an excellent adversary, and Nicolas Cage actually puts in a reasonable performance too.Any film that can shock you whilst at the same time making you laugh and cry has to be commended. This story relies on great writing and acting to achieve that rare goal, not on gore and special effects.This is not going to appeal to everyone, but I believe it is pure genius and if you aren't easily offended, buy the DVD because it's one to keep and watch over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Soft kick in the head,"I purposefully try not to read too much about a movie if I might go and see it. I don't want to risk spoiling my experience by taking any preconceived ideas along with me. This was the case for Kick-Ass, I'd read some thing about it being something like ""self aware"" or something to this affect, whatever it was it appeared to mean to me that it was not a corny comedy directed at ""the average"" teenager but something a bit deeper. So I didn't read much more because I had decided that I might go see it. Admittedly this strategy hasn't worked out for me before as well.Today I went to see Kick-Ass. Extreme violence perpetrated by a pre-pubescent girl peppered with foul language doesn't really impress me. The post-pubescent, but clearly lagging behind in the maturity department, behind me seemed to find these parts ""funny"", as did a fair percentage of the audience. I'll give the audience the benefit of the doubt though, often embarrassment is covered up by a burst of laughter.Was this film that bad? No it wasn't terrible, it was just not very, or even much good either.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

It  Kick's Ass!,"For more reviews head to http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/ Superheros, caped crusaders, masked avengers, latex wearing super studs. Why is it that these paragons of righteous humanity only exist in our dreams? The main point of Kick Ass is to show us that superheroes don't exist in our modern world for a very good reason. Kick Ass is a parody of the insanely popular comic book adaptations that have been bombarding our theatres since the release of Spiderman back in 2001. The satirical elements of the film seem to be lost on a large number of critics who have branded the film with all kinds of damaging labels; 'exploitative', 'gratuitously violent', and 'politically incorrect' to name but a few. Of course Kick Ass is all of these things. But the film has a different motive for being so than your normal run of the mill action pick.Kick Ass tells the story of Dave Lizewski, an avid comic book fan who wonders why no-one has ever thought of becoming a superhero? The constantly unnoticed and downtrodden Dave decides to do what others only dream of and create a crime fighting alter ego Kick Ass. Dave soon realises that being a superhero is harder than he thought, especially after only narrowly escaping with his life on many occasions. Dave's problems escalate when Mafia kingpin Frank D'Amico thinks Kick Ass is behind a slew of recent drug busts that is actually the work of real vigilantes Big Daddy and Hit Girl.Unlike most comic book adaptations Kick Ass does not glorify violence. The graphic nature of the fight scenes serve to humanize the actions. They do not appear heroic, just a big bloody mess. The film also explores the consequences of violence. Every time our hero engages in a battle he is beaten to a bloody pulp and only narrowly escapes with his life.Most of the flack received by the film centre's around the character of eleven year old, foul mouthed vigilante Hit Girl. Why exactly is it that this character has received condemnation from family groups worldwide, especially since the MA 15+ film has never been marketed as anything less than strictly adult entertainment? Sure Hit Girl is like a pint sized Rambo, but is she any more disturbing than the mass murdering, psychopathic child in Orphan? The sociopathic, serial killer played by Macaulay Culkin in The Good Soon? A callous, bloodthirsty Kirsten Dunst in Interview with the Vampire? There are countless other examples of child exploitation, but Kick Ass seems to be the film taking the beating. The fact that director Matthew Vaughn is making the point that Hit Girl is a product of our increasingly violent culture seems to be lost on most naysayers. He makes the statement that superhero films glorify violence so much that in our society it is perfectly within the realms of possibility for an eleven year old to wish for guns and knives for her birthday.Kick Ass is a rollicking good farce and anyone who attempts to view it as a straight up action film is going to have trouble. It successfully pokes fun at many generic superhero conventions; the death of a loved one, the arrival of a superpower (which in Dave's case is a slightly heightened ability to take pain due to nerve damage sustained in a fight), the superhero costume ( a green scuba suit which Dave attempts to wear underneath his clothes at all times), the training regime, the nerd boy who likes popular girl, the showdown and the inevitable sequel setup.The cast is exceptional. Nicholas Cage gives his best performance in years as Big Daddy, Chloe Moretz almost steals the film as Hit Girl, Christopher Mintz- Plasse brings the laughs as Red Mist and Mark Strong delivers another exceptional villain. The film's star Aaron Johnson continues to show his versatility as an actor, possessing the humility to make Dave pathetic enough that the audience just can't help but root for him.Kick Ass is a unique film that deserves to find a large audience. Here's hoping that audiences will get past the controversy and be able to view the film for the delightful romp that it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Yes it is a bit pro violence, but this is one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.","I never saw 'Kick Ass' in the cinema, I bought it recently on blu-ray as it is recommended by many. After watching it I had to say ""Damn! Why did I miss this at the cinema?!"" I love watching films not knowing what to expect, being surprised and amazed while watching it, and that is exactly what happened with 'Kick Ass'. All I really knew about the film prior to watching was that it is about some douche who becomes deluded into being a superhero and that it is also pretty violent, there is much more to it than that. There is also the outrageous black humor, a crazy mob family, Nic Cage, and one of the most bad-ass characters to ever have appeared on a screen - an eleven year old girl!'Kick Ass' (based on the graphic novel), follows the tale of a normal teenager Dave (Aaron Johnson) who like everyone else exists in a violent and dangerous world, and wonders why no one wants to be a superhero. After being mugged by knife wielding thugs, Dave finally decides to do what others won't and becomes a superhero called 'Kick Ass' despite having no powers or any kind of training at all. He so fittingly puts it later in the film ""Just a dick in a wet suit"". His first fight against crime (unsurprisingly) doesn't go well - he gets stabbed, run over by a car, and barely survives at the hospital. When he returns he is still absolutely determined to be a superhero, and heads out onto the night streets once more, completely blind to how ridiculous he looks to everyone else. Needless to say his second venture to help others ends rather well. He accidentally ends up in a brawl with some crooks and successfully fends them off. The fight gets filmed by some civilians and is put on YouTube and becomes the most watched clip on the internet, and Kick Ass instantly becomes famous across the country.He catches the attention of two other 'superheroes', Big Daddy (the legendary Nic Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) who have a story of their own. These two unlike Kick Ass mean business serious business. They don't just fight crime - they obliterate it! Going against many superhero trends they kill criminals instead of capturing them, making Batman look like a fairy queen. It turns out Big Daddy has a vengeful history with the films villain – powerful mob boss Frank D'Amico (played by the fantastic Mark Strong) and has been training himself and his daughter Hit Girl to destroy D'Amico's entire crime empire. Kick Ass manages to land himself right in the middle of this crime war, and it threatens to doom him and everyone around him, including his budding love interest Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) who thinks he is gay. He discovers being a superhero isn't as cracked up as he thought it would be.The acting is great all round, Aaron Johnson is suitably wimpy and unforgettable as the titular character. Nic Cage is on fine form as Big Daddy, being crazy, funny and sympathetic all at once, it's a shame he doesn't appear more. Mark is 'Strong' (hee hee get it?) as the villain, something that he is becoming quite notable for doing now. While D'Amico is a cruel and cunning mob boss he also has a family which makes him more interesting, and he isn't a super villain like in other superhero films, he is a real world bad guy. The funniest character had to be D'Amico's nerdy son Chris (Christopher Mintz Plasse) who becomes another 'superhero'- Red Mist.However the real star of this film is unquestionably Hit-Girl played by the delightful Chloe Moretz. This little girl is a MACHINE!! She also happens to be the source of the films controversy and fame. Never will you have seen such a young child kill so many adults in a single film ever, and in such brutal ways. She is also a potty mouth and probably swears more than any other character, and trust me this film has lots of swearing! Which begs the question, how is such a brutal and offensive character so charming? The finale of the film belongs to her when she raids D'Amico's building, and one of the craziest action sequences I've ever seen unfolds. She practically becomes the main character at the end, and Kick Ass became more like the sidekick. You just want to run up to her and give her a big hug, at the same time you probably also feel like fleeing from her.Do I have any negative comments about the film? Well actually I do. The film is a bit too violent for its own good. I'm amazed this film didn't get an adult rating; it has more swearing than a Tarantino film, a few unsettling torture and interrogation scenes, and LOTS of blood. As much as I love Hit-Girl, I have to admit it was a bit disturbing to see such a young girl wield guns and knives like a pro. I can understand some critics' arguments about the film trying to encourage children to be violent, but the violence is not to be taken seriously. Also I found Dave's two 'friends' to be quite unlikable, I don't know if they were supposed to be funny, but they came across as irritating and mean.'Kick Ass' is a visual treat, and has fantastic pacing, you will never get bored for a second. The film is really a study of superheroes in the real world. In our world if someone tried to be a superhero, they would either be deluded losers like Kick Ass, or extremely violent vigilantes like Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, which is interesting, however it doesn't show us all this without having a lot of fun. It isn't to everyone's cup of tea, but if this is your tea, you're going to lap it up!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Most Self-Explanatory title ever?,"Director Matthew Vaughn's ""Kick-Ass"" isn't a spoof of a superhero film at all. Rather it is its' own superhero film. It gives us a lead who wants to be a superhero not because of some higher calling, or a tragedy that would derail most of us but instead is given about 45 seconds of screen time. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is just looking for a little purpose in life. He's a comic book nut to boot and so he dons a green wet suit and is off to disrupt some petty crime in New York City. It's from here the movie takes off, spiraling into dark satire, hysterical parallels, gritty and gory action, etc. Did I mention it also features one of the most controversial and entertaining characters in cinema history? Dave's a pretty normal guy. He pines after Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca), has a pair of funny but dorky best friends (Clark Duke of ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" among them), and makes deposits in a certain warehouse. Once he takes up the mantra of ""kick-ass"" he finds himself way over his head. After all he's not Bruce Wayne or Clark Kent. This has shades of ""Watchmen"" in it. If normal people take up the title of a costumed vigilante they're just still human. The costume is a persona and a representation of an ideal. It's not who they are. Dave meets a father-daughter pair who could care less. Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) looks oddly like Batman and his daughter Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) has been raised to make the Dark Knight look about as threatening as Katherine Hiegl. Why would he raise her so? The movie gives a perverted sort of explanation that makes sense in some odd way. The pair are after Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) a ruthless mob boss. This mob boss has a son who soon goes by the name of ""Red Mist"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Is he a ruthless youngster like his dad or does he simply admire his papa? The answers all come one way or another.In case you didn't guess Dave is in way over his head. His romance and motivations mean nothing once he realizes just what his adopted profession actually entails. That seems to be the general point of ""Kick-Ass"". Superheroes can't exist in the real world because what they strive to do is simply impossible. To oust organized crime syndicates and real world crisis's is the job of many men and women, not three extraordinary individuals. The appeal of a film like this is that it's set in the real world. Dave doesn't triumph in his first outings as a comic-book icon. In fact one is downright traumatic. His sobering presence in the film gives it the grounding it needs with the likes of Big Daddy, Hit-Girl and D'Amico shocking their way across the screen.Now for the issue of ""Hit-Girl"". If someone were to say they hated the film or couldn't watch it because of her you really can't argue with them. Her character is violent, so mature and the very thought of a pre-teen doing what she does is so scary that present a mountain of moral dilemma? Is it wrong for someone to write her character in such a harsh yet humorous way? What's the point of her character? What about her dad? Best not to think of it all that way. She's a walking, talking, punching, kicking, shooting, swearing send-off of the genre. You want outrageous? Rorsarach would blush. You want sinister and threatening? The Joker would be at a loss for words. In a genre where disbelief must be put on-ice for hours at a time Hit-Girl is its' ultimate symbol. Forget about the fact that she utters the ""C"" word with the frequency of Joe Pesci, or that she has the maturity of 30 year old Soviet sniper, or that her daddy time is spent both at a bowling alley and taking slugs in the her Kevlar-protected chest. She's killing the bad guys and that's all that matters in a superhero film. The aspect of morality only matters if the good guys don't have it because we know the villains don't.Any film is nothing without it's' performances. Superhero films are especially vulnerable in this area. ""Kick-Ass"" provides us with a cast that knew exactly what movie they were making and how they were supposed to fit into it. Cage is at his best here. He brings a controlled intensity to his best roles and Big Daddy is no different. As cool and ferocious as he is you can't help but be totally taken aback by him. Johnson is perfect as the not-to-vulnerable lead. His angst is presented with both hilarity and honesty. Mintz-Plasse will forever be known as ""McLovin"" but his character has some real depth here. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps but does he really know what his dad does, and once he figures out will that change? The film gives a classic answer. Then there is issue of his dad played by Mark Strong. He is fast becoming his generations' definitive villain-actor. He was sinister and stout in ""Sherlock Holmes"" but he's a downright a****** here. That's a compliment Mark, can't wait to see you in ""Robin Hood"".I don't claim to be a comic-book geek but I get giddy over any great film. ""Kick-Ass"" is just that. It belongs in the pantheon with ""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Spider-Man 2"", ""X2"" and ""Watchmen."" Those films all chose to deal with their conflicts both real and fantasy with ferocious action and well-written and serious plot points. ""Kick-Ass"" certainly succeeds as an action film but never forgets just outrageous it is. The result is something affecting, shocking, thrilling and funny.

"No Powers, No Gadgets, No Problem.","Whoever said you needed superpowers or high-tech gadgets to be a superhero? In KICK-ASS, Dave Lizewski proves just that as the titular hero, fighting with nothing but lean, mean determination and desire to uphold justice.Aaron Johnson does a great job as the hero geek, morphing from a shy pushover into a full-fledged crime-fighter in a green suit who would die in a split second to protect his tiny little philosophy and mission. Nicolas Cage pays homage to the 60s Batman and revels in his role as the vengeance seeking ex-cop. But the show stealer here comes no bigger than the size of 12-year-old Chloë Moretz, dispelling all those images of adolescent girls those tween queens on magazine covers have given you. As Hit Girl, she disposes her enemies faster than Superman could finish his heroic opening statement, and does so with unceremonious aggression and minimum fuss. The fact that she's so young differs from those femme fatales in that she does not rely on any sort of sexual appeal to make her character more attractive or intriguing; she doesn't have one, she didn't need one. She's awesome fully because she took down seven guys and left one pissing in his pants, putting the Batgirls and Elektras to shame.Perhaps most worth applauding is the no holds barred direction of the visual style and action of this movie. Too often, films have been toned down and made bland to avoid the R-rating and often causes creative integrity to suffer. From start to end, however, Kick-Ass showed absolutely no concern for going ""overboard"". There's no holding back from the excessive cursing, blood and gore of the movie that you could be forgiven if you thought Tarantino was behind this.All in all, KICK-ASS is a refreshing take on the now badly exploited superhero genre, and is capable of taking itself seriously at times yet provide mindless entertainment with witty humor and high-octane action that promises to keep you at the edge of your seat.

Surprising and perfect!,"Before i saw this movie, i had heard that it was simply a gory teenage action flick. Usually I'm cool with that so i decided that it would be fun. Plus, who doesn't like the loser turned awesome story? As iwatched this film it reminded me of one person: Quentin Tarantino. The score was perfect given the circumstances in a twisted way, the gore and action was over stylized as if it was to look unreal, the story was offbeat and fun and definitely clever. I've been a big fan of the works of Tarantino, and watching this movie made me realize what it would be like if i watched a superhero movie done by him.The acting in this movie was very solid. Nicholas Cage temporarily got out of his ""dud after dud"" funk with a solid performance, Mclovin did his dorky thing, and Aaron Johnson shows a very promising future with his role. The real star of this film, however, is Chloe Grace Mortez.

"So far, the year's best movie","Without reiterating what others have said, I will only say the following and try to keep this short:There is a sequence during the last third of ""Kick-Ass"" that is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!! It involves a major character, darkness, lots of enemies, night-vision goggles, a fantastic POV shot, and, eventually, a strobe light attached to a gun. Except for one character, nobody (including the viewer) can see anything or tell what's going on unless someone fires their weapon. This sequence is appropriately fast-paced, exciting, violent, jaw-dropping and a MASTERPIECE!!See this sequence! See ""Kick-Ass""!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
it was (so sorry) KICK-ASS.,"So, just watched kick-ass. So many great performances, an amazing storyline, and a swearing 11 year old girl. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. First of all, Aaron Johnson (dave) was very good. I have been waiting so long to say this, nick cage did great in this film. By far his best film. Chloe Moretz (hitgirl) did great, she was by far the best performer in this film. She was very funny, and played her role great. Lyndsy Fonseca (katie) did very well too. She is also very hot, i might add. And Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Chris a.k.a Mclovin) was also very good. I would not recommend this to anyone under 14, or even above, but that all just depends on maturity. It is very dirty. But again i say, it was a great movie, good storyline, and amazing actors. I'm putting this one in my top 5. It is well deserved as its place in the IMDb top 250. GREAT MOVIE.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The most deceptive movie marketing ever!,"This is not a comedy! and if they would have been honest on what the movie was really about chances are I would have gone to see it anyway. There are a lot of very depressing and horrific moments in this movie which is fine as long as you're not lying to people in your advertising and leading people to believe this is a light hearted comedy about teenage misfits fighting crime. There is nothing funny about this movie and in the end it's all about revenge, violence and a twelve year old girl dressed up like a common street whore arbitrarily murdering people. I've seen a few reviews where people have actually taken their children to see this movie.

Open your mind!,"An original look at comic ""heroes"". Very smart movie. It makes you think it's a comic based film, but it has so much more to offer. It never loses touch with reality. The little girl steals the show, she really kicks some ass, but we were reminded she's just a little girl no matter how mature she appears to be. The second last action scene is one of the best I've seen recently. Highly recommended! People who criticise this film because of the violence and the little girl needs to wake up. This is a film, and it is not inspired by a true story, if you believe everything you see is a bad example then maybe you should not watch any films at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Move over Angelina Jolie / Lara Croft,"Chloe Moretz is exceptional as Hit Girl. Frankly they mis labelled the film. She has the chutzpah of Hermione in the Harry Potter films, with serious attitude and moves to boot.She makes Angelina Jolie / Lara Croft look, dare I say it, old and slow.It's really her film, and appropriate that the A-list talent, Nicolas Cage, plays her father, not the 'hero's'.It's remarkable that the film scores so highly, and a tribute to its peak moments, because the general pacing makes Hannah Montana look racy - long long long voice-over throughout the movie.We got it, gawky teen, can we move on please.Yeah, it's good, in fact it's very good, a bronze olympic medal, but it could have been gold. Despite my title, Tomb Raider, and The Matrix - for example - show true craftsmanship. This was highly watchable, occasionally and momentarily brilliant, but in the end too much like rehearsing lines, rather than delivering the play, or practising notes rather than performing a song: snippets and hints of genius and beauty, but too disjointed to leave you with the pleasure and after effect of a a truly great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Hilarious. 'A Clockwork Orange' meets 'Punky Brewster'.,"i thought this movie was pretty damned funny. i suppose it might make some people uptight, but hell, you can't please all the people all the time. this movie will probably please a lot of kids and that's what probably bothers most adults.as twisted as a lot of this gets, and as much as this film parodies (violence, vigilantism, super heroes, etc.,), it most interesting element is it's statement of child empowerment. this film is good for kids believe it or not. it teaches kids to stand up for themselves, to be tough, and to believe in their own empowerment. i'm not advocating violence or irresponsible behavior for kids, i'm just saying it does'nt hurt them to have a tough role model now and again. it's a very dangerous world man has created for himself, and kids should be wary, cautious and tough. you sometimes have to learn to take a stand right or wrong, and this film is definitely about standing tall and strong.i'm not a big fan of comic books or super heroes, i used to get into all that stuff, but i pretty much put it away as i got older. i still like kid's entertainment, i mean it's all pretty darn funny, but the whole super hero thing just seems kind of naive. that's what makes this movie so amusing. it takes on the whole adolescent preoccupation with super heroes and heroes in general.super hero stuff usually bores me these days. but not this film. it was funny, satirical, and it was pretty ""kick ass"". life ain't easy, and it's a very hard place. i don't see what's wrong with telling young people the truth. it's a gentle let down and they'll get over it. if you don't want to tell them directly, have them watch this movie. it pretty much says it all, and as soon as they stop laughing and feeling giddy, they'll get the message.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Lives up to it's name.,"Personally, I found this film to be incredibly enjoyable and I really don't mean that in a sadistic sense.Firstly, the character, Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), is inspiring to me. He portrays a plausible teenage vigilante. He starts off very brave, tenacious, reasonable and truly heroic! I think my favourite scene is where he defends a victim from 3 thugs, in front of people and endures numerous hits (both physically and on Youtube). The scene works perfectly to the tune 'Omen' by The Prodigy and, in a way, the fight scene is an omen in the film.The film is similar to 'Hot Fuzz' because it starts off realistically, set in a world of selfish people, corruption and apathetic witnesses and yet only one guy is desperately trying to do the right thing. However, all hell breaks loose and both films end in a ridiculous and violent crescendo. Kick-Ass very rightly says, ""I'm way in over my head!""In contrast, Hit-Girl seems to be a character deliberately used to test the threshold for bad influence. The actress seemed far too young for the role. She even drops the C-bomb! She reminds me of Puss in Boots manipulating people by acting angelic then suddenly becoming a merciless but skillful assassin.It's great to see Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist, McLovin etc.) in this role and a very different Mark Strong (Mob-boss Frank) compared to Vaughn's other brilliant film, 'Stardust'. I think this film is very well directed and I love the way the plot played with my expectations many times. That was thoroughly enthralling!Also, I liked the intertextuality (film references) to other superhero movies like Spider-Man, X-Men and Nick Cage being similar to Batman.I think a 15 rating is OK but slightly pushing it. There are a few torture scenes including a particularly unpleasant one towards the end. But the film is still brilliant and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Fortunately, the area I live in doesn't need a super-hero as it's relatively peaceful. But I believe Kick-Ass when he says, everyone's fantasized about being a superhero. I'm not ashamed to admit that I have. However, this film proves that you don't need to be a mutant to be a super-hero. You just need to be a good character.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Kickass, you mean Asskick","I have never thought a movie like this would so bad ass. I must admit, I was never really anything in high school of course I knew how to draw, but that really can't count in anything in the popularity status for me. Adding to that I read comics whenever I could, especially those batman comics.So when I heard this movie last year I was curious what a movie like this would be. Obviously I knew a movie like this would based on a graphic novel. Didn't expect that it was written by the author of The Ultimates, Mark Millar. All I am going to say about the graphic novel, that was hell of bloody. Sure the movie didn't follow exactly like the movie but it had its true essence, it was bloody.Hit-girl is compared to Punisher in the essence of how far they will go, sure she was eleven years old, and her dad is called Big Daddy ironically, recruited her for his mission to gain vengeance on the drug lord Frank A'mica. Kickass, truthfully is a lame superhero, especially without having superpowers. If I was going to be a superhero I would not just get a suit and then expect to kick butt which Dave Lizewski did. He should have thought well what he was going to do, but the thrill of dressing up in tights has a certain aroma that can not be denied.To sum it up I liked it the movie and I'll give a two thumbs up if you want something that has a good soundtrack and explosions to satisfied your eyes",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Fun, energetic, and kicks major ass.","The film is based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. It centers on Dave Lizewski (Played by Aaron Johnson), a kid who lives alone with his dad. In Dave's home town, crime runs amok, and thievery is everywhere you turn. So one day, Dave becomes a superhero. After a brief, but disastrous attempt to stop two men from stealing a car, he later saves a man's life. He names his altar-ego, Kick-Ass. He later meets Big Daddy (Played by Nicolas Cage), and Hit-Girl (Played by Chloe Moretz). They are two people looking for revenge against a crime lord named Frank D'Amico (Played by Mark Strong). Things get more complicated for Dave, not only having to balance his life, and his altar's life, but dealing with a new superhero arriving on the scene simply called Red Mist (Played by Christpher Mintz-Plasse), who is actually Frank's son in disguise.So, how do I describe this movie in four words, or less? Like this: Kick-Ass, KICKED ASS.The story is brilliant, inspired, and wonderfully realistic. It doesn't suffer from, nor do I remember it having the typical clichés of a normal superhero movie.So what about the performances? Excellent. Aaron Johnson was a great lead performer. Christopher Mintz-Plasse played a great role. Mark Strong, who seems to be typecast as villains, is pretty good with what he has. Then there's Nicolas Cage, who is stunning, and Chloe Moretz, who is a great deal of fun to watch.And the action? Edge of your seat awesome. The action and fight scenes are intense, gritty, and brutal. They have wonderful stunts, and fantastic pacing and film editing. All year long you can expect me to be singing the praises of Pietro Scalia, and his co-editors.The film is smart, hilarious, and thrilling to watch.If you haven't seen this film yet, go.

"Jet packs with chain guns, precocious pre-teen killing machines, and Youtube heroes.","""Come on, be honest with yourself. At some point in our lives, we all wanted to be a superhero.""I'm loving the recent bounty of ""real people as superheroes"" movies. Whether they're adaptations of graphic novels like Kick-Ass and Watchmen, or original stories like Defendor and the upcoming movie Super, I can't get enough of them.Kick-Ass (the graphic novel) is like Watchmen for the new generation. Not as momentous or genre-defining of course, but still just as post-modern, in its own way. The movie adaptation does feature some changing and refocusing of the original story, but I think it holds up pretty well.Kick-Ass is entertaining, which is the most important thing. Funny often, violent often, often funny AND violent, and (very) occasionally poignant. Nicholas Cage is better suited for this kind of irreverent movie than almost anything more serious, Aaron Johnson is a decent Dave, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as funny as usual, and Chloe Moretz steals the show, as she often does. The more the movie focuses on her, the better it is.A lot of fuss had been made about the violence in this movie, and of course, Hit Girl. Well, those people would be shocked to know that the story and Hit Girl herself have greatly been toned down from what you'd see if you read the graphic novel. Several of the more ""questionable"" things were cut out of the movie entirely, and the ending is decidedly more general audience friendly than it originally was.Kick-Ass (while violent, don't get me wrong) is no more violent than something like Watchmen, and beyond the shock factor some people may feel about seeing a 12 year- old use some very improper language, there's nothing here more offensive than what you'd see in a similarly rated action movie. All of Hit Girl's scenes (really, the entire movie) are so over the top and unrealistic, that I honestly don't see how anyone could be bothered by that character. If she's an issue for you, this really isn't the kind of movie you should be watching. I just thought I'd address that, because I quite frankly thought that the controversy over all that was ridiculous.You should easily be able to tell from the trailer if you'll this movie. If you thought those were awesome, you'll enjoy this. If you thought otherwise, don't bother. It's not for you. Fans of the graphic novel should also be reasonably pleased, as the casting was solid, a lot of the story was kept intact, and it's just plain fun to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A comic book lovers wet dream,"Since ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"", the bar for comic book movies has been raised to a far grander medium. They showed us that these movies can be enjoyable, and yet maintain a large amount of depth to both story and character. Since then, every comic company is scrambling, trying to mimic their image. Almost all the Marvel characters, including ""Spiderman"", are being re-booted, and studios are scrambling to find the next big thing.....the next hidden gem. Well, with a name like ""Kick Ass"", it better be one movie that lives up to it's name if it wants to survive.First, let me go ahead and assume that we have all seen ""Spiderman""......okay, good........this movie starts out almost the same way. Geeky kid, no place or purpose, decides that he is going to finally take on crime himself and become a superhero. Pretty basic, you kind of expect what is going to happen with this story, seeing that we have all seen it before......and then BAM! It does a total 180......but in the most entertaining way possible. And this moment alone, tells you that this is not your typical superhero movie.I cannot even begin to describe how entertaining this movie is. Everything from the characters, to the dialogue, to the action sequences.........this movie is a comic book lovers wet dream. It was funny, it was gory, and i kid you not, there were some cinematic sequences in this movie that literally had my jaw in the floor. Example: One of our famed superhero's, a little 9 year old girl, is blasting the hell out of bad guys to the theme song from ""A Fistfull of Dollars"".......i mean that is straight Tarantino. So don't be fooled by all the funny costumes, and somewhat humorous title. This movie has a great storyline, and told in a very entertaining fashion. And much like ""Iron Man"", it deserves to be taken seriously. But don't get me wrong, the movie is filled to the brim with brilliantly placed humor that had me laughing so hard that i was crying. So to pretty much sum it up.......its a movie that has everything......action, humor, serious story, and entertaining characters.Now i simply must talk about the characters. Because they are really what made this work. It's not like most comic book movies, where only one or maybe two characters are entertaining to watch. In this one, everyone is worth watching. Each superhero has their own little personality that makes them so unique, and un-comparable to anyone else. But even though they are all entertaining......the one that stands alone, is Hit Girl. I will easily go down in saying that this character is not only one of the most entertaining superhero's every created, but one of the single most entertaining characters even written in film. I will not go into any detail, because finding it out for yourself makes it even better.......but god damn. You remember the feeling you got when you saw Heath Ledger as the Joker. And you remember saying to yourself ""Man, they could make a whole movie about him and it would be awesome""......yeah, its the same case here. This is a character that will have everyone talking for years to come......it was that good.Bottom Line, Another bar in the comic book genre' has been set. Now i know that the phrase ""A movie that has everything"" has been tossed around a lot......but this movie really does have everything. Imagine a mix between ""Spiderman"", ""Kill Bill"", and ""Superbad""......three very different movies right? But take the best from all three, and you got this film. Also, one thing that i must touch upon, is the fact that this movie would have probably failed if it were not rated ""R"". Because the fact that this movie takes everything to the edge, makes it fun to watch. So watch out 2010 Summer Blockbusters, because this movie has set an incredibly high bar. ""Kick Ass"" lives up to its name and more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Is the Film Any Good?  The Title Says It All.,"Everything you need to know about this movie is right there in the title. From start to finish, this movie is loaded with enough action and humor that I never got bored. It grabs your attention the moment the movie begins with a wanna-be superhero diving off a skyscraper with his makeshift flight suit, leading into the initial realization of our main character Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) that no one's ever tried to be a superhero. Inspired by his favorite comic heroes, Dave throws together his own costume and takes to the night streets to fight crime. It's not long before he finds himself in over his head, attracting the attention of both a father-daughter crime-fighting duo and the city's biggest drug kingpin.For those who haven't seen it yet, do not go in expecting your average comic book film. This film is brutal. It doesn't pull punches are there the violence isn't limited to the blood-less beatings you find in Spider-Man or Iron Man. KICK-ASS is loaded with bloody bullet hits, impalings, hacked limbs, and unapologetic gore. And the best part, most of it is dealt by a 10 year old girl. I know that part's made a good amount of people angry and has surely stopped plenty of people from even giving the movie a chance. Roger Ebert was so put off by the concept of a kid committing acts of graphic violence that he gave it the worst review possible. When you watch this film, you just need to have fun with it. From the moment I heard of this movie, I knew what to expect and I had a blast watching a kid slice-n-dice and drops F-bombs. Some might argue that it sets a bad example, but seriously...who in their right mind would let their kid watch this movie?Director Matthew Vaughn (who did the equally awesome LAYER CAKE) did an awesome job with this film, and he collected the best people for the job. Aaron Johnson is the high school geek with delusions of grandeur and is hilariously uncoordinated in his superhero efforts, enjoying the perks of fame despite getting his butt kicked regularly. He did a good job but he was often out-shined by his friends, played by Clark Duke and Evan Peters. The best part of the movie was Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz as Big Daddy and Hit Girl. I'm sure I'm the minority opinion but this was one of my favorite Nic Cage roles ever. As Damon Macready, his goofy demeanor reminds me of a father you'd see on a 50's sitcom but once he dons his costume as Big Daddy, he's a violent vigilante who dresses like Batman and sounds like Adam West. He is teamed with his daughter, Mindy, as Hit-Girl. Just like Cage, she's got dual personas...as Mindy she's freakin' adorable (it was funny watching her get super-excited about trading an extra bullet to the chest in her training for a trip to the bowling alley) but as Hit-Girl she's downright sadistic and growls like Dirty Harry.The villains in the film were great. Mark Strong and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are Frank D'Amico and his son Chris. Frank is the city's top crime boss and his son wants nothing more than to be a part of his business. Chris finds his way in when he convinces his father the best way to bring down Kick-Ass is to pose as another new superhero, Red Mist. Mintz-Plasse is at a disadvantage because I still see him as McLovin from SUPERBAD but I suppose it works for this character, contributing to his nerdy awkwardness as he tries to enter the world of crime.All right, I've written more than enough about how much fun this movie was and how great a job the cast did, but the whole movie can be summed up with it's title. It doesn't lie and anyone who's a fan of superhero films should give this film a watch. It takes a classic template and warps it into something brutally entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This Movie Is Mediocre At Best,"I don't know what people see in this film its not that great its ""okay"" at its best. Nick age was god awful in this. my geek brain cannot fathom why he chose to do this character the way he did with the unnatural dialect. I think this film could have been so much better if Nick was mute in it or played the part as it was originally written.. the flying sequence was garbage ""worst ever"" but.. it wasn't all terrible any time hit girl was on screen was amazing, any time she was on screen the movie very suddenly changed its format it had a great soundtrack and action sequence but as sudden as it came, it went back to trying to be the lames movie ever..Final thought - watch this if you've never read the comic and have nothing else to do, otherwise stay away this movie does not hold a match to the original story by comparison this is complete canine stool..thanks for your time and i hope this review helped you make a decision.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
I wish Hit Girl was my daughter,"When I first heard of this film, late last year, I was intrigued. I watched some trailers and thought this could be, potentially, the film of 2010. Well, it'll take something special for this not to be the case as Kick-Ass certainly didn't disappoint.Nic Cage was great, his ""acting"" style was well suited to the role of Big Daddy, as were the rest of the cast. But it's Chloe Moretz who steals the show. Hit Girl swears, not as much as some who haven't seen the film seem to think, and kills her way through the film as is awesome. Arnie, Sly, Dolph, Bruce, Chan and Statham all rolled into a pint sized assassin. She'll go far I'm sure.I may have to go see this again later this week.9/10.

Great light movie,"I loved it.All I knew before watching it was that it had something to do with normal people trying to be superheros (I usually try not to even watch the trailers so that they don't influence me and they don't make me expect more than what the movie has to offer).I think about this movie as follows: take Watchmen, do a low-cgi-version out of it, mix to it a few pieces of American Pie, add how you would try to behave when being a superhero plus some bloody Tarantino-shots for one of the characters, contour the whole with some interesting music and you've got the movie.It was like with Zombieland - in both cases I expected a quite bad movie, but in the end they were quite good, not serious, with a story that unfolded without any problems, nice camera shots, nice music, good actors, happy feeling at the end - a profiled movie. Not one of those that mix everything trying to be OK for every kind of public.As I always doubt if the person who wrote the review has the same taste that I have, here are a few more or less recent movies I liked: Watchmen, The girl with the dragon tattoo, Let the right one in, Frost nixon, Zombieland, Children of men, Gone baby gone, Snatch. This of course excludes older ones, even classics like 2001 Space odyssey or Seven samurai.Nicolas Cage does his job - not more and not less. Chapeau. The little girl (Chloe Moretz) is great, probably the best character in the movie. The main actor (Aaron Johnson) was in my opinion flat. He could have been a bit better. The bad guy(s) fit well in their roles.10 out of 10 would have been with a better main character and towards the end a badder bad character.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Pop Culture and Silliness to the Best,"In New York, the teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a loser high-school student fan of comic books ignored in school that spends most of his time with his friends Marty (Clark Duke) and Todd (Evan Peters) that are also comic book fans. Dave has a great attraction by Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) that does not notice him. One day, the clumsy Dave decides to make the difference becoming a masked superhero without powers named Kick-Ass. However in his first action avoiding a car to be stolen by two punks, he is stabbed by one of them and hit by a car later. Dave is submitted to a surgery and his bones are mended with metal. When he recovers, Katie notices him believing that Dave is gay. In the night, Dave helps a man that is hunted down by three guys in front of a cafeteria and the teenagers shoot the fight with their cell phones and cameras. Then they put the footage in Internet and Kick-Ass immediately becomes famous. Meanwhile the powerful gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) believes that Kick-Ass is responsible for actions against his gang and plots a scheme to destroy him. However, the responsible are the vigilantes Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, whose secret identities are Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage) and his daughter Mindy (Chloe Moretz). Damon is an ex-cop that was framed by Frank D'Amico and sentenced to prison. He lost his beloved wife while imprisoned and trained his daughter in fights and weapons to combat crime, more specifically Frank. They start a partnership with Kick-Ass, but sooner the evil Frank and his son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) plot a plan to betray Kick-Ass.""Kick-Ass"" is one of the funniest movies I have watched this year, exploring pop culture of comic books, superheroes and video-games associated with silliness to the best. The cartoonist characters are hilarious, with a douchebag that has his ass frequently kicked deciding to become a hero that kick asses; an eleven year-old girl that is a hit-woman (actually a hit-girl); a paranoid father that raises his daughter training her to kill bad guys; a beautiful girl that gets closer to the anti-hero Dave just because she believes he is gay. ""Kick-Ass"" is a great parody to Spider-man and I loved the reference ""with no power comes no responsibility"". Chloe Moretz performs one of the most refreshing and crazy characters with Hit-Girl that looks like Steven Seagal or any other action movie hero like Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dolph Lundgren expert in martial arts and weapons that easily kill the bad guys and is responsible for some of the best moments of this entertaining film.

The production values from the photography and editing to the glorious costumes are striking, and the soundtrack has a lot of energy. As does the fast pace, the smart and witty dialogue and a fun and unpredictable story.

"Why Do You Think They're Called ""Comic"" Books?","Now, here's a seriously screwy superhero movie that definitely had its head right up its ass. I think that a more appropriate title for this utter nonsense would've been ""Stupid-Ass"".It really made very little sense to me why Dave Lizewski felt that he had to literally play out his little, comic-book fantasy in real-life. By becoming a superhero (who, by the way, possessed not a single super-power), was he really so frickin' deluded and beyond common-sense thinking that he couldn't see the incredibly dangerous mission that he was about to embark on (even after he had been stabbed and beaten)?Like, was little Davie Lizewski's life really so unsatisfactory that he felt the need to draw this sort of screwy attention to himself? Wasn't ejaculating into countless tissues enough to fulfill his superhero wet-dreams?If Lizewski was really so hell-bent on bringing the bad guys to justice, wouldn't it have been so much more easier and a heck of a lot less life-threatening just to have called 911 on his cel and then let the cops handle the hardcore stuff?And, speaking about that dynamic-duo of Big Daddy & Hit Girl - Like, what sort of a totally demented message was that business sending out to parents and their kids?So, here we have a seriously fukked-up father who trains his 11-year-old daughter to be an utterly ruthless, insensitive, foul-mouthed killing machine. And never once do the questions of morals, or ethics, or common-sense thinking ever enter into the horridly violent actions of the bitchy, purple-haired Hit Girl.(And the father is never in the least bit concerned about his daughter's safety. And the daughter never questions herself or her father about what she is doing)I personally viewed Hit Girl, and her blasé attitude towards what she was doing, as being worse than the most vicious bully on Earth. But, because she was looked upon as a ""crimefighter"" (self-appointed and self-righteously sitting on the side of the law) her savage, bloody murders were deemed as ""OK"".Yes. I do realize that this picture was, indeed, a ""Comedy"". But, from where I was sitting, I found its humour-factor to be extremely callous and cold-blooded in nature. This film, pretty much, amounted to being nothing but a one-note joke that literally stretched the point of its ""jesting"" to the absolute limit. And because of that, this film just couldn't sustain the insane momentum that it was creating and so it snapped under its own unbearable weight.And, finally - What struck me as very puzzling about this picture was that (due to its graphic, over-the-top violence and its non-stop use of profanity) it was a film clearly meant for an ""over 18"" audience. And, yet, in spite of that, I found its basic story-line was, without question, geared to an age group that fell significantly below the age of 18.Yes. Very odd. Indeed!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Enjoyable piece of superhero satire and outrageous action.,"Cinema today has become over saturated enough as it is with superhero flicks, be it Marvel, DC or anything else less mainstream. So it's quiet refreshing that they're willing to bring more cult classics onto the big screen.Kick-Ass is a sort of a self parody in someways as it seems to satire the whole superhero concept from beginning to end. The writer of the comics, Mark Millar, even said that the idea was based off of his own desire to be a superhero growing up in Scotland. It feels somewhat believable that a teenage looser might actually try this out someday resulting in this much mishap, for the first half of the film anyway since towards the end it gets more over-the-top. The writing is well thought out with a great sense of irony and humor, even really dark and brutally violent scenes will bring a devious grin to your face. Characters feel believable and are easy to connect with, especially Hit Girl who has to be one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in cinema. It's hilarious how one critic accused the film makers for making this eleven-year-old girl 'sexulized' but then bawled when he was accused of pedophilia himself, as though he expected anything else! That little rant aside, Kick-Ass is a refreshing and amusing piece of work that should have you coming back for more. Roll on the sequel!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Napoleon Dynamite meets Watchmen?,"I guess I am just a sucker for those movies where the underdog overcomes prejudice, ridicule and overwhelming odds to win respect, impose justice or just get the cute girl. Whether it's a 40-year old virgin, a high school geek or the unlikely employee of the month, I get vicarious joy from watching the small (or goofy) guy win. But with Kick Ass, Hollywood has a number of surprises for you. Who would of thought a prepubescent, 11-year old girl could embody all hopes and aspirations of us armchair superhero lovers. Who thinks this stuff up? The running jump shot to the head under strobe light has to be one of the finest cinemagraphic effects I've seen in years. The music is great and well chosen for each scene. I think you'll really enjoy this one. But moms, don't rent this one for your tweens. The language is very adult.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This movie Kicks Ass,"Over the past 5 years more and more DC and Marvel heroes are making their way to the big screen... Yeah most of them are top notch movies, but Kick Ass is something else...The thing that makes it different is that the action (most of it) could really take place, not just in some parallel universe where an alien from Krypton wears his underwear on the outside or a teenager bitten by a radioactive spider :D Kick Ass can be anyone of us who dreamed of being a superhero even if he doesn't have any special powers, but is sick and tired of life being unfair.Take a chance and watch the movie (by the way it's got good music and some nice film effects) and it's got a good rating after all :P",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"I can't promise this review is coherent, because this film was so mind-blowing!","This film is truly amazing. I think I just gave away the entire conclusion of this review, but that's probably because I can no longer think coherently because it was so mind-blowing! Kick-Ass is the brain child of Mark Millar who wrote the original comic series and it's lost nothing of the original charm in its translation to the big screen (by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn).It stars Aaron Johnson, as the geeky lead and even in this guise he's a little bit delicious. I'm not just in awe of his looks though, together with Clark Duke and Evan Peters they give an amazing performance, and you can tell it all them because their lines are witty but the delivery and the background actions are ludicrously funny. Chloe Moretz gives an impressive performance as 11 year old hit girl, being only this age herself it undeniable that she can act (and kick some serious butt) but at times it felt as though she didn't always appear to know what was going on. The only other minor flaw seems to be that Christopher Mintz-Plasse appears to be playing his character from Superbad, again. This isn't enough to detract from the film as whole in anyway, more a passing comment you'll not when leaving the cinema.The film is a triple threat; it can sing, dance and act. The soundtrack is superb, featuring the likes of The Prodigy and Ellie Goulding it's worth buying in its own right. It's use within the film is possibly the best I've seen this year. ""This Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us"" by Sparks is used with such fantastic timing it will have you in stitches. The camera-work (and editing) is jaw-dropping. This is art house style with a mainstream budget, and it is beautiful. I want to hug the cameramen.I don't know why you wouldn't want to see this. There is some serious weapons, some eye-popping action and some comic-book legends. If you want gore? You can have it. If you want laughs? You got them. If you want romance? It's there (and it's cute). If you want 117 minutes of pure, quality entertainment, I urge you, go see Kick-Ass.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Thumbs up for  Kick-ass,"Kick-ass is awesome! (Just a short tribute, nothing special to say)This was a real superhero movie. In the beginning I was a bit skeptical about having to watch a movie in this genre, which was only 30 mil. in production budget. Seriously the Spider man movies ran from 140 mil. to 257 mil. in budget and this movie kicked their ass!The acting was brilliant with a strong story, so it was certainly surprising to see so little turned into to something so great. Further more this is the first movie in a long time that made Nicholas Cage look good. This a good part for him. The music score compliments the storytelling and sets the mood for an exiting and fun adventure.For all who love superhero movies this is a must see!! No question about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
What more could you want?,"There's not much else around these days that can offer this much comedy and action in one movie. I really really liked this movie, loved it in fact. The most original of its kind in my opinion. For me Chloe Moretz was my favourite because i wasn't expecting such a great and comedic performance. Went into the movies not expecting very much because the trailers looked awful but i was in stitches within 2 minutes of the movie. Don't understand the odd people that say its the worst movie they've ever seen because it does'nt get any better than this. And i love during the fight scenes the great music they pick and the slow motion is really cool. So yeah, do not miss out on this one please!!! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly a really great movie,"I got the chance to see this movie last night (07/01/10') on DVD and it was great. I heard many great reviews and some mixed reviews but its a great movie. People need to stop talking movies too seriously and enjoy it for what it is. Granted, its not a movie for everyone, and not everyone would like it but people need to give it a try and quit at it if they dislike it.It's rare when a movie is seemed better than the trailer and this movie is just one of them. Sure there are a few flaws in other people's opinion, on how this isn't a plausible superhero movie, and more of a wannabe superhero's fantasy. And how the main protagonist Kick-Ass is overshadowed by other characters, mainly Hit-Girl who is so entertaining to watch on screen. Not only is this one of the best wannabe superhero movie out there, it also beats out a lot of superhero movies. This movie was ballsy and yet very entertaining to watch because unlike PG-13 movies, this movie goes all out. They don't hold back on the action and violence, and that is one of the reasons why this movie was successful. I am glad the distributors decided not to dumb this movie down for the younger audiences. Nicolas Cage did a great job with his role as well but unlucky for him, he character dies towards the end. His daughter, Hit-Girl really stole the show in this movie and she was definitely the main character towards the end of the movie. It was intense and amazing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Didn't Work,"Had looked forward to seeing this movie but was really disappointed.It seemed to me that the makers didn't know what they were trying to create: a teen-comedy? a comic-based actioner? an uber-violent fable? None of these worked.I thought all the characters did their stuff well: Nicolas Cage and, of course, Chloe Moretz were fun to watch but the in the end, the overall package was well short of satisfactory.Others might disagree but I felt very uncomfortable watching a 10 year old girl being beaten up (quite realistically) on screen.

engaging... and substantial!,"Kick-ass is one of those movies that has its tongue so firmly panted in cheek because of the years of video archives where superheroes were altruistic. Also, because of this fact, they are able to find the perfect cast to pull it off. The characters are interesting while also being somewhat stock. The nerd becomes superhero, the crime boss bad guy with lots of guns. His underwhelming son who wants more. The mentor hell bent on revenge and the protégé turned into the perfect weapon who never has questions because she finds herself protected from them by love. Its not the situations or the characters that mainly draw us in. Its the little nuances that they have managed to fit into the story without making it seem weighed down or unfocused. At one point kick-ass is using some heavy machinery and you ask why at first, but then u realize that its not a bad fit. Its just a fit. Everything seems to fit in the film. In one case you have the high school life, but then you have a very real life outside of the school. This is where kick-ass ventures into often with hilarious results and sometimes very real and intense results. When he is looking for the cat, priceless! And when he fights its comical but also seems very brave of him. He upholds the altruism of the classic superhero but he doesn't have the talent to beat his enemies if they decide not to listen. U never really feel sorry for him tho because he does tend to be somewhat lucky getting caught in the middle of a war between an entire crime syndicate and a father and daughter with lethal accuracy. If he has any powers whatsoever the power of being lucky would be it. The thing about this movie is after watching it I feel very entertained and not patronized. The movie just told itself. It didn't try to find solace in things. It didn't try to make u feel good. There's no way you can be 100 % comfortable with an 11 year old girl going through what she goes through in the story. And cage's character was very damaged. Its pretty clear what his intentions are and they sure are not altruistic. It was executed pretty much perfectly. Its larger than life but remains grounded. The crime syndicate doesn't overstep its dramatic bounds. Its the right amount of ineptitude and ruthlessness that makes them so real. Then we have a little girl killing them with great ease. One might say that takes away from the realness. But thats not true. Its believable that she can do such things. What they have accomplished is fleshing out a fantasy in a very mundane and dangerous world. The hero gets hurt, a lot, in this world, but thats what makes him so interesting, its what makes them all so interesting, that they are weak and they pretend to be strong. Most comic book heroes are strong but pretend to be weak. A hero without any threats is boring. If superman had no kryptonite there would nothing to stop him from boring the crap out of us. The more weaknesses the more interesting. Kick-ass may be the most interesting man in the world in that case. I had to give an 8. It was good and thought provoking, but it didn't blow me away.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Ace movie, poor ad campaign","First of all i'm starting this review off with the idea that no film, whether it's independent and artsy or all action and gory, is perfect.So with that in mind i'll write my review of Kick-Ass, it's a great film that was let down spectacularly by it's marketing campaign, now i live in the UK and while i can't comment on anywhere else in the world i can say that the advertising campaign in my city made this movie look like 'virtua fighter kids vs the care bears on acid', lots of garish flashy images of teenagers in daft outfits.i recently read that this film fell way short of it's financial targets, i'm convinced this is because of the god-awful ad campaign.anyway....the film gripped me straight away, aaron johnson is a very likable character and while his friends seem like SUPERBAD rejects (more on that later), it's hard not to instantly empathise with him.after about 20 minutes you get the idea that the flavour of this film is more to make you think about your own morality when it comes to helping others rather than watching nerdy kids running around in pyjamas.After Kick-ass' first proper fight you can really get behind the character and against all logic....actually start to think that this story is plausible.about an hour in you get to meet the true stars of the movie (as the critics say), big daddy and hit girl, lots of controversy over HG's use of the C-word, while if you read this it will seem gimmicky it's actually quite reasonable conduct for a character that spends her evenings cleaning up street trash.saying that i found her character to be a bit of an annoying know-it-all, also christopher mints-plasse seems to have been thrown in as red mist for no discernible reason other than to ride the coat tails of the current cr*p that passes as comedy at the cinema.Nicholas Cage is excellent as Big Daddy and his character gets the most emotional scene in the film, Mark Strong makes for a menacing gangster and Johnson's on-screen squeeze gets quite a few good comedy moments.this film actually does quite well in the character development department, especially considering that this is part of the comic book genre.the soundtrack is great and the plot never drags, at 2 and a bit hours long it's certainly more than most people would bargain for.well worth a giving a go, even if the case artwork/posters don't seem to do it for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of the funnest movie-going experiences I've had in awhile,"Being based on a beloved comic book series, and as a film that redefines what a super hero movie, specifically, should be, Kick-Ass would make for quite the companion piece to last year's Watchmen. It's a film that will assuredly offend many more people than it already has. If you manage to get past that, however, what you'll find is a piece of cinema that's pure fun.Let me say, first and foremost, that Kick-Ass has a terrific ensemble. Aaron Johnson, who – as others have mentioned – will likely end up being overshadowed by other cast members, as great as the titular character. This is a character that, with even the slightest bit of mishandling, could've come off as pretty unlikable, but Johnson captures that perfect blend of awkwardness and badassness. Christopher Mintz-Plasse also delivers a surprisingly resonating performance as Red Mist; the days of him being simply known as McLovin' are over.The real stars of this movie, however, are Nicolas Cage and Chloë Moretz as Big Daddy and Hit Girl, respectively, the former having officially redeemed himself for his performance in Ghost Rider. I won't say much for the sake of spoilers, but there's some brilliant stuff that only Cage could do with that character. As for Moretz, this is a career-making performance from her. Her introduction alone will go down as one of the great character intros. And even while committing such horrible acts of violence, she strangely manages to capture that sense of childlike innocence. It's something else, to say the least.Speaking of violence (most of which done either to or by children), this is easily one of the bloodiest, nastiest mainstream movies to hit theaters in some time. Even as somebody who's watched all of the Saw movies (to give a more recent example), there were a couple of scenes that I just wasn't prepared for. That being said, the action is fast-paced, yet – thankfully – not so frenetic that you can't understand what the hell's going on, and there are some real nail-biting moments during the film's stirring climax.Amidst all of the mayhem that goes on in Kick-Ass, however, there is some real human drama to be found here as well. The film definitely succeeds in getting you to sympathize with Dave, and by the time he's doing what's expected from a guy with an alter-ego named Kick-Ass, you're cheering him on. The film then equally as well succeeds in making you hate the villain, Frank D'Amico, played by Mark Strong. This isn't a guy who, right before killing you, will present you with some long, drawn-out monologue, he'll just kill you. And by the time the aforementioned climax rolls around, you see just how despicable this guy really is.Kick-Ass is the most fun that I've had at the movies in a while. Just about everything in this movie works, from the Superbad-esquire humor, to the often over-the-top action sequences, to the surprisingly believable cast of characters. And hey, I managed to get through this whole review without saying ""Kick-Ass kicks ass,"" even though I'd really like to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Awesome! This movie kicks ***!,"Kick-Ass is a superhero movie that uses a mix of high school comedy, teenage romance, extreme violence and most of all satire. It works absolutely perfect. All aspects are here, cool action, interesting characters, great humor and also a clever plot line. Feels like a really original superhero film and I will go so far as claim it is one of the best I have seen. It's simply brilliant. So the film is really violent perhaps one of the bloodiest superhero films ever. But it's not just for the sake of it. The action scenes feel in a way like they are both gritty and suspenseful but also totally over the top at the same time and of course so entertaining. The humor is great, some jokes are funny just on their own and others are parody of other recent superhero films. I guess in many ways this is a film for the geeks but also viewers that are not totally into the superhero genre will find a great time here. This movie is itself a superhero adventure but at the same time satire, a play on the superhero genre, comic books and popular culture. But the whole plot is great written and actually deeper and cleverer than most in the genre. It's much more than just a parody. The whole adventure is great but just as much interesting are the characters. The character's ordinary life is just as engrossing. The acting is superb. Chloë Grace Moretz is the standout both in her performance but she hers is also the most interesting character. But Aaron Johnson fits his character just as perfectly. I like most I think have not been a fan of Nicolas Cage in a long time but this was his best performance in years. This is one of the best films of 2010. I don't read much comics anymore and I didn't know anything about it so Kick-ass was one of the year's positive surprises. The most original superhero film in years and also one of the best.

Bring on Hit Girl – and show me the money!!Let me tell you a little secret: if your film is smart, hip, funny and has a few touching moments, lotsa people will accept all sorts of nasty stuff thrown in. Wouldn't they look unsophisticated and humdrum in front of their friends and peers if they didn't!! Yep, I've covered all the bases, ladies and gentleman.Of course I've also publicly stated that fans of the Kick Ass comic would kill me if I held back on the violence. It's a pretty pat and convenient excuse, but the amazing thing is, no one has thus far taken me to task for it. Who said indifference is a bad thing? Certainly not my savings account, hehe!On the other hand, I really worry about how jaded and apathetic so many people in society have become. As a filmmaker and a businessman, this poses a real challenge, but I feel we have overcome it with ""Kick Ass""! Hit Girl is a shot in the arm for all and sundry. People are fighting the good fight, silencing the uncool who have voiced dismay at our adding a young girl to all this awesome savagery. (All in good fun!)

Lady Snowblood 2010,"Many people mention that Kill Bill by Quentin Tarantino was largely inspired by Lady Snowblood, the 1973 Japanese revenge movie directed by Toshiya Fujita and starring Meiko Kaji. The sub-plot in Kick Ass (Big Daddy/Hit Girl story) is much closer to Lady Snowblood than Kill Bill is, except that the female assassin is much younger and more foul-mouthed.Having watched quite a few of these Japanese revenge-themed movies from the 70s of late I think I've developed an appreciation of the genre. Kick Ass fits in nicely, and the acting is superb. I hope Chloe Moretz goes on to do as well as Meiko Kaji did.The main plot in Kick Ass has a lot of depth, touching on many contemporary issues such as apathy, gay-bashing and school-yard bullying under the guise of a coming-of-age story. I see more in it every time I watch it (which has been quite a few times already). Aaron Johnson does a great job with the role, struggling with all the moral and personal issues that the movie raises.Some have criticised the movie for not fitting into any genre, but I see it as being post-modern in it's breaking out of genres and reflecting on them in a way that transcends rather than satirizes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Fantastic Joyride,"I have to say, out of all the technicalities that make a movie good, you never really think of ""editing."" But in all seriousness, the editing of this flick is so great, that even if it had horrible characters or plot, I'd still want to see it again.Thankfully that's not the case. Kick-ass has a ton of fun characters, my favorite of which are the father and daughter (Big Daddy and Hit Girl). They all have an array of quirks that don't overwhelm their whole presence, and they all play off one another very well in a darkly humorous plot. That being said, the only problem I had with this movie was that it may have been too serious. It's a satire movie with very few laugh-out-loud jokes, but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable. I went into the movie expecting a boatload of jokes, but ended up getting a surprisingly dark experience. But it doesn't stop the fact that this is a fun movie from start to finish.In my opinion, this is the Zombieland of super hero flicks. It may not be as funny as the trailer made it out to be, but it's well made, well executed and keeps you on the edge of your seat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Kick-Ass!,"I got back from seeing Kick-Ass a few hours ago.I really wanted to see it as I'm a fan of superhero movies, especially darker R-rated ones.I loved Watchmen! Kick-Ass is both a superhero movie and a pretty funny comedy.Based on the graphic novel which I have not read, the story is about a nerdy teenager named Dave who decides to become a superhero named ""Kick-Ass"".The problem is that he is not very strong or skilled.Meanwhile, a father and daughter superhero team named ""Big Daddy"" and ""Hit-Girl"", who are much more experienced than Kick-Ass is, decide to meet up with him, and end up saving him from some violent drug dealers, which the drug dealer thinks kick-ass is responsible for.The father-daughter pair plan to kill a rich drug dealer because he framed Big Daddy for drug dealing years ago.Meanwhile Dave falls for this girl who thinks he is gay due to a rumor being spread at school and the drug dealer's son becomes a vigilante named ""Red Mist"", just so he can bring the trio down.Kick-Ass works as a superhero/vigilante movie, but it also works as a teen movie.We see examples of Dave being a nerd as well as various pop culture references which would pertain to teens.This is probably the first R-rated superhero movie to feature teenagers.The character ""Hit-Girl"" is probably the best character in the film due to her funny profanity-ladden one-liners and ability to really do damage to the baddies.The actress did a great job portraying her.Overall, if you like superhero movies or teen movies, then Kick-Ass is the movie to see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The Starting Pitcher of Young Guy Movies in 2010,"Watching Kick-Ass, we realize other films are working at one quarter speed. We've seen so many superhero movies. Especially after the Dark Knight watershed, Hollywood's as crazed in its search for comic-book options as Dobbs was in his search for gold in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. We feel we're familiar with all the angles on the genre, but then comes this movie, itself a comic book adaptation, about several superheroes, that, very simply, does it better. It's fresh. It doesn't spoof or satirize; it just plays an original tune with all the same notes. It's directed by Matthew Vaughn, who produced Guy Ritchie's hyperkinetic thug films, but directed Layer Cake. So we wonder, who was learning from who? Kick-Ass tells the basic story of the Ordinary Teenager, who wonders why nobody's ever decided to become a superhero like the ones in his comics. The reasons are obvious, but when you're one of those invisible kids in high school, your big pipe dreams begin to be your plot to prove yourself. So he decides to become a real-life superhero himself, despite having no powers or training in the least. The movie does not shy away from realistic ramifications of fantastical encounters, and during his first attempt to fight crime by trying to stop a carjacking by two local thugs, he's indeed beaten, stabbed, and even hit by a car. He's hospitalized, convinces medics to say nothing of his costume, to say he was brought in naked. But now some of his nerve endings are damaged, giving him a slightly enhanced capacity to endure pain, metal plates have been placed in his skeleton to sustain his bones.The assigned villains of the story are big-city Mafiosi, led by Mark Strong, returning to the role he unreservedly plays best, the tough, dominant boss who doesn't mind getting his hands dirty. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is his son, who gets his own drivers, bodyguards, respect. Mintz-Plasse is the rare character actor iho's so naturally funny that the first time we see him, I started to laugh, even though he's not doing anything really. There's just something about his look and manner; he's like Woody Allen for our generation. He becomes Red Mist, Kick-Ass's ridiculous yet cunning costumed nemesis.The charm of this movie is the interweaving of so many rich superhero characters into a fast-moving but expansive plot with a cheerfully tasteless sense of cruel humor. I'm of course speaking mainly of the father-daughter crime-fighting team of Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. We're introduced to them when he promises to reward her with ice cream after a training session involving shooting her point-blank while wearing a bulletproof vest. She masters the martial arts possibly more than any movie fighter of any age I can recall. She's particularly skilled with lethal knife-throwing, and is rewarded a foot-long knife by Dad somewhat like a samurai is rewarded a special sword by his sensei. She fearlessly confronts a hallway filled with gun-sporting gangsters, shoots, stabs and beats them all to death. The movie's not taking the easy way out: They don't wail on the floor; she brutally takes their lives, apparently experiencing no emotions about it. She uses heavyweight profanity like a Guy Ritchie thug, and is the toughest, most effective character in the whole story. This is ballsy, fresh and reactionary comedy.Outside of the superhero and mob characters, all of whom are richly and colorfully defined, the movie is nevertheless just as guilty as the next mainstream movie of not having any clue how to portray high school kids. I'm told that in Mark Millar's original comic, the girl of Kick-Ass's dreams goes from uninterested to appalled when he reveals his secret identity. That'd perfectly befit the film's disregard for the easy way out, which allows it to be so fresh and intriguing. But Hollywood won't have it, as in the most unreasonably stupid scene, he breaks into her room, explains his deceptions and in a completely implausible turn they begin having passionate dirty sex. However, where this would normally sever a movie from my engrossment, this one's working at such a vigorous frequency that I remained interested in its explosive set pieces and ink-black humor.Perhaps it only seems smarter than it is: There's a scene where Vaughn confidently demonstrates a knowledge of what the audience already knows, where Strong, and we, see Kick-Ass walking down the street from behind, he follows him, eagerly attacks him, all of which occurs without ever giving us exactly what we suspect, but what's more admirable even then is how Vaughn never found it necessary to show the face of the phony Kick-Ass; he knows we know it's not actually him. However, it's never elucidated how they find out later that the Kick-Ass imposter who they attacked was only an imitator and not the actual Kick-Ass. If nobody's aware of who Kick-Ass really is up to that point, how do they know the imposter wasn't the actual Kick-Ass? Well, at any rate, it's difficult not to have fun at this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Near Perfect Superhero Movie,"Kick-ass can be summed up as easily as Superbad meets Wanted meets The Dark Knight.I've read the graphic novel Wanted by Mark Millar but haven't gotten around to reading Kick-Ass just yet but from the movie, it seems he hasn't lost his flair for blending over the top violence, wacky humor and irony.The trailer was misleading - sure, i didn't do a lot of research heading into this movie. I thought it was going to be one of those action adventure comedies since Matthew Vaughn was director ala Stardust with a hint of British cynicism ala Layer Cake. My expectations were high because of the viral marketing and many different trailers set loose upon the internet and i was not disappointed. Not one bit.However i feel that the weak link in the movie was ironically the eponymous Kick-Ass. His exploits though hilarious and descriptive narrative throughout the movie aside, i felt somewhat let down by his role in the movie. He was outshone by the side-characters including the brilliant Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy and precocious Chloe Moretz as Hit- Girl. Mintz-Plasse whom we all remember from Superbad and Role Models does a good job as Red Mist and Mark Strong, my favorite actor villain archetype does a great job once again.This movie is like many people will call it, a fanboys wet dream. It has it all - just think Superbad meets Wanted meets Dark Knight. A bloody good combination of movies i think. Dare i say it? The soundtrack in the movie was Kickass....",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Brutal but brilliant superhero film,"If you're a fan of comic book movies, you should definitely check out Kick-Ass – it's not a typical superhero flick, and it's definitely not for the faint-hearted. As befitting the film's basic premise – the idea of costumed vigilantes in the real world – most of the action is grounded in reality (with a few notable exceptions), and while it's always thrilling, it's also very intense and often seriously brutal, enough to make you cringe. Unlike in many comic book movies, you really feel the punishment that the heroes both take and dish out.That said, when the film's trying to be funny, it does that really well too – there's quite a few pop culture references and mentions of other superheroes, but they're usually humorous and fit in well, unlike some other movies. The acting is great all round: as plenty of other people have noted, Chloe Moretz steals the show as Hit Girl, and provides the best action in the film as well.All in all, powerful action, great humour, and an interesting story make Kick-Ass a fantastic film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Kick-AssThe reason why regular folks don't take up the mantle of super-hero is because empathy is their Kryptonite. Also, the hours suck.Luckily, the idealistic fan-boy in this bawdy comic book movie has the compassion, free time and health coverage needed to combat crime.Tired of his mild-mannered existence, awkward teen Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) dons an emerald guise and patrols the streets as Kick-Ass.Garnering celebrity due to a viral video depicting his brutal brand of justice, Kick-Ass soon attracts allies–Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloë Moretz)–and enemies–Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).Based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr., Kick-Ass is a cocksure concoction of sardonic scenarios, brutal violence and offensive annotations all masterfully mixed together by director Matthew Vaughn.Sadly, my own comic book alter ego would have to be the obsequious henchmen: Kiss-Ass.

Avoid at all cost,"I'm going to keep this short and simple. If you've read and loved the comics, stay away from this movie. They slaughter the story, they have some of the same key points but besides that they basically just took the story and decided to ruin it as much as possible. I understand them wanting to change certain aspects of the story such as the violence, but they did much more then that. The casting is terrible with the exception of Chloe Moretz, I loathed Aaron Johnson as kick-ass. He turned Kick-Ass into this self centered jerk who you want to see beat up, he would've been better as a mugger or bully.But like I said in short if you loved the comic you'll hate this movie I couldn't bare to watch it past the five minute mark.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"""You Wanna Play...?""","Being in Cinema management I had the foresight that Kick Ass was ""one to watch"". I saw some scenes at a Universal Film day and thought that it was warming up nicely...this film was never going to disappoint.Its Superbad with a sprinkling of Spiderman and Kill Bill. Kids in costume going on the offensive against the crime lords. It is well written and sparkles with gore and humour.The lead actor, Aaron Johnson is very Michael Cera-esquire but that is not a bad thing. It is a very fashionable film comedy era indeed and spoof movies are all grown up with emotion and deep characters.I think if I am being over critical some of the fight scenes were a blur and perhaps some better use of slow-motion effects might have broken this up.Definitely one of my favourite films of the year so far!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Well executed and entertaining.,"I have to say that Kick-Ass pretty much kicked ass. The previews for the movie are very misleading, it's not a spoof movie at all but rather it is a movie about would-be superheroes in the real world, sort of. Dave is a nerdy high school student that is perpetually being mugged outside the comic shop he frequents. Lamenting the fact that people often witness crimes and do nothing he decides to do what nobody has done before, become a superhero. Kick-Ass has no powers, no training, no gimmicks or gadgets, just a great deal of idealism and naivety, and that's all he needs.At first he is wildly unsuccessful, landing himself in the intensive care unit after attempting to stop a car theft. Eventually he manages to do some good and the video taken by onlookers becomes an internet sensation. This inspires Damon (Nicholas Cage) and his eleven year old daughter, Mindy, whom Damon has been training since she was five to be a combat expert, to join the fight against evil. Damon becomes Big Daddy, a cross between Batman and The Punisher, and Mindy becomes Hit Girl. The action sequences with Hit Girl are straight out of The Matrix. It is very surreal to watch an eleven year old dispatch bad guys with guns, knives, swords, and skilled martial arts, but it is very entertaining.The operations of the new superheroes put them into direct conflict with the local drug kingpin, Frank D'Amico. A series of traps, shootouts, deceptions, and brawls leads to the final climax of heroes vs. villains inside the skyscraper headquarters of the drug kingpin. Is the movie a satire? Perhaps, but I sense more that it is a reflection of the writer's wish that there really were superheroes. If you are offended by the idea of a little girl kicking ass and taking names I suggest you not see this film. However, if you like to be entertained I do recommend Kick-Ass.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
You have to see this movie if you like cinema!,"I had seen the movie for some time, and had in my mind it as one of the best things I had ever seen in the movies. After revealing it ... THIS REALLY IS THE PURE TRUTH! Let's try to start with ""top"". Matthew Vaugh's direction is impeccable, with few dialogues and scenes he manages to bring depth from the protagonist of the film, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Tayler- Johnson), to his friend with fewer lines, Todd (Evan Peters). Not as if this were any surprise, because I really want to live to see a bad movie directed by that man! Simply phenomenal !. I do not have anything to complain about in the script, there are no loose ends practically, and maybe even following a ""safe"" line, he looks different in his ""backbone,"" giving a face that we've never seen before for ""superheroes."" What today Deadpool is known to have done, and super lauded and credited, Kick-Ass had already mastered it more than half a decade before. So I think the timing of a film production is one of the things that makes it a big flop, or a big hit. Maybe it debuts today, Kick-Ass would just be ""one more"" because of the ""saturation"" of the industry, maybe if it had come out in the early 2000s, the movie would have been a gigantic flop, because the audience might not be Ready for it yet, and for the good fortune of all of us, this movie masterpiece came out exactly when it had to leave! I can not stop talking about the characters / actors, which are a high point as well. It would be impossible to speak of all here, but it is worth mentioning Aaron Johnson (the Kick-Ass), who holds the film with mastery, making us believe that he really is a nerdy misfit, even though not looking like one, and giving us laughter in Many moments, where the film makes that grace, making a mixture of ""R Comedy"" with action of a ""Tarantino level"". Chloe Moretz, (Hit Girl) is definitely in the role of her life, I've seen some other movies of her, and my God, this girl was really born for this role! With an air of ""innocent"" in some moments, but ""bad-ass"" in others (even for a 10-year-old girl), if the character is not the best, it is certainly one of the best things in the movie. And finally, a good movie always needs a big antagonist, and Mark Strong (Frank D'Amico) brings a villain stuffed with clichés of gangster movies, or even some superheroes around, but works extremely well in your proposal! Being a kind of walking whimper, which refers to countless other productions, the character is the ""cake cherry"" that the film needed (besides the final fight scene, where we really get scared by a certain character). Anyway, even NICOLAS CAGE will rock in that movie! Well, if you like heroes, or even if you like an excellent action movie, an excellent comedy, adventure movie ... actually: IF YOU LIKE CINEMA! You have to see this movie, everyone needs to see this movie, which comes up sloppy (like the protagonist at the beginning of the story) with only good intentions, and eventually becomes much bigger than I thought it could be .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Are you serious? Have mercy!!!,"This movie should come with a disclaimer ""Only for kids"". Having loved Christopher Mintz-Plasse in Superbad, I had high expectations from ""Kick Ass'. To say that I was tortured to the core would be an understatement. For one this is not a comedy. The lewd language makes it unsuitable for kids and the fairytale ending makes it unsuitable for adults or sane people. One would expect this title to get a 2.8 rather than 8.2 which it currently has at IMDb. There is virtually no story line for the movie. This is rather a weird slap-stick comedy. The director tries to make up for this by adding a few pointless emotions to the end. In short this is one movie one would like to forget. Or better still not watch.

Its that good it restored my faith in movies!!,"After many let downs over the last few years I was wondering where the next great movie was coming from.

Best film I've seen in a long time,"I'd seen the trailers to this film and they didn't give much away. If you've ever thought you could be a superhero then this is the film for you. The fantastic mix of comedy, emotion, parody and sheer downright awesomeness make this a film not to be missed.While high in comedy and creating some moments where I was doubled over while watching it the film doesn't pass up on scenes that draw you into the characters either. Sometimes the things you're laughing at are because if you didn't you'd cry. There's a dark gritty story behind the humour that can live up to Sin City, it's just put across in a different manner. As with all comic book superheros this one delivers the drama and background that make the heroics themselves just another part of fleshing out the individuals.The only way people could possibly pick fault with this film is with the language and gratuitous violence, but it fits in so well and makes the picture better for it.

A movie that truly Kicks-Ass,"Just back from Kick-Ass and all i can say is WOW what a blast, this has to be one of the best superhero movies ever made, dare i say it ""its up there with The Dark Knight"". The basic premise is simple, what we have is a geek that dreams of being a superhero, then one day he finally builds up the courage to go out there and fight crime, however he is very rusty around the edge's because he has no real training and therefor gets his Ass-Kicked from time to time, but the kid has heart.. He then comes across too other superhero's (Big Dady & Hit Girl) but they are the real deal, and they have been trained well especially Hit Girl. So what follows are these crime busting hero's who are out to get the bad guys and when the action hits, it hits hard. Not only does it work as a great action film it also works as a great comedy, and one of the cool things about the movie is that we really do care about the characters and what they go through. The overall look of the film is very slick, the violence in some parts are brutal but fun, and some of the set pieces towards the end are just OTT, but it all merges perfectly in the confinements of this beautiful comic book world..

"Morally reprehensible, NOT!","'KICK-ASS': Five Stars (Out of Five)This is one of those movies that you're so hyped up about after watching it that you can't wait to tell your friends and see it again! It's definitely a crowd pleas-er and seeing it with an enthusiastic overwhelmed audience only enhances the effect of the movie. The film is a darkly comedic and excessively violent superhero satire based on the popular comic book of the same name (By Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.).It tells the story of an average nerdy high schooler named Dave Lizewski (played by Aaron Johnson) who's so obsessed with comic books and super-heroes that he decides to become one. In his first attempt he's severely beaten and injured but much of his damaged body is replaced by steel implants which make him much more successful his second time out. He has no real powers but he wears a green costume and can take a serious beating. After being caught on tape and made famous to the entire world Dave, known as 'Kick-Ass' to the rest of the world, becomes an inspiration to people everywhere including a father, Damon Macready (played by a scene stealing Nicolas Cage), bent on revenge against the town mob boss (played by Mark Strong). Macready and his eleven year old daughter Mindy (played by the very impressive Chloe Moretz), whom he's trained to be a killing machine since birth, dawn superhero costumes of their own as 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' and wage a war against the local crime ring which 'Kick-Ass' is believed responsible for.The film is raunchy, hilarious, surprisingly emotionally dramatic at times and just an action packed blast to watch. It's extremely well written and directed (by Matthew Vaughn, of 'LAYER CAKE' and 'STARDUST' fame) and this is by far his best work yet. The film, like I said, is excessively violent and is probably the most violent super-hero movie ever made. It's been criticized by some for this reason but I think these critics are missing the point. The film is a great gift to comic book and super-hero fans everywhere and is already one of the most popular films ever in this genre (according to IMDb user ratings).It's one of those movies that perfectly builds tension and then releases to the utmost satisfaction to the viewer. The score is perfect, the pacing and editing is perfect and the movie just hits all the right notes for it's near 2 hour running time perfectly. It's a classic that I'm sure will be remembered and loved for many years to come and anyone who criticizes it for it's so called 'offensive content' isn't watching the movie for what it really is; an inspirational and satirical ode to comic books and super-heroes; a masterpiece in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pmr_F8e44c",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Nothing can prepare for what you are about to watch.......KICK-ASS ...yeah,"It was a virtual certainty, just like Joker said that Gotham will never be the same again, because Batman had changed everything forever by showing Gotham the true colours of the criminals, by the same token, Chris Nolan with his Dark Knight has changed forever how we view super heroes, by showing us the true colours of other super heroes and how hilarious they have been so far, not to say sorry excuses at being called movies.And the result is Kick-Ass. Raw, dark, terrifyingly enjoyable and above all action packed with lots of blood and gory. In fact, the rawness of the movie may even be found offending and objectionable to the old school movie goers.This movie is not a superhero movie that you watch with your children. It will not make you laugh (although there are some funny scenes), because it is not meant to make you laugh. It is not meant to be a Superman or Spiderman type of super hero movie too. It is something else, something of its own kind, unique even. Maybe, it has created its own genre... so that, when a movie like this is made again, we can say that its 'Kick-Ass' type.My advise, and this is from someone who has watched many movies of all genres over the years, if you like superhero movies, please don't watch Kick-Ass, because after watching it you can never go back and watch those movies again. You will find them funny at least, and irritating at worst. But if you are willing to cross your frontiers and watch something which will leave you short of words when you're done, gasping for breath, sweating, adrenaline pumping...then my advise: watch it...and tell the others who are as crazy as us....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This isn't hyped at all - it's genuinely excellent,"Watched it tonight, it is indeed very very good and surprised me. In some ways the trailer is misleading - it's definitely very funny, no doubt about that, but it's very dark in places. I'd say only very early scenes are played for laughs. A lot of the scenes in the second half are full of suspense and only have 'light relief' for humour. It's comic in the sense that, say, Snatch is. If anything it plays out like a gangster film, with goodies and baddies taking turns to have the upper hand. Certainly several places were brit-crime-flick in tone. (Before you ask, yes it does work along side the equally strong 'teen comedy' side of things - he's unwittingly drawn into this murky world)It was great to see the shot and dialogue nods to, well, just about every famous superhero film - usually quite subtly (I recognised some shots, although can't place from where), occasionally knowingly.This definitely isn't a gimmick film - it's exceptionally well made, with an excellent story with no 'stupid' plot bits to think of, fantastic acting and characters you care for. Some of the action scenes are truly superb, and all different - there's some very imaginative stuff going on here. The trailer definitely doesn't have all the best bits (something I was worried about)Actually, more I think about it, the more I think I've watched something superb tonight. Great entertainment and an excellent film. 9/10As an aside, come to think of it, if the entire film was no-substance entertainment, like the trailer might imply, then there's no way critics would be getting such high praise - it would be getting 3/5, 6/10 etc.. Empire and Total Film have given it 5 and 4 stars because it's an exceptionally good film. Simple as that!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Nutshell Review: Kick-Ass,"What makes this film stand out besides its plot which has maintained its essence from the comic book narrative, is how the characters got introduced and developed for this roller coaster ride. There are enough ups and downs as we follow the protagonist Dave Lizewski aka Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), who decides to take on the vigilante superhero persona because besides being fodder for bullies, he feels that it's time someone in the big city had the balls to stand up for the little man, with mask and some special ability of course, which in a way he obtains through the school of hard knocks for imbeciles, the first incident which indicates just how straight Vaughn will play the film out without unnecessary, cliché bullshit, which will raise some eyebrows at first, before you realize and be thankful that clichés are going to be out of the window.For all his shortcomings, Dave serves up enough pathos almost equivalent of a cooler Peter Parker, sharing similar concerns and pangs as a schooling and growing teenager, only without the input of a radioactive spider. It's true when you put on a uniform that it can compel you to turn into someone else, and watching Dave stumble through that, with his taser and Eskrima sticks, you can't help but to feel for his character, and to eventually root for him to achieve something other than Youtube/Myspace glory.Then there's the ""real deal"" heroes in the film, led by Nicolas Cage in a Batman lookalike costume. We know Cage had lost out on his opportunity to play Superman, so his Big Daddy isn't that bad after all, in what I thought was one of his fun, contemporary characters to date, especially when there's a really poignant backstory fleshed out through superb comic book panels, and tells of why he's so dogged in his pursuit to bring down the villainous drug dealer Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). McLovin' Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist also departs from his usual pigeon-holed typecast and gets primed to showcase a lot more despite his limited screen time, so it's quite nice to see him step out of his comfort zone, and step up to the plate.The one who clearly stole the thunder from everyone though, is Chloe Moretz's role as Hit- Girl, the uber-violent, take no prisoners vigilante with a foul mouth to go along with her martial arts skills. Raised under exceptional circumstances, she's a would-be assassin from day one, and owns just about every action sequence that she gets to flex her muscles in. There hasn't been a child character that had exuded so much caution thrown to the wind, and that's what makes her role refreshing (some parents will frown upon naturally), especially when her alter-ego is a cute, innocent looking schoolgirl who is obviously more than meets the eye, and one that comes with a glint of mischief as well. She's the biggest ass-kicker in the film, and she rocks big time, with the best lines, and the best moves. A definite favourite who has the potential to seal this film into cult fandom, the Fannings and the Breslins better sit up and take note!To say anything more of the story will be to give it away, but suffice to say it also dealt with the modern day apathy, and obsession with popularity, online hits and virtual friends, where you find no-one lifting a finger to help a fellow man in need, but plenty of those standing around the sidelines recording everything for a youtube upload. It's almost anti-superhero in a way with its take on copycat wannabes who get into an awful lot of needless trouble, and deglamorizes or even shatters whatever notion that we earthly mortals will have about powers, to confine it within our dreams. It takes on the what-ifs, and plays it out in almost realistic terms on the kind of trouble we would expect, with threats obviously made to loved ones should secret identities be exposed, and that we'd really be psychopaths of sorts if we were to don a costume and start fighting crime in it, like the characters here who are living our fantasies, on screen.Fused with great comedic timing and a rocking contemporary soundtack, my verdict of this film is that this Kick-Ass kicks ass aplenty! Oh, there's a Singapore connection in the film as well, so keep your eyes peeled when the end credits are rolling. I'm quite confident this film will have a placing in my shortlist for the best of the year when the dust settles. Highly recommended, don't miss this, and yeah, the M18 rating means this film gets released here uncut, so kudos to the distributors for not opting to dumb down the level of violence and profanity, which will butcher the film badly, and rob it of a layer of Kick-Ass-ness!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kick-Ass - Fighting for justice 25/8...,"Matthew Vaughn's (Layer Cake) latest film is an insane concoction of action, comedy, romance and drama under one big superhero-genre roof. Based on Mark Millar's comic of the same name, 'Kick-Ass' follows Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), your typical male teenager, who follows through on every boy, child and grown man's dream of becoming a superhero (despite the fact that unlike most modern-day superhero's, Dave has not one extraordinary power or ability what-so-ever). Throw into the mix a Father-Daughter vigilante team, a love-interest, a wannabe superhero with an ulterior motive and a crime boss antagonist, and you have a pretty god-damn fun film worth two hours of your time.Dave and his friends (Clark Duke, Evan Peters) are nobodies. They are the emblematic high-school students who waltz through their school hallways day-after-day, week-after-week, undetected by those at the peak of the social hierarchy including the attractive Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca). Bored of simply keeping a tissue conglomerate in business, Dave decides to take up the challenge of showing everybody that anybody with a costume can be a 'superhero' and thus his crime-fighting alter-ego of Kick-Ass is born. However Dave isn't the only costume-crusader cruising the streets as Big Daddy and Hit-Girl team (Nicolas Cage, Chloe Moretz) together, as any modern father and daughter would, by fighting the bloody fight with their own purpose in mind. The main focus of their combined anger is resident crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) who will stop at nothing to make sure his merchandise reaches the streets. While Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) also eventually joins in the fun, piggy-backing of Kick-Ass's success.The true genius of Vaughn and Goldman's adaptation from page-to-screen is that they manage to brilliantly combine elements of pure violent action, touching emotional relationships and moments of comedy to break the ice between brains being scattered and tears being shed. The on-screen violence is brutal, unflinching and in your face, like a shotgun blast to your temple. From stabbings to the odd, inadvertent, accidental suicide, each action sequence is perfectly orchestrated to create maximum enjoyment. While true moments of tender, emotional realisations and witty teenage banter counter-act the vicious nature of this film, which is as disturbing as it poignant at times, especially when you're transitioning from a brutal beating, to an awkward father-son moment within minutes. It all adds to 'Kick-Ass's' quirky, little charm however.Despite attempting to be a 'superhero' by night, by day Dave is still a normal teenager searching for his true identity, and of course, that elusive first girlfriend. Aaron Johnson plays this part perfectly, to the extent in which we should all be able to find a side of Dave to identify with (we were all young once...). Whilst despite competent performances from the veterans; Mark Strong and Nicolas Cage, the true gem of this piece is Chloe Moretz, the young girl who plays the hit-girl beyond her own age to a beautifully tragic tee. Hit-Girl is a ballsy, yet brilliant character who shows the audience that young girls on the big-screen don't simply need to be emotional vessels or tragic victims (this could potentially lead to the rise of the aggressive, twelve year old protagonists!), but they can be as dangerous as the adults that hope to protect them.Probing the depths of the superhero genre in which many fear to tread, 'Kick-Ass' is something different which works pretty darn well. It's a violent superhero film, with a lot of heart and many hilarious moments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Inception and Toy Story 3 seriously have their work cut out.,"I'm not going to repeat the plot outline because that's been done in all the other reviews so I'll make this short and sweet. Kick-Ass has raised the bar for the rest of the summer films headed our way. If any of them are as entertaining as this, then I'll sell the computer I'm typing this on. Every character is so well done, the action is top-drawer and the dialogue, well, it's razor sharp. Especially anything that comes out of Hit-Girl's mouth.And it really is her movie. Chloe Moretz is one hell of a discovery and is destined to be forever remembered for this role, her debut, and THAT line. She simply dominates every scene she's in and is one-to-watch for the future. Her along with Nic Cage are simply outstanding and it's so nice to see an actor of his calibre doing something decent after what seems like an eternity of making dross. Mark Strong is also brilliant and actually gets some of the films best lines.I can't find fault with this film. As well as being a)very, very funny and b)a corking action picture it is also a very subtle critique on the whole notion of celebrity and wanting to be famous and the crazed impersonators it encourages and the resulting swamp of money that can be made from it. But that's not really the point of Kick-Ass now is it? It's an entertainment first and foremost and I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a film that was this much fun. The blackest of humour, the slickest comic-book violence - all put together with oodles of confidence by Matthew Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman, who after Layer Cake, Stardust and now this, are fast becoming the best creative double-act in Britain. It only makes you wonder what Vaughn could have done with X-Men 3, considering the budget for that was about $150m and Kick-Ass had a budget of $28m. After Kick-Ass, the movie world will hopefully be his oyster, and rightly so.Kick-Ass is out in the UK already but to readers from the US, you should be very excited, because you're about to get your ass kicked by the first genuine candidate for film of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Easily one of the best superhero flicks as well as one of my personal favorites,"I'm typing this review now even though this movie came out four years back, as I have just gotten an IMDb account. That being said, I just had to write a review for it.When I first saw Kick-Ass previews, I expected little more than a critical failure like many comic book adaptations. As reviews began pouring in, I decided to give it a shot. This was one of the best cinematic decisions I have made.First off, it is extremely R rated. F bombs left and right, tons of gore, and all around adult content. This made it extremely funny albeit vulgar, as well as extremely entertaining.Second is the score. I don't know what it is but it is one of the best scores I have ever heard. Catchy, epic, and at times chilling, it makes for a perfect atmosphere for a superhero trying to find himself.The movie is quite comical, yet surprisingly takes a rather epic, and serious turn as it progresses. This made me come away from the movie much more impacted than I would expect. My friends have grown tired of me talking about how good it is, and I recommend everyone to watch it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Superoheroes without Superpowers,"¨ Had I ever been a real super hero? The most I'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking. With no power comes no responsibility, except that wasn't true. ¨ (9/10) Director Matthew Vaughn has done a fantastic job once again directing this super hero movie, where these heroes actually don't have anything super about them. This is Vaughn's third feature film after directing Stardust and Layer Cake, and both films were received warmly by the critics and audiences alike. I have to admit that I really loved this ultra-violent movie and was really entertained throughout the entire film. Hit-Girl makes Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill look like an amateur. Of course we don't have the Tarantino dialogue with this film, but the action and the performances are highly entertaining. Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn adapted the screenplay from Mark Miller's comic book of the same name. Miller's previous comic book, Wanted, was also made into a film starring Angelina Jolie, but I think Kick-Ass is far more superior and probably one of my favorite movies of the year. Yes, the violence is gratuitous and the language is strong, but watching this 11 year old girl fighting all these criminals is just priceless. She steals every scene she is in. This is not your regular super hero movie and definitely not one you will want to miss because it is an extremely fun ride. In my opinion Kick-Ass is last year's Zombieland combining violence with comedy. Many people were turned down by the violence and the language in this movie, so I know it is not for everyone, but I think that what Matthew Vaughn did in this film was just brilliant, and one can tell he is influenced by his close friend Guy Ritchie.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an ordinary kid who isn't very popular in school. He hangs around with two of his close friends, Marty (Clark Duke, Hot Tub Machine) and Todd (Evan Peters), reading and visiting comic book stores. Dave begins to wonder why no one decides to become a super hero and fight crime. Despite not having any special powers or any fighting abilities whatsoever he decides to become a masked vigilante and calls himself Kick-Ass. One day while he is on his super hero duty he encounters a couple of thieves and tries to stop them from stealing a car. Kick-Ass gets seriously injured and ends up in a hospital. Several metal plates are put in his body due to all his fractures, and they actually make him a little more resistible to punches. Little does Dave know that there actually two other masked vigilantes with vast experience on fighting organized crime. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his highly trained eleven year old daughter, Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) have been fighting against a mafia boss named Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong, Sherlock Holmes). One day the three masked heroes meet and they give Kick-Ass some advice on the business. Kick-Ass seems to have inspired other people to become super heroes and suddenly there is a new one in the streets who calls himself Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is actually Frank's son. None of these super heroes actually have any special power and the violence begins to escalate as the movie progresses, but always combining it with a great dose of comedy.The true star of the film is Chloe Moretz who plays the eleven year old Hit-Girl who is highly trained in fighting and instead of playing with dolls, she plays with knives. She is just fun to watch on screen and one of my new favorite characters. Nicolas Cage is also good playing the eccentric Big Daddy and Aaron Johnson is great in the lead role. Kick-Ass can be compared to Clive Owen's Shoot Em Up because of all the cartoonish violence on screen, but I found it more similar to Kill Bill, although with a much more climatic ending. I found the dialogue to be quite funny and mixed well with the action scenes. The movie isn't deep and you probably can't get anything out of it, but it is highly entertaining and such a fun experience. I haven't been this entertained in a long time and Kick-Ass is one of those movies I wouldn't mind watching over and over again. I definitely recommend this film and know it will be hard to top entertainingly wise.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Kid Kicks-Ass, boy does SHE kick-ass!","The great thing about movies that enter the realm of super heroes is that nothing is over the top. Anything goes, and that is precisely why I read comics while growing up. The sixties were a different era of course, and I could only afford new books on Saturday. But I spent the entire afternoon reading them. It was a time to let the imagination roam unfettered. Time would seem as if suspended while I studied and imagined the world beyond a single frame or page. So with 'Kick-Ass', I did exactly as I did so many years ago. Sit back and hopefully, watch in awe.The movie opens slowly, and a foundation is laid out. This is very important due to many not having read the 'Kick-Ass' series. I had never heard of it. But the premise intrigued me and that was enough. So, in a sense, I was back to the Saturday afternoon atmosphere of seeing things for the first time, as they unfolded. And unfold they did.The rise of 'Kick-Ass' was due to frustration with the status-quo. You don't have to be into comics to understand this. However, it is the second ingredient to becoming 'Kick-Ass' (courage) that is uncommon. So young Dave (Aaron Johnson) has decided to change his world and the catalyst is the comic book super hero world he lives for. He creates an alter-ego 'Kick-Ass' and sets out to make a difference in his world. Along the way, he'll meet allies, adversaries and find that recognition can be a two-edged sword.Each page of 'Kick-Ass' yields additions to the film that are a surprise and very welcome. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fine as the ignored son of the local mob boss (Mark Strong) who reckons he'll be reckoned with one way or another. Nicholas Cage plays a comic book writer who has the added task of raising a daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) alone. Chloe is a young dynamo who also happens to steal the movie (apologies to all the talent assembled, she is that good). I'm not getting into the characters here because you really need to watch the movie and let the story evolve.The film is based on the Mark Millar comic book series. The writers worked closely with Millar . And for their efforts to bring forth a fresh and lively story to an old genre, writer Jane Goldman and writer-director, Matthew Vaughn have succeeded wildly. Oh and there will be more of these movies to come, that you can be sure of. After all, there's a charismatic thirteen year old girl who simply must entertain the world, one more time before getting back to school.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Amazing movie, on par with Watchmen for me","I give this a 9/10 because it's a movie that doesn't take a graphic novel or comic book series and butcher it (i.e. Spiderman, loved the first two differences aside but the third was disgusting.) or the X-Men. Although varying in places from the comic books in which it's based, Kick-Ass stays true to the source material much more often than it doesn't, resulting in a great mixture of comedy, action, and suspenseful scenes that make you wonder what's going to happen next.For those of you who think the violence is over the top and too graphic, you need only watch movies like Watchmen or any other R-rated comic-book film. Chances are the violence is there because it was there in the comics, as is the case with Kick-Ass. Dumbing down the violence for a movie based on an equally violent comic would be doing the true fans of the series a great injustice and at the end of the day, those who decide to tackle movies based on comic-books are often great fans themselves.If you don't enjoy a lot of graphic violence, you can opt out of seeing this movie, but remember it's not there to be ""hip"" as some reviewers are saying, it's there because it's supposed to be there to keep the movie faithful to the source.I hope this review helps!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly excellent,"Finally a film that lives up to the promise of the trailer! This film is more than just very funny and terrific (and very gory)entertainment, it has hidden depths.It's a journey that starts from light-hearted funny teen-comedy then gradually becomes deeper, darker and more powerful as it goes on. I actually found the last 30 minutes or so to be powerful and emotionally moving.The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed, the visual style is beautiful, the music is absolutely perfect - the combination of all 3 in synergy at times touch on perfect cinema and had me laughing with tears in my eyes - only a few films have ever achieved this.Acting performances are also top-notch.In short you get what you expect (refreshingly so) from this movie, and surprisingly a whole lot more!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
What Kicked Ass in Kick-Ass,"I don't know about other people, but my expectations were so-so for the film, because all too often comic type films never meet expectations. Well there were so many things about this film that were absolutely great. Lets make a list of things in this move that actually Kick- Ass:WHAT KICKED ASS IN KICK-ASS 1. soundtrack - so many great artists, and it goes seamlessly with the film. 2. nic cage - turns in a great performance for a character that provides several goosebumps moments, at least to me. 3. Chloe Moritz - amazing newcomer to me, but she was spot on in her relationship with her father. watching her and big daddy made me feel like i was watching kill bill, but better. 4. what gore - i didn't think it was as gory as everyone made it out to be, but it was still pretty intense. 5. fight sequences - outstanding! 6. acting - Andrew Johnson, as Dave/kick-ass actually does a great job holding the film together. the only other time i saw him in a film was for the illusionist, and he says like 5 words. 7. mood swings - the plot line is quite solid, as the film progresses nicely with next to no slow points. the story is told well, and for a comic/drama/comedy it created strong emotional changes for not only me but in the characters too. 8. cinematography - great camera work, very commendable.You take this film for what its worth and realize its not Oscar material, but it is super well done for its purpose to entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Have fear. They're here.,"Kick ass simply kicked ass! Its far more than just a superhero spoof....Its a hysterical comedy/action. It reaches out to all those teens or maybe even adults that have always dreamt of actually being a superhero! One thing thats certain, it will keep you laughing without a doubt and another thing i was actually surprised by some of the action, real cool and slick at times.If not the best comedy/action ever made, its a shoe in for 2nd place!Going to see the film i had no major expectations, in fact i thought of it as another 'high budget' comedy film (which seem to be noway near as funny as the 'low budget' comedies) but i was actually surprised, the result was AWESOME! Definitely worth 2 hours of my life and a couple of moneys from my wallet! Matthew Vaughn has suddenly blasted through the Hollywood barriers, Congrats to him on such a great summer flick!If your wondering what this film has to offer, let me give you a little taste; Silly unpopular 'invisible' nerds trying to become superheroes, a outrages cast, cool and funny action scenes, a hysterical script and a movie that for once exceeds most peoples expectation! Did i miss anything?All in all this movie is a cross-over of superbad and superhero movie and is far better then both of them put together! Its a feel good movie and it deserves the hype that it received. Ill recommend for anyone who has a thing called sense of humour. A great feel good summer flick for teens and grown ups.

Kick Ass by name and by nature.,"Kick Ass starts from a promising point of view.What if anyone could take to the streets and exact protection or retribution in the role commonly associated with superheroes? Hmmm. Nice.What if most of these were kids? Hmmm nicer.What if some of them were ultra-tooled-up-mafia-hunting-vigilantes? Hmmm. Excellent.That's what you get with Kick Ass. It's a Smorgasbrod of superheroes from Dark Knight-esquire Batman (in 11 year old girl's clothes humming along to a Tarantino soundtrack) to a young Steve Martin in The Jerk-like loser role.And that's what makes this film ROCK. It really does. Its bad language is at times shriek out loud funny. ""Is that all you C**** have got?"" yells 11 year old Hit Girl as she pumps lead into more brains than an episode of University Challenge.""Take that you Mother F******."" When she gets angry.Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) is the movie-stealing find of the decade. She is gobsmackingly in your face as she DESTROYS hundreds of armed thugs (think O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill, or even better her teenage sidekick Gogo Yubari).It's completely out of order, off the scale, outrageous and freakin' hilarious.Nicolas Cage is great as a scheming and revenging madman. The scene where he practices firing pump action bullets into Hit Girl's chest is unique and remarkable.This is a great movie. It sags a touch in the second act but opens and closes like a wounded rhino.See.At all costs.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The most surprised I've ever been at a film.,"When I saw the ad campaign over here in England, it was marketed as just the sort of film I'd turn my nose up at and wouldn't take any notice of. The campaign showed the 2 or 3 slapstick or obviously funny moments from the film, and I immediately dismissed it as being another ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""Step Brothers"" type film. That's why I saw it a whole 2 months after release. I'd heard good things about it from a few friends so thought I'd give it a go.This film is just stunning. It's the antithesis to the dark knight, which I kind of enjoyed, but it is the most over-rated film of all time. This is possibly the most under-rated. There have only been a handful of films that have gone any sort of distance to changing me as a person, and it seems odd to be putting this film in the same venn diagram as the likes of the Shawshank Redemption, Fight Club etc... but as the end credits rolled, I was left with that numb feeling I live for, and found myself thinking about my own life, and what it could be.If you haven't seen Kick-Ass, that's going to seem like a chronic exaggeration, but in my opinion, it deserves everything I've just written plus more.Kick-Ass just has everything. Some of the best direction I've seen in years from Matthew Vaughn, who is hardly a familiar face in the film industry, which just sings his praises even more. When you add to that some genius camera-work, a script that grabs you by the nuts from scene one and doesn't let go, and some terrific acting (particularly from newcomer Chloe Moretz as the oh so lovable but oh so vicious hit-girl), and also one of my favourite ever soundtracks from John Murphy, Ilan Eshkeri, and others, you've really got a quite frankly stunning film.If you read this and go and watch Kick Ass, you may not enjoy it as much as I did, but I defy anyone to sit through it's 2 hour duration without laughing, crying, shouting, or just smiling at it's sheer epicness. I did all 4.Any film that makes me leave the cinema and want to ditch my profession to fight crime in my town gets my vote. Absolutely brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Seriously??,Are you freaking kidding me with this garbage? First I could only make it to the 40 minute mark before stopping this nonsense. I did not find any of it entertaining in any way. Then you have a small child dressed like a superhero and chopping people up? No wonder the actress looks and behaves like a sociopath in everything I have seen her in. What kind of parents would let their child do a movie like this? Absolute trash. And I see there was a part 2?

A Superhero flick with interesting twist,"A nerdy boy becomes a super hero who first get his ass kicked and then kicks some bad boys ass. Which in itself isn't so new but this movie has a few twist to make it interesting.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a nothing guy who has a hard time getting any attention in school. One day he decides to buy a super hero costume off the internet and dubs himself Kick Ass. His first attempts at being a hero are absolutely inept but he gets the local media attention and Kick Ass becomes a well known man about town. He stumbles upon a father Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage) daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) super hero team who are after the towns bad man(Mark Strong).This movie is extremely violent the way Robocop was, but here most of the violence is done by 11 year old Hit Girl.

Kicking ass and taking names,"A FEW years ago all we had to satisfy our titular comic book fantasies on the big screen was a baby-faced Toby Maguire prancing around in a red spandex suit. Now it would seem we are spoilt for choice as the age of the comic book sets into full, unflinching flow. The latest panel to film conversion is indie flick Kick Ass. This however, is a different coloured set of spandex altogether. Rated with a 15 certificate, it's not one of the family friendly comic tales of which the world has become accustomed to of late. Instead, it is a rough and tumble, action packed adventure with copious helpings of in-your-face violence and colourful profanities from unexpected mouths. Regular American high school student and comic book fan Dave Lizewski lives a simple life alone with his father. Personal trials, hardships and popularity aren't problems which really factor into Dave's life, until one day he decides to become a super hero - without powers or training. This simple concept opens up a realm of possibilities which resonate on a more personal level with an audience who live in the same universe, as opposed to the eccentricities of the Marvel and DC worlds portrayed in previous comic book adaptations. Because of this, the hilarity of the situations Kick-Ass finds himself in are amplified tenfold; giving the audience a more realistic, often painful, representation of what being a real-life super hero would be like. It would seem Dave is not alone in his quest either. He soon runs into crime-fighting duo Big Daddy and Hit Girl, a father-daughter combo of devastating proportions. Veteran Nicholas Cage gives a suitably high quality performance as the doting Dad tutoring his lethal little girl, but the plaudits from most critics have gone to 13-year-old Chloe Moretz, who was only 12 at the time of filming. Her role and performance will inevitably be redolent of previous young starlets like Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver and Natalie Portman in Leon. All of Moretz's co-stars and crew have heaped praise on the youngster, with many confessing to being forced into raising their game at the risk of being acted off screen by the pocket-sized puncher. Samurai swords and ninja throwing stars are Hit Girl's weapons of choice, and she is a dab hand at using them. Slicing and dicing her way through hoards of bad guys, Big Daddy's daughter carries out her job with an unflinching, hard-as-nails attitude. However, the small hero is also where the film draws the bulk of its controversy. One scene in particular sees Hit Girl beckoning more baddies on by calling them a four letter profanity currently considered one of the language's worst. Those who stir the controversy though are, for the most part,those who have not seen the film but only heard about this on-paper noteworthy situation. Those who then see Kick-Ass though, will probably employ hindsight as they realise the subtle yet evident portent of emotional hardship Hit Girl has had to endure as she grew up with her father in prison. As such, the language she uses is not for the shock effect on its audience, but more a faithful reprise of the comic book character's melancholic upbringing. Moving away from the controversy, a potential sidekick of questionable morals in the form of Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse arrives to help Kick-Ass in his quest. Red Mist is the on screen son of super (yet still normal) villain Frank D'Amico, played by the ever despicable Mark Strong. The rich kid son, desperate to please his father, goes undercover to infiltrate Kick-Ass' superhero circle and provides some classic hilarity as he finds out that being a scrawny comic book nerd is not the best qualification for becoming a superhero. The film's grounded reality is its most empirical feature. At first glance, Kick-Ass' costume looks like a wet-suit you could pick up on ebay with a few extra pads stuck on. At second glance it turns out that that's exactly what it is. His first attempt at super heroism consequently ends up getting him hospitalised and throughout the film he keeps his homely characteristics that make him a normal teenage boy, all the while developing the courage and bravery of a true superhero. Grittily realistic is an adjective too far though. The film strikes a perfect balance between apathetic realism and over-the-top, completely un-PC action. Seeing Big Daddy teach Hit Girl how to 'take a bullet' by shooting her with a machine gun while she has a bullet-proof vest on is something that, for all the world an audience feels it should be shocked and appalled at, but the conviction and temerity of the characters make it utterly hilarious. The story plays on an interesting concept which the majority of its audience will find easy to relate to: The overwhelming desire to become a super hero in real life. The fact that the movie was commissioned before the third edition of the comic was even published and its first story arc completed speaks volume's about Kick Ass' potential as a low budget blockbuster destined for infinite critical acclaim. Perhaps the film is not one for the more conservative viewers who like their super heroes well-spoken and family-friendly (Aside from French audiences, who can see the same Kick-Ass at their local cinemas with a PG certificate), but it remains an absolute must for anyone outside of that classification. Spider Man and Batman are everything a super hero movie should be, and this movie is absolutely nothing like them, which is its crowning achievement. In Kick-Ass, writer Mark Millar has managed to create a viable alternative to the super hero norm which matches the quality of those clad in tight costumes who have come before it in a completely different, radical way. Just don't go getting any ideas...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kicked arse,"I wasn't expecting to like ""Kick-ass"". Why did you buy it then? I hear you cry! Well, because ""Stella"" was doing this fantastic offer where you can choose from 40 DVD's and get one for the price of a text (which is only 10p or so woohoo! P.S. There are other great alcoholic beverages apart from ""Stella""). So I thought ooh, I'll try this one even though I'm probably going to absolutely hate it even though loads of people say it's great. It turns out that I absolutely loved it and by the end of it I was quoting Lynne, ""FANTASTIC, LOVED IT! LOVED IT!"" Whilst nodding my body like one of those desktop bird things. Anyway, you won't know what I'm on about because I don't even know myself.Now I've rabbited on for a whole paragraph about nothing really so let's get on to the film. I was scared that i wasn't going to like it because A. I don't like superheroes, B. It's in-your-face awkward yanky humour that's portrayed on the TV spots won't be to my taste C. I hate comic adaptations (hello ""Watchmen"") and D. Nicholos Cage is in it. Thankfully all of these letters were not a problem one bit. ""Kick-ass"" should be commended for its inability to portray something that seems completely believable but at the same time be incredibly outrageous, like ""The human Centipede 2"". I was really impressed with how gorgeously the film was written (by Johanathan Woss' wife no less, she's obviously got more talent than him... Bloody busy body) it had a fantastic story to tell which blends humour, action and brilliant characters almost perfectly.""Kick-ass"" was also exactly my humour. As soon as Nicholas Cage shot his daughter in the chest I knew this film was going to be fine-diddly-ine. ""Kick-ass"" is really funny at times, and most importantly at the appropriate times. It keeps it's entertaining story and action sequences separate from the humour so that it doesn't become too over-powering and interferes with the story.""Kick-ass"" did kind of seem reminiscent of ""Watchmen"", it's almost as if this is what ""Watchmen"" should've been. Because whereas ""Watchmen"" is a dreary, pathetic yarn which takes itself way, way, way too seriously. ""Kick-ass"" is an hour and 50 minutes of pure entertainment, it's never boring and is always engaging and exciting. i really didn't want it to end with it's incredible action sequences and brilliantly drawn characters. The directing was really impressive and almost Quentin Tarantino-esque as it did have that ""Kill Bill"" kind of quality to it.""Kick-ass"" may also seem very kiddish on the cover but please don't let this anywhere near young viewers. It really doesn't hold back on its insane violence and profanity's. ""Kick-ass"" did get a hard time in the press because of Hitgirl who's basically a mini Uma Thurman from ""Kill Bill"". They didn't think it was appropriate to let a child swear and assassinate so many people, but you know what? It's all a bit of fun, and people should open there eyes and not take life quite so seriously.Like I said, ""Kick-ass"" is the complete opposite to what i thought it would be. I never thought that I'd be sitting here giving it a 10/10 and glowing report. It is perfect in a way. It's directed brilliantly, written fantastically, it has a fabulous soundtrack as well as characters we can all care about. ""Kick-ass"" is pure entertainment and is the ultimate experience in fun as well as having an interesting story put there. If you thought you'd never like it, give it a go.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
With Great Fanboyishness Comes Great Responsibility,"Everything before the appearance of Hit Girl was at least interesting, after that the head of the movie goes so far up its own ass, it can perform its own colonoscopy, which it then proceeds to do, as what I'm sure some would call satire. Mark Millar's hacky writing that's made him a 5th tier mainstream comic writer is present here as ever. If this is a good adaptation of the comic (which I gave up on after issue 2) then it's a faithful adaptation of a bad book. ""Mystery Men"" and ""Blank Man"" with a little girl who calls people a ""c&^t"" and plenty of references to YouTube-is that what's passing for edgy and original these days...agro Juno? The strain of creatively impoverished Millar writing can be traced from ""Wanted"", to ""Kick Ass"" and the Iron Man franchise. For instance, Samuel L. Jackson is in the new ""Iron Man 2"" because Millar had artists model their new Nick Fury after him in his ""Ultimate's"" comic's series. When Alan Moore says that modern comics are now just a spawning ground for bigger commercial properties and merchandise, Millar is looking more and more the eager grounds keeper. His books come with headshots in mind.""With Kick-Ass, the books just out and now the movie's out six weeks later. And I think that's the way things are going to go now, because to go to Marvel's B and C-list characters and try to get movies out them – what's the point of that?""-Mark Millar. I know this is the way Kubrick went about ""2001"", but this ain't 2001. Concerning, B and C, characters I would gladly take a ""Howard the Duck"" sequel any day over Super-Bad kid doing the world's worst Batman quote at the end of a movie.As for Mathew Vaughn as director, ""Kick Ass"" combines the worst of his last two films; the Guy Richie rip off of ""Layer Cake"" is now replaced by embarrassingly brazen Tarantino worship, and the stiffeled/self-congratulatory attempts at graphic-novel adaptation in ""Stardust"" is present and accounted for here. Vaughn financed the film himself, so calling this a soulless studio product isn't accurate or necessary. Bad indie movies get made too...agro Juno is actually more accurate than I suspected when I started writing this.At the beginning Kick-Ass tells us how he isn't like your daddy's super-heroes no alien origins or dead parents to avenge, no powers or skills etc., but an hour later, were cheering on Hit-Girl's Matrix/28 Days Later/Silence Of The Lambs/Kill Bill reference laden revenge for her slaughtered father, and watching jet-packs streak across the sky. Roger Ebert went too far connecting ""Kick-Ass"" to Columbine and Virginia Tech. A movie can be bad without being the end of western civilization, and though Kick-Ass isn't very good. Children and Old people swearing will always have produce a knee jerk ironic laugh, like a fat man with high pitched voice, or a short person with a deep Barry White voice, and so Kick-Ass has it's moments of amusement(largely thanks to Nicolas Cage).With great fan-boyishness comes great responsibility, and if super-heroes have any meaning at all, it should be about more than just kicking ass. If your reply to that ""But then what else is there?"", then just forget everything I've said, this is the movie for you.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This movie was GREAT.,"I saw this movie come up on my Netflix On Demand 'recommended' list, and thought I'd give it a shot. Of course, I had already heard all about it and was definitely curious to see what all the hype was about, and although I do enjoy the genre in general, I was certainly not expecting to love this movie as much as I did. In fact, one might say that I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it.Yes, I know it's wrong to see an eleven year old girl gleefully dismember bad guys. Yes, I know that vigilantism is nothing to advocate. And yes, I also know that if an average high school nerd put on a pair of tights and decided to fight crime, he'd likely end up dead.I can happily put all those concerns aside though, because the fact is that this is a tremendously well made film with a solid plot and characters you genuinely care about. The acting is superb, particularly by young Chloe Moretz who is surely a superstar in the making. The director obviously had a very clear vision of what he wanted this movie to be, and he hit a home run in execution.If I had to pick out something that I didn't like, it would be that most of the street scenes which are supposed to be New York City are pretty obviously not (as a native New Yorker this annoys me quite a bit)... I realize this was likely a budget issue, but its still something noticeable. The only other thing I would possibly complain about is that I feel the jetpack/gatling gun gadget that Kick Ass used in the end was just a tiny bit too much... I think they could have accomplished that scene a little better. But honestly, these are very minor flaws in an otherwise outstanding film.Yes, it's not a movie for everyone, and there are going to be many people who aren't going to be able to get past the imagery of a tarted-up preteen girl brutally killing criminals while making profane wisecracks. And that's fine... I totally understand where they're coming from.

I almost did until someone recommended it to me, otherwise I would have skipped it altogether.The main character is a high school loser who decide he needs to do something drastic and become a Super Hero.

In regards to Tom,"OK for all of you out there that just read Tom Collins review don't listen to the part about Avatar. You can't compare an Action/Comedy to a Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Adventure. Thats just wrong on so many levels. So please Tom stop putting your opinion out there that isn't even an opinion at all.In other news: this movie was really good and I would recommend it to all but the 12 year old sitting a row down from me. It actually has a really good story and you'll probably be surprised throughout the whole thing. It has great constant action, a love interest, some drama and the best part is that all of these things are in good balance. The only thing that I didn't like was the potential awkwardness at some parts in this movie. Once you see it you will know what I mean but it is like a pebble in an ocean. You will hardly notice this film's faults.Bottom Line: Don't think about how good Avatar is compared to this movie. Just go and see it, have a good laugh and be emotionally impacted at the same time and hopefully come out happy that you just spent $10 on that.B. N.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Pulls no punches. A worthy adaptation,"A truly daring comic-book movie, with great action sequences and dialogue that's sure to shock and leave you in awe. It's customary to hear profanities from adults in films, but hearing it from children always throws you for a loop. Nothing wrong with it in my view, and the constant use of it by Hit-Girl was a funny story in itself. She and Big Daddy definitely made for a great team, and provided some of the film's best moments. No doubt she's the star of the film, as her scenes are pretty much brilliant. Not familiar with the comic book, but as a stand-alone film, it's great. So, as far as an adaptation goes, I'm pretty sure it lives up to the source material.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Wicked!,"This film is not for children. It's advertised for kids and it looks like children would watch it since the plot revolves around normal people trying to be superheroes. Well, it's definitely a film that shouldn't be seen by anyone younger than 18 years old. Chlöe Grace Moretz plays Hit-Girl, an 11 year-old Mindy who kills many, many people and uses very profane language.Nicholas Cage is in the cast and mainly plays the anchor, as Mindy's dad. I wasn't thrilled about watching a film with Cage attached to the title, but, I heard rave reviews from friends and read critics views of it and had to check it out myself. Mostly, I wanted to see Lyndsy Forseca in a sexier and more body-revealing role. I recognized her name from playing the future daughter of Ted in How I Met Your Mother.As far as the movie plot goes, it's quite interesting and engaging. It's a great premise because I've always thought that anyone could become a superhero, but no one ever does. It's something that's been on people's minds for years. It's quite realistic in the way of showing violence against these ""heroes."" It's great to see that the screenwriter and director can follow the comic book loyally while keeping realistic.No one becomes a superhero and has no consequences. Kick-Ass almost gets killed, Hit-Girl has trauma happen to her, and the realism piles up. I enjoyed the action sequences and found myself on the edge of my seat during the climatic battle. I also found myself cheering for Cage at a moment, which I've never really cared for his characters.I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Katie and Dave (Aaron Johnson). I thought it was quite romantic and I thought the tender moment in her bedroom was realistic while still being romantic and funny in a quirky way. It's great to see Chlöe kick major ass in all her scenes. I liked the character, regardless of all the killings and language she uses.Kick-Ass is great comic book movie that is different from all other comic book movies. It's also a very good movie on it's own. But I can only recommend this to audiences over 18 years old.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Awesome!,"I can't describe beyond words on how awesome this movie is. I waited for the DVD with the thought that this movie would not be good enough to see in theatres. I wish I saw this in theatres because this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There is a good blend of comedy, action, and teen romance.This is about a teenage superhero who teams up with a adult superhero and his young daughter and together they fight the evil off in New York City.Now if you are expecting something like Batman or Superman, you will be wrong. These superheroes fight to kill unlike the fore-mentioned superheroes. This movie depicts tons of violence especially from the amazing 11-year old girl. But, I liked that.Overall, this is one of the best superhero movies ever. The only thing I hated was Nic Cage's haircut. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Has a Soul and Understands the Spirit of Comics Better than the ""Real"" Movies","I consider this one of my generation's great movies. (""My generation"" being the younger millenials who were high school age in the early 2010s.) I try to stick to reviewing movies I can provide insight on, as there's really nothing I can say about the classics before my time that hasn't already been said.Maybe you ""had to be there"", but I still think there's a lot to enjoy and admire about this movie, perhaps even more so now that it would never happen again. This was way ahead of its time satirizing comic book movies. We think about the genre getting tired within the past few years, but you gotta remember, in the 2000s we suffered a glut of comic movies that were all duds.This came during a time when the new phase of Marvel was barely starting -- the one that ""ended"" in 2019 with the last Avengers -- and began with 2008's Iron Man. There had been so many failed attempts already that a series of reboots had been commissioned. Aside from Nolan's Batman, the whole genre had already grown stale. Even at the time, Marvel's cracks began to show as Iron Man 2 released the same year to middling reception.Nevertheless, Kick-Ass came along when Marvel appeared to be on an upswing. In a sense, the filmmakers were making fun of these movies before it was cool to do so. But it was done affectionately and to great effect. I've never seen a movie like this before or since, and it meant a lot more being the target audience.It just perfectly captured and summarized being a teenager in that moment in time during the early 2010s. The protagonist walks into school with a WIRED earbud in. MySpace and YouTube are featured and play important roles in his rise to stardom. He has an Xbox 360, one character remarks that Kick-Ass ""owns"" and the overall sensibility is very much of the time, especially with regards to the banter and references. There's a lot more attention to detail like this that were nice touches -- which dates the movie in a charming way -- but you get the idea.In fact, this was one of the first movies I got excited for after seeing its redband trailer on YouTube. Before ads -- which would have been unthinkable -- back when you could post a video of anything so long as you weren't threatening to go to someone's house and kill them.The casting of one of the more well-known comedic teen actors from the time (Plasse) -- who was hot off the success of his R-rated comedies -- gave the impression this would be the same kind of movie. In some ways it is, but the pleasant surprise is that it's actually a well-crafted action movie that plays it straight more than you'd expect.That is the movie's strength, in my opinion. It is a great action movie, but categorizing it this way is an injustice. It's more of a black comedy, and the British sensibilities come through, but not too strongly. It is an odd duck for sure, but its original flavor and attitude wins me over.There's a streak of cruelty throughout that is certainly off-color, but it's mixed with an unusually sweet tone. The protagonist is kind of innocent, which is what makes you scared for him. For the same reason, it's all the more impactful when he goes through hell. However, the moments of darkness never overshadow the youtful, pop vibe. This blend of contrasting tones is fascinating and memorable to say the least.Every aspect of the production is astounding, from the casting of likable and funny actors, to the sets, costuming, special effects and editing. What you have here is an independently-produced British movie, set in America, filmed on location in some part of Ontario -- and the rest on soundstages in England -- starring a mix of Americans and Englishman providing some of the most convincing American peformances you can get.It's ""politically incorrect"" to the core, unapologetic, and really pulls no punches in its portrayal of the evil characters, which is something the big budget mainstream assembly line movies can never do in the name of their precious PG-13 rating. The violence is all practical, the stunt work is impressive and CGI was used mostly for backgrounds and enahncements, which are blended so well its almost imperceptible.This was definitely a time when we were past the ugly 2000s CGI that's aged horribly, but before it was standardized like it is now where all the assets, green screen work and waxy figures look the same. (The good news is that the movie has aged well.)I don't expect to see a movie like this to ever get distributed again. On the down side, it can be a bit much and some of the material is in poor taste, but I think the filmmakers ultimately pulled it off. It's an overindulgent piece that never attempts to punch above its weight.Sure, there's no emotional connection or anything to intellectualize, but it undeniably has a soul.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A funny take on Superheroes,"Rating-8/10Kick-Ass is a very good action movie based on many instalments of comic book franchises. The film's fight sequences are well done and are enjoyed immensely among the comedy which also run's through it. I found this film to be very good indeed and couldn't recommend it enough, all though if you dislike violence then maybe stay away, below I will tell you why I felt it was very good and why the sequel was warranted.The story is fun and delightful to watch and with the action and comedy blending well together, it makes for an enjoying watch. The story is fast and has some fantastic fights and even the deaths seem over done just to kill someone. I like the way it is a dark comic book film and actually show's what a real superhero would have to deal with, except for the crazy gadgets we sometimes see used in the film. I also enjoyed the characters who wide range of personalities make for one hell of a ride and a thrilling story to match it as well.Aaron Taylor-Johnson in the main role is good yes as very humorous throughout the piece. I enjoyed his little girl helper played by Chloe Grace who was fun but kind of crazy in her overly violent role for such a young girl. Nicolas Cage is funny but also the voice of wisdom in the film with Mark Strong playing a very menacing voiced villain who in the all comic book type action, actually seems like a real mob boss. Finally Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Strong's son is great and very funny at certain times, the entire cast do a good job and contribute to the fun factor immensely.The writers were a cross between screenplay writers and the original comic writers who worked well to bring it to the big screen and still keep the hyper violence and quirky humour among it all. I loved the fights as I said and a great choice of weapons are used in every different fight, and with the last battle of the film, an even crazier weapon is used but you'll have to watch it to see that thing. Costumes are great and although can seem over the top and sort of cheesy they give the heroes enough darkness in there character to make it more serious like.The film is over violent and contains some bloody scenes, for me personally I found it not the worst but for those less accustomed to violent films then this isn't for you, take it with a little salt and the humour will take over the violence. The story isn't that solid and isn't anything too much special plot wise although I will say it turns out much more fun than the plot actually sounds and so the film is sort of hard to criticise in a major way. Finally I did feel Kick- Ass is like so many other comic book movies and the synopsis is super similar to others but then again to say he is more a vigilante inspired by comics, it is quite different.People who love comic book movies I think will love this too with it's fantastic fight scenes and costumed capers making this is a fun comic film. I said about the violence already and if you can't deal with that much blood and violent scenes then this isn't for you, but as I said just think of the movie as comedic and the violence part disappears. It has a sweet romance plot running through it too and could please many fans with it's darker tones sometimes being drowned out by more lighter loving genres.Overall I give it a 8/10, a firmly very good movie and worth a watch I think it is indeed. It is the kind of film where you can sit back relax and eat some popcorn and truly have a good time watching it. Finally I said it warranted it's sequel because it truly did, and judging by this you would expect a good sequel, but that is yet to be reviewed here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"""Kick-ass"" kicked ass!","Had ""Watchmen"" not existed I would say that this is a very unique and original take on the 'Superhero' mythos and in many ways it still is, besides all the cliché's and stereo-types, ""Kick-Ass"" some how still feels fresh and original and really makes super-heroism or vigilantism realistic and relevant for todays times. If somebody really did put on a wetsuit and a mask and starting fighting thugs on the street, you bet your arse somebody would video that and stick it on 'YouTube'! Instant fame! A trend would start and before you know it, more vigilantes or ""heroes"" would show up for sure. The cast is absolutely brilliant in their roles and i must say ""Kick Ass"" is a welcome return to form for Nicholas cage who's films of late have seriously been sucking a whole lot. His character ""Batma...."" oops, I mean ""Big daddy"" is brilliantly acted and portrayed with just the right mix of campiness and seriousness that it works so well and makes for one of the strongest characters in the film. His daughter and side-kick ""Hit-girl"" is a psychotic 12 year old girl who swears like a trooper (drops the ol' C-bomb numerous times) and brutally kills villains without so much as a blink of an eye! Her scenes make for all the films best action sequences without a doubt! Aaron Johnson who played the title character of ""Kick-Ass"" is an actor of whom I'm not familiar with so I had no previous expectations to go by which was good as I felt his acting was fine and worked well for the character he played. The crazy thing about ""Kick-ass"" which will either be it's downfall or it's saving grace is that it's a mixed bag of genre's going from typical superhero adventure film, to side-splitting ""superbad"" style humour to overly violent gore fest to serious dead-pan scenes....it works for the most part and is definitely worth a watch for anybody who likes violent films....or comedies....or superhero films.....or action films....or dramatic films......(you get where I'm going with this).In short; ""Kick-Ass"" kicked ass!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Solid over-the-top action-comedy,"A guy, as average as averages go, decides to become a vigilante, a savior in need for damsels in distress. He puts on a suit, practices a fighting routine and tosses himself into business of superheroes. Not hampered by any form of experience he is quickly faced with the grim reality of being a want-to-be-hero, but that doesn't stop him. Instead, it feeds his resolution to become one.As a storyteller this film offers quite enough. It flirts with reality, in that it never goes so far that it becomes completely impossible (just very, very improbable) but since it never takes itself seriously this flirtation only works in a positive way. The story line that ties the action sequences in this film together is thus more than good enough.As an action-film this one is solid gold - nice quick paced, neatly choreographed, sometimes blatantly stolen from other films, but always fitting to the film.But all that is the basis, and with just that basis this one would still fall in the category of run-of-the-mill action films. This one does not do that because it offers extras in the form of some dark and twisted tangents and it is these extras that make this film very enjoyable instead of just enjoyable.All in all, nicely over the top, nicely paced, nicely twisted, and completely mad.9 out of 10 good intentions",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Kicks ass. Literally.,"When I first heard of the release of this film, I thought ""Oh here we go again, another teen comedy trying desperately to make audiences laugh with it's cheesy gags and stupid plot line"". I was expecting an absolute nightmare; but I've never been so wrong. From start to finish, it perfectly blends action, violence and satirical comedy all into one nicely wrapped package, delivered first class. Mintz-Plasse, possibly the tastiest sounding name in show business, gives a truly sublime performance as the lead bumbling teenager who tries to become a super hero in the modern world, without thinking of the consequences. Even his co-stars, young Moretez and Cage sparkle as father and daughter; with a infamous reference to Adam West's classic Batman which he depicts to perfection. Now, onto the violence. And my God, is it violent. From a man being roasted in a fire alive, to a guy being blown out of a building by a bazooka, it has absolutely everything for action fans to feast they're hungry eyes on. Seeing it's blood thirsty nature, you really do wonder why it's certificated a fifteen, but then of course, it's not violence. It's COMIC violence. Or that's what it says on the tin. This film is no Ronseal, as it goes into much darker issues from just good vs. bad, appealing to a much wider audience. So what have we learnt? That anyone can be a super hero? No. This film is simply fantasy in the real world, with it's tongue in cheek humour and extremely graphic fighting scenes, it delivers a thrill ride that teeters on the edge of over the top.

W.O.W.,"It's better than Deadpool, just bursting at the seams with great energy, imagination and risk taking. Not to mention an unusually intricate plot for superhero movies. I felt like their backstories were stronger than typical superhero films. And it's a master class in editing and pacing. The pace never lags, and there are times that it zooms a few steps ahead of the viewer and patiently waits for us to catch up. Aaron Taylor Johnson, Chloe Grace Moritz and Mark Strong all own their roles, with Strong in particular pulling off the neat trick of being both menacing and funny.

Fun superhero movie,"People have been saying that ""Kick-Ass"" turns the superhero genre on its ear. While it's true that the set-up adds a certain level of verisimilitude to the film, the need to have a story turns it into just another superhero origin story, save for a few throw-away lines and gags to make it more real. That doesn't mean it isn't fun, however.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is your normal teenager. He's a comic book lover, but that's about as far as he goes in terms of being out of the ordinary. He's so normal that he's just about invisible. One day he starts wondering why no one has donned a costume and become a superhero. If you really think about it, it really shouldn't take much. So Dave buys a wetsuit and becomes Kick-Ass. Before long, he becomes a phenomenon, inspiring a father/daughter team (Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz), and attracting the attention of a wealthy drug kingpin (Mark Strong).The best thing that the movie has is its realism. ""Kick-Ass"" tries to be as realistic as possible in terms of what would happen if a normal kid tried vigilantism. It's not a pretty sight. Dave isn't invincible, and neither are any of the other superheroes; when someone gets hit, it hurts...a lot! However, I didn't think it went far enough. I mean, wouldn't the police be able to track him down with forensic science? That would lead to some interesting complications.Nevertheless, it's still a lot of fun. All the actors perform in an understated way. I often criticize movies for doing this, but it works here. Aaron Johnson makes for a good pubescent superhero. His voice frequently cracks, and so on. But Johnson is a good performer. Nicholas Cage is a little off-the-wall (as Cage is wont to do), but the understated way of acting keeps him restrained enough from doing anything too outlandish. Mark Strong makes for a surprisingly good villain. And Christopher Mintz-Plasse does what you'd expect him to: he's like Foegel in ""Superbad"" (his star-making role), only a lot less geeky and oblivious.There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this film, and a lot of that has to do with Chloe Moretz, who plays Mindy, aka ""Hit Girl"" (quite well, by the way). People were shocked at the profanity she utters. Nothing was said about the people she kills (a number so high that it would make Ah-nuld blush). Conservatives are always complaining about how we've lost our moral values. They should check this movie out, and then see which is more disturbing.This movie is a lot of fun (adults only...the film actually gets the rating it deserves, for once). Nothing is taken too seriously, yet it's never too cheeky, either. However, character development is a little too low for the film to work completely. Dave is in over his head from day one, and he knows it. But he needs more development for us to really feel it. And while the film doesn't completely break the mold of the superhero genre, that doesn't mean it's not a good movie anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Dark Horse Comics' Big Screen Triumph,"DH Comics are a hugely under-rated brand. They have created amazing big- screen characters such as Hellboy, Scott Pilgrim, and Kick Ass himself. My personal favourite of their creations, Kick Ass, has possibly the best movie adaptation of any comic book character in this utterly brilliant flick.The writers have stayed very true to the comic book roots of Kick Ass, which I love. Other superheroes are often referenced, jokes are scattered thoughtfully through the script and the action is wonderfully over the top and really 'comic-booky'.Lovable characters that I can relate to are abundant too. Dave himself is just a regular kid that lives his dreams of being a superhero, and as corny as it is, he doesn't let anyone stand in his way.As a big comic fan, I feel as though this is the perfect comic book movie.

F U Mr. Bitey!!!,"""More like Ass-Kick"" Been a while since I watched this and it still holds up really well after all these years. It's a great alternate surreal like take on the superhero genre that doesn't only serve as a parody of superhero films but also makes you wonder what if someone actually tried to don a costume to fight crime in their down time at how immensely wild that idea is it also does a great job showcasing how bad or good it could turn out here. Nic Cage is always a delight as his manic acting self but the real star of the show here had to be Chloe Moretz as Hig Girl. If I ever have a daughter I want a clone of Hit Girl plain and simple. For one of her debut big screen acting roles she came out of the gate swinging and firing on all cylinders and completely overtook the movie mostly but I didn't mind it one bit. Sure she was a girl boss but she was my kind of girl boss presented in a way where she was not only badass but she had some vulnerability to her in being that she was so young and physically stunted and in the finale she learned a valuable lesson in a sense when going toe to toe against someone twice her height and build. Overall Kick-Ass was a fun ride filled with memorable quotes and characters and is still a damn good time almost 15 years later.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
In MY humble opinion,"I was very skeptical about seeing this movie: it looked like another one of those stupid trying-to-be-funny kid romps. Then i saw that it was a controversial over the top violent action movie, so i said, hey, why not. I went to see it with a friend and we both had the same verdict. TWO THUMBS DOWN. I thought ONE line was funny, the rest was just what I thought it would be: teens and little kids TRYING to be funny. I also don't mind brutal action movies, but NOT starring little kids. I was honestly pleasantly surprised that Ebert gave this movie 1 and a half stars. The action scenes were great, but only if they had been done by grownup. If these kids were in an all out comedy, that would be different, but they weren't so...I am probably the only one who hated this movie, but that just my humble opinion.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

How?!,"How does this have any high reviews? I couldn't make it through the first 20 mins. After like 10 mins I wanted to shut it off but I keep trying and I couldn't do it. The part o watched was slow boring, obnoxious, crude. Blow away by the high reviews. Don't waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly good!,"I didn't expect to like this movie. I usually avoid teen comedies and comic book movies. But this one held my interest and was a high-quality film with a lot of familiar faces.But it is Chloe Grace Moretz who steals the Show. She was only 12 when the movie was filmed but is very convincing playing an 11-year-old cold-blooded vigilante killer. Her dialogue and mannerisms seem very natural and there are intensely violent action scenes involving her. Kudos to the director, Ms. Moretz and of course her stunt double.There is plenty of action interspersed with comedy and drama and good acting from all involved. But watching the 12-year old Chloe Grace do such an amazing job with such a demanding role is quite impressive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
All clouds have a silver lining.,"I didn't see Kick-Ass at a movie theatre, so I don't know how audiences reacted to it. But judging by its rating here many people liked it. I liked it too, and that's because it's the most original film I've seen in a while. Its violence and sexual content will turn off some viewers though. The film centers around Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a teenager who wonders why there aren't any superheroes in real life. This thought leads him to try out being a superhero. The film's realistic approach to this is often amusing. Did I mention that there is violence? A bit of it is hard to watch on first viewing, but just when you think it's gone too far things turn around. Dave isn't really a charismatic character. The film makes up for this with Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). Hit-Girl is (at least for me) the star of the film. The girl's like a Mongol; determined, inventive and a great fighter. She doesn't have a lot of screen time, but whenever she's on screen things are more interesting. Moretz is very good in the role; she has almost the same effect as Heath Ledger's Joker in the Dark Knight (2008). In addition, she swears but in her case it's just plain cool.Kick-Ass isn't just about the humour and the action. There's some good character development. Most of the fights are amazing, but the story turns out to be good and varied as well. There are thrills as well as genuine drama. The villains aren't a bunch of pushovers, so the heroes really have to give it their all here. And then there is the effective use of music. Yes, Kick-Ass has a lot going for it. Director Matthew Vaughn should get much of the credit, but every actor delivers too. Last decade's comic book and action films were obviously an inspiration on Kick-Ass, especially Spider-Man (2002) and Kill Bill (2003). However, the film's hero elements seem more effective than those of its inspirations. Because the fantasy elements are kept to a minimum here what the heroes go through really hits home. It's not easy to watch when they're in pain, but it's also thrilling when they succeed. The filmmakers smartly used this to good effect, especially in the second half of the film, which is even more exciting than the first half. And to top it all off Kick-Ass features one of the best (if not the best) uses of a bazooka in film. I recommend Kick-Ass; it even has a lot of replay value.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Better then I expected!,"All I can say is that I was in no way interested in watching this movie at all. But my friend & finally decided to watch it last night & I must say it's 1 one of the best movies I have seen. Full of action & fun! The acting was great! I especially enjoyed watching Chloe Grace! She was a beast!!I was a bit surprised to see Nicolas Cage play the role he played. But as usual, he did a great job.The plot/story line was good & kept my attention. Everything gelled together nicely surprisingly. It was nothing like I expected it to be. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!! If you don't see anything else, see this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Will make you care about superheroes again.,"Watching the trailer for Kick-Ass I was pessimistic. It appeared to be extreme for its own sake, the characters were lazy and unoriginal. The relationship between hit girl and her father especially struck me as forced and weird for its own sake. Having now watched the film in full I can't say I was wrong.The difference, though, is that all of these elements work perfectly in context, because when a human being decides to go superhero they're likely to be an unoriginal weirdo, and are certainly taking things to unnecessary extremes. This is the beauty of Kick-Ass, and allows it to effortlessly achieve that which a recent crop of big budget deconstructive superhero flicks have fruitlessly strived for in recent times. The Nolan Batmans, Hancock and, most significantly, Watchmen tried to show us the consequences of putting a hero in the real world, then laid before us vastly unrealistic and exaggerated characters for our consideration. The problem with these films was that they got bogged-down in their own significance, imploring us to stop and deeply think about what a superhero is and the consequent moral implications, etc, etc. They failed to realise that comic book superheroes do not truly exist, and if they do it is for no other reason than to entertain us. By grasping this, Kick-Ass shines as wonderfully easy to relate to and batsh*t insane, simultaneously.Many reviewers have praised Kick-Ass as a ""thinking person's film"" for its unconventional approach to the superhero, but I would argue the exact opposite. Its characters occur so naturally and its events so typically that the viewer just has to sit back and enjoy the show. Its treatment of superhero legend somehow avoids both damnation and mockery, and feels like nothing other than joyful celebration and homage. The glue that holds all of this in place is the film's magnificent sense of humour which, despite the odd self-aware joke that might lose its potency over time (not wanting to die ""before finding out what happens on Lost"" an example) sure as hell made me laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Brilliant, immoral and a lot more...","The critic Charles Koplinski wrote, ""Kick-Ass is only half right."", but let me put it this way, ""Kick-Ass"" is half brilliant, but it's half immoral, and lacks rhythm. When I left the theater I was amazed about how good this film was, but then I started thinking about how many immoral messages and lack of depth (Which as OK when the movie didn't take itself too seriously, but then the second part came, and it started being a real super-hero movie, and, for a few minutes, boring) that it also contains. But when you see so many ignorant messages in such acclaimed movies like ""Avatar"", in this movie industry, that seems full of stupid people with diluted ideas, it was a relief that in the end of the movie they didn't say ""Save the green!"" or any of that childish crap.It's the story of Dave Lizewski (Johnson), an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan with a few friends and who lives alone with his father. His life is not very difficult and his personal trials not that overwhelming. However, one day he makes the simple decision to become a super-hero even though he has no powers or training.Right in the first sequences you can see that this movie is different than the others, probably because of it's style (That can be great sometimes), and narrative technique. The direction is mostly great. The action scenes and extremely well shot, except for the one where Hit-Girl use the night vision in the warehouse (It looked more like if we were watching someone playing ""Doom""). The violence in this movie is well put sometimes, but at other times, very disturbing (And i'm not easily disturbed).The screenplay is far from being great... Maybe it's good, but not something that improves the movie, on the contrary, it can ruin the movie if you look in some different points of view, but there is one thing that it really appreciated about the script... Right in the beginning we can see how dangerous Frank is, which was not present in other movies like ""Ocean's Eleven"" where Andy Garcia (The bad guy) spends the whole movie without killing a single person. Following the same grade, is the acting, that is great sometimes (Chloe Moretz, Mark Strong), sometimes good (Nicholas Cage, Aaron Johnson), and occasionally bad (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).Another thing that stood out in the picture was that the movie looks cartoonish, without trying to be it every time, in this aspect, it works better than ""Sin City"", but not as good as ""Spider-Man"".Verdict: Some may find it offensive, and I kind of understand them, but there is no doubt that this movie is entertaining, well directed and well acted, and worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
