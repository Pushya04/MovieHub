HOW HAS THIS EPISODE A LOWER RATING THAN STAR WARS EPISODE VII : THE FORCE AWAKENS,"Now this is how you end a trilogy and this is how you conclude a climax of one of the greatest sci-fi stories to be told.There's things to criticise, yes, there's things that could have been improved, yes, but ultimately, George Lucas managed to give us a great end result that, at least to me, is one of the best sci fi movies ever made and certainly the second best, if not the best Star Wars Episode.Now, some CGI hasn't aged well, we all know it, like for example all clones you'll see in the movies, they just look terrible, but some other still looks amazing, look at the end battle on Mustafar. Gosh the rendering of the environment of that planet is amazing. Also, the dialogues feel more adult and less goofy in comparison to both episode Lucas had made before (i'm referring to the prequels of course). Also, even if some of the acting performances still show to be bad (in a way), there's been some important improvement compared to Star Wars episode II.This movie also has some depth in the confrontation between Jedi and Sith that has never been brought in any other Star Wars movie. You can understand why Anakin joins the Sith and what motivates Palpatine to be this evil. This movie shows us, what the similarities between Jedi and Sith are and ultimately shows us what the main differences are. It gives us context and gives us the reasons why you may join the dark side. What I mean by this is that, usually the Sith are evil because the script wants it, there's no real reason to it, look at the sequels, why does the first order handle they way it does, because they are evil, that's what we'll be told, but they ultimately lack of a realistic motivation, which makes those movies childish and boring. Now, in this movie, we get to know what Sith want, as Anakin says himself, and I believe Palpatine does too, they want to bring peace, justice and security. What differentiates them from the Jedi is that they want to obtain that, by having full control of the people and institutions, not letting any opponent exist and through an establishment of fear amongst people. This is similar to Hobbes' Leviathan in a way and gives this movie philosophical depth, at least to some degree. I know of course that the philosophical or political ideas aren't very complicated in this movie, but I like the fact that at least it gives you some food for thought, something that the sequels for example do not!So I do certainly not understand why this movie is rated below Star Wars VII, please join me to fix this! (Also, this movie contains the two best fight scene from the entire Saga, Yoda vs Darth Sidious and Anakin vs Obi-Wan)That's all folks.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This one is actually great!,"The first two movies in the prequel trilogy weren't horrible, but had so many flaws. This one isn't as good as any movie in the original trilogy, but if you ask me it's pretty close. This one is actually very well done and special effects don't look so fake now and give us some really epic scenes, especially in a movie's climax that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Here, George Lucas proved that he can still do it and I was really satisfied with this movie. The acting was the best the prequel trilogy gave and Hayden Christensen isn't so wooden and annoying anymore. Here he's actually pretty cool and shows that he has potential, but Ewan McGregor remains the best part of the cast. You really believe him to be young Obi-Wan and that's very well done and he also has some very heartbreaking moments with Anakin at the end. One of the biggest flaws in the prequels was all those political conversations. Just lots and lots and lots of talking that makes you want to fall asleep, but thankfully, Lucas listened to his fans and it's reduced here. It's still present, of course, but not as much. Romance between Padme and Anakin is a little bit more believable here, but still not enough and that's one of the biggest flaws here, but the blame is more on Attack of the Clones in this case. Everything is executed very well and leading up to the original trilogy is very good, even tho it does create some plot holes, but in Star Wars you can explain almost everything with the Force. And one more good thing for Jar Jar haters, he appears for only like, a second. Hooray! But there is one more thing they messed up in the ending and I'm not gonna spoil anything but that one awful line (NOOOO!). While the first two movies in the prequel trilogy were disappointing, this one makes it all better. Not everyone will like it, but as a big Star Wars fan, I must say it's a nice and intense ending for the prequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
7.6?! ARE YOU SERIOUSLY?!,"The most tragic and interesting part in the prequel trilogy. Emotions during the viewing will be just on top, there are inconsistencies with the canon, but this does not spoil the impression of the film.

The Saga is Complete,"Revenge of the Sith is my favorite movie (not only considering the six movies of the saga, but it's one of my favorite films ever). I love the prequels and I like the original trilogy. Star Wars prequel trilogy has a terrific scenery, lots of spectacular scenes and fabulous elaborate costumes.The world of Star Wars is like a dreamworld for me. If I could live in it, I would.The whole Star Wars saga tells the story about family and love. The greatest story of all, the timeless story about Anakin Skywalker is so close to my heart, that's why I love Star Wars so much. The tagline of the film - ""The saga is complete"". So there is no need for awful Disney sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fitting end but you can't beat the real thing,"SPOILER ALERT My thoughts on Revenge of The Sith. Although miles better than the previous two, when held up against the original trilogy it still left me feeling under whelmed. Whether that it symptomatic of today's era when big budget spectacles are two-a-penny I'm not sure.I'll start with the opening space battle in the film. Nobody can say it wasn't visually effective. You jump straight in to the midst of a battle. Starfighters zig zagging across every corner of the screen, explosions left right and centre, Laser fire criss crossing the cold vacuum of space, Obi-Wan and Anakin in a frenzied dogfight with the droid attack fleet. Probably millions spent on the scene and endless manpower dedicated to its completion. Visually stunning yet souless. Give me the sequence in ROTJ anyday, when in the cold stillness of space the rebel fleet come out of Hyperspace, ready to mount an attack on the Deathstar. The Imperial fleet hangs back in the distance and you know you are in for the mother of all space battles. You can't buy that sort of anticipation, that sort of ""Oh My God, I can't wait for what's gonna happen next"" feeling. This is what Star Wars is about A grand spectacle with feeling, not just a grand spectacle.Then we have how easy some of the main protagonists go down. Count Dooku goes from a Sith lord capable of fending off Obi-wan and Anakin in AOTC to someone is easily taken down by Anakin with the shimmy of a lightsabre. I don't see how his skills and powers have improved so much from the second movie but we are told by Anakin that they have and we should just accept it. In the return fight between Luke and Vader in ROTJ. You sense Luke is empowered by the knowledge he has of Vader and a momentary lapse into anger by Luke allows him to bear down on Vader and bring him to the ground. A believable turnaround of events considering what has gone on before. Not so in the rematch between Anakin and Dooku. Considering Dooku manages to immobilise Obi-wan quite easily once again and fought Yoda to an arguable draw in AOTC's, the swiftness by which Anakin dispatches Dooku is a bit stretched.Then we have the romance. Portman is a great actress, you'll get no arguments from me. Apparently the rumour is Hayden can act as well judging by the reviews he had for Shattered Glass. Why is it then that when they share lines and romantic scenes together they can't muster an iota of the chemistry that Han an Leia had in the original trilogy. Anakin comes across as a simplistic figure, with simple lines. I believe the problem is Hayden always over compensates when he reads out his lines. Understandably he's trying to think how Lucas would want them to be delivered. Is he thinking, ""How does saying I love you Padme in the Star Wars universe where there is a galactic war going, differ from saying I love you in the real world"". What should I enunciate, what depth of feeling should I squeeze from my character, a tragic hero figure destined for a fall from grace. My feeling is that he shouldn't. Yes Star Wars is set in a galaxy far far away but I love you is still I love you no matter what context you put it in. That's why when the inevitable romantic scenes come along they still leave you feeling flatter than a pancake run over by a bulldozer. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher to me gave a very adult take on the relationship between Han and Leia. It was basically scoundrel meets women way out of his league and lets forget the hell out of all this sci-fi stuff and just act how we feel it should be. Result - classic scenes to watch again and again. Lucas unfortunately hasn't remembered this lesson in time for the final film.The events that lead Anakin's turn to the darkside are also difficult to accept. Yes we know his transformation must be complete by the end of the movie less we find ourselves potentially forking out for the ""Fourth in the Trilogy © Orange Cinema ad"". But the excuse of needing knowledge to save his wife and keeping alive the only person who has this knowledge is the premise for an alarmingly rapid descent into the dark side. Sure he murders the Tusken Raiders in AOTC's without a second thought but that was shortly after his beaten mother died in his arms. After lopping Mace Windu's hand off and allowing the Emporer to lighting blast the bad-ass Jedi into the Corsucant night sky, there is not a hint of remorse by Anakin. A rapid betrayal of the Jedi, the murder of the Jedi children quickly follows, yet hours before he's still Anakin the Jedi. Sure a little confused, hugely frustrated but not a child-killer. Much more believable would be something like the murder of Padme in front of his very eyes and the Jedi complicity in this which might enable Anakin to turn against everything he believed in so quickly. Yet it is only the hint of great power he might be able to achieve under Palpatine tutelage that triggers Anakin to turn against everyone he loves, in an instant.Oh and the final fight scene, Apparently doesn't matter if you are the chosen one. It's all about height. If you have the ""Higher Ground"" then the fight's yours. Someone should try telling that to the two pieces of Darth Maul laying at the bottom of a power shaft somewhere.So to sum up George  thank for the memories. It wasn't quite a home run but you sure came damn close and 'A' for effort. I think that other trilogy with the guys with the funny feet kinda of stole your thunder though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Damn Good Movie!,"Upon seeing Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith early this morning, I let it sink in all day to form my opinion. After all that thought, I concluded that this was a damn good movie... and probably my favorite of all 6 episodes (definitely of the episodes 1-3)!One of the things I liked about this movie is the way it presents Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). George Lucas made you believe that, although we know Anakin was evil, he did not believe himself to be evil. In fact, he thought he was doing the right thing, even though some of those things were undeniably wrong.Also, many of the mysteries were finally answered. We all knew Anakin was Darth Vader, and that Vader was the father of Luke Skywalker and Leia, but now we know how and why they were separated. We also know how Darth Vader came about and why the need for the costume. All this and more!A review of this movie would not be complete without mention of the spectacular special effects. Every shot in the movie is stunning and hard to look away from. The action starts from the very beginning and does not let up, except for some minor love scenes. The light saber battles between Anakin, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Yoda, Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and General Grievous were all done extremely well. Even R2-D2 got to kick some butt!Overall, as you can probably tell, I loved this installment of the series. All of the questions were answered and was more action packed than I could have hoped for. Definitely recommended. 9.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Final Part of the Saga,"In Coruscant, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the Separatist General Grievous' spaceship and Anakin kills Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) with his light-saber after a fight; however Grievous escape from the Jedi. When they land on Coruscant, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) comes to tell Anakin that she is pregnant. Soon he has premonitions of his wife dying during the delivery. Palpatine requests that Anakin joins the Jedi Council against the will of the members but his is not promoted to Master and stays Padawan; further they ask him to spy Palpaline. Anakin is manipulated by Palpatine about the true intentions of the Jedi and is tempted to know the dark side of the Force that could be capable to save Padmé. Further Palpatine discloses that he is Sith Lord Darth Sidious. What will Anakin do?""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the final part of the saga initiated in 1977 by George Lucas. This episode is among the best ones and shows how Darth Vader was born. George Lucas in 1971, surprised the world with the cult ""THX-1138"". In 1973, another great movie: ""American Graffiti"". Then, in 1977, he directed the fantastic ""Star Wars"". Since this date, he basically dedicated his life only to the excellent Star Wars saga. With his potential, he could have contributed much more to the cinema industry.

Under-rated because of first two movies. This one is truly amazing.,"I think it is under-rated because the first two movies was not this good. This last one is pretty good, how rated so low? First two were not bad but they had so much more potential, those two movies could be so better. I think this is nearly the best way to connecting to the Original Trilogy after two decent movies. This is all we wanted from Star Wars. And this last movie gave that to us.I think storyline is quite amazing in this last movie of the trilogy but the techincs could be better a bit in my opinion. A better cinematography and visual effects maybe. I don't know how ILM managed to do better visual effects in the other projects at the time. I'm not saying VFX and cinematography are bad, I'm just saying those could be a bit better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Probably the best of all 11 Star Wars movies,"After five largely odious episodes, ""Revenge of the Sith"" was rewarding enough to redeem the franchise for me. There was no theatricals, no overacting, no brinkmanship, no obnoxious teasing and taunting between the male and female protagonists and, above all, no more garish protracted scenes of ugly sentient alien beings that had driven me berserk in the previous episodes. (CGI really did the trick, I guess.) The lightsaber duel scenes were also much livelier and more fun to watch.Not to mention that the cast are actually a lot more likable! Call me a blasphemer, but there was just something terribly wrong with Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill in the first trilogy. Here you could actually feel the chemistry and love between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, and the two of them, along with Ewan McGregor, gave a truly natural, entertaining and coherent performance together.And then the epic story of how the Jedi warrior Anakin Skywalker, believed to be the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force and defeat the Sith once and for all, became the Dark Lord Darth Vader, that was a whole different level of drama. The idea of good versus evil, that good always wins the war no matter how many battles it's lost, takes the backseat as Anakin becomes conflicted between his Jedi mentors' rules and expectations and his love for his secret wife Senator Padmé. The movie is a masterpiece at playing out the agonizing moral ambiguity that descends upon a human when they're faced with threats to their loved ones, when they stand to lose what makes their life worth living. Here the concept of good and evil is blurred in Anakin's eyes and, quite simply, the ends begin to justify the means.Fear of loss is what leads to anger, the Jedi masters insist, and anger leads to hatred, hatred to the Dark Side. Loyalty to the Jedi Order is another tenet that the young Jedi struggles with as he realizes what his masters seem to have holding back from him about the nature of the Force.I'm thankful they made this movie the way they did. I loved it. And it's woefully underrated compared to the original 1980s trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Lucas Redeemed!,"When I asked the reviewer sitting next to me to sum up Revenge of the Sith, he simply said ""great!"" That seemed to basically be the consensus of virtually everyone in attendance at an advance press screening of the final chapter in the Star Wars saga.There was an exuberant mood leaving the theater, as if everyone was in collective agreement that Lucas had finally done it. That he had gone out on top, with a stunning, rock-solid coup de grace. And from all the feedback I've heard from that screening, my sense of that collective mood was right.There are no real spoilers in ROTS. Everyone basically knows what happens in Episode 4: A New Hope. We all know Anakin becomes Vader. We know Obi Wan lives and we know Luke and Leia are born. What we don't know is how Lucas weaves those story lines into the large, six-part opus and better yet, why?No, it's not a perfect movie. There are those moments that make us cringe. Bad dialog and High School drama class acting make for a few awkward moments where you can hear audible moans and giggles in the audience, but we have come to expect this from modern Star Wars films. The upside is that these moments are rare in Episode III.OK, get ready. Take a deep breath. No Jar Jar! Yes, you read that right. You can let out that deep breath now.Fortunately, we have one savior to rely on for stellar acting. Mr. Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. McDiarmid brings the elegance of an Alec Guiness back to the franchise in a knockout performance that leaves the audience riveted and exhausted. He is the lifeblood of the film.As someone who saw the original 30 times in it's first month of release at the age of 13, I currently consider myself a Star Wars moderate. I don't have volumes of SW merchandise, nor can I debate whether or not carbonite contains enough oxygen to make it float. All I know is that magical feeling Star Wars gave me in the original 1977 release and that I'm happy to say, after a disappointing pair of prequels, has been finally restored and reinvigorated.Here's to Mr. Lucas for giving us all something spectacular to remember for our entire lives that embodies the whole point of going to the movies in the first place, to escape and lose ourselves in another world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"it starts out on an awful, pretentious note, but thankfully cleans up its act with a sweep of majestic power well before it ends","Now that George Lucas has cleaned up his act for the first two movies in his Star Wars prequel trilogy, we can all pat him on the back and say, ""That's more like it, George."" His third film in the trilogy, I say, still does not quite capture the magic and feeling of the original classic narrative from 1977-1983, but it's close enough, it's a lot better than ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" and, despite a poor, rushed beginning, it's a pretty good movie, though not remarkable like the originals.Here's the movie where we finally get to see Anakin Skywalker (still played by Hayden Christianson in a miscast part) transform from the young, loyal Jedi romancing a galactic queen (Natalie Portman) into the vicious black-helmeted villain who terrorized us so in ""The Empire Strikes Back."" We also see the final transportation of Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) into the sister, gravelly-voiced Emperor, and other things.""Revenge of the Sith"" starts out on a pretty poor note. For a moment, I was very concerned that it was going to wind up being exactly like ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" - dreadful, boring, and disappointing. The opening scene where Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker invade an enemy space fleet, blast apart bad guys, slice up robots, and fight the most ridiculously-named villain, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) again, was just like before. It was dumb, ostentatious, and filled with lousy dialogue like ""It's not the Jedi way."" And later on, there was again that sappy romance with Padme, with more trashy dialogue like ""Hold me as you did by the lake on Naboo."" (Naboo? Can't Lucas come up with a better name for a planet that *that*?) But...*but* after that, the movie really redeems itself.After this point, the writing, though uneven does improve, the action scenes become a little more entertaining, and most impressive of all is a change of mood from the campy video game-like atmosphere of before into a more serious, pessimistic note with a tragic feeling. For the first time, this new Yoda, created through CGI imagery instead of a puppet, captures the mystique and charm and personality of the original. Now he seems more like Yoda and not just a shrunken philosopher with an object-subject-verb speech manner. If there still is a weakness, it is the character of Darth Vader. Remember, this guy is supposed to one day become one of the cinema's greatest villains. We still don't get that feeling with this one. Even when he does become Vader at the end, it still does not seem like the same. It seems like a different character with no resemblance beyond appearance. And it's the personality of Vader, not merely his appearance, that made him so compelling in the original trilogy.""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the best and only solidly entertaining entry in the prequel trilogy. It's not, I say, a great movie. It is flawed and again, its beginning half-hour or so is rather poor and boring and flat, but it does pick up things. Slowly at first and then quickly. And the movie's climactic lightsaber battle, directed in part by Steven Spielberg, is truly entertaining though not believable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's OK to be a STAR WARS fan again.,"For several years now, it's been a rather uneasy proposition to be known as a STAR WARS fan. First, we had to put up with the great embarrassment of the clownish Jar Jar and the gut wrenching ""acting"" from the muppet known as Jake Lloyd in PHANTOM MENACE. Then came the laughably stilted dialog and the clumsily told love story from ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Fans far and wide were wondering what George Lucas had done to their beloved STAR WARS franchise! Something that once was so rollicking and without peer was being transformed into kiddie-pandering, muppet populated, CGI over-loaded dreck!Mr. Lucas, all is forgiven. Welcome back. REVENGE OF THE SITH is the prequel installment we've been hoping for all along. Gone is the overly wooden acting and the ridiculously petrified dialog. In there place is a logical and believable storyline. Anakin's transformation is inexorably sensible. It is natural and not forced into shape by wooden dialog. Scenes between Anakin and Padme, are heartfelt and honest- a far cry from their nearly unwatchable scenes in ATTACK OF THE CLONES.The same can be said of scenes between Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor is legitimately great in this film. He gives Kenobi real depth and the viewer thoroughly believes that he grows up to become Alec Guiness). There exists a real bond of deep feeling the viewer can feel between master and apprentice thus making Anakin's fate all the more tragic, as he slowly becomes more and more entangled in Palpatine's (Ian McDiarmid, in a joyfully malevolent turn) web of deception and evil.Visuals have never been an issue in the prequel films and this is most certainly the case with REVENGE OF THE SITH. The opening sequence is a jaw-dropping collage of ships in movement, dazzling colors, and frenetic combat. Additionally, the technology used to create Yoda seems to have grown exponentially over the already impressive wizardry used to animate Yoda in CLONES. Front to back, the vistas Lucas shows us are entirely believable and staggering joys to behold.George Lucas goes right for the jugular in this film (the PG-13 rating is well earned! Parents be advised!!). This is a very well-told story of a fall from grace told in an unflinching manner. And yet, the hope for the future is so firmly in place as this film rolls to an end, a tear will roll down your cheek if you've lived with this series of films as long as I have. STAR WARS is back.

The only thing with this film is that it relies too much on digital technology, which causes it to lose some of the charm of the original trilogy.That aside, Star Wars Episode 3 is by far the most dramatic and spectacular of all the Star Wars films. Continuing the story of episode 2, this film tells of the events leading up to the original trilogy. It tells the tale through three key elements,1. Tragedy 2. Betrayal 3. RomanceThese elements make this film the most stunning and the best of the prequel trilogy, and a debatable best in the saga. It is my favourite but others may disagree.

Story + Special Effects = Success!,"(No Spoilers!) Excitedly submitting my comments two weeks prior to the opening of the film (after a preview screening at the Ziegfeld Theater), I am thrilled to add to what appears to be a growing wave of positive reaction to Lucas's effort in Episode III. As a life-long fan deeply caught in a love hate relationship with Episodes I and II, I cautiously awaited this final installment. I felt in my heart that this would be a great film, but feared that somehow I would again be disappointed. Maybe I was starting to succumb to the notion that I no longer had the spirit of that six year old boy who was mesmerized by the original Star Wars, long ago in 1977 at that far away NJ theater. Maybe.From the opening 20th Century Fox logo, the movie hits the ground running, proving once again the CGI capabilities of ILM and the thrills they inspire. However, unlike the first two films, where spectacular effects were layered upon complicated, contrived and sometimes dramatically vacant scenes executed with some of the worst performances in memory, there is solid story telling here. And that's the difference.The drama builds steadily in the first act before hitting light speed with a combination of excitement, dread, intrigue and pain. This strong dramatic spark ignites the entire cast, helping them turn in what are easily their best performances of the three films. When you have a script with this kind of thump and talented actors, the result is fun to watch. And for once, perhaps most importantly, the special effects serve the script, not the other way around.Anakin's internal struggle, present from frame one, quickly consumes him, catapulting the film towards its inevitable conclusion. While its no surprise that the film ends on a desperate note, there does remain a glimmer of possibility as the story segues into the aptly titled classic ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"". It's thought provoking and inspiring.It's also worth noting that as advertised the film is dark, makes no apologies, and is much less child friendly then the others. All pluses in my opinion.The final result with ""Revenge"" is a complete film that I will never forget, a somewhat renewed perspective on what Lucas was going for with Episodes I and II, and assurances that that little boy inside me is still there, popcorn in hand, ready for a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
George Lucas Light Show,"Roll up, roll up to see the George Lucas light show. Look what I can do with my computers boys and girls? Isn't it great?When will Mr Lucas remember how the balance of the action and special effects plus the story, the drama, the tragedy and triumph in episodes IV, V and VI were what made the first trilogy so amazingly powerful. Not forgetting some of the performances he got from his cast: compared to Christiansen, who was a huge disappointment.Unfortunately, in the age where we have been given The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter - our imaginations are being pulled in all directions. We not only get thrilled by visual effects, we think and feel story lines. We identify with the characters in their make believe worlds.I do realise that this project was ambitious. Lucas had his work cut out, to make the prequels and bring the story together. I feel in some ways, this has been a success (hence the 6/10). But as I sat in the cinema for that length of time to see III, I just wanted it to be over. It lacked intrigue, struggle and drama.

Doesn't live up to the hype.,"After reading the great reviews I was really looking forward to seeing this supposed ""Great"" movie that was finally as good as the original trilogy. I am a die-hard Star Wars fan and even thought that the criticism of episodes 1 and 2 were unfairly critical. Sure they were not as good as the originals (by far), but they were still entertaining movies that were better than 90% of the garbage that comes out of Hollywood today. The final showdown in Episode 1 between Qui-Gon, Obi-wan and Darth Maul was one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. Very well done and very intense. I really hoped that Lucas finally got it right and concentrated on the development of characters and story line and not just the eye-candy. I hate to say it, but Lucas you blew it.The acting was extremely wooden for the main characters. Is it really the acting or the directing and writing? I don't know. I do know that I was never convinced of the reason that Anakin finally decided to turn to the Dark Side. The story was just not there and Hayden Christensen did not convince me. Natalie Portman has done extremely good work in other films. I felt nothing for her character here. The acting of Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is superb. Ewan McGregor was solid as well. Yoda may very well have been the best actor in the bunch.It comes down to the problem that I never felt worried for any of the characters. There was no realism to the movie to create worry. When all of the characters can do multiple triple back-flips, kill anything that attacks them without effort, be able to fall off of cliffs with no damage it takes all of the drama out of the film. Even R2D2 can defy gravity and just jump out of the fighter with no damage. In the original trilogy you kept saying to yourself ""how the hell are they going to get out of this mess?"" You were on the edge of your seat. The extreme use of animation turns it into a cartoon with cartoon actors. The reason the first trilogy was great was because you could identify with the characters because they seemed real and their situations seemed real. The characters in Episodes 1 through 3 have none of these same qualities.I think that the secret to the original trilogy was the superb acting of Harrison Ford. This guy was Uber-cool, charismatic and everyone wanted to be Han Solo. In Revenge of the Sith, there really is no one for you to relate to or even care about or root for. Harrison Ford made everyone around him just ""click"". The incredible banter with Princess Lea, with Chewbacca and even the droids added humor to the film that seems sorely missing in RotS. The attempt at humor in RotS is forced and relies on slap-stick and the quick laugh. How many times do we hear R2D2 scream for the quick laugh? Everything has been dumbed-down and it is unfortunate.There really was no purpose to introducing new characters like General Grievous. Again, no character development to even care about him or despise him. The battles between the droid army and the clone troopers seemed just like background and filler. No real purpose to it other than eye candy.I will have to see this film a second time to confirm my thoughts. Believe me, I really WANT it to be a great film.This movie is a definite must see just to see how the Star Wars story comes together. I still found it very disappointing and undeserving of the ""great"" ratings that it is receiving.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Top 2 not 2,"In my opinion, this is the greatest Star Wars film ever made. And a whole lotta people in 2021 agree with me. I have grown up watching this movie. Although the old generation does not like it because it is tonally different than the originals, they have to understand what makes it great; the world building and lore. Revenge of the Sith and the prequels in general bring a whole new world to Star Wars. Previously it was a bunch of white dudes w weird names, mass amts of people in white armor, a bad guy dressed in a peculiar black suit w a red laser sword, and a black dude who flys ships. The prequels, especially ROTS, exponentially builds the Star Wars universe in a glamorous way, giving us a whole new perspective on a galaxy far far away. Back to the movie though. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman stepped up BIG TIME on their roles and their love story was finally convincing. Ewan Mcregor was fantastic as always, but Ian McDermott stole the show. His performance as empire palpatine in ROTS is objectively a top 5 performance in Star Wars, arguably top 3. The overall tone and feel of the movie is a spiritual journey as you watch these characters go through unbelievable events. Lucas also gives us the most beloved characters in the prequels, such as Padmé, Obi Wan, Yoda, Mace, Anakin, and more. To have those emotional attachments to the characters you love so much makes this movie so good. Not to mention it has the best lightsaber fight in the franchise, the movie delivered on all fronts. The story, worldbuilding, performances, tonal feel, and more make this a 10/10. The only reason this is at a 7.5 is because of old head haters who didn't understand it. The new generation loves it and rightfully so; as George Lucas, Natalie Portman, and Hayden Christiansen are finally getting the respect they deserve. IMBD please refresh your ratings soon as the reviews for this movie will progressively go up as time passes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A movie to bring balance to the two Trilogies...,"I personally am more of a fan of the original trilogy than what I have been of the prequels. Although I did enjoy TPM, and AOTC, they definitely were not as well done as A New Hope or Empire. I think the general criticisms of the first two prequels was lack of good story, and poor acting. First I would like to say that the acting is much better in Revenge of the Sith than the first two prequels, but what truly stood out in this movie was the story. It was delivered perfectly, for the first time since Empire, Lucas connected emotionally with his audience. The last hour of the movie was especially powerful. Although probably not planned, I think this movie will be the bridge that brings the old star wars sheep back into the fold. Just as Anakin eventually brings balance to the force, Revenge of the Sith will bring balance back to the Star Wars Universe. And judging by the reaction of the test audience I was part of, everyone I was with feels the same way, no one left their seat for at least a couple minutes after the movie ended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The saga is complete.,"Finally we have the episode3 of Star wars. So many things happens in this episode, that I need to make a summary of the things that happens. First of all, some years have passed since the Clone War. Anakin and Obi Wan are fighting as hard as they can, specially now that Palpatine was kidnapped by general Grievous, the leader of the droids army. Anakin finally menage to kill Count Dookan,( with Palpatine motivating him)and Obi Wan killed Gen. Grievous.Anakin continues to maintain the marriage with Padmé hidden, but things starts to become complicated to him when he starts to have nightmares with Padmé dying when she gave birth .Anakin becomes a sith and an apprentice from Darth Sidious, and even Padmé who could not believe that Anakin turned to be bad, is shocked by his behavior(as well as obi wan).Anakin's looks are much better then episode 2(he is more similar to Luke) and R2-D2 has more participations in this episode as the others.The clones executing order 66 has strong scenes, because seeing so many Jedis and Wookies being killed is heartbreaking for everybody who is a big fan of Star Wars.(specially when the little Jedi children are killed by Anakin's hands) This episode is the mark when the Empire begins and the Jedis fall. The only jedis alive are Yoda and Obi Wan, the first one stays isolated and the second one goes to Tatooine to give Luke to her uncle and to be watching him. (Leia and Luke are isolated from each other to be safe from the siths, and Leia stays with Senator Organa,who always wanted to adopt a little girl).We also can see Anakin's body being destroyed in the fire, and for that reason he cannot live without the black and famous suit of Darth Vader, that nowadays is an icon for every fan.Padmé only died because she gave up of living, since Anaking broke her heart. (By the way, she only dies because of Anakin himself) In his desire to make PAdmé alive, he went to the dark side and this is what makes her sad and heartbroke.(Palpatine,who is lord sidious tempted him with the offer of knowing how to produce life, and Anaking, being too much an ambitious person and angry with the jedi council that not trust him very much, became a sith.R2 and CP3O has their memory erased, that's why they don't remember anything and never told Luke about his father.*A Thing that I really don't like: 1-First, I personally think that Anakin surrendered too easily for the dark side, specially for someone who was full of doubts all the time. But in general, this the best episode from the new trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Flawed,"Enjoyable, but very flawed.Too many wasted characters. Jar Jar Binks added then ditched when he realised everyone hated him.What was the point of having Chewbacca in it - ah! I know, so George Lucas can tell all his fans that ""Chewy's in it.""C3-PO, a waste of time - should never have been in the first two and should have just been added at the end of the third one. Vader screaming ""Nooooo!!"" at the end. Reminds me of Seymour Skinner off the Simpsons screaming ""Nooooo!!"" when Bart Simpson inflates a hot air balloon of him and releases it.Too many light-sabre battles. Probably because George was desperate to have them in. In the IV, V, VI films there was around one battle per film.Too many characters. No one is likable in any of the I, II, III films.Also the Prime Minister of Utapau. When he whispered that the ""Clone Army was here."" I can't tell if he was lying or not. very ambiguous.Obi-Wan's lizard had something stuck in it's throat.Visuals are very good, but more original ships should have been in it instead of re-designed ones. There isn't a single ship in the I, II, III same as the ones in the later ones. Obi-Wan and co should have been in Tie Fighters as the Empire simply replaced the Republic.George's problem is that there's too many people round him saying ""yes, George, Jar Jar, fantastic idea.."" get my point.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
surprised.,"i loved star wars as a kid. i grew disenchanted with the new trilogy. i was prepared for another letdown.i was surprised to see that things really come together. 'sith' has a coherent story, well told, well paced. the movie is full of fireworks, but they always support the progression of the story, nothing felt unnecessary like some stuff in the earlier episodes. the characters were all solid. some were even great. there were quiet, slow paced moments that made sense, felt right. the transformation of the characters came across well. the conflicts are complex, personalities are multifaceted. this movie carries a lot more weight than episodes 1 and 2.not everyone will be happy. there are weak moments, there is wooden dialog, there's cheesy romance. nevertheless, for most of the audience, even non hard-core star wars believers, this movie works. it's great entertainment, and it ties in very well with episodes 4-6. the sense of disconnect that people felt with episodes 1 and 2 is gone. you will want to go home and watch 'a new hope' right after seeing 'revenge of the sith'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than expected.  Best of 1-3,"After Episode 1, I had nearly written off the Star Wars series. When I saw Episode 2, I found myself interested again. However, after 2, I have to admit that I dreaded the release of Episode 3. I knew that what I felt was the weakest and most irritating aspect of Episode 2 - the love story between Anakin and Padmé - would become a major theme in episode 3. While I understood then, as I do now, that this was an important element of the overall plot of the series, I never felt compelled to care about it. Portman and Christenson just did not seem to have any chemistry and I felt that the scripts became clichéd, one dimensional and pretentious in every one of their scenes together.If my rating of 6 sounds harsh to you, please keep in mind that I ADORED A New Hope - seeing it no less than 4 times on its first run in the theaters and a couple times in its re-released special edition, but - for me A New Hope is the only film in the entire pair of trilogies I would rate above an 8, and I am not sure I would give any of the rest an 8.Episode 3, however, is a worthy addition to the Star Wars series, bringing back the elements of intelligent political intrigue, beautifully shot fast-paced action sequences and special effects, and clear lines between good and evil. It's a nice wrap up for the saga and does much to explain, if nothing else, why Lucas chose to present the series in the way that he did.My only complaint about Episode 3 can be summed in two words - ""Hayden Christenson"". I felt he was miscast in Episode 2, and in both 2 and 3, I felt that his acting needed at least a few more years of development. He is blown off the screen in almost every dialog with any other actor in the cast, and though he does a good job with his interpretation of the rise of Darth Vader, it seems that camera angles and direction might have been what saved him in the scenes where he excelled. Though many reviewers feel that Anakin's transition to the dark side took place too quickly and was poorly examined, I believe that all of the elements of internal tension and conflicting desire (Anakin has always been power-hungry, head-strong and too easily flattered into compliance) have been in the script since Episode 2, I have to fault the actor and the director for failing to bring these problems to life in a more vivid and powerful way.The rest of the cast is quite good. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Ian McDiarmid were particular impressive. Although McDiarmid's physical acting occasionally challenged belief, his portrayal of Palpatine was spot-on. McGregor, by episode 3, has absolutely come to define Obi Wan Kenobi as much as the great Alec Guinness did. I really enjoyed watching him act as Alec Guinnes acting as Obi Wan Kenobi, and adding a bit of his own unique style to the character.Episode 3 is not just a fan movie, but an exciting and interesting experience and a vast improvement over episodes 1 and 2. While it will disappoint many of the more closed-minded fans, I can recommend it to sci-fi action fans in general, and those who felt alienated from the series by Episodes 1 and 2. It's not quite the wild time that A New Hope was, but, in it's own way, it might just become a classic over the years.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not bad for  a Star Wars movie - though that's not really saying much,"I had had a difficult day and needed some mindless entertainment. I wasn't disappointed. Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith has had some of the worst elements of the series pruned - gone are most of the irritating cuddly little creatures aimed at the spin-off toys market (there's no shortage of other spin-offs), and the disingenuous racist stereotypes suggested in other episodes seem to have been cleaned up. It even has a degree of political correctness with a throwaway jibe that recalls George (bad Jedi: ""If you're not with me, you are my enemy"") Bush and the parallels with modern day dictators (whether they trumpet a corrupt democracy or a brutal regime behind their warmongering) are apparent. One of the flaws of other Star Wars episodes has been the simplistic 'ultimate good versus ultimate evil' debate - in this one, the two warring sides are seen as separated more by pain, fear, misunderstanding and miscommunication than anything else. There are slightly less overtly religious references, although 'The Force' still has an elitist hierarchy based on some poorly defined universal power. Probably the only character you'd trust to run anything might be the genuinely peace-loving and diplomatic Padme, a female icon played by Natalie Portman and love for whom sparks off more 'evil'.What of the film itself? As Star Wars films goes, it's not bad, but that isn't saying much. The dialogue is mostly trite, the acting wooden, and the cinematography could be aimed at a 12-year old with learning difficulties. Some of the special effects are quite nice - I particularly liked the cityscapes. If you've followed any of the other episodes and not been permanently turned off you'll probably go just to see what you're missing - and to get to see the genesis of the big bad Daath Vader. But it is a film that, without the marketing and money poured in to it, would still be firmly in the Saturday children's matinée slot if there still was one. The robots make funny, cutesy little squeaks (even in the vacuum of space or when trying not to be heard by other robots), affect gay walks, or (especially the baddie ones) sound a bit like they've strayed from a Mickey Mouse cartoon. In the old days, if you got confused as to who the good guys were, you could usually assume the black man was the bad guy. Nowadays that would lose too big a sector of the market so it's the ugly, deformed people who are bad guys (or bad robots): cute (or good-looking) equals goods guy. If good guys go bad they reassuringly become ugly or have funny eyes.Portman (who has a better stab at some real acting than any of the others) has a character that maintains or the traditional stereotypes of the subjugated woman - her main function in the film is to have babies. Remarkably, in a galaxy where the most unimaginably advanced medical techniques are routinely available in the blink of an eye, women, even quite important and well-placed women (ie important in relation to men) can die of childbirth. The fear that she will die in this way prompts superstitious Jedi warrior Anakin Skywalker not to seek out more reliable doctors and surgeons but to go a dangerous route to greater supernatural power to somehow 'protect' her. Women, being such weak creatures are (not unsurprisingly) largely noticeable by their absence in the important affairs of state where men decide how to blow each other up. It would be nice to think that George Lucas was suggesting this as irony - unfortunately he probably is not. His grasp of human rights is about as sturdy as any well-oiled social liberalite that, like the Republicans he lambastes, probably couldn't pronounce the names of half the places that America wages war on. Team America: World Police had a clearer take on such things. Unfortunately George Lucas is still on a galaxy far, far away, even if it will pump revenue back home to him, if not for light years, at least for a very long time to come.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If Star Wars must end, this is the way to end it!","(NOTE: THERE WILL BE MAJOR SPOILERS WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!!) As the Clone Wars rage on, spreading Jedi across the galaxy, the Seperatists dare to strike at the heart of the republic. Led by General Grievous, the evil cyborg, the Seperatists kidnap the Supreme Chancellor of the republic, Palpatine. Two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, are sent out to rescue the Supreme Chancellor, and what unfolds is an epic space battle and a lightsaber duel with the Sith Lord and Seperatist leader Count Dooku. After a successful rescue, the two Jedi end up being separated. Obi-Wan is sent to find General Grievous, who escaped the epic space-battle. Anakin is left on Coruscant, capital of the republic, to spy on Chancellor Palpatine, whose actions in the Senate seem suspicious. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith, is looking for a new apprentice, since Anakin killed Dooku.Anakin and Palpatine are good friends. They trust each other. Palpatine is like a father to Anakin. When Palpatine reveals that he himself is Darth Sidious and that he wants Anakin to be his new apprentice, Anakin turns to is fellow Jedi for help. The Jedi confront Palpatine, and the Sith Lord engages them in a lightsaber duel. Anakin, against orders, goes to th epic battle, only to turn on his friends and join Palpatine. Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and helps Sidious destroy the rest of the Jedi. In the end, Vader engages Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel, only to lose and be seriously injured.

Predictable,"By know you know the most important things: the acting and dialog are unbearable (except in the case of McDiarmid), and the effects are busy but competent. The story spins and spins until it ends where we know it must with each step being supremely predicable.This comment deals with only two elements: risk and dimension, plus a few miscellany.Risk:This is the most profitable franchise in the history of media. Lucas has shown that fans will turn out no matter how bad the films are. The last two were scandals yet sold tons of tickets. He could have done anything with this. Anything.Almost every other major player in Hollywood at this point in their careers  rich beyond imagining and nearuniversally celebrated  would strive to satisfy their peers that they indeed are capable of doing something clever and inventive if not artistic. They know history grinds away at hacks, no matter how successful, until they become jokes, Edward Bulwer- Lytton was in his day roughly in the position that Lucas is now. Today he is a joke from Snoopy in the comics to the yearly Bulwer-Lytton junk writing contest.Recall this movie and ask yourself if there was anything in it that surprised you, that wasn't exactly as you expected from past movies, that made you sit up and say, ""wow."" With the approximately 8 billion dollars this franchise will make directly, there could have been room for something  at least one thing that was cool. There was not a shred of new imagination in the cities, creatures, props or design. Not a single novel technological item or scientific or even cultural idea was introduced, usually what defines science fiction.Though Lucas owns the largest and most advanced special effects company in the world (Industrial Light and Magic), there was no effect that we haven't seen elsewhere. Does this lack of risk, ambition and novelty strike you as odd?The first movie in the series (the 1977 one) did introduce something new in effects, the dogfight and trench run at the end. Since then, effect-laden films have learned how to place and move the camera in new and exciting places. Even a film as mundane as ""Unleashed,"" which I saw last week, moved the camera into the midst of the fight scenes. Lucas' camera is still stuck in the same mode as in 1977, which he (admittedly) stole from Kurosawa.Dimension:That is... except for the first seven minutes or so. That is the only part of the whole movie where we see a new camera eye. This is dePalma's eye: it follows the fighters and their pilots; it swings around them and precedes them, it swings to their point of view, it moves back out of the battle and back in. But shortly we are back in the old static greenscreen mode with Jackson.There's a famous story in Hollywood. Lucas took his original Star Wars money and built ILM and Pixar. He really had ambitions to change the future of cinema. ILM has indeed become a major force in movie-making and some say the world is now open to new possibilities. But ILM has instead become rooted in realities: you imagine a place and they make it look real. Pixar was always the place where more imaginative and impossible worlds would take shape.But he simply didn't know what to do with it. He couldn't stretch his vision beyond what he could already see, so he sold it to Steve Jobs. Jobs has focused not so much on inventing new realities but on a new feeling of dimensionality for the viewer. ""Nemo"" was cast in the sea so that the action and the camera would be free to move in all three dimensions. Pixar has profoundly changed how we expect our eye to move in threespace, and they have effected that change more in the last 4 years.Space battles are ideal fields for this sort of awareness, but simple travel in high cities affords lots of opportunities as well. This movie has many, many places where the new consciousness could have been employed, but it wasn't.Miscellaneous:Ewan McGregor's career will survive. He's already been in two films that actually did make a dent in the universe (""Pillow Book,"" and ""Moulin Rouge""). He doesn't need to claim this as an important film.Non-US viewers will certainly see this story as a metaphor for American politics and policies of force: a democracy that sacrifices freedom for security; a war based on sleight of hand; the statement that anyone not for us is an enemy; the misappropriation of religion for political gain...On opening weekend of this film, I predict that it will be remembered as something that changed the political narrative in the US by sheer exposure (and timing). And that as mythmaking and movie-making remembered not as important but fondly recalled, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" is today.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best prequel film,"It is an amazingly choreographed masterpiece.When it released it was a pretty good film but not outstanding but when clone wars came out and fleshed out the characters and built up the world and added more to Anakins fall was just beautiful.I know the film by itself is just good and the clone wars is a seven season show but it is worth it and you should watch it.Revenge of the sith is still an amazing film that I love watching and you should watch it too. But watch all of clone wars first except the final 4 episodes, leave them until after you watch RotS.

It would have been more entertain had this film focused on the building of the ""Death Star"". It also would have been great to see a better way the Anakin turn to the ""Dark Side""George Lucas is a good director of special effects but directing people is not for him.Hayden Christensen however is miscast and so wooden in this that you don't care that he is almost burned alive.Natalie Portman however does not come across any better but most of us knew she is a very good actress however you would never know it if you only saw her in this.The one bright note is that Jar Jar Binks only has a 1 second cameo in this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force was not really in it..,"This film is a must see, simply because it is the link in the saga, but that is about where it ends.First off, the special effects are stunning. A small army of people worked on them and these did a very nice job. The problem is that there is hardly any shot *without* SFX and cross-fades are at a high pace. It seems likes Lucas is racing towards the finish and moving in full force to do so. Everyone is an action hero, including R2D2, and the Jedi are put to use as one-man armies.Unfortunately, the film suffers from three flaws. Most annoyingly, there seems to be no chemistry between Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Natalie Portman (Padme), whose characters are supposed to be in love. In fact, the latter connects much more with Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan), who was surely the best actor in the film.The second flaw is the pomp in general. Whereas the early Star Wars films still seemed like they were fun, the later (and this one in particular) are heavier in drama and music than a Wagner opera.The third is that Anakin is walking into a rather obvious trap set by Darth Sidious, and somehow gives a Sith Lord the benefit of the doubt over all of his Jedi mentors, in the face of much too blatant political maneuvering.All in all, I feel Lucas overshot his target. The film is more action than adventure, as if the video game knockoff was the most important consideration. My suspension of disbelief was long gone by the time Darth Vader rose in his dark suit.None of this matters, of course, because hordes will go and see it, if only for that scene and the accompanying music.P.S. One more thing: personally, I deeply regretted that Jar Jar Binks did not get killed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"my review of Star Wars III, Revenge of the Sith","I must admit that I am not a die hard Star Wars fan, but I had to go and see the third movie on the day that it came out, because my son who is 13 wanted to see it so badly. I will tell you this much: after seeing the movie, I went and bought the digitally remastered CD set of the first trilogy, and watched it from the beginning to the end. Now the last confrontation between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader becomes so meaningful, while I thought that their fight in episode IV was so primitive compared to their fight in the final moments of episode III, which was very nicely done by the way. The movie had me think so long and hard, and it has been a long time since a movie had me think so much.I thought that Anakin had a very bad hair stylist. The entire time during the movie, I thought ""boy, do something with your hair!"" His acting was better in this movie than the other ones, but he did not convince me that he is a villain. He did not convince me that he became Darth Vader, he was still too cute and lovable to be anything but Anakin Skywalker.I thought that the transition to becoming Darth Vader was a bit too easy and sudden. Just a few words by the chancellor and there was Anakin at his feet giving up his soul to the devil. That was just not believable I thought.Then I thought about the agony that he went through to get to that point, and I saw many helped him on his path. In episode II, he did tell Padme about how he had murdered the sand people, revealing to Padme the pain and suffering that he was going through. Yet Padme, who is supposedly older and wiser than Anakin, does not try to help him resolve his feelings, either herself or by asking help from one of the Jedi's. Instead, she marries the troubled young boy who does not know what he wants in life yet! There you go Padme, that will fix him, lets add more pain and torture to this troubled young man who is trying to find his path, and can't deal with his emotions, lets marry him and keep it a secret, to add to his dilemma and pain and suffering! That will fix him! Oh no, that is not enough though Padme, lets get pregnant too, so that he is really fixed! So Padme had a big hand in pushing Anakin toward the dark side.Then the advice that Yoda gives him when Anakin does go for help ""you must forgo of all attachments..."" what kind of advice is that?! Yoda, you know he is in pain, you know he murdered the sand people (Yoda sensed it as it was happening) so why the heck are you not reaching out to the boy? And there is the Jedi council. They realize that Anakin has powers, and is troubled, yet they try to force him to obey them, instead of trying to help calm his troubled soul. They keep shutting him up instead of listening to him. They keep yelling at him instead of being kind to him. There you go, good job guys, you know that Anakin has a troubled soul, yet you do all that you can to send him down the path of hell. You guys perhaps deserved your fate because you were so stupid.I couldn't help but cry out when Anakin was defeated by Obi-Wan. As his limbs and arm were cut and he fell onto the sand, I cried. I felt for Anakin, everyone had helped push him on that dark path, and the end, Anakin had to pay for it dearly. Obi-Wan's life was saved so many times by Anakin, yet he did nothing at least to help Anakin when he was being burned by the fire that started consuming what was left of his body. He left Anakin there screaming in pain. Oh how everyone had a big hand in creating Darth Vader, and how they thought that they themselves were so much better than Anakin because they did not give in to the powers of the dark side.I have been thinking about my relationship with my son, how now as a single mother things are hard at times and how I have no patience with him, so I try to force him to act the way I want him to, ignoring the troubled age that he is and the transformation that he is going through from a child into becoming a man. This movie made me realize that I too am like the Jedi's, trying to force my son into submission, while I forget that the forces of doing the bad things can be so strong and times, and so tempting and sweet. Throughout all of this, the only one that listened to Anakin was the Chancellor. And then the Jedi's were hurt and wondered why Anakin joined the dark side.I vow to be different than the Jedi's from now on, and try to listen to my son's emotions as he is going through them. What my son needs to realize is that I am his only true friend, and he will not realize this by me trying to force him into my ways. That will make him choose the wrong path.Anakin, my heart goes out to you, you were a victim.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith - 10/10,"1. Overall Plot - 10/10
This is the climax of the Star Wars Galaxy. Order sixty-six, the fall of the Jedi, and creation of the Empire is the most important and big event in Star Wars. Seeing that all be played out is amazing. There is also the best fight scenes of any movie ever.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10
Most entertaining a movie can get. It's full of action packed scenes, and just doesn't stop. It's so good. The plot of Anakin becoming Vader is very cool to watch.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 10/10
Absolutely full of emotion. Whether it's Anakin's fall to the Dark Side, his love for Padme, his relationship with the Jedi Order, or even with his brother, Obi-Wan. The emotional journey's that every single character goes through is amazing.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10
This movie is absolutely full of different amazing themes. One I like is the struggle of good and evil. Even the most evil people can sometimes do the most evil things because of good intentions. Anakin didn't want to join the Dark Side. He wanted to save Padme, and in trying to do that was consumed by Darth Vader.This is one of the deepest movies I've ever seen. Everything has meaning to it. It is a perfect way to tie and connect and give context from the prequels to the original trilogy.5. Characters - 10/10
All the character are amazing. Anakin is just trying to save Padme. Obi-Wan is just trying to do the best he can and help Anakin. And Palpatine is a truly evil genius who has been pulling all the strings perfectly.6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
All the acting is amazing. People say Hayden Christensen is bad in this movie, but I think he's amazing. He shows very well just how conflicted Anakin is.Natalie Portman is pretty cheesy at times. And Ian McDiarmid is also kind of cheesy at times. But I think both of these are very easy to look past. At the end of the day, George Lucas has always said that Star Wars is a space family soap opera. So it being a little to dramatic and cheesy at times makes sense.7a. Cinematography - 10/10
This movie is beautiful. Star Wars cinematography is amazing. And this is the best of the best.7b. Choreography - 10/10
The fights in this are the best in every movie ever. The Mustafar scene alone is single handedly the best fight of all time. It is all very fast paced, and full of emotion. The shots are filmed very wide too, so you see the entirety of the fights, and all the amazing choreography.8. Score - 10/10
Star Wars has the best music. And this is the best of it. The music is so powerful, deep, and meaningful. It is very epic to watch.9. Editing / Pace - 10/10
I love the classic Star Wars editing. The pace is also great, and we see the complete journey all the characters go on.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
The effects look phenomenal in this. It's amazing to me that it looks better than a lot of much more modern films.Average Score:
9.9/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:

I only rate my top ten movies a ten out of ten. That is how good this movie is. This is the best of the best. Star Wars is my favorite franchise aside from Jurassic Park, and this is the peak of Star Wars. The storytelling is phenomenal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not bad...once we actually got to the movie,"I have no idea what Lucas was thinking about when he wrote this bloated mess. It seems so simple; everyone wants to see how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. So why are we watching 2 hours of Obi-Wan or Yoda chasing people around the galaxy with the requisite 15 minute long light saber battle? No one cares about any of that...just get to what the movie is actually about for God's sake.Once they get to that storyline in Act 3, the movie becomes interesting. While the acting by certain cast members is rather stiff (which I blame partially on the digital sets; it's hard to interact with a green screen for a whole movie), Ewan McGregor gets better as the movie goes on. The screen writing, direction, and editing also get much tighter in the 3rd act. In short, Act 3 shows what kind of movie could have been made if Lucas wasn't so focused on CGI battles designed more to sell toys than to advance the plot. The Empire Strikes Back remains the best in the series mostly because it was about advancing a story rather than Lucas' bank account.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gives a perfect closure to the prequel trilogy! A must watch.,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is an epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. The film stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Late Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Late Kenny Baker and Frank Oz.The sequel to The Phantom Menace (1999) and Attack of the Clones (2002), it is the sixth film in the Star Wars film series.Anakin joins forces with Obi-Wan and sets Palpatine free from the evil clutches of Count Doku. However, he falls prey to Palpatine and the Jedis' mind games and gives into temptation.The best film of trilogy and absolutely incredibly superb film. The film has a base of superb story, great execution, with mystery, BGM and astounding VFX and backed by great acting and beautiful locations.The plot and the execution of the film is superb and is been beautifully supported by perfect cinematography. The film which will keep you spellbinded throughout and gives a perfect closure to the prequel trilogy.The acting is superb and all the characters were impressive in their respective characters. I was critical of Hayden Christensen in the previous film but in this film he was superb and it seems that he adapted the character of Anakin perfectly. Ewan McGregor, Portman, Jackson all of them were very impressive in their characters.Screenplay of the film is fast paced and gripping and is beautifully balanced by the superb use of VFX. The cinematography is great and the BGM is also very effective. This is undoubtedly one of the best film of prequel trilogy and a must watch for all the star wars fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's not *that* good!,"Come on, 8.2/10? That's the current running average on IMDb. The movie is *not* that good! The acting was bad, again, and special effects were too much, again, and the whole thing felt very contrived. The opening sequence with Palpatine's rescue was the worst opening sequence of *any* of the Star Wars movies to date. Of the three ""new"" movies, I'd give my nod to Phantom Menace as the best, Revenge of the Sith second, and Attack of the clones third. My favorite is ultimately still the 1977 original, although there were elements of Empire and Jedi that I'd rate higher. The best light saber duel is hands down the battle with Darth Maul. The worst is probably this latest effort, with them battling it out on the lava flow. That was even funnier than the Yoda/Dooku battle in Attack of the Clones.'Nuff said",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
FITTING END TO THE PREQUEL.,Fitting end to the prequels! The culmination of a two other movies that ends with so much emotion weight and a great pay off that transition to the original trilogy.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty darn excellent!,"Quite a few things can be said about the Star Wars prequels and it is not all positive. It is pretty safe to assume that you either love or hate them but in my opinion Episode III is pretty close to the high standards of the original three films. Many people felt that Episode I was to much directed towards children, a lot of people felt that the main character (Anakin) was too weak in Episode II but Episode III remedies both these things.The tone in Episode III is much darker, in fact it could be said that Episode III is the darkest of all the Star Wars films and like it was the case with Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back this darkness suits the universe very, very well. The darkness also gives the film less of a computer game feel (a thing much loathed about the previous installments although I didn't mind) and somehow makes the film seem more real. The dark tone is also very appropriate given the contents of the film because this film more so than any of the other Star Wars films is dominated by the dark side of the force. This film tells of oppression and how the Galactic Empire came to be and also it is the culmination of the battle between Anakin and Obi Wan who are like two brothers.The effects in this film are also better than ever before. They are still not as good as the effects in Lord of the Rings but they are pretty close and it seems to me that a lot more attention has been paid to the details in this film than in the previous two films and I can't help but wonder if the Episodes I and II would have been better films if as much attention had been paid to them as in this one. In fact looking back it would seem that the previous films were nothing but build ups to this film which has the obvious climax. Every scene in this film has some form of special effect and it is done so well that you don't even notice the effects which is of course a good sign meaning that the effects work.The acting has improved in this film and I think people will think better of Hayden Christensen after seeing this film than after seeing the Episode II. He seems more at home in the character and the fact that he has obviously been working out in preparation for the film helps making him look menacing rather than pathetic like in Episode II. He deals better with the dialog which is still not good enough (but then again Lucas never could write dialog). Christensen seems to be able to portray the emotions of the character better this time around which was a nice change from Episode II where all he could do was create broad strokes. His chemistry with the other actors have improved partially because his chemistry with Natalie Portman is still pretty much non existent but his relationship with Obi Wan seems to be much better. You feel real warmth and sincerity between the two (Anakin and Obi Wan which makes Anakin's claims of seeing Obi Wan like a father seem more plausible unlike in Episode II where all they did was argue). Ewan McGregor is absolutely brilliant in this film. Not only does he look increasingly like the now deceased Sir Alec Guinness but he also sounds like him. His sense of timing and his use of his voice makes him an ideal younger Obi Wan and the most well rounded character of the bunch (in fact because of Mcgregor's performance Obi Wan has become my favorite Star Wars character). He steals every scene he is in and he still kicks ass on the battle field. Natalie Portman has nothing to work with making her character flat and unbelievable but I don't blame her. I blame Lucas. Ian McDiarmid finally gets his chance to shine and he shines brightly. He seems to be the actor who deals best with the cheesy dialog and delivers every line with confidence and experience. He truly becomes the Emperor and is completely credible all the way through.Not everything is positive in this film, however. First of all much of Anakin's development seems rushed and is therefore not completely believable. Also I really don't get why Lucas had to introduce General Grievous. He is not at all menacing and Matthew Wood's voice acting is horrendously bad. He is just plain annoying and a character whom I hate nearly as much as Jar Jar Binks (who didn't say anything in this film YAY!). Needless to say the dialog is still quite bad but that is to be expected.All in all the best of the Star Wars prequels and (I feel) as good as the original films.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The best of the prequels, but it does disappoint","Revenge of the Sith was a decent entry of the Star Wars saga. It is for me the best of the prequels, by far outshining the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Having said that though, I still was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it looks absolutely amazing. If there is one thing all the Star Wars movies have in common, it is that they are all a marvel to look at. With the marvellous cinematography, splendid special effects and colourful sets, it was a feast for the eyes. John Williams has a record for writing truly magnificent scores for ET, Home Alone and Superman, and is up there with Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman and Jerry Goldsmith as one of the best film composers ever. The score he did for this film is no exception; it was absolutely outstanding. The performances in general were a lot more solid than they were in the other prequels. Ewen MacGregor impresses as Obi Wan, Frank Oz is brilliant as Yoda, Christopher Lee was superb as Count Dooku and Ian McDiarmund steals his scenes as the benevolent Palpatine. Natalie Portman shows beauty and a vast emotional range as Padma. However there were problems I had with the movie. While not as bad as he was in Attack of the Clones, Hayden Christensen did for me give a wooden and unconvincing lead performance. Plus whereas the stories in New Hope, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back are clear, sophisticated and fast paced, there were pacing problems here and the plot was murky and convoluted. And sadly, I also thought the dialogue was as wooden as Christensen's performance. Overall, a good movie, if you want the real thing, watch New Hope, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back instead, but on its own merits it's watchable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Blown Away!,"I love Star Wars but to be honest I wasn't expecting to be as totally enthralled by Revenge of the Sith like I am. Knowing the final outcome I thought how good can this one be? Well, it met my expectations, and went above and beyond them. I am so overwhelmed by all the visuals, the action, the emotion ... George Lucas is a genius. Hayden Christensen pulled off the transformation (emotionally and physically) superbly. The action was non-stop as was the emotional turmoil. Many true to life themes. Wow! I just can't say enough. Everyone must see this movie. If you're not already a Star Wars fan you will be after Episode III. I feel like I finally ""get"" the entire series. I have closure now. This is just THE movie to see this year. Like I said not just because it's a great Star Wars movie but because it is just a great movie period. Go see it - you won't be disappointed. You might think you know what's going to happen but they give us so much more than just straight cut answers. This is so much more than the missing piece of the storyline - this is IT! This is why we were blessed with Episodes 5-6 to begin with.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
All I can say is that Lucas has finally redeemed himself!,"MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!Yep, I got to catch an advanced screening of the long awaited final episode of the Star Wars saga, up here in Nothern California.All I can say is, WOW! This has the best action sequences of any of the six Star Wars films! The battle sequences at the beginning with Jedi star fighters and separatist forces is by far the most spectacular special effects sequence ever put to film.Anakin's downfall towards the dark side begins after an opponent of his is killed, which lures him more and more towards the dark side of the Force.Anakin and Obi-Wan spend the first half of the film trying to end the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separtist forces.Acting wise, Heyden Christensen does a much better job this time around portraying the darker Anakin Skywalker as he heads towards his destiny, all of the wooden Anakin from The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones is finally free from his shackles this time around.Ewan McGregor, excellent as always does a great job portraying Obi-Wan Kenobi as a jedi master who knows his pupil is headed for the dark side.Natalie Portman does a great job portraying Padme Amidala as the tragic wife of Anakin who knows that the Republic and her husband are slowly drifting away from her. Padme's final scene is heartbreaking to say the least and adds some serious emotional impact towards the ending of the film.But, the real scene stealer is Ian McDiarmand who does an excellent job portraying the kindly Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as well as another major character in this film.The new villain, General Grievous, is cool, but I liked Jango Fett and Darth Maul a little more. Grievous isn't in the movie too much but when he and Obi-Wan are fighting on the planet Utapau, it's war on a large scale, with Obi-Wan riding this large lizard and Grivous riding this wheeled vehicle. While this is going on, Anakin grows even more closer towards the dark side, with fits of rage and jealousy towards his fellow jedi and towards the Republic.In this film you see how all of the jedi are exterminated, what finally happens to Padme, the mother of Luke and Leia, how Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and how the crumbling Republic becomes the first Galactic Empire. Warning though, Anakin's change to Darth Vader is quite scary and will definitely upset the little ones! Wow, Lucas has done it, and made a successful connection to the original Star Wars film, A New Hope! One of the coolest bits is seeing the Tantive IV, Bail Organa's rebel blockade runner, from A New Hope in action towards the end of Revenge of the Sith.We finally get to see Alderaan, and the wookie Chewbacca for the first time since the classic films, and the best bet, only a short glimpse of Jar Jar Binks towards the end of the film during a highly important funeral.The final confrontation between Obi-Wan and Anakin on the planet Mustafar, a lava planet, as well as the final duel between Yoda and Darth Sidious are far the best lightsaber battles of any of the films so far, and their tragic endings will only highlight the impact of the events that unfold in the film!While I'm sorry to see the cinematic portion of Star Wars come to an end, Lucas has ended the Star Wars saga on a grand fashion. All of John Williams music has pieces of the earlier prequels and some elements from the classic films to tie Revenge of the Sith with the other five films of the saga.Now, I'm more excited than ever for the upcoming television series, which takes place right after the events of Revenge of the Sith! Here's hoping that Revenge of the Sith, knocks off Titanic as the highest grossing film of all time!Buy your tickets now, because Sith doesn't just happen, it rules!By far the best of the three Star Wars prequels.

Faust,"This is the part of the new series that Lucas was waiting to tell, and everyone else was waiting to see. Everything that precedes it is filler -- magnificent at times -- but something to keep fans in suspense and sustain the cliffhanger tragedy in the public mind. For all the lambasting Lucas receives, he is a good orchestrator of ideas, though he has lost touch with the energy and pacing of his earlier films. He has the same kind of foresight that Mephistopholes has in this play. It is a grand, but flawed vision, full of coercion for the fans through relentless persuasion in the media.In a way, this film feels like a confession. It is a commentary on the dehumanization of films through technology. Gradually, these movies have lost the real actors that were the vitality of the series, and piece by piece, have been replaced with CG 'clones'. The product of this vision is now more mechanized, so it feels like it is only sustaining us, keeping us alive enough to feed the Empire. One of the last shots in the film is a chilling one. Anakin's human eyes are replaced by computer-generated vision.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The Best Star Wars Film Of All Time, Othello For The Millennial Generation","In 2002, George Lucas took a multitude of creative risks in both writing and directing, raising his ""Star Wars"" saga (And the Fantasy genre in general) to a level of maturity, intelligence and emotional depth not seen since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" with his second film of the prequel trilogy, ""Attack of the Clones."" (Fanboys hated it.) The final film in his prequel trilogy, ""Revenge of the Sith"", surpasses even franchise juggernaut ""Empire"" in terms of story, acting, themes, drama and characters. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a very far cry from the relatively lighthearted and optimistic original trilogy. ""Star Wars Episode III""'s bite matches its bark, its epic battles used to elevate already heavy substance to the tale of a good person losing everything to a tragic flaw, much like in Shakespearean tragedy.Anakin Skywalker has visibly matured and developed between ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Revenge of the Sith""; having grown far wiser and more empathetic, mastering his emotions to a point where they guide him rather than control him. This growth in character makes his irreversible descent into darkness all the more tragic, spurred by a horrific vision of his wife's death. When he finally turns to the Dark Side, it's not mere impulsivity; it's a ""damned if he does, damned if he doesn't"" choice motivated by a very plausible and understandable fear of losing the most important person in his life. Padme is a completely different person from the stoic, reserved Queen we saw in ""Phantom Menace."" Rather, Padme has become a very extroverted and emotionally open person to Anakin, her love and trust blinding her from seeing his flaws; ones that ironically if spotted earlier could have saved her husband. The same love that brought out her humanity is the love that ultimately leads to her demise. Obi Wan Kenobi is at his most likable and relatable here, having grown into a proud and loving father figure to Anakin. Their trust has grown since ""Attack of the Clones"", and Obi Wan's admiration for his apprentice prevents him from truly empathizing with him. As Proverbs 16:18 says, ""Pride goeth before destruction."" All these characters are indeed blinded by their love, and ""Revenge of the Sith"" does an excellent job telling a story of the terrible danger in emotions clouding reason and leading to destructive delusions. Also poignant is the film's message on being as open as possible to our loved ones, a course of action Anakin refuses to take as his relationship with Padme is, though full of love, severely lacking in trust.Hayden Christensen gives what is, in my opinion, the best performance of the entire Saga as Anakin Skywalker. He carries an aura of fear, paranoia and sadness to both his facial and vocal acting (With a touch of madness. The scene where he attempts to convince Padme to rule the galaxy with him is chilling.) that makes it impossible not to sympathize with his character.Natalie Portman gives easily her most intense and passionate performance of the trilogy. She really sells her blinding and undying love for Anakin. Her scene on Mustafar where she begs Anakin to change his ways brings major tears, making even the most cheesy of dialogue sound shockingly touching and heartfelt.Ewan McGregor has never been better as Obi Wan Kenobi, offering the definitive take on the character in ""Episode III."" He does a phenomenal job with Obi Wan's transition of loving pride for his apprentice to horror and disgust at his best friend's terrible deeds. He's particularly effective in the final 1/4 of the film.Ian McDiarmid is downright frightening as Chancellor (And later EMPEROR) Palpatine. The Mephistopheles to Anakin's Johann Faust, McDiarmid boasts a vast range of emotion in his role as Palpatine; from manipulative warmth and deceptive kindness to seething hatred to manic and sadistic glee.The lightsaber fight between Anakin & Obi Wan is large on scale, but more importantly, it's possibly the most emotional cinematic duel of the new millennium. The duel is truly difficult to watch but impossible to look away from, the emotion and feeling of betrayal experienced by both characters clear in their facial expressions and choreography, the latter almost emphasizing a subtle hesitation or scare attempt Anakin & Obi Wan try to use as attempts to get the other to back down. This culminates in a heart breaking conclusion and a powerful monologue by Obi Wan, delivered with poignant sincerity by Ewan McGregor.Fanboys prefer the original trilogy and ""The Force Awakens"" for emphasizing the more upbeat and ""fun"" side of the ""Star Wars"" saga. ""Sith""'s more adult take finds its real emotional core. The sheer darkness of the film displeases the Saga's fanboys and hipsters who pine for the days of corny one liners and trope characters. One scene in particular, a brilliantly subtle and resonating rumination scene where Anakin gazes out from the Jedi Temple and Padme from her apartment over a sunset descending Coruscant as they ponder their future together, does what no ""Star Wars"" film before or since ""Episode III"" has done; it takes a scene with no action and no dialogue, and turns it into a tear inducer. The acting, subtext, cinematography and music in that scene makes it, in my opinion, the apex of the entire ""Star Wars"" saga. Unlike the soulless, abominable works of Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay, George Lucas uses the gorgeous visuals in ""Revenge of the Sith"" as a tool to convey emotion rather than a toy to be played with. From a symbolic shot of Anakin solemnly gazing at the sun slowly leaving Mustafar to the horrific sight of him burning alive on its Hellish shores, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a work of art.""Revenge of the Sith"" is a masterpiece that transcends the limits of its franchise and its genre. It's one of the most underrated films ever and easily the best film in the Saga.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Obi wan vs Anakin Skywalker,"First of all, i am not a very huge fan of star wars movies. In fact, i would rather play the star wars game on best possible gaming console than watching the movies.

And it is quite nicely shown how he turns toward dark side. performances are not great but decent enough. It also gives answer to various questions like how the twins were separated and who is the dark lord who lures anakin towards dark side.I would give it a 7 out of 10.

Now I get it!,"Just got back from seeing Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. I'm not a big Star Wars fan but I have watched it with friends who are fans or seen it on TV re-runs growing up. I didn't dress up or even go on opening night. I wasn't even planning on seeing it but I was invited by some friends. It was not a disappointment at all. It had action from beginning to end. Drama, comedy and mystery too. Not much surprises but quite a few sad parts that were tear jerker to a few people in the theater. This Star Wars movie basically shows how a good kid turns bad as a result of bad influences.In this movie, the good kid was Anakin Sywalker who turns into the evil Darth Vader as a result of the bad influence known as Darth Sidious. Honestly, I wouldn't have understood a lot of the Star Wars plots and characters if it weren't for this movie. Episode III answers a lot of questions. Even if you don't care about Star Wars, poke fun at the ""geeks"", laugh at the names of the characters and think there are a few bad acting in it, it is an overall great action movie worth seeing! Most of the graphics were a little hard to fathom since light-sabers, light speed vehicles, weird characters and numerous things in the movie are things that we haven't seen in our lifetime. BUT it was pretty awesome to see how realistic all the graphics looked. You don't have to watch the rest of the Star Wars movies to understand the story but it does help to know the gist of the previous Star Wars movies.Now, I understand why the first three episodes of Star Wars weren't shown because it would have taken a lot of surprises and suspense in the original Star Wars movies back in the 70s and 80s (Espisode IV-VI). Hearing ""Luke, I am your father!"" would have been less of a surprise considering the first three episodes would have told the audience about that. Besides, George Lucas didn't know back then if all six episodes of the Star Wars movies would have been a success so he had to make the story a little shorter first. Episodes I-III were just written to show the fans the whole story of this epic adventure. Episode III does a great job at connecting the whole story together. I recommend seeing this movie with an open mind and just appreciate the imagination turned into visual reality thanks to movie magic. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another almost great movie from George Lucas,"The problem with ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the same as the problem with ""Attack of the Clones"". Writer/director George Lucas spends to much time trying to connect all of the Star Wars dots. He shouldn't have bothered. He should have made the prequels to please movie audiences and not worry abourt all of the Stars Wars fans that read the books. They are two different audiences. ""Revenge of the Sith"" has quite a few moments of movie greatness. The battle scenes, the look, the imagination involved are all terrific. The scenes with General Grievous are my favorites. He's a great villain. The major problem with this movie is same as ""Episode II"". The story of Padme and Anakin is dull and uninteresting. Hayden Christensen is a pretty face that's not up for the task and Natalie Portman mails it in. With each passing viewing I find Portman more and more annoying. I saw ""Revenge of the Sith"" for the first time in the theater. I've seen it quite a few times since.

The Saga is Complete,"There was a bittersweet feeling to watching this movie. One one side, the crowd cheered when the Star Wars letters boomed onto the screen and clapped when the end credits ensued. On the other side, we are done. There is no more movies, no more anticipation of the next installment, no more questions on how the saber duel between Vader and Obi-Wan occurs. There will be much analysis and commentary on if this satisfied us in the close to 20 year buildup.I for one was at the edge of my seat throughout this film, absorbing everything to the fullest. The dialogue was slightly improved over the previous two and the chemistry between Hayden and Nathalie was still non-existent but the story and the effects were great. This was a dark piece of the trilogy and once I completed watching it, I went home, had a quick bite to eat and sat down to watch A New Hope and I saw a link and consistency that was missing from the first two.The next step for Star Wars will be TV I am sure with the success and well written episodes of the Clone Wars.

"Some flawed minor things, but everything you can expect of a SW title.","There was one major thing that I disliked about this movie when I watched it in the Cinema. The transition of Anakin to the Dark Side is unconvincing.Yes, he wanted to save Padmé, but why would he just go about killing jedi kids and doing other awful things so fast? It is as if he was always an evil psycho instead of a normal guy who fell into darkness due to a lie. On top of that, a gullible fool when it came to Palpatine, but very suspicious when it came to the Jedi.I don't think the actor is to blame, but the poor dialogue/script Lucas sometimes writes, no one is perfect (the ""sand is coarse"" dialogue comes to mind).Other than that, this is a massively underrated movie considering the SW universe. There is no way ANY of the new disney SW can come close to this in rating terms. Overly complaining fans really left an unwarranted bad record for this movie.The movie has amazing action, amazing lightsaber fights, wonderful CGI for its time, that even today looks good, and it has a clear and interesting plot. This movie is a Masterpiece if you compare this to the Disney shenanigans.This is very close to Empire Strikes Back, which is arguably perhaps the greatest SW movie ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
THE TRUE OPINION,The movie sucks... I love itThats all folks,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Dark Side Rises,"""Revenge of the Sith"" uses more computer generated images than the two movies before it, only it is brighter and richer in detail than ""Attack of the Clones"". But it visually loses to ""The Phantom Menace"" because real sets, real locations and practical effects, when used well, work best. The plot is easily superior to both ""Episode I"" and ""Episode II"". It does introduce some elements that have never been there before and some of the important events did happen off screen, but in general, it works with the material that has been built across the three movies. And regardless of the great amount of action that it has all over the place, ""Episode III"" does not even come close to suffocating under its own spectacularly huge weight. It may have primitive dialogue here and there, it may have primitive acting here and there, it may have too much ridiculous lightsaber swinging, it may still want you to believe that human soldiers are somehow better than battle droids, and it may not have much Christopher Lee, but it is beautiful, meaningful and bold, especially, for a mainstream piece of entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force is stronger with this one...,"""Star Wars"" is back... and the Force is stronger with this one. Episode III in the saga (and also the final Star Wars film) is a better showing than the previous two prequels (""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones""). The plot is solid, the effects are excellent and the action is real. There's everything a Star Wars fan could want: lightsabers, villains, Darth Vader, Luke and Leia... But the film lacks something: magic. ""Revenge"" fails to recapture the magic of the original ""Star Wars"" films, although it certainly gives a valiant effort, and toward the end of the film it comes very close. But it never really fully grabs on to that mystical quality that was so evident in those original films.Part of the reason rests with Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker). He fails to deliver on all points. The delivery of his lines is terrible. His scenes with Natalie Portman (Padme Amidala) are almost painful to watch, and several times I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of the dialogue. So perhaps Christensen isn't completely to blame. The script leaves much to be desired. The dialogue, as I mentioned before, is laughable in more than one scene. The opening scroll text is ridiculous (although, admittedly, it wasn't that much better in the originals). However, of any actor, the one portraying Anakin Skywalker should give the strongest and most stirring performance. The audience should be emotionally involved in his turn to the Dark Side. But Christensen makes that impossible. His lack of ability to make the character connect with the audience makes the film lose much of its potency.Yet there are some truly stellar performances. Ian McDiarmid (Chancellor Palpatine) is stunning. Every time his character speaks, his voice manipulates both the characters and the audience. He is truly a worthy villain for this saga and it's refreshing to finally see the Emperor of ""Return of the Jedi"" fame finally come into being. Another solid performance comes from Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi). He manages to deliver some really awful lines with a spirit that few actors would have been able to muster.Episode III, while not necessarily what I would call a true return to the spirit of the original ""Star Wars,"" is still a fun, entertaining movie. And fans of the saga will enjoy seeing Darth Vader on screen again, in all his splendor. But this is not a film that I would take young children to. While the previous two films (especially Episode I) have been more family friendly, this film is not quite so. It is rated PG-13 for a reason. There are some very intense and disturbing images that were upsetting even to the film's older audience members. Overall, this film is more than I had expected. It has its faults, but it is still a decent, entertaining film that allows us to glimpse at the man behind the mask of Darth Vader.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than I or II, but nowhere near Empire","This movie would be worth it just for the last half hour or 45 minutes, but two things keep me from rating it higher 1) the humor that appears in the initial trilogy is lost, or forced, here. Nothing to equal the Han/Leia type stuff like ""Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder. Who's scruffy-looking?"" 2) Portman and Cristensen have all the chemistry of a used Kleenex. (Heck, Cristensen has more chemistry with McGregor than with Portman.)However, that being said, I think what this trilogy has been completely missing is the sense of wonder of the initial trilogy. After watching the opening CGI sequence, I was reminded of a quote from Vader in Episode IV: ""Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed."" Lucas should have heeded his own advice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Perfect Conclusion,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith delivers a cinematic masterpiece, earning a solid 10/10. The film's exceptional storytelling expertly exhibits Anakin Skywalker's tragic fall, intertwining it seamlessly with the larger Star Wars saga. George Lucas's grandiose vision comes to fruition through breathtaking visuals, particularly in the lightsaber duels and space battles, showcasing the stellar advancements in CGI at the hands of ILM. The emotionally charged performances, especially the iconic Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Hayden Christensen's compelling portrayal of Anakin, elevate the narrative to great heights. John Williams's incredible score adds a layer of depth never before seen to this extent, delivering what is in my opinion, one of the greatest film scores in the history of cinema. Revenge of the Sith stands as a crowning achievement in the Star Wars universe, a thrilling blend of epic space opera and tragic character-driven drama. How this movie can stand at only a 7.6/10 on IMDB will never cease to amaze me, as this film delivered one of the most thrilling cinematic experiences of all time. Thank you George Lucas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A troubled film.,"I'm sorry, but I just don't know what else to say about this film. This is truly a piece of cinema that is struggling to entertain. With some of the most impressive visuals seen in the last 100 years of filmmaking, one wonders what went amiss here.The opening sequence of the two jedi pilots flying through the battle looks and feels odd, and sets the tone for the overall story. Many complain about the juvenile aspect of ""The Phantom Menace"", and some of the kitschy story telling of the second film; ""Attack of the Clones"". But for me this film tops them all in terms of getting sidetracked by the visuals.For a film that's supposed to be rated-R it sure does seem to lean towards a kiddy audience in a very bizarre way. So much that I'm hard pressed to label this thing other than a skittish film that bounces from here to there in terms of at whom the story particulars were aimed.The best way to critique this film is to look at the first Star Wars film ever made. That movie was a bit of an homage to the old sci-fi serials, just like the Indiana Jones were an homage to the serial adventure series. But the thing about the original Star Wars film was that there was a grounding there, a sense of plausibility and realism that melded with the far off setting and adventure. When Leia was about to be interrogated in the Death Star, we knew she was in for a round of torture and horror. We never saw it, but it was very much implied. When Luke was looking out at the twin G1 and G2 stars of Tatooine, we saw a sunset shot as a real sunset, framed and pictured for us by Carole Ballards magnificent lensing; cinematography that gave a bit of a documentary feel combined with a classic film making framing reminiscent of films like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Ben Hur"" or even ""Shane"". We were slowly introduced into that environment after having a taste of action in the beginning. And that's the other case for the original Star Wars film; example; the opening fire fight shows us a sense of reality, a sense of danger, a sense of plausibility and tension without an emphasis on showing off the visuals, or getting side tracked by truly unimportant SFX. The story dictated the shots, not the reverse.With ""Revenge of the Sith"", and looking at the silly light saber fights, the puzzling antics detracting from the story direction (cutesy but dangerous miniature robots instead of an explosive warhead on a missile? Exactly who is this film for?), implausible feats even by super hero standards, simply put, torpedo this thing to the bottom of the interstellar equivalent of Davy Joneses locker.I saw it twice in the theatre. Once by myself, then again with some people I knew at the time. And I just couldn't get over the complete comic book abandon this film took to tell the story. It's like if someone were to make a prequel to ""Spartacus"", and ditched all of the scope and profound character driven moments, and instead replaced them with cool martial arts action and flying weapons to take sword and sandal epics ""in a new direction"".And for all of the spectacular visuals the one thing that really gets me, that really makes me wonder, is that none, and I mean positively none of the special effects looked real. Visually spectacular, and technical wizardry beyond my SFX background, of that there is no doubt. But for all that, they looked like glamorized photo-realistic cartoons.That is key.The whole point behind the first film was to bring those exciting moments of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon to the big screen in an updated and more technically and dramatically driven vein. Every sci-fi fan loved the effort, me included. But these latest films? And specifically the last one? Wow, what a disappointment.But, they're the author's films, and what are we going to do about it? That's the vision he chose, and that's what we have.Hopefully the next big sci-fi film maker will throw something up on the screen with a bit more care, and perhaps be a bit more hands on in the art department and cinematography.For something as big and well known as Star Wars, there's a certain weight that the films needed to live up to. But the story is more fairy tale than the other films ever were, and fused with some outlandish and unconvincing special effects and action that really take over the film, one is very hard pressed to gleam anything positive out of this.I'll be brutally honest here, I think of my own film career and the opportunity I had to work up there in Marin (LF, ILM, Sp), and am glad I didn't. As a grip, PA or AD I wouldn't have had one iota in terms of creative input, and to be honest with myself my review is all hindsight, so I'm not even sure I would have had the wherewithal nor courage to point out some of the really obvious foibles in this piece. I mean, I'm not the director, and every director I used to work for had their view on how right their vision was; i.e. infallible. Is the author of Star Wars any different? I don't know.Watch at your own risk.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Star Wars Film,"Once there was a Thane in Scotland, who learned from a coven of witches that he was destined to rule as king so his wife, Lady Macbeth, convinced him to betray and murder the king so as to seize the throne. Lord Macbeth did so in secret but then betrayed and killed all of his friends for fear of the murder being exposed and he became a paranoid and bloodthirsty tyrant with even his wife looking upon what he did (at her suggestion) in horror and killing herself. Then Macbeth went mad with power and assured his own downfall. That is the Tragedy of Macbeth by William Shakespeare, the story of a man who went from hero to homicidal tyrant.Is Revenge of the Sith as good a story as Macbeth? No but it is still quite good. Why? Because like Shakespeare, its writers understood Aristotelian tragedy. A mostly admirable figure with a single major flaw (or set of flaws) makes appallingly bad decisions as a result of his flawed nature and assures his own downfall eliciting the sympathy of the audience in so doing (thanks to the aforementioned admirable traits.)Can a story of a hero who becomes a villain be a compelling Aristotelian tragedy? Yes, Shakespeare proved that. Can George Lucas also create compelling tragedy from the same basic premise? Yes, this movie does an excellent job in proving that.Would I regard this movie as worthy of the Bard himself, as some do? No but it's quite good nonetheless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good but one wooden actor kills it,"Hayden Christiansen as Anikan Skywalker is so stiff he kills the Movie, great effects, great action, but as a central character he simply labours through every scene, how he was cast is a mystery, Kermit the Frog could have carried it off better, not surprising he's never led in a movie again outside these Star Wars movies, they got stuck with him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Get your kicks with Order 66.,"I had hoped, when I decided to watch this prequels again with my son, that ""Revenge of the Sith"" might be good enough that it makes up for suffering through the first two again. Whilst I would never argue that it's a perfect film, I would say that not only is it much better than Episodes 1 and 2, but that it's a good film in its own right.The clone wars having been raging for years, and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are heroes. Following a daring kidnapping by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) the pair are sent to liberate Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) which they successfully do, with Skywalker killing Dooku against his Jedi training. Later Palpatine reveals himself to be a Sith Lord to Skywalker, but tells him that only the power of the dark side can keep his wife, Padme (Natalie Portman) who is pregnant with their children alive. As Anakin makes his choice, the Chancellor's transition to becoming an Emperor is complete.There are still some existing problems with this film. Mostly they are in performance though. I know it's not cool to constantly harp on about one actor, particularly one who has suffered these complaints for 16 years now but Hayden Christensen is not good. He has less awful dialogue to deal with this time, but still he struggles to convey the torment that his character is suffering through.The film has improved in other ways though. Visually it's really good, with the entirely CGI General Grevious actually being believable as character (and I was surprised about how little screen time the character has, given his popularity and existence in other Star Wars media going forward). Dooku too is sold a little short by the film, and it's really worth reading the novelisation, as my son and I did prior to watching the film, to get more of what's going on with him.It's just a better paced movie all round. The action beats are much more spaced out and frequent across the run time. The final fight between Obi-Wan and Vader is really well done, maybe even better than the three-way dance of Episode One. The horrors of Order 66 and Anakin's trip to the temple classroom. Brilliant moments in a film that, as I said, is not just miles better than the other prequels - but also a good film in it's own right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Satisfying, but I cant help feel somewhat disappointed","In ROTS, George Lucas has managed to tie and complete the SW series quite well. He links all the stories well, and ROTS flows well into Episode IV. The visuals are stunning and every scene is carefully thought out (visually that is), giving us a convincing feel of the 'realness' of this very detailed world.However I must say, positives end there. I felt there wasn't enough time allowed to develop the characters, many of the scenes felt rushed as if to say George Lucas was thinking, ""Ok, whats the quickest way to state Anni and Padame's love? I know get them together for a cheesy scene!"". A lot of the scenes were not dramatic enough and lacked underlying meanings or symbolism. I felt as if everything was stating the obvious and lacked substance.Scenes which attracted the most criticism from me were Anni and Padame's 'romance' scenes and Anni's transition to the dark side. Anni and Padame's romance scenes are cringe worthy. Full of cheese and terrible, terrible acting by these two. To me their chemistry (and acting) are the biggest let downs of ROTS. Anni's transition to the dark side felt rushed and not dramatic enough, as is all of a sudden Anni thought to himself, ""Yeah why don't I just join the dark side, ehhh, why not?"".Overall this movie was satisfying and a relief compared to Episode one and two, but it falls short of its huge potential to be one the great movies of all time.I am satisfied yet disappointed...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Very disappointed fan,"As with all three of the prequels I came out very disappointed. Once again Lucas has proved he has spent too much time focusing on Industrial Light and Magic and not on his Star Wars universe. The movie is a visual masterpiece, but once again falls very short as for storyline.I think my biggest problem is the lack of likable characters. Anakin spends the whole movie crying and whining, very fitting for the future evil lord of the empire. Padme only talks about how much in love she is with Anakin, and Obi-wan was never my favorite character. Where is the Han Solo and Lando Calrisian to round out the characters. Where is the quick banter back and forth between characters that makes the story more real. That brings up my next problem.Once again the movie is filled with 3 word lines that fall short of their intended emotional impact. I heard Lucas hired a script writer for this movie, but I get the feeling he vetoed every idea the writer had. While watching the old movies there was plenty of dialogue between characters that was just jokes and quick wit. In all three of the new movies every line is dead serious taking away the fun of the movies.Overall it was an enjoyable movie with quite possibly the best computer animation ever achieved in movie history.

"Another Objective 5/10, 7 For Nostalgia","A few months ago, I wrote a review of Dinosaur (2000) saying it has lots of problems and is an objective 5/10, but I still kept my rating a 7 because of my enjoyment. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of The Sith holds a similar place in my heart.As a kid, I was a huge Star Wars nerd, and ROTS was my most anticipated movie of 2005. If I sit down and watch the movie, I can point out the countless plot holes and logical inconsistencies, and make fun of the bad dialogue and stilted acting and direction the whole way through. However, it's so thoroughly entertaining, I've seen it dozens of times and I never get tired of it. While the other 2 prequels are mostly boring and skippable, I have so much fun with Episode 3, both ironically and unironically.Pretty much every other film critic on the internet has pointed out the good and bad about this film. All I'm going to say is if you're new to Star Wars and are reluctant to watch the prequels because of their reputation, at least watch ROTS for Ian McDiarmid's performance as Palpatine/The Emperor. He's so deliciously over the top, his character just LOVES being evil, it's glorious.

Also going into the movie I kept reading that Hayden Christiansen did't come off as a whiny little Jedi like in Episode II... but I have to disagree.

I still recognize Leia's Theme,"The challenge of making Revenge of the Sith (as in any other prequel) is that we all know the ending but here, for some of us, it's 28 years ago. From this angle, George Lucas did a wonderful job in bringing things full circle, moving almost seamlessly back to the beginning 28 years ago, into the ORIGINAL Star Wars (1977), which is now given a somewhat contrived title ""A New Hope"".After the rather bizarre look in the first two episodes, C3P0 is finally looking like his good old self again. The X-wing fighter is back too, or at least an earlier version of it. And there is adorable Chewbacca (we even named our dog after him). And what ecstasy  as baby Leia is handed over to the foster parents, the long missed ""Leia's Theme"" wanders languidly into the background. There are also things unlooked for. Yoda's mention of the secret of immortality seems to be an attempt to explain why in the original trilogy Obi-wan deliberately allows himself to be struck down by Vadar in Episode IV and later appears as some kind of apparition in Episodes V and VI.Lucas delivers, making Episode III a satisfying, if not elating experience. The fiery lava scene does look a little bit too much like Mount Doom. The weakest point I think is the rather unconvincing conversion of Anakin to the Dark Side, seeming so easy, with hardly any struggle after blocking off Windu's killing blow at Dooku. We must remember that what started Anakin's road to the Dark Side was the anger and lust for vengeance of his mother's death. Although without graphic visuals, we were told of the ruthless slaughter of women and children in the hands of Anakin. This is the root of his evil side. It would be much more convincing had we been shown some quick flashbacks of that memory at the critical, fateful moment, the point of no return for Anakin/Vadar. Christensen is still the weakest link. I would prefer to see Ryan Gosling or Jake Gyllenhaal, two actors in the same age group that have much more depth in their acting.After watching the global opening of Revenge of the Sith in this part of the Galaxy, I immediately bought the DVD set of the original trilogy and re-watched all three. The most touching moment will always be when Anakin in the very end comes back, dying in his son's arms. The Force is back, alive and well.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The effects and scenery on this movie where fantastic as shown in the epic battles you can presence throughout the film, the passion along the continuing and long lasting duels between good and evil.

"Much better than the previous two, the next ones are still better!","""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (USA, 2005, 140 Min., Theatrical Version)A Review by Jonathan Fain[7/10]The closer the story line gets to the original Star Wars trilogy, the better the movie is. The mixture of the classic Star Wars storyline, and the bad tasted prequel story is excused due to the keep-on improving Computer Graphics, which steals the attention from the mess it creates in the story.I like Special Effects, also CGI, but watching this film and its prequels is like watching a computer game movie. Towards the ending of the film, themes from the original trilogy begin to appear: Darth Vader's black mask, The Imperial Soldiers and white halled battleships, and everything seems to become aesthetic, so is the story.The movie is full of action. At one point I grew tedious of the numerous light saber duels, and thanked god for they stopped fighting and started a dialog, which was beginning to be more interesting. The spaceship battle scenes are gigantic and too detailed and messy, makes it hard to follow the action.In my opinion, this movie should open the saga and the fans should discard the 2 prequels, as they were truly not related to the magic of the Star Wars world.Every kid that goes to this film, will understand the meaning of DEMOCRACY, as the term is repeated several times throughout the film. It is important for a film to teach, however, how bluntly the characters spill those words off the screen, it's annoying. Let us not forget the extremely poor, and cheesy ""Love Dialogs"" between Anakin and Padme. It started to annoy me in the previous episode already. The love dialogs between Han Solo to Princess Lea in the classic Star Wars were in funny and exciting and much more human.All of the characters receive closure except for the one character who made the original Star Wars a blockbuster, and I mean HAN SOLO. He is the reason why Star Wars was such a great movie. This movie doesn't mention Solo at all.Although the movie has many flaws, it creates a closure to the entire Star Wars plot, which gives to this movie a Shakespearean or maybe biblical atmosphere (especially at the last 5 minutes). The ending was exciting. Although I suffered at some parts of the movie with the messy and repetitive action, the ending got me out of the theater with a taste for more. Well, I do have the original trilogy at home... guess I can continue the adventure.

Very Disappointed,"OK so after episodes I and II, I wasn't really expecting very much from this movie. There seemed like a lot of ground for Lucas to cover which had been exacerbated by the slow pace of the previous two films. The plot was actually pretty good and the story ties everything together much better than I thought it was going to, by the end I wasn't really think such and such a part didn't make sense... However... the acting was really terrible (and as Portman and McGregor have proved themselves to be excellent actors it is hard to blame anything other than the direction), the editing was really really terrible, the script was horrible, the pace was all wrong, and it was probably an hour too short. Many of the above problems were to be expected, Lucas is a poor script writer and is not good at getting the best of performances from his actors. There are far too many scenes in the film that were not needed and because of this the important scenes feel rushed and squeezed into the remaining time.Lucas with ILM has pioneered movie special effects and has said that he waited so long before making the prequels because he was waiting for the effects he wanted to become available. What worked in the original trilogy was that he used the effects available to help him tell a story about an interesting universe, with good interesting characters who had development paths for us to follow. In the new films he has gone totally about face and the characters and universe only seem to be there to provide a platform for the special effects.I think I have been overly harsh in my scoring as if you compared this to a film like Independence Day it would probably hold up OK. However as part of a greater series it really stank and I think that the world would have been a better place had Lucas not bothered making episodes I, II, and III.Thank you all for your time.

It is a space opera isn't it?,"It really makes me sick. So many of the writers here are treating this movie as if it were a candidate for best dramatic movie of the millennium and then flunking it when it fails.

There is not a movie made that does not contain flaws and can't be ripped mercilessly to shreds (and that includes your favorite movie whatever that is).One of the thing I enjoyed about it was the way it tied the circle together resolving things from a New Hope and other episodes.I also enjoyed the performance of Ian McDiarmid very much. But the performance of the other actors was quite respectable.

May the farce be with you!,"It's a good piece of entertainment (hence 7/10), and I would heartily recommend it to anyone with a couple of empty hours on a Saturday evening, but I couldn't stop thinking, 'why on Tatooine did anyone bother making these movies?'.I saw the original movie when I was 7 years old, and episodes 4,5 & 6 (naturally) hold a special place in my heart. They were great tales of a simple band of characters forging a 'new hope' out of the old empire. They came at a time when the world was emerging from the grip of recession and reflected something of the (well-founded) youthful optimism of Lucas and Spielberg. The movies were good fun, and their natural successors seem to be the Indiana Jones series which continue a tradition of the individual battling the forces of evil in an amusing, knock-about adventure.The most recent 3 movies in the Star Wars cycle, however, seem to be an indulgence. The first two were especially complex, and I have no real idea what the story around the central theme of Anakin's development actually was. Something to do with trade. Anyway, not very interesting, and a world away from the 'band of heroes save world' theme of the first 3! So, in summary, it was a good movie, very entertaining, beautifully made, and as long as you can focus on that and not wonder why Lucas needed to make 8 hours of movie to explain why Ani went bad, then you'll love it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars Strikes Back,"George Lucas has finally decided to listen fan's complains and make a great work like this. I gave this movie a 10... maybe I'm still under impression but I can't find any minuses except poor acting in some parts of the movie and some cheesy dialog... But that are't real minuses because Star Wars movies are well known as movies with poor dialogs and acting... This movie won't get any Oscar any time soon but it's masterpiece if you like Star Wars... You have all those transformation from good to dark side, all those visual effects, space battles, ground battles, light saber duels... Palpatine is ingenious. He is the most brilliant carachter in whole movie... This movie is great! Thank you George",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great movie experience but....,"Star Wars Episode 3 is certainly well worth the money spent on the tickets. The special effects were out of this world! During the opening scene of the fight in space, a fighter was blown to bits and you can actually SEE the pilot being thrown into orbit together with the rest of the debris. If that effect does not meet expectations, I don't quite know how else anyone can make it better. The light saber duels were excellent. However, the Obiwan-Grievious fight scene was a huge disappointment. I mean, how can someone (or something) known as the ruthless killer of other Jedi warriors, and wielding FOUR light sabers, be so incompetent to lose 2 arms in a space of seconds?Unfortunately, I have to admit that what brought this movie down a few points was the hurried pace during that all important scene where Anakin became Darth Vader. The scene was perfect to extract the maximum dramatic emotion from the audience, but it felt as if Lucas was running out of film and needed to finish the shoot in double quick time. All in all, Episode 3 is the best of the prequels but some way short of the spirit of the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic,"It's a fantastic movie. Many would say The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars series, but I personally think Revenge of the Sith is the best. Every time I watch a Star Wars movie, there are parts that get a little boring, but this movie is not at all. I know what will happen in the end, but it's so exciting to see the process. And the lightsaber battle was so good I couldn't take my eyes off it. The prequel trilogy is worth seeing on its own. I love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mustafar!,"I felt the full spectrum of emotions while watching this film. While the first two prequels suffer from poor writing, acting and pacing, this movie overcomes them masterfully. The dialogue is much easier to digest, the acting is improved (especially by Hayden Christensen) and the film carries a weight and tension from start to finish. The storytelling is at a different level, with the juxtaposition in the final scenes illustrating so much more than birth and death.This film is the culmination of years of investment. From A New Hope to Attack of the Clones (regardless of quality), there is a depth to the characters and a third act payoff rarely accomplished in film. Seeing Anakin's fall from the Chosen One to a Sith Lord is captivating. The scenes with Palpatine's subtle manipulation (the booth, circling in the hallway, etc.) are sublime. All this tension leading to Anakin alone in the council room, split at the core with tears dripping down his face is why I watch movies.I could write an entire article just on the masterpiece that is the battle on Mustafar. There is a profound depth to every element in that scene. As an audience member, I care deeply about both characters. The relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin is finally broken as one expresses hate and the other love. They were brothers, spending more time in their life together than apart. This conflict is illustrated in their perfectly matched fighting style and the emotion brought forth by both characters. It might be the single best fight scene in cinema history. Seriously, I do not know if there is a better 1v1 battle with more emotional depth and a higher quality of fight choreography than this single scene.In the end, this film is not a celebration of Darth Vader, nor does it try to convey that the Jedi Order was perfect. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a tragedy, plain and simple. From the dialogue seconds apart of ""I need him!"" contrasted with ""What have I done?"", the story of Darth Vader is brought full circle. I know this is controversial, but I believe that this is the single best film in the Star Wars franchise.Best Character: Palpatine
Best Moment: Battle on Mustafar

This where the fun begin,"Where to begin with this film. It's really great better than the first two prequels. The final battles/ending was so emotional like seeing baby luke. However there are some flaws which are also from the other movie. First, they should've explored more with the back story to some of the characters like general grevious (who has his own flaw but I will get back to that). Like it felt just like the others missed opportunities and doesn't help the world building that much. Another thing is the dialogue is still meh/bland/forced but it's not awful like with the other two. Now to general grievous, this character is very one dimensional expect for the Darth sidious talk scene but other than that it feels very one dimensional. It felt like there was more to him but eh there was nothing there. Honestly he's an alright character because of the clone wars made him a little bit more enjoyable not all one dimensional. Not hating on general grievous but just there are some flaws. And overall this film is great the best of the prequels but still has flaws.Here's the entire thoughts of the prequels. They are good but should've been better with the world building which what most people agree on. Just felt George tried to be like the thrawn books/ the gold age of sith comic book like world building but never understand that it's much book than movie form if done this way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not compelling,"Watching the final part of the prequel trilogy gives one a real sense of closure, which is very good indeed, but also a real sense of emptiness, which isn't so good. I don't mean just an empty feeling because there are no more Star Wars films on the horizon, I mean empty as in sadly unfulfilling. If Star Wars Episode III were a candy bar, it wouldn't be Snickers.Going into the theater, you already have a sense of what'll be in the movie, because you know how Episode IV (aka Star Wars) began. So you know which characters from Episodes I and II won't make it to the end of III, you know what'll happen to the Jedi Council, and you know who turns evil and gets to wear a totally badass helmet.Sometimes being familiar with characters (perhaps intimately) is a good thing, because it makes it all the easier for one to root for them. On the other hand, knowing what's going to happen - and how things will end - can also be a debit, because then the viewer has a certain set of expectations that he or she feels should be met, expectations that when not met contribute to feelings of disappointment and disillusionment.Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), pupil to Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) torn between aiding the Jedi Council and Chancellor Palpatine while war rages on against Darth Sidious, Count Dooku, General Grievous, and the rest of the merry men of evil. Meanwhile, his wife Padme (Natalie Portman) can see her husband only in secret, lest knowledge of the union between a Jedi and a senator become known.Even though there are plenty of explosions, stunts, and general mayhem, the movie is really about the moral failings of man: Should Anakin stay on the true path as the Chosen One, fighting for good along with the other Jedi Knights? Or should he succumb to the Dark Side and help those he loves? Can he be selfish and selfless at the same time? Since he is such a young warrior, it seems, he is easily manipulated, but the catch is that he knows he's being manipulated by someone. Anakin's problem is that he doesn't know who is doing the manipulation, and he suddenly doesn't know whom to trust. Trust is a central theme to the story: Anakin's trust of the Council, of Obi-Wan, and of Padme; the Council's trust of Anakin and Palpatine; Padme's trust of Anakin. Their relationships offer an interesting juxtaposition with the violence and action surrounding them.With the first two episodes of the prequels, the viewer really didn't know what to expect. We knew where Star Wars began, of course, and we knew these three movies would lead us to it, but we didn't know how. What adventures would happen along the way? But with the third movie, less was left unknown before the movie even began. I knew what was going to happen, so I was counting on George Lucas to perhaps throw me a few curveballs to keep me off balance - and, of course, wow me with his special effects wizardry.My problem with the third episode was that it was simply there; it's almost as if it were a bridge to the fourth episode, rather than being a standalone episode itself. I wasn't really excited by this movie, which is in itself a major disappointment. I wasn't shocked, amazed, or surprised, and that's a real shame. True, it's great to see familiar characters (including late in the movie who shows up in the next episodes), and it's fun to see them do battle against their sworn enemies. It's fascinating to watch Anakin turn from callow youth to diabolic fiend bent on ruling the galaxy. But I knew the end result, and there was nothing compelling about the storyline.On the plus side, the acting by Christensen and Portman - especially in their shared scenes - has dramatically improved, although there are still moments when Christensen seems like he's only four lessons into a ten-lesson acting course. McGregor channels the late Alec Guiness; one can easily see how he becomes the old man we see in Episode IV.Even at nearly two and a half hours, the movie is fairly well paced, without some of the lulls that plagued the first two prequels. And the effects are certainly believable, not to mention those employed to animate Yoda and other nonhuman characters. The hand-to-hand fighting scenes are wonderful to behold, always credible.But the movie just doesn't grab you the way it should. It's the final movie in the series; we won't see another one. It should grab the viewer by the ears and shake him a bit. Instead, George Lucas' epic series finally comes to a close not with a bang-pop-zowie of an exploding Death Star but with the slight whimper of a Jedi sliced in two by a light saber.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My thoughts about the movie,"This movie was breath taking!!! I laughed with the characters, & suffered with them!!! The Star wars keep your attention from the first minute to the last!! It was great! The best moment from my point of view was a double battle in the end, where the viewer has the same emotions as Obi_Wan: either to be sorry for Skywalker, or to feel disappointed in him. & i just love Yoda: the way he thinks, talks & acts!!! He is incredible!As for the death of Padme it seems to be unclear, i mean it's understood that she has no will to live, but still... Also the motives of turning of Anakin to the dark side are very simple, but so human! frankly i expected some more unusual reasons & motivations, but these ones are really close to each of us!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
aren't you supposed to save the best for last?,"When George Lucas said the 30+ crowd prefer the older Star Wars movies to the newer ones while younger preference is the opposite, i realize after seeing Revenge Of The Sith Lucas was saying that kids today have bad taste in movies...It's saving grace however, is compared with the two other new movies it's the best. Plus we get to see the entry of Darth Vader which makes this movie a mandatory must see.For those of you that enjoy a good, compelling movie be prepared for disappointment. Lucas failed to overcome his hurdle of breathing excitement and suspense into a movie where the ending is all ready known. Additionally, the dialog just wasn't convincing and in places conversations were forced in order to push the plot along.I was also unhappy with his dependency on CGI. Sometimes things have to be done the old fashioned way just to keep scenes believable and this was the case with Sith. Of course my disassociation with the laws of CGI physics may be from not being raised on a Nintendo! Hmm, could this be the reason why reviews are split based on age Mr Lucas?Regardless of the bad, it is a MUST SEE. But if you must, I recommend a cheaper matinée showing or wait till it comes out on DVD. Have Fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Finally a Star Wars to get excited about again.,"What an amazing film. I loved it. Definitely the best of the new trilogy and only slightly below Empire. Blew New Hope out of the water (still my least favorite of the original three...) and much better than Return of the Jedi. Think Jedi without the Ewoks, the tone of Empire and some of the endearing but terribly cheesy dialog of New Hope and you have Revenge of the Sith. And hands down, the final fight scene... BEST... LIGHTSABER FIGHT... EVER!!! Only a few real mistakes, but anyone who really gives an honest assessment of the series will see these same issues in all the films... most notably the fact that Lucas can't write a love scene or dialogue to save his life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My Thoughts On Revenge Of The Sith,"Amazing... Purely amazing. Really, this was WAY better than Attack Of The Clones. This time both Portman and Christensen were superb actors (unlike the previous temper tantrums thrown by Anikan). For one thing, the movie was darker, unlike episodes 1 and 2, which were all bright and futuristic. This one had the feel of the original movies. The plot is full of action all the way through, and never has a dull point. Plus, the special effects are greatly done, so as to not look goofy. It's sad, it's exciting, it's romantic,it's philosophical, it's just plain... amazing. Really, if you haven't seen it yet, which almost everyone has, go NOW. You do NOT want to miss out on this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
best of a bad bunch,"I think it's fair to say, if George Lucas had messed up this one he would have well and truly been considered a bigger muppet than Miss Piggy.Well he didn't, he couldn't really. He has a classic tale at his disposal with the massive advantage of a transformation into one of the best known villains of the 20th Century.There are some dodgy bits, but we're kind of used to them now and also, nothing as bad as the love story in Clones or Jar Jar in Phantom.I don't feel the need to go into the ins and outs of the story as there are plenty of you who will doubtless pour over ""significance"" and whathaveyou.

An impressive and glorious end,"George Lucas has finally proved himself worthy of the legacy of ""Star Wars"". With Revenge of the Sith, Mr. Lucas has proved that he can actually direct a great movie. Revenge of the Sith manages to successfully and satisfyingly close the Star Wars circle. The saga is finally complete.Many Star Wars fans (myself included) were disappointed with George Lucas when he made the first two prequels, Episode I: The Phantom Menace and Episode II: Attack of the Clones. We felt that he ruined the charm and the magic of the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, and VI; A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi respectively). While nobody really goes to Star Wars to see great acting, the acting in the prequels (especially by those who played Anakin: Jake Lloyd in Phantom Menace and Hayden Christensen in Attack of the Clones, and also by Natalie Portman, who played Padme) was below any real level of tolerance. The fact that Natalie Portman is normally a good actress proves that the problem with the prequels was the director, and not the actors. The script was uneven, and George's pathetic attempt at writing romantic scenes in Attack of the Clones was so pathetic it was embarrassing. George also ruined some favorite Star Wars lore: The Force became a scientific matter (Medichlorians), and R2-D2 and C-3P0 became the sources of comic relief, thus completely ruining their characters. C-3P0's one-liners in Attack of the Clones were so bad it hurt. We all asked ourselves, ""What was George thinking?"" Well, with Revenge of the Sith, we understand that George asked himself the exact same thing.Revenge of the Sith is so much better than the previous two prequels it's amazing. Everything in it is better. I'll start with the least important: the special effects. The opening shot of the movie totally blew me away. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Many people complained about the way the CGI Yoda looked in Attack of the Clones, and I also thought that he wasn't a really amazing achievement in CGI. In Revenge of the Sith, the animators have clearly taken some more classes, and Yoda looks perfect. Who would have thought that a 2-foot-high green CGI character could look so believable? And he really does. The character of General Grievous is brilliantly executed. If you're a special effects fan, prepare to be completely blown away. What's so overwhelming about this, though, is that while the movie is built with the special effects, it doesn't rely on them, it's not built around them. They are used as tools to create the visuals of the Star Wars universe. They are second to the plot, and to the drama. And that's one of the reasons that Revenge of the Sith is so successful.The acting has improved by far. Natalie Portman finally proves to all Star Wars fans that she can, in fact, act. And she acts wonderfully in this movie. The true shining star, though, is Ian McDiarmid, who plays Palpatine powerfully, with ruthless supremacy bordering insanity.The film's single, biggest flaw is the casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker. Episode II was too flawed to really notice Hayden's bad acting, but in Episode III it stands out, and really drags the film down. This is especially unfortunate because of the intensity of the film and his character  intensity that is brought down because of his acting.The true crowning achievement of Revenge of the Sith, though, is the drama. It sounds strange saying this, but Revenge of the Sith is actually emotional. I was totally engaged in the drama. It's not all drama, though, there's plenty of action, but the scenes with the Jedi, especially with Palpatine or Anakin and Obi-Wan are really tense and powerful. The emotion in this film is something that hasn't been seen in Star Wars since the dramatic scenes between Luke and Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. Their intensity can definitely be compared to those very scenes. Anakin's decline towards the dark side is portrayed so brilliantly and dramatically, that you really feel for him, feel his and his loved ones' pain. Star Wars once again becomes a true cinematic experience, and not just a bunch of special effects.And despite the drama, there still is some of that good old Star Wars fun. The difference is, that with this movie George isn't (painfully) trying to create ""cool"" things on the screen. Yoda fighting Count Dooku in Attack of the Clones wasn't really important (after all, the fight ended quickly, and unresolved). It was put in just because George knew that people would think that seeing Yoda fighting would be ""cool"". The same goes for R2-D2 flying with the jets on his legs. In Revenge of the Sith, George doesn't show any of these things only because of their entertainment value. Yoda fights because he's fighting for his life. R2-D2 uses his jet packs as a tool, not as a way to show off his ""coolness"". It seems that George's attitude towards the film has completely changed from his attitude towards the other two prequels.Any Star Wars fan (and hopefully, that's all of you) will be delighted while (and after) watching the film, because of all the reasons mentioned above, but also because it's such a thrill watching as all the loose ends are tied, and all the pieces of the puzzle fit in perfectly with the beginning of the original trilogy, starting from Episode IV.All in all, Star Wars Episode III is a total success from George Lucas, who managed to end the saga with an impressive and glorious bang. And if you manage to look over the feeble dialog and the wooden acting, you'll see that it's actually a really good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Typical summer blockbuster, it is. Lacking detail, subtlety, performances and strong writing, it is. Impressed, I wasn't.","Star Wars was the film that pretty much created the blockbuster, tie-ins, merchandising, so it is no surprise to find that this one has all the strengths and weaknesses that we have come to associate with blockbusters. Specifically the issue that it is all noise and CGI without as much heart and good writing as would normally be required. Visually, this film will be a treat to those looking at the film on that level because it is like CGI overload  Lucas appears afraid to just have simple scenes so even personal moments in Padme's room have wide windows with constant movement behind them. On a technical it is impressive but it detracts from the story, which was what I went for, and it just ended up distracting and rather unnecessary. In the UK, one part of our terrorism laws prevents suspects using computers; at times I felt that perhaps the same measure should be taken against Lucas, to force him to focus on things other than effects.If you are just looking for action to wash over you with lots of pretty colours then this should do you, for me though even the action scenes were pretty uninvolving. Last week I saw Ong Bak  which drew a real reaction from the audience; with Sith, the audience just sat back and tried to keep up with it. It had its moments but it was never gripping or exciting. Part of this may be down to the fact we all know what will happen (we may not know the detail but we already know the outcomes) but this should have been a strength of the film because the script could've done much more with the material  making it tragic, clever, insightful and moving. Sadly it doesn't do any of these particularly well even if it has a go at all of them in some ways.Firstly, the story is not really developed past the very basic blocks that it skips over; hence Anakin's fall is rather obvious and lacking the complex inner turmoil that should have been there. In fact his turning is so simple and so easily explained that it almost makes Anakin look, well, gullible and weak willed rather than the imposing Vader we will know later. The script occasionally links to Bush's policy in Iraq but I think this was more by chance than anything else and as a result it doesn't really do anything clever or interesting with it other than just put it on the screen. Of course the basic story still works and it did enough to interest me and have a narrative that I cared about but saying ""this happens, that happens and this happens"" is not the same as writing a story with detail and intelligence  Lucas can only do the former. It was too late to address the character failings of the previous two films and the script can't  the characters are flat and my lack of emotional buy-in with them was a problem; of course my nostalgia helped to some degree but you can't ride on that alone. The biggest difference between the original (which was hardly Shakespeare after all) and this is fun. Everyone loves Han because he is great fun. Here everyone talks like they're delivering the most worth lines ever and it is rarely ""fun""; it is dry where it needed to be lively and it is only one or two childish moments with R2D2 that drew small laughs from the audience.This leaves his cast with a difficult task  delivering lines and characters that don't even work that well on paper. We seem to either have lots of action or the characters stand around explaining the story to the audience in long, overly-worthy speeches. Christensen is not awful, but with so little to work with he just comes off as rather wooden and simplistic; considering the strength and impact of Vader, the poor writing of his fall was surprising. Once inside his suit, Vader moves funnily like whoever was inside was overdoing things to compensate for the mask. McGregor can't do that much and just settles for doing his best Alex Guinness impression. Portman is shunted to one side and does OK with her few scenes, but the film can't spend too long on her so anything she might have been able to do is wasted. Jackson is at least cool  and thus manages to rise above his basic character and provide weight to his words. Ian McDiarmid produces such a wonderfully hammy performance that I expected him to reveal fangs and say ""I vant to suck your blood""; he was great fun though. The rest of the cast are all in small roles without ever being important to the audience  it was nice to see Chewy, R2, C3P0 and others but this was not their film.Overall, I forgave Clones because it had enough in it to just about stop me disliking it, but here I was not so forgiving  perhaps because I had higher hopes and saw it as being the most important part of the new films; just like Empire was the best of the original, this should have been an intense experience that had effects as the second reason for seeing it  not the first. As it is, people will flock to it and be overwhelmed with noise, movement and colour, and perhaps that will be enough with the building block story to satisfy the summer blockbuster audience who only go to the cinema once or twice a year. However many viewers will find the development to be basic; the performances dry; the CGI overused; the action noisy but yet strangely uninteresting. I didn't hate it (it didn't draw any strong emotions from me) but, considering the key role this film plays within the series, it fell well short of the mark.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A prime example of going out with a bang!,"There is a good reason ""Revenge of the Sith"" is considered the best movie in the prequel trilogy. It is way more serious than the two previous movies, it featured a lot of good action scenes, great music, explored themes such as loyalty, brotherly friendship, love, hate, betrayal, possibility of loss and the loss itself, as well as losing yourself. The movie is filled with iconic and well choreographed battle scenes and iconic scenes and lines in general, Anakin is a far less cringe character than in the second part and the music is phenomenal. The whole thing is simply put, a blast, and yes, as with every Star Wars movie, there are things you can criticize if you really want to, but I see no point, as I'm a Star Wars fan and I love these movies. I give it a 10/10, something which I'm about to do for the last time as far as the main entries in the franchise go, because Mr. Lucas decided to sell the franchise and... Well... It got questionable from here, but all in it's time, as it's said...

GREAT-depressing-Stunning visually,"I'm updating my first post because I saw the movie AGAIN, and now have different view of it. The first time I saw it was 12 midnight and I was very tired with a headache too. So I saw it again the next day, fully rested, feeling good, and now can give a fair assessment of it.Acting is fine in this film with the exception of Portman in 1 or 2 scenes, and Jackson in a few scenes. Portman is weak with her ""oh Anikin - let's go somewhere where its just you and me and our love"" bs. Jackson isn't ""official"" and ""military"" enough in his demeanor and presence. He struts when he walks. No disciplined use of the English language- casual and lax in word pronunciations. It doesn't seem appropriate for the military ""flavor"" of ""Jedi-status"" individuals. He and Portman are A-list, fine actors who are fantastic in other roles but not in these.We all know this is the story of the fall, so I wasn't expecting a happy ending. However, Lucas chose to end this thing with a scene that I thought was absolutely FANTASTIC. In the first movie, there is a scene (which I won't reveal) which became a sort of Landmark for its emotion, power, and uniqueness at the time. I thought that I was the only one who really loved this scene and remembered it. But Lucas, obviously recognized it as well and it was a fantastic way to end this movie. That being said...My problem with the film: I personally don't think we're given proper motivation for Anikin to fall to the dark side. If Lucas had shown slight clues of instable character, betrayal tendencies, or character flaws inclined towards evil previous to this movie, then this fall would have been more believable, as this sort of ""hidden"" but dark side started to grow. When Anikin falls to evil, it is so tragically depressingly unbelievable that I simply wanted to walk out of the theater; I mean - there was no well-developed REASON for him so suddenly turn to evil, I was like- so ""what's up wid dat""!??Regarding endless fight scenes, Its a time of war; there's going to be much fighting.

His battle with his former master, Obi Wan Kenobi, is one of the longest and most interesting lightsaber battles in the entire saga. During this battle, the fate of the republic is at stake.The film is simply brilliantly made. Special effects and computer graphics came in handy in a film where huge spaceships explode and many ragtag troops fight throughout the galaxy. Bravo, George Lucas!I liked the third episode more than the other eight, both in the way it was shot and in the plot itself - sad, but very interesting. In this part, many important characters die and entire governments collapse.My verdict: an unforgettable masterpiece of a film, the best of the entire saga.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Space Opera Strikes Back,"The interesting part of Episode III is how blandly the visual effects are presented, and how the action sequences in the first half of the film have so little intensity. Fighter ships sweep in and out between larger battle cruisers and deal with annoying little droids, and I don't care that it's CG  I accept it as valid star ships fighting over Courescant. It's a virtuoso display of Computer Generated Imagery . . . and yet I don't find myself in awe or wowed by the display, but then again it really wasn't the point of Episode III either.This review is written several weeks after two viewings, and I can't remember any sensation from Episode III to match the thrill of seeing the Millennium Falcon escape from the second Death Star down that tunnel or the canyon sequence from the first Death Star. George Lucas has succeeded all too well in blending visual effects with reality to the point that the epic battles in a galaxy far far away can backdrop a conversation without being distracting. Life and death struggles, mass space battles, and the evil veil of the dark side is as mundane as the morning routine before work.And in a weird way, the whole beginning of Episode III feels like it doesn't really belong. It feels like left-over issues from the previous film that needed addressing before Episode III could really begin, and to be quite frank, I probably would have liked Episode III a lot more if the entire first 30 minutes were cut and Anakin's fall was more deeply explored. On a related note, I'd of liked the entire trilogy more had the story been more personal to Anakin and not try to chronicle such a wide span of his and Obi-Wan's life.Enough of that, though, Revenge of the Sith is the film I've been waiting for. While the opening action sequences didn't do much to keep my attention, the exchanges between Anakin and Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, you rock) had me on the edge of my seat. I literally perked up every time Anakin would step into the same room with the Chancellor. I grinned with way too much delight upon hearing McDiarmid recited the line ""Leave us"" exactly as he did in Return of the Jedi. When Anakin says he'd like to kill the Sith Lord and Palpatine answers, ""I know you would . . ."" John Williams cleverly unveils the Emperor's theme, and it sent shivers down my spine.The seduction to the dark side  that is why I came to see Revenge of the Sith. Screw action sequences, screw Grievious, and the lightsaber fights, I came to hear Yoda cite, ""Gone he is, consumed by Darth Vador"" and it was good. It was damn good.Also noteworthy - the scenes that earned Sith a PG13 rating greatly impressed me. With MPAA mis-aimed sensitivity running rampant and the entire horror genre being diluted to PG13 ratings, it was strangely refreshing and satisfying seeing gruesome and haunting imagery in a Star Wars film. Let's face it, the Dark Side of Anakin Skywalker is far more suspenseful and shocking than anything The Ring 2, Cursed, and a number of other PG13 horror flicks had up their collective sleeves. I hereby retract any negative comments I may have made about George Lucas' artistic integrity.And the score . . . like he did with Return of the Jedi, John Williams saved the best for last. Sith's music is a cunning reflection of the ideas in the films  while its themes didn't particularly strike me right away like Jedi's score, this one snuck up on me and used more subtlety to grow on me. That's not to say Revenge of the Sith's score does not sport the usual John Williams orchestral color and boldness, but at first listen it seems to fall in the shadow of the other Star Wars themes . . . and slowly its unique sound and charms unfold not unlike the Emperor's master plan. I adore the music to Revenge of the Sith, and I can write a full review on the narrative and emotional power within the score.As I stated earlier Sith is the Star Wars prequel I had been waiting for. It was the joy of returning - truly returning - to that place ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" And I thank George Lucas for it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An important Star Wars movie,"Revenge of the Sith is by some distance the finest Star Wars prequel.The technical wizardry, the special effects, the ear-buzzing sound, the mind-numbing action and those magnificent light-sabres are all there.The special effects, of course, are incomparably good and the digital photography achieves a dazzling clarity.It contains dramatically cogent and highly satisfying finale to the Star Wars saga.The final third of this dark, brooding epic is utterly mesmerizing, building magnificently to a coda setting up all the events in the original trilogy with an as-to-now (at least in the prequels) unforeseen brilliance.Lucas has woven into the action and effects a relatively thoughtful story about a young man meant for greatness but corrupted by his own fear and confusion.A must-see Star Wars movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great film - I cannot understand the cynics,"George Lucas' saga finally comes to an end and although most seem to be delighted with 'Episode III', there are those who are less than pleased with 'Revenge of the Sith', something I have trouble understanding. Such an opinion must belong to those lacking in sight, hearing and, ultimately, soul.Now I will be among the first to say that George Lucas is certainly not a great director, and as a writer he is decidedly average (or decidedly below average). But what he has is imagination, more than most directors, such as, for example, any director going by the first name of 'Clint' or the surname of 'Eastwood'. Yet it is directors such as the latter that continue to reap rewards and accolades for their horribly conventional work, not to mention praise from dull film critics. After the average 'Episode I' and largely unsatisfactory 'Episode II', it seems too easy to jump onto the 'slate George Lucas' bandwagon. But 'Episode III', far from lacking in emotion and drama, is brimming with both, making the viewer really care about the characters in a way that was missing in the first two prequels. True, it may lack the sense of fun found in the original trilogy, but this film is not supposed to be fun. This film is about what makes a good man evil. And, surprisingly, it works.Beginning with a tremendous inter-stellar battle, 'Revenge of Sith' grabs the viewer's attention with an iron fist and never lets go. The action is well-paced, connecting well with just enough 'Star Wars' humour and the main characters' personal conflicts - Obi-Wan Kenobi's struggle with Separatist leader General Grievous, pregnant Padmé's inability to comprehend her husband's behaviour and, of course, Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace. The film's climax is a truly awesome sequence between Skywalker and Kenobi, full of passion and bitterness - it really does not disappoint.There has been much debate about the dialogue and acting in 'Episode III'. Well, the dialogue is awful in parts (notably most of the scenes between Anakin and Padmé) but why do people act as if this is something new? I enjoy the first trilogy ('Return of the Jedi' less so) not because of the dialogue (which is just as bad as it is in 'Episode III') or the acting (Mark Hamill? Harrison 'I have three facial expressions' Ford?) but because it is a great story that reaches into my imagination. The dialogue and acting in the original trilogy is hardly ground-breaking, but has been accepted as part of 'Star Wars' and does not harm people's enjoyment of the story. Why are we suddenly so prudish about it now? For the record, I think the acting is not at all bad in 'Revenge of the Sith'. Hayden Christensen, for all the slating he gets, is fine as the troubled Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader and brilliant in his duel with Obi-Wan on the lava planet of Mustafar. I only hope negativity towards his skills do not hamper his career - anyone seen 'Shattered Glass'? Ewan McGregor has never been better in his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Natalie Portman is the only actress I have ever seen that makes the line 'You're breaking my heart!' sound credibly heart-wrenching and Ian McDiarmid is excellent as the evil Senator Palpatine.'Episode III' does, however, have its flaws. The dialogue between Anakin and Padmé is excruciatingly cheesy and static at times and this does hinder the plot, as a major factor in Anakin's trip to the dark side of the force is his fear of losing his beloved wife. The problem is that the audience has to work a bit harder to really believe the love between the two is actually there. And the creation of Darth Vader seems a bit too easy in the end - a case of Senator Palpatine a.k.a. Darth Sidious basically saying 'Come on, son. The dark side. You know you want to join it...' and Anakin agreeing with 'Oh, okay then.'. Skywalker's reasoning may be slightly dodgy, but does suffice and the film's plus points far outweigh its negative aspects. This is 'Star Wars'. If one starts picking at the story's veneer, it will be difficult to stop. Just sit and enjoy it for what it is - over two hours of pure fantasy and perfect escapism that people of all ages will love (apart from narrow-minded cynics of course).Unlike Episode II, I found this film marvellously absorbing, wonderfully powerful, surprisingly moving and most of all, brilliantly entertaining. I cannot tell you how excited I was when the words 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...' appeared on the screen and John Williams famous score filled the cinema. This was one cinematic experience I will never forget.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Lucas should have asked himself before making all these prequels: ""What would this movie look like with original 1977 special effects?""","I love the original Star Wars trilogy and I'm even enough of a goober that I'll read some of the Star Wars books that continue the story of Luke, Han and Leia. So, honestly, I think I'm your typical American. Star Wars is right up there with apple pie and baseball, and if you've never ever had an incredible urge to pick up a lightsaber and go at it after watching the Star Wars movies, then you should have your head examined, or grow an imagination, whichever one is easier.So I'm just the type of sucker George Lucas was counting on when he made these prequels, because let's face it, these prequels are for the fans. Like many, I was disappointed with Episode I and II. They lacked everything that made the original trilogy a classic. The critics are right, Episode III is the best of the prequels and the first one that comes close to being a satisfying movie but it still lacks that ""oomph"" that made Star Wars such sci-fi greatness. I honestly think the main reason why most people are happy with the third film is because it introduces most of our favorite characters from the original films, and it has lots of Jedi lightsaber fights... lots of 'em!The problem I have with all these prequels is if Lucas had the same ""stone age"" special effects technology he did with the first ones, I don't think there would even be a reason to make most of the scenes in these prequels. You know, back when Jaba the Hutt was actually a huge puppet, when the Death Star interior was really a set piece and not a blue screen, or when lasers and lightsabers weren't CGI. Lucas couldn't fall back on incredible ten minute pod racing sequences, spectacular city backgrounds or insane Jedi stunts in the original trilogy but none of us cared! What pulled us in was a great story, compelling writing, on-screen chemistry with the main stars, a continuing storyline, and everything else that this prequel is missing. You know your trilogy has problems when even the eternally cool Samuel L. Jackson looks awkward as hell.So if you're asking if this third prequel justifies the first two wrecks and gives us an overall trilogy equal to the original films, the answer is no. Go check out The Lord of the Rings if you want a fantasy trilogy on par with the legendary original Star Wars trilogy. But in Lucas' defense, there have been trilogies that managed to destroy their series far worse than he did. Just look at The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, and suddenly Lucas looks like a genius! If you're just a casual Star Wars fan and wondering if you should pay the bucks to watch this movie, I say yes! You don't need to watch the first two to get into the third movie and now I'm not even sure if it was necessary to make the forerunners as a trilogy. Episode I especially looks pointless.Now that the prequel hype is officially over, I feel as though I've read another fun Star Wars book series or maybe even played one of the better Star Wars video games out there like Knights of the Old Republic or Jedi Knight. And that's how I recommend you view the prequels. They're more Star Wars candy for all of us fans who have ever wanted to pilot an X-Wing or fight with a lightsaber, but they'll never replace the feeling we had when we watched Luke Skywalker face Darth Vader or Han Solo fly out of trouble one last time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It's over. Thank god.,"With ""Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith,"" it's time for those of us raised on the Star Wars franchise, we who have a certain fond attachment to the series, to acknowledge the unavoidable: these are not good films. It's easier to admit this about the first trilogy, protected against criticism as it is by the prism of nostalgia. Even the considerable mess of ""The Phantom Menace"" seemed no worse than a mulligan. After providing the heroes and villains of countless childhoods, George Lucas could be forgiven for being a bit stiff after a 20 year absence. But by the time R2D2 suddenly sprouted booster rockets in ""Attack of the Clones,"" something had clearly gone wrong. The saga limps over the expected finish line with ""Revenge of the Sith,"" and the end is gratifying; we no longer must bear witness to the agony of something so beloved. It's the film equivalent of putting down Old Yeller.The details of the plot are as bewildering - and immaterial - as in the previous two installments. Young Jedi Anakin Skywalker races toward black helmet-dom as the Jedi Council, infinitely wise and able to read minds, yet unable to fathom the numbingly obvious, stumbles to uncover the Sith Lord manipulating galactic politics in order to rule the Republic. Perhaps Chancellor Palpatine, he of the consolidated emergency powers and sinister hiss, is involved? Perhaps the pope wears a funny hat.By this third episode, Lucas has lost any trace of cinematic patience he once displayed. There's nothing here like the slow dawning of the nature of the hulking Death Star in ""A New Hope"" (""that's no moon""),or even the graceful glide of droid transports over silent grasslands in ""The Phantom Menace."" It's as if Lucas feels constrained by this last chance to blow his CGI load, and so crams every frame with as much wonder as he can muster. Even the film's quiet moments seem hyper-charged, and leave us feeling exhausted. Dialogue wooden enough to catch fire doesn't help, either.That said, pieces of ""Revenge of the Sith,"" like the two previous installments, are fun to watch, and may well delight the younger set as the earlier films did a different generation. I confess to a small thrill at seeing that shiny black dome, and hearing the mechanized Vader wheeze, for the first time. ""Revenge of the Sith,"" though, is ultimately more relieving than anything else. It's over, finally. Time in the Galaxy for peace, and rest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Prequels are great.,"Too much has been said by SWhaters (Star Wars Haters) that has been taken too seriously. Lost in the mix is that Lucas made a fantasy adventure saga in the vein of The Wizard of Oz and of course the Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials of old. Instead of applying silly ""modern"" standards of judgment to these films a more appropriate perspective is to focus on the word Opera in the ""space opera"" description. And as such, this series covers every base one would want in a rousing saga, culminating in an excellent and heart-wrenching conclusion that leads to a trilogy with an appropriately different tone for a different era within its story world.The acting and dialogue is not wooden, particularly Christensen's. It's appropriate to the age levels of his character (in all three films) in the same way that whining about going to Tosche station was absolutely appropriate for Luke. Why SWHaters don't get this, I'll never know. Their claims of bad or clunky dialogue are bogus given that they can't identify what great dialogue would be and the SW saga has several moments of decidedly great dialogue (""Obi Wan's going to kill me"").What Hayden Christensen does particularly well is portray a young man (still a boy, perhaps) who is boiling over with emotions that he is incapable of controlling, even though he knows it and tries. His performance is pitch-perfect to explain what could have created Darth Vader.The element that works the hardest and most appropriately in the entire saga and definitely in the Prequel trilogy is George Lucas' masterful focus on Theme throughout all of the films, something current-day SW productions have completely lost sight of (except for Rogue One, Andor, and The Bad Batch).Few single films in cinema history achieve the greatness of this film, let alone 6. It is an awesome achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Fall of the Jedi and the Rise of Darth Vader,"The prequel trilogy had started in a somewhat dubious way for Star Wars fans, but it concluded with what is undoubtedly one of the best films of this franchise created by George Lucas. Revenge Of The Sith seals the cycle between this trilogy and its predecessor by offering the origin story of Darth Vader. Although the previous episodes and the animated series by Genddy Tartakovsky were already telling this story through Anakin Skywalker, here comes the most important point that makes it clear that the origin of Darth Vader is a rather tragic story. The film also clarifies fundamental events that were not explained in the original trilogy about the fall of the Jedi Order and how the empire rose. The film begins where the Clone Wars animated series ended and when it seems that the victory of the Jedi is assured, that changes quite a bit when discovering Palpatine's true plans. Here it is crucial to note that the film clarifies the true purposes that Palpatine had, the objective of the creation of the clones, his fascination with Anakin and that his kidnapping and other things seen in the previous installments were a trap so that Anakin could fall into the hands of the Sith. Here it is even justified why the Jedi Order did not want to train Anakin from the beginning in The Phantom Menace. Throughout the installments it has been seen that Anakin was someone very emotionally vulnerable. In Attack Of The Clones and Clone Wars it was seen that he was a very naive young man who was easily influenced by anger and rage. Another of his weak points was the fear of losing Padme without reflecting on what his actions could cause in her. In theory, Anakin was never ready to be a Jedi or should never have been a Jedi in the first place and became a double-edged sword that Darth Sidious knew how to take advantage of. Anakin was someone very easy to manipulate and that is why the terrible tragedy seen in this film occurs. A tragedy that leads to the death of many Jedi, the breaking of the brotherhood with Obi-Wan Kenobi and not to mention what happens to Padme. It can be said that this installment of Star Wars offers a wonderful story that seems to surpass everything seen in the first episodes. It is an excellent plot of action, epic battles, love, betrayal, tragedy and tears. That helped a lot in the development of Darth Vader as a character to understand his past and improve his image as one of the best villains in cinema. We must not forget the magnificent cast, the fantastic production, the wonderful special effects and the excellent soundtrack by John Williams. All this offers moments worth remembering such as the rescue of Palpatine, the battle of Obi-Wan against Grievous and the confrontation of Obi-Wan with Anakin breaking their friendship. Revenge Of The Sith does not manage to be only one of the best Star Wars movies, but one of the best movies in history just like A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is a very well-done conclusion to this trilogy that is a bit underrated,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows Anakin who has been promoted to Jedi Counsel and asked to spy on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as war seems to be brewing. Meanwhile Padmé is pregnant and this news needs to remain a secret until Anakin and Padmé can choose a direction in life. Anakin will be torn between sides, the Jedi and the Chancellor, as his family's direction will be greatly impacted by a potential war.This movie is directed by George Lucas (American Graffiti) and stars Hayden Christensen (Jumper), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Natalie Portman (Leon), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting), Jimmy Smits (In the Heights), Christopher Lee (Lord of the Rings) and Ian McDiarmid (the Lost City of Z).The special effects in this trilogy are absolutely outstanding and I was thoroughly impressed by the CGI and creation of the various aliens in the universe. The large iguana scenes in this were awesome. It was also great seeing Bobba Fett make a cameo. The evolution of the Republic is well told and is its fall and demise followed by rise. The characters being torn throughout the movie by the direction of leadership is very interesting as if Anakin's pull closer and closer to the dark side. The light saber scene with Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding as is Anakin's scene with the children at the end. The lava fight is also awesome, and the birth of Vader always brings a smile to my face.Overall, this is a very well-done conclusion to this trilogy that is a bit underrated. I would score this a solid 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic stuff!,"Today, at last, I saw Episode III for the first time. To be honest, I had great expectations (also because of the fantastic trailers)  they were fulfilled and even topped! The plot can be told very quickly, I think: The movie takes place one or two years after Episode II, chancellor Palpatine shows his true face, Anakin becomes more and more influenced by the dark side  we all know the result of this (two words: heavy breathing) and his marriage with Padmé develops into a dramatic direction. Besides you have the usual: Spaceships in blasting battles, troups, aliens, monsters, beasts and light sabers.To sum it up: The movie is great! After the unspectacular Episode I and a romantic but quite weak Episode II Lucas found his old spirit again and with it the charm of the legendary Episodes IV-VI: The dialogues are sarcastic, witty and humorous again, the great one-liners are back and R2D2 and C3PO are no longer just minor characters but more involved into and important for the plot. OK, there are one or two situations where Yoda appears maybe more funny than he was supposed to, but you've got so much fun watching the movie that you don't bother about this too much. Even Hayden Christensen's acting improved, the other major cast is great as usual (especially Natalie Portman) and I liked Ewan McGregor as Kenobi very much (although his beard was irritating, it didn't suit him  I think it looked much better when it was shorter). The scenery once again looks stunningly realistic, the costumes beautiful and the wars bombastic as usual (though they sometimes were a bit too long).But still we mustn't forget the tragic side of this movie  here, the most legendary evil creature of the Star Wars universe is ""born"" (namely Darth Vader) and Lucas shows Anakins sad path to this transformation in every painful and merciless detail. This is why Episode III is maybe the darkest, most violent and also saddest movie of all the six. But what I liked the most: Although Anakin changes completely, Lucas still succeeds in showing that there are human feelings left in him (of course I won't tell you how he does that)  those scenes are very touching and almost made me cry.All in one I would say: It's a truly great final episode for the Star Wars series and in his fine quality a perfect link between the old and the new movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
an entertaining and fulfilling roller-coaster ride down nostalgia lane,"I've just seen the film at a digital night screening, and I must say: even though the film is still flawed, it's not the ""revenge of the S-H-I-T"" I thought it was going to be. It's by far Lucas's best attempt to recapture the magic that made so many people across the world love the original Star Wars saga.Let's be honest, ""the phantom menace"" and ""attack of the clones"" didn't quite do the original series any justice. It seemed like George Lucas was just trying to promote his visual fx and sound studios by giving them a platform that would be widely anticipated. But I'm willing to forgive Georgie boy for his corporate money making decisions, because ""revenge of the sith"" is a return to form.OK, first the bad news. The storyline still consists of hopping from one planet to another, the dialogue is still corny as ever, the acting (though improved) is still too wooden (but that's probably due to blue screen work), and the visuals still look like an elaborate video game disaster (come on Lucas, you're rich enough to pay a costume designer, you don't have to paste a head onto a cgi body!!!). But with that said, that's probably the only thing worth bitching about.Lucas manages to make us feel for the characters for the very first time. And even though the opening sequence runs a little overlong, the dramatic build up of everything else is spot on.I won't say anything more about it. I didn't really hate the first two prequels, but I didn't particularly like them either. But this one can 'prudently' be loved by Star Wars fans all over the globe.

The movie felt like we went from explanation to another. That is to say; -How Anikin becomes Darth Vader -Why he has to wear his signature black suit -How all the Jedi are killed (which by the way was PATHETIC, but I can't expound on that because I don't want to spoil anything...) -And most importantly how and why Anikin turns to the Dark side. Once again I think that the combination of Hayden's poor acting and the rushed story left me with no connection to Anikin as to why he felt like he had to turn to the Dark Side. It was blatantly obvious that a pattern of ""abuse"" was trying to be established between Anikin and the Jedi council. In the end for Anikin to throw away all those years in what seemed a very, very short time was very unconvincing to me.Acting- Everyone did an admirable job except Anikin and Padme. There parts looked at times like they were reading cold at an audition.In my opinion it should have taken 6 hours to do what they attempted to do in a little more than 2.5 hours. In the end I gave it a 7 out of 10, but I admit there is a bonus bias factor as I have always liked the first 3 movies, and I hate to say it but the last three have failed to give me that epic feel.************STOP HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!************The Killing of almost all the Jedi took about what seemed to be 3 min.

This is the chapter where we come full circle and get to see how Anakin Skywalker becomes completely seduced by the evils of the Dark Side and transforms into the personage of Darth Vader. As Anakin, Hayden Christensen was much better in this than he was in ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and all those eerie moments where he turns into a misguided villain with hatred in his eyes were strongly rendered by him. Even Natalie Portman was better than usual as Padme, and though it took her three films to appear as more than just a pretty new Christmas ornament, I thought her love scenes with Skywalker were pretty decent.I have been championing Ewan McGregor's dignified acting as the younger Kenobi in all of these first three episodes, and he's as classy as usual here. However, the finest performance comes from Ian McDiarmid, in the role of the dubious Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.The last half is better than the first, and fulfills just about all expectations, as far as fastening all the series' loose threads into once concise whole and paving the way for the 1977 original (forevermore to be known as A NEW HOPE). SITH also benefited from occasionally strong (for this saga) material, such as what happens to the younglings. Hilights include more action-packed light saber fights (one of them being a re-match with Christopher Lee's Count Dooku), and the fleshing out of the little Yoda character, who gains our heart and has now become one of my favorite STAR WARS characters. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Incredible Special Effects, Golden Turkey Acting","Once again George Lucas has made an incredibly stunning movie with great special effects and fight scenes. Why oh why can't he write a script? Hayden Christensen really should never be given another major movie ever again. Time after time he looked like he had just read the script of the scene before the final scene was shot. I know Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are gifted actors with numerous credits in there career, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the last we will ever hear of Hayden Christensen until the Golden Turkey awards are handed out next Winter. Still this is a very good movie if you want to see great special effects, this is what George Lucas will be famous for 50 years from now. The story is dictated by the previous 5 movies, so ""predictability"" is something every Star Wars expert can expect. Still it would have been nice to have a twist on the story, something the old Star Wars always brought in. Maybe seeing Liam Nieson appear next to Yoda at the end would have been nice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

one word..... AMAZING,"By far the best one. Fast paced and beautiful the whole way through. I feel so honored that I got to see it as one of the first across the country. There was so much action crossed with love. The action and settings of the movie really traces the slow decent into Darth Vador. If you haven't seen the first 2 or the last 3, you really should before you see this movie. It will all mean so much to you and make so much more sense. Don't worry if you feel lost at the beginning even as a fan, I was, but that's the intention. They really tied all together and ended with a beautiful shot that leads you right back to the originals. 10 outta 10, 5 stars, slam dunk...whatever you call it, it was fantastic.

Actually... it wasn't a bad movie. I can't believe it.,"After watching the first two fiascoes (the prequels), I certainly didn't have any hopes for this one. I was expecting a whiny Darth Vader (Palpie! My light saber is, like, SOOO UNCOOOL! I hate it, hate it, hate it! - and so on), a terrible storyline, predictable plot, and slow... s-l-o-w storytelling.Oh, and terrible acting. Did I mention it? No? Well, Lucas seems to be the only man alive that can bring the worst out of Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor.Anyway, I was happily surprised to see that, although his dialog was beyond laughable, Lucas did it right this time. I can't remember being as amazed as I was with this movie since ""Empire"" came out. This is the Star Wars that should have been since 1999 - the stuff kids can dream about for years and years.I was very satisfied with this movie, and can imagine it'll be considered as the only worthy addition to the original trilogy. It's a lot better than Return of the Jedi, and easily on par with the original Star Wars.I only wonder - will Lucas revisit his movies once again? If he does so, he'd do a good thing if he took Episodes I and II and turned them into a 2 hour movie... and digitally removed that whiny kid.

painful acting,"I think you have to blame George Lucas for the painfully shallow performances by Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen.

Screams of silent agony rise from the Emperor's latest torture chamber, i.e. your local movie theater.George, please become an executive producer and exalted director and please delegate everything to a talented and ferocious star who will do justice to what you've created.

best 1,"i found this star wars the best of the lot even though the old ones are the classics, but that doesn't stop making it the best. the special effects and the great story line which combines all the star wars together gives a great edge. it is a non stop action film so i have to give it a 10 as this is the type i like (a non stop action). i think that this shows that Darth Vader is caring for his kids because he doesn't realise hes turned to the dark side and he is only trying to save her. if u haven't seen this I'm sorry for telling you but thats the way it is. this film finalises with the death of a lot of Jedi's which upset me but hey its only a film. i recommend this film to any age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is hated?,"Don't know about you guys but this movie is what i'd call a near-to-perfect masterpiece. At the end of 2020, i'd say that this is the most meme generated movie ever, imo. For instance, the ""It's over Anakin, i have the high ground, don't try it."" People harshly criticized the screenplay even when they know it's suppose to be like that. George Lucas told from the beginning itself that Star Wars is a Space opera. It's a space opera sub genre. So it's supposed to be a melodramatic movie. But instead, knowing this, people criticized the actors, Hayden particularly. Well there's nothing we can do when it is actually ""Star Wars fans who hate Star Wars"". I have to admit that TPM & AOTC both were pretty messed up in some ways but not this one.Now jumping to the movie, people have been waiting for almost 20 years for this moment. The backstory behind Darth Vader. How he got in the suit. As we all know, every movie is about the Skywalker bloodline. George weaved everything together to fill every single gap in The Original Trilogy. He did an amazing job, not to mention, he got over 15 years to do it. Overall in my opinion, this is an excellent movie but there are flaws.Ian Macdiarmid was fantastic. I loved his performance. And i think he himself enjoyed playing Sidious again. His manipulation, his sinister talks and everything, it's so highlighting in the movie. But Palpatine's lightsaber fighting wasn't very satisfying to me. It lacked originality and was very poorly handled. Like when he was about to kill Fisto, Windu had about 2 seconds to attack him, that's how slow Palpatine's movements were and there were some other stupid scenes, which i'm not mentioning.The visuals were stunning, yes of course it was Lucasfilm, so that's not very surprising. Every leap of advanced visual effects were Lucasfilm's, isn't it?About Hayden and Natalie. They did everything they could to make it all good. But sometimes it doesn't go that way. Despite the universal hate Hayden got, he said, ""if they call be back to play Darth Vader, i'd be there in a heartbeat"". That's the level of his commitment. And they did called him back to play that legendary character once again in the "" Obi-wan Kenobi"" series alongside Ewan McGregor. If that doesn't give us chills, then what will? McGregor was the major highlight of the film. His performance was breathtaking, no doubt. Natalie was over-dramatic, but i loved her performance. Then Frank Oz's Yoda, amazing. Anthony Daniels, a legendary character who is in every movie, loved his performance. R2 of course. Samuel Jackson, pretty good.Then John Williams' score. The best in Cinema. Loved each and every single one.Screenplay : 83Visuals : 91Performances : 87Pacing : 90Direction : 86Musical Score : 99",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Revenge of the Sith is a surprise of a movie,"After a good thirty years, and two prequels later. George Lucas is bringing the final piece of the Star Wars saga to the fans. And after two opulent misfires, he has a lot to live up to.So is Episode 3 the messiah of a film that people have been waiting for all this time? Yes, and no. Yes, it's a much better film than both previous episodes. No, it still could have been even better with some changes. Many things that didn't work in the previous episodes are still there, and they still don't work. Anakin and Padme have no chemistry between each other, and most of their horrendous dialogues seems forced. And while the film is the least dialogue heavy of the three prequals, it still suffers from some terribly wooden phrases that the characters are forced to say with a straight face.Effects wise, the movie is top class once again. While the only grumble is the character of General Grievious, most of the effects are simply stunning and the opening space battle will blow people away.But therein lies the problem, like in the previous films, Lucas feels at times lost in the splendor of his own visual creations that he loses sight of the big picture, and the movie begins to lose it's momentum. Such instanses are fewer than in the previous episodes, but still noticeable. Mainly the final 45 or so minutes could have used some better editing in parts.Acting, in terms of Star Wars acting, is good. McGregor has over time grown into the young shadow of Alec Guiness and works his charm very well into some bland scenes and manages to bring some genuine motion to what could have been yawn inducing at worst. Lucas still has to work on his characters and dialogue, even if the effects are the main focus at times.In the end, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, is a surprisingly good finish to the saga, and hopefully the last part in it. It's at times incredibly thrilling and truly emotional, and at times very cringe worthy. But by the time the credits roll, the good had outweighed the bad, at least on my part.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Is it as good as the original trilogy? No. But it is the film we've been waiting for,"When you think Star Wars, many words come to mind. ""Epic,""""imaginative,"" and, ""KICK-@$$!!!!"" The prequels didn't quite match up to these standards. George Lucas is one of the director's who was once among the best of the best, but he has become overly commercial in recent years. Phantom Menace tried to appeal more to children than the people who actually understand the philosophy and sophisticated qualities of the originals. Jar-Jar Binks is loathed by all smart people, but young children enjoyed him. In Episode II, Lucas tried to present a more mature vision, adding in romance and upping the scale of the battles, but although the battles were quite good, the romance was executed quite terribly. He seemed to have read a couple of bad romance novels just so he could figure out how to write dialogue. It's quite amazing that he managed to waist such great talent with his dialogue in the prequels: Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, and Natalie Portman, usually very fine actors (and actress) but not so great here.Well, the criticisms can now be nearly set aside.What makes this so much better than the other prequels? Style, my friends. Lucas stops being so plain and goes ahead and shoots this movie with style. Though the action scenes in both prequel movies were solid, this film blows the lid off both of them. There's an incredible sense of speed in this film, with massive starfighter battles, over-the-top lightsaber fights, and large ground battles. They don't have the scale of Attack of the Clones, but feature many more thrills.One of the biggest complaints with the prequels was Lucas's over-reliance on fake-looking CGI technology. Though there's still a ton of CGI here, It fits more seamlessly with the live-action stuff. Another complaint was that the aliens didn't look very Star Wars-ish. Well, we have the same aliens. But at least Jar-Jar doesn't appear very much.George Lucas has always been great at writing stories, though they haven't been executed well lately. But here we get a very dark story filled with moments of over-the-top emotion and cruel, cruel, irony. The turning of Anakin over to the dark side is an amazingly ironic situation, and I won't spoil it here, but I will say that it will induce you to shake your head.Unfortunately, the dialogue is still problematic. It's still better than the last two movies, and the actors are better at delivering their lines. The biggest improvement is from Ewan MacGregor. This is quite possibly his finest performance. He acts his character exceedingly well, but doesn't go over the top except when its required.Overall, this movie is a massive improvement over Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. It's darker, more epic, better acted, and overall a very solid film. It's a shame that there are moments of severe nitpicks and clichés, a bit more than I would like. But if you're looking for a movie that mixes incredible action sequences with an involving story, then you should check it out when you get the chance. Then again, you probably already saw it. If so, good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

fantastic epic with the most satisfying end!,"I had the chance to visit a early screening in my hometown Zürich (switzerland) of ROTS and I was very nervous and hopeful because I wasn't very excited about the previous episodes (I &II, specially I). but then, what a joy when I left the theater after the screening.

Anti-climactic,"Visually stunning and yet I found myself yawning here and there after twenty minutes. Basically, this is exposition, showing us the origins of the Empire, the development of the main characters and their relationships with each other. But, finally, at the end of this episode, we know the great struggle between the two sides of the Force has just begun. The first Star Wars movies, made when Lucas and the rest of the world was thirty years younger and that much more innocent, had an exuberance I found lacking in this final installment of the prequel. Episode Three reflects the grimmer world we live in after 9/11 with its increased degree of cares and concerns.

My Favorite Star Wars film,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I have always been vocal about the prequels (while not being the best in dialogue and acting direction) being much better than some have said. Again, they have their problems, but Revenge of the Sith is by far one of the best Star Wars films in its overall story, action, and heart.The good: the conclusion of the clone wars, knowing how Vader becomes Vader, why Luke and Leia were separated at birth, the final battle between master and apprentice.The bad: acting direction, some minor story choices.

If you like video games . . .,"A two hour and twenty minute explanation of how a fine young Jedi warrior could wind up as Darth Vader. The fable is told with an orgy of top grade special effects. It is a must-see for teen geeks, but for mature audiences it is like watching a teenager play a video game with the volume too high. If you saw the original Star Wars when it came out in 1977, you are too old to still be watching Star Wars movies.The stylized dialog is especially annoying. Does not create wisdom, to alter syntax. Is still drivel, what you say.The Star Wars world displaces itself from the present with futuristic technology, Renaissance chivalry, Medieval mysticism, and the politics of ancient Rome. To its credit, Episode 3 manages to wink at the present by jabbing George W.'s anti-evil rhetoric, and by offering a cynical view of the warfare that is by all six of the films otherwise glamorized and idealized.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Almost felt like old times...,"I was 7 years old when i saw the ""original"" Star Wars (New Hope) at a drive-in. Seeing that on a HUGE screen with a starry background, entrenched the whole Star Wars phenomenon into my psyche. I have been an on and off fan my whole life. I said that to say I did enjoy Episode III quite a bit. At 35, I figured I would never feel an inkling of what I felt on that starry night in 1977 when I saw Episode III. Well, I felt something. It wasn't perfect, but I could tell George Lucas did put an admirable effort into this film. Mr. Lucas still has a ""kid with the best toys on the block"" syndrome with all of the special effects, but at least the story tends to keep up with all the glitz and glash.Ewan Mcgregor and Ian McDiarmad really grow into their roles(Obi-wan Kenobi and Emperor Palpatine,respectively). These two carry the film as far as drama goes. And the one surprise for me is that Hayden Christensen does an admirable turn as the tragic Anakin Skywalker. As one reviewer said earlier you will never see the original Trilogy the same way again. The character of Darth Vader has been a part of Pop culture for a long time. To finally see the history of Vader/Skywalker is entertaining ans saddening to a degree. If you are a true fan, you may be speechless at the end or looking for a refund, but you won't be able to deny that no one will ever come close to George Lucas' Opus again.The first 30 minutes are truly entertaining and fun while in contrast, the last thirty minutes are powerful but disturbing. Parents please show caution when taking your children. The middle is a hodgepodge of great and mediocre acting, over digitized animation, too little characterization and leftover political fertilizer from the first two Episodes. BUT it all comes together nicely in a spectacular fashion.I hope George comes to his senses and decides to do Episodes 7-9, but directed by some new talent. We'll see. Anyway, a really good film, not a great film. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointed,"Lucas had several different ways he could have gone with this story. What he chose, for me, was extremely disappointing and contradicting to his characters. For instance; Padme a very strong, independent, self reliant women from the moment we first met her in Episode 1. She was the leader of her planet and she was only a teenager for starters. In Attack of the Clones she fought along side all the Jedi's in the ""Arena"" and not only survived when some Jedi did not, but she was the one who freed herself, Obi-Wan and Anakin from the chains in the beginning of the ""Arena"" scene. Yet in Return of the Sith she dies but NOT due to medical problems during the birth of the twins, but as the medical bot states ""We are losing her, we don't know why. She has lost the will to live."" What?!? So basically she gives birth to 2 children and because her heart is broken she loses the will to live?!? Doesn't make any sense. Seems to me that the Padme we became to know and love would never abandon her children nor give up so easily in regards to Anakin. She would have had to be murdered/killed to tear her away from fighting for both her children and for Anakin. A better choice for Lucas as well as being much more believable is if she died either by accident and then Anakin blames Obi-Wan OR Sidious kills her and tells Anakin that it was Obi-Wan. It would have also given Anakin's fall to the Dark Side more credence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Disappointing Finale,"""Revenge of the Sith"": Getting Down with the DarksideBringing balance to the force, a task that Anakin Skywalker is prophesied to fulfill,seems like a walk in the park when compared to returning the Star Wars film saga back to its original glory, a task George Lucas tries to accomplish with the series latest and last installment, ""Revenge of the Sith"". After two prequel duds, critics and Star Wars' fanatics alike have expressed doubt about Lucas' ability to direct the Star Wars finale, perhaps the most anticipated film of all time. Could Lucas restrain himself from including awful side characters such as the infamous Jar Jar Binks? Could he cut out the wooden dialogue and coax better performances out of his actors? Could he stage epic battle scenes and light saber duels like those that permeated the original trilogy?""Sith"", however, seems destined to erase these doubts and give modern audiences a great Star Wars film of their own. The film has thus far received critical acclaim across the country, and for the most part I agree with the critics. ""Sith"" is a vast improvement on its two prequel predecessors; it's a good film, but not a great one.Lucas' solution to making this film an improvement is fast and furious pacing. ""Sith"" starts out with an epic space battle and rarely lets up. The film has more light saber battles than any of its predecessors and only slows down for scenes in which Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) carefully lures Anakin (Hayden Christenson) toward the dark side of the force.Unfortunately while the action is magnificent in scale, not enough back story is given for the battles to have much emotional feel. Who and what is General Grievous? Why is the republic fighting on so many different fronts? What's up with the Wookies? The performances and dialogue also are also disappointing especially during the exchanges between Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin. When these two talk they come across as two men trying to convince themselves that they are like brothers instead of actually feeling like it.One advantage the film has is its storyline, which is the most compelling of the entire series. So many epic sagas are about redemption or a hero fulfilling a destiny, but few narrate the story of a hero who falls from grace and becomes an embodiment of evil. Darth Vader is one of the silver screen's most memorable villains, and the film is at its best during the interchanges between Anakin and Palpatine. Even these scenes, however, fail to reach the emotional intensity of the Luke/Yoda scenes in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" or the Luke/Vader/Emperor scenes in ""Return of the Jedi"".Despite all the flaws, the film's final thirty minutes are pretty spectacular. The light saber duel between Anakin and Obi Wan sizzles with its hellish background and sheer speed. Jedi Master Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) finally confronts Sith Lord Darth Sidious and watching the two gurus of their respective sides of the force go at it is a high point in the series. So if one can sit through the mediocre first two acts, one can get their moneys worth during these two final showdowns.The original Star Wars trilogy is the most significant film series of all time. Sure Lord of the Rings was great, but those stories were originally conceived as novels and can arguably be appreciated better as such. The first Star Wars saga was conceived solely for the screen and through its revolutionary use of special effects to its epic storytelling, those films will always have a place in pop culture. The characters were so memorable, from Yoda and his lack of grammatical correctness to Chewbacca the world's favorite walking carpet, that they could be cast in mainstream films and no one would blink an eye. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is at its best when playing off story lines and characters established in the first trilogy, rather than creating new ones for itself. And while the film may not live up to the originals' quality, it certainly resurrects the franchise by delivering a respectable prequel.Two and a half out of Four Stars",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A partial return to form for Lucas,"It looks great. It sounds great. It's actually got a story this time. It knits together the original and the new trilogy rather well. And yes, it's actually a pretty good movie. Nowhere near A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, but on par with Return of the Jedi.But it's got Hayden Christensen, who almost manages to ruin the movie entirely. It's also got non-existent character direction by Lucas and the usually competent Ewan McGregor spouting some rather silly lines. It's got its fair share of tooth-grindingly bad daytime soap opera dialogue, delivered without passion or soul.Still, I was thoroughly entertained, despite its glaring faults.Oh, the eye candy! My hat's off to the folks at ILM, as they've outdone themselves and pretty much every other FX-company in the world. Huge space battles right from the start, numerous alien vistas and environments - every one of them believable, living and breathing with various forms of life, so breathtakingly real I felt like I could step into the screen.But for every little thing Lucas manages to get right, there's Christensen to foul something else up. His delivery is wooden and amateurish, as the passion and rage called for by the script are nowhere to be found inside this young actor. Portman is not much better. McDiarmid gets the best part to play (baddies are always fun, right?) and does it with gusto. Jackson is convincing as Mace Windu, and Jackson gets his wish regarding Windu's fate.The crux of the entire story is Anakin's turning over to the Dark Side of the Force. Did I find the causes for this believable? Unfortunately, I did not. This point in the story and the carnage following it left me struggling, forcing myself to believe that this tragic young man would choose the Dark Side because of the things I had previously witnessed. There was also little to no reason given for the horrendous things Anakin did right after crossing over. This is by far my biggest problem with the movie; it stumbles at this, the most important hurdle.If you believe the reasons for Anakin's decision, you're in for a treat, as the rest of the movie is one heck of a roller-coaster. It's also quite brutal and at times beautiful, even touching, thanks to a brilliant musical score which makes much more of an impression as it did in the previous two movies.Knitting together the two trilogies is managed by several little touches. You can see the spaceships' design moving towards the ships seen in Episode IV - TIE fighters are seen in their early stage, as are X-Wings and some other vehicles. In one scene, Padme is wearing familiar buns on her head. We meet Chewbacca, along with a huge bunch of other Wookies. The explanation for why C3PO is unable to recognize his former master is half-baked, though. And, naturally, there's Leia and Luke. The final shot had me in tears.Episode III is the only movie of the new trilogy I actually want to see again.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The fastest paced, most exciting, best character developing, and yes, best Star Wars movie, period","I was ready for Revenge of the Sith to be a moderate step up from the last two prequels, but it was in a different league and should be compared with the epic fantasy movies of our time: the original trilogy, LOTR, the best of Harry Potter and the MCU. It doesn't try to do too much and succeeds on two major fronts: Anakin's character development and the exciting action sequences. Anakin's complete lack of character development was one of the driving factors of why Attack of the Clones was so bad, but we see a complete 180 here. He's given a much more well-rounded script and shows the struggle of wanting to become a great Jedi and seeing murkiness in whether there's a true binary good and bad as well as balancing selfishness and selflessness. His transformation is completely plausible, as you see his doubts in the Jedi and the allure of saving his wife and greater power. The political plot was extremely well done - I said I wanted lots more Palpatine, and I was not let down here. Some really interesting parallels you can draw to modern society too, with democratic people and societies acting as the Jedi and dictatorships as the Sith, and democracy falls due to their own elitism and not realizing the consolidation of power until it was too late, with too few checks and balances. The Jedi assumed themselves invincible and even when they thought there was a Sith, still didn't take it as seriously as it deserved. Anakin's descent is really well done, but other characters like Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Palpatine are also very well done, and even Padme is palatable in this one.You can't talk about this movie without considering the epic action sequences. General Grievous is sick, the climactic cuts between the Yoda and Anakin fights were really well done, and the order 66 to tell the clones to turn were all great. No scenes dragged at all, which felt like the trademark of 6, 1, and 2. What makes Revenge of the Sith such a unique movie is that it's in a special spot in getting to tie up the trilogy and set up the original trilogy, and it does both very satisfyingly. Don't lump it in with the other two prequels - let it stand on its own as the excellent movie that it absolutely is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best Star Wars Movie for me,"Its just amazing,fantastic and good in everyway. I enjoyed every second as a star wars fan. Good pace,amazing acting from Anakin,and Obi wan Kenobi is my favorite character. Very enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Failed to live up to the hype.,"Can't say I was surprised that this did not live up to the hype, but I WAS surprised at how bad some of the acting was (special mention must go to Natalie Portman, who I love otherwise but who really was looking quite awful here, mostly in the scenes with Hayden Christiansen, who was not much better). Of course, Anthony Hopkins and Al Pacino would have had trouble making such inane dialog sound believable, so what are you gonna do? Lucas is clearly scratching the bottom of the Star Wars barrel. This was not really that great a movie....on it's own. As part of the Saga you have to kick it up a notch or two just for being there, and Darth Vader IS a Mythic Villain for sure, but overall I was really under-whelmed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"At least, the end !!!!! (Screen)","My first star wars movie (and cinema experience) was ""The Empire strikes back"". I was then 6 years old, and Dark Vador (in France) has terrified me and gave me fever. Nonetheless, it was magic and I was very fond of collecting the toys, and inventing tons of stories with them.Then, Lucas decided to show the first trilogy. And, maybe it is my adult consciousness, maybe it is the stories, but I never really get stuck in Episode I, II or now III.Sure, there are great scenes in this last part (ex: The Emperor character, all his seduction of Anakin and his political plotting  I fear the idea the Power can support its own ""fake"" adversary to hold on the authority  , the first moments of Darth Vader, the recurring scenes in all the movies.) But, there are dumb character (Grievious), dumb locations (Why Wookies home unless for the vision) and I am fed up with the constant aggressiveness of Jedi/Battles since Episode I. In my opinion, Jedi are spiritual and call on strength and fights only on last solution. Here, as in Episode II, they fight, fight, fight. Sure, the special effects are extraordinary but the movie lacks some soul, depth, in a word: SOME EMOTION.In conclusion, Star wars was a saga of 25 years: maybe my oldest passion. I am glad it is finally over, and if all this first trilogy is a bit less interesting, I will be proud to share it all with my next generation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The THIRD best Star Wars!,"I am sure many people reading this will by now have seen the film, however, I won't be adding any spoilers ""just in case""Several drawbacks in the film prevent me giving it a 10 out of 10, perhaps I am being too fussy, but there you go:1: As in ep 1 and 2, there is large emphasis on androids: far more than in the later films (4-6). This in itself is not bad, but, as we know, Lucas did not make these films earlier because the technology was not available. Now, however we are faced with the Irony that films set later than 1-3 contain LESS technology - although it does not spoil them one bit, it does make a ""seamless"" transition from 3-4 a bit hard to swallow.2: and this is the nub of my complaint: Episode 3 is a fantastic film, although if anything I would have liked it to be a bit longer - that said - we again ""knew"" the story anyway - and it is remarkable what Lucas has achieved in that the presentation is so good - BUT, for me, a longer build up would have been good. The film is very closely allied in some areas of scenery etc with Ep4, and the reasons are obvious. But the end of the film is actually a let-down. We all know Vader ""appears"", but, remember, this film ENDS a long time before the events of Ep4: this gap will apparently be plugged with a TV series, and this is what I dislike the most: there is a large gap - with a story WORTH telling still left - this SHOULD be a movie, not confined to low budget TV. Episode 3 (i would say 3A) stands alone as a brilliant film, and tells the story Lucas wanted, and that we wanted. But it IS NOT sufficient to ""close up"" to episode 4 - again, I think another film IS justified. Then again, could it be the film is so good that we don't want it to end?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Revenge of the Sith a return to form for Lucas,"I was quite young when Episode IV came out, and I loved it for its excitement. Having within the last year or two rewatched the original series, these are my observations:IV is the best of the series. V is good, but the 'romantic' banter between Han Solo and Princess Leia was really bad. VI is OK, but it turns cheesy, and has a happy clappy, Caspar the friendly ghost type ending. The Ewoks were the most marketing/toy driven characters of the first trilogy.Episodes I-II Awful. Jar Jar Binks was a hopeless attempt at creating a new comedic character along the lines of R2D2 and C3PO. Lucas seemed to have gone crazy with CGI, especially with Attack of the Clowns. Sure, he had millions of CGI fighters, but the scenes were a MESS. Contrast that with the brilliantly done scenes in Lord of the Rings II. It too had millions of CGI fighters, but it worked brilliantly because you could see military strategy and tactics being utilised and creating tension.Revenge of the Sith-back to basics story telling-kept simple and easy to follow. Many analogies were drawn with today's 'war against terror', with Annakin aping some of Bush's 'arguments'.Anyway, sure there were some clunky and barely serviceable dialogue, but the story was good enough. Maybe Annakin's venture to the dark side could have been handled differently and better, but I liked the fact that he made his decision impulsively.What I'd like to see...now that Lucas has done a Star Wars worthy sequel, I'd like to see him REDO episodes I-II!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

No way could Lucas make me believe that what was happening would force Anakin so easily to join the dark side. And all that cheesy drama doesn't belong to such a would-be classic. That's why I rate it so low. Also there are some so clichéd moments destroying the main plot, that you'd probably laugh at, but i won't spoil it to you, cause it's clear everyone will watch this movie.

The best film of the prequel trilogy,"After the crushing disappointment of ""The Phantom Menace"" the Star Wars series got back on track with ""Attack of the Clones"", which set the stage for the concluding chapter of the saga, ""Revenge of the Sith"". Luckily for moviegoers, it seems that George Lucas saved the best for last.A tragedy in the classical sense, George Lucas's script is easily the most dramatically compelling of the prequels. The ultimate fate of the hero is known ahead of time but we are nevertheless drawn into the story as it unfolds before our eyes. Although the tone is serious, it is kept from becoming oppressive by several infusions of action.The cast is largely unchanged from the previous instalment and this movie finds them comfortable within their characters like never before. Even Hayden Christensen, whose performance in ""Attack of the Clones"" left something to be desired, managed to rise to the challenge of the lead role.As before, the special effects were well handled, though a bit ostentatious at times. George Lucas was again in the director's chair and he did a fine job. And, of course, John Williams once again lent his talents to the film's musical backdrop.Although arguably falling just a bit short of the original trilogy in terms of overall quality, ""Revenge of the Sith"" still provided a satisfying conclusion to the story of how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. If only the first two prequels could have captured more of what made this film stand out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good job, George.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than the Disney trilogy, but falls short of what it needed to be.","This is my opinion on the prequel trilogy as a whole: Good ideas, bad execution.The prequels suffered from a few problems. They came far too late after the release of the originals. They relied too heavily on what was at the time the burgeoning new field of CGI. And, I'm sorry George, poor direction. My biggest complaint, however, is the fact that these movies did not, as far as I'm concerned, accomplish what they needed to - namely, skillfully show Anakin's fall to the dark side.There isn't much to say about the first point other than waiting so long almost ensured that the idea would either fade in popularity (which it did not) or expectations for it would grow to the point that satisfying them would prove daunting for any director.I believe the next three points are all tied together. George Lucas was never the greatest writer of his age, and this is coming from a long time fan of his work. He wasn't even all that inventive. Most of the concepts he brought into Star Wars were directly taken from the works of Isaac Azimov: droids (robots), hyperspace, Coruscant (Trantor), even the force is just Azimov's concept of a fully realized galactic Gaia. If you told me that Star Wars was originally concocted as a fanfiction written by a young George Lucas then adapted (slightly) to be an original work, I'd believe you. The point is, his imagination and writing ability weren't what made the original movies work. What made them work was his presentation. Unlike Azimov, whose works were often very heady and dry, George's version of what was essentially the same setting was far more engaging and exciting. It was simplified, and not at all to its detriment. This made it more approachable than Azimov's books, easier to digest. But this also meant that George often needed help from others in making his dialogue and plot really work, and in the original movies he got this help whether or not he liked it because he wasn't all that big yet. People weren't too intimidated by his reputation to tell him when his dialogue didn't work or a plot point raised eyebrows. This wasn't the case in the prequels. Nobody questioned his decisions and the difference was palpable. This was why we got Jar Jar, and angst filled cringe inducing teenage Anakin, and clunky forced romance between Anakin and Padme. And while the movies looked pretty (for their time), the pacing was often too slow, often got lost in minutia, and wasted much of its runtime in unnecessary amounts of setup with little payoff.These movies were meant to show how Anakin, Luke's father, became Darth Vader, and why his redemption in the last act of the original trilogy was meaningful. However, much (if not most) of the ground the story covers over three long movies barely touches this, and when it does, it does so clumsily. The best opportunity for this descent into darkness would have been the war around which the plot circles, but then barely touches. War is often brutal and emotionally scarring. A young, bright, talented Jedi could easily encounter many experiences in a war which could cause them to descend into the darker elements of their humanity while still clinging to a spark of deeply buried virtue. Instead, the war begins at the end of the second movie, and by the beginning of the third it is all but over. Anakin is depicted as a hormonal teenager who waffles between misguided, honorable, and big sad, culminating in the slaughter of children. He goes from essentially good to comically evil with all the complexity of someone having flipped a switch, and the method of doing so left his redemption in Return of the Jedi soured. A man who becomes jaded through the horrors of war can be saved. A man who slaughters children with his own hands cannot. It was clumsy and rushed, and could have been avoided if the flow of the three movies had been more skillfully written and executed. If the second movie had actually covered the clone wars and its impact on a young and impressionable Anakin in a similar fashion to All's Quiet on the Western Front, taking a idealistic youth through the realities of warfare, the loss of his wife and (as far as he knew) is unborn children, the failure of the Jedi code to ensure peace and prevent tragedy, *that* would have been the story Anakin needed. But this is not what we were given.I would say that the animated Clone Wars series helped bridge this unfortunate gap, but after finally getting around to watching it, I can't honestly say that that series did any better at showing Anakin's fall. Nothing can undo his actions in the third film, and the series, for it's run time, didn't do much better than the films in depicting his fall.In the end, George Lucas is great when he has the right people helping him. Star Wars would never have been what it was without him, but these movies showed that it wasn't him along that made the original movies great. He had an idea, and it was a good idea, and he was a good showman, but he needed other people to handle the plot and the dialogue, and sadly no one had the backbone to speak up while these movies were being made.In closing, it's easy to look back on these films through the lens of nostalgia and the absolute dumpster fire that was the Disney trilogy and see them as perhaps better than they were by comparison, but I was disappointed with the prequels when they were first released, my reasons for this disappointment have stood the test of time, and even though The Phantom Menace grew on me a little since then (but not by much), the following two entries have not at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"REWATCH: By far, the best prequel.","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog :)Rewatching before OBI-WAN KENOBI.When it comes to film sagas with massive fandoms, you'll find fans of literally all installments. STAR WARS has 11 movies and surely all are someone's #1. That said, REVENGE OF THE SITH proves to be an improvement in pretty much every single aspect compared to the first two prequels.The narrative and its character arcs receive a much more interesting treatment - we finally get to witness Anakin's turn to the dark side and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Lightsaber fights are more captivating, visuals still hold up rather well, and even the performances are more convincing - dialogue remains pretty bad, especially within the love relationship between Anakin and Padmé, but Christensen surpasses his previous performance. The score continues to be as memorable as ever.It may be far from my personal favorites, but it's, without a doubt, a film that deserves the positive evolution it has received as well as its fans.

A truly epic disappointment,"Six years ago, I walked out of a movie theater, unable to admit to myself that perhaps George Lucas had made a mistake. My love for all things Star Wars clouded my sight and I was merely happy to have more jedi, droids, and George.Three years ago, I walked out of a movie theater cringing, shaking with fright over love scenes and computer graphics faker and more artificial than many of the films you would see on Mystery Science Theater 3000. But I held out hope that Episode III would redeem these films...Oh boy.The only thing tragic about ""Revenge of the Sith"" is that it completes the desecration of a brilliant film trilogy. Debating how it stacks up against the other prequels is like deciding who deserves the best actor Oscar: Keanu Reeves, Shaquille O'Neal, or Justin Guarini. Yes, it is that bad. This one might even take the cake, for it is the first movie of the six in which I laughed out loud at the dialogue (""Execute Order 66""...or how about ""From my point of view the jedi are evil""). I respect Mr. Lucas, but this man needs one of his cronies to step up and tell him he writes like a middle-schooler.There is a hollow lifelessness about these films; we just don't care about the characters or what happens to them. The plots are forced together crudely, trying to link every single event to another in the original movies. I cannot believe in the thirty years since the originals came out it seems we have moved backwards in terms of special effects. As ""cool"" as it is to see Yoda fight with a lightsaber, it looks like a cartoon. The prequels live and breathe cliché, relying on sheer over stimulus to excite the audience.Take out the ""Star Wars"" element and we have Battlefield Earth 2. I hate to write this because I wanted to love this film as much as anyone else...but take off the blindfold people, and see Episode III for what it is: a piece of garbage thrown to die-hard fans who deserved a space opera, and got a space backstreet boys concert.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best in the series,"After having seen episode 9 on the big screen I just had to come back to this, the best of the Star Wars movies, to give it a massive thumbs up. Although we knew that Anakin has to turn into Darth Vader here, the drama surrounding it is breathtaking. The intensity of a scene with nothing else than a guy waiting in a room. The twisted righteousness of the Jedi, the political trickery of Palpatine and a character lost and torn apart by love, fear and conventions of society. It really is great drama and on top of it is great action. It shows how Lukas has matured and if you are honest, none of the original trilogy did even come close to this.After having seen it again I can almost forgive Lucas for having sold the soul of it to Disney.

Best of three...,"It is unquestionable that this is the best entry in this trilogy. An accomplishment which most likely was not hard to achieve considering the first two were really, not great!Unlike the last two, this entry to the franchise does not have a laughably bad script, it is nothing spectacular and it does improve as the film progresses, but it is still significantly better than the first two. An emotional factor is aimed to be gained and it is obvious, subsequently failing, but it works much better than in the first two.A huge sigh of relief is made when it becomes clear it is not dull. It has boring sections, but without a doubt utilises action sequences and keeps a fast pace throughout. At times the action sequences felt like filler to make the film more enjoyable, but it works well.No section is more improved on than the disastrous visual effects, in the few year gap between this and episode 2, Fox managed to employ some decent animators, it was much needed and frankly could've used this level of animation through the trilogy or maybe the practical effects method used in the originals would've been the smarter move?There are tonal shifts through this movie and they are painfully obvious. Towards the end it does become extremely dark including mass genocide, but it is a vast improvement over the light hearted approach of episodes 1 and 2.Which generally sums out this film as a whole.

Revenge.. it is ..,"Waiting to watch the truth that lies beneath the events is a real treat to our imaginations. The expectations were very high since the movie had to say anything and everything that has been left behind.

The reasoning behind the events has been very diffusing, at one point anakin talks all about the dreams and yet there he is at the end, not taking too much care about Padme. instead, its abt the breathtaking fighting sequences..watch the return of jedi and the empire strikes back..feel, one could, the very reason of the clash between the space titans. I would at this point appreciate the intricate details that has been pointed out by lucas such as in the emperor's introduction about the dark side to anakin..where he talks about who anakin is ..in sense..what he really was !! It was a puzzle to which not many would be enticed towards. The role of Padme was less inspiring, why dint we see more interaction between the two if she was the main reason for his change from a jedi to vader ?? Further, killing of the powerful jedis at the mere hands of army was not that easy to absorb..If the movie won my hearts it was due to the fantastic stunt display..the fight between grievus n obi-wan was awesome..and the final clash between the master n student took people by real surprise due to its marvel.

Lucas is capable of much worse.,"It's difficult to make this film and not disappoint someone. The expectations are just too high; after three decades, grown men are still wearing silly outfits and making odd sounds while waving their plastic light sabres outside cinemas. I don't fault Lucas for the criticism he's received, nor do I think that he should be chastised for not making the best science fiction film in history. Furthermore, if he wants to make some more money and have his characters sell stuff on TV, more power to him; if you don't like it, buy another brand. I could care less whether Vader ends up advertising for Playtex. My gripes lie elsewhere.Somewhere along the way, the novelty wore off. Effects that should be better are now simply larger and digitized. The puppet Yoda from the 1980s looks better than the CG Yoda of today. Dialog between main characters went from campy to painfully corny -- Anakin never sounded more contrived.Beyond the poor effects that almost universally look fake, and the dialog that at times borders on ridiculous, the real downfall in my opinion is that I wasn't convinced Anakin had compelling reasons to turn to the dark side. Since this is the whole point, my opinion of the movie dropped.Another problem I had was that Lucas chose to side-step plot points by either covering them in the cartoon ""Clone Wars"" or deleting them from the story entirely. Again, it's his call, he made it; however, I don't have to like it...On the bright side, it's a fun film with plenty of action and lots of things blow up.I suspect lots of people that have waited for three decades might be wondering if it was wise to attend conventions and dress up like space creatures after all...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great performance of visual effects and music, but the storytelling","I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid, and this has become a fond memory for me, it can be said that this movie opened my love for the Star Wars universe and even things related to it to space and planets, UFOs...
Perhaps this is the perfect ending to the birth of the character Darth Vader. Music, it's perfection, wow especially at the end, music is my favorite. Visual effects, amazing. The lightsabers, perhaps Obi-wan and Anakin's battle in the volcanic planet is one of the best and most emotional fights in the world of action movies, where Obi-wan utters the words at the ending with Anakin was so good that I forgot about their old version in part 4 and 5, at that time I just wished they would remake the old versions. But despite such special things, part 3 still has some bad things, such as the quality of the dialogue, especially in the first half of the movie, the lines are quite simple and weird like in the cartoons for kids. Especially the storytelling. In the clone wars, there were scenes that helped develop the character well but were removed from the movie, and in this part I feel the same way. Why did Padme, a politician, overreact when Obi-wan mentioned the Sith? The film does not mention how people feel about Jedi and Sith, viewers only understand this conflict is simply between Jedi and Sith, no one else. Then the conflict between Obi-wan and Anakin is also not fully developed. At the part of Obi-wan's parting, Anakin and him were still very close, but after that Anakin had a grudge against Obi-wan very quickly. And the other characters like Yoda, the Jedi... are pretty faint and don't have much special. Everyone knows how strong General Grievous is but in this movie he is quite weak, even though it was the result of Windu's attack, but he still disappointed me a bit.Overall, this is still a memorable and good SW movie, especially the last part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What a disappointment.,"From the very beginning with its inexplicable space battle through numerous plot twists that didn't seem to mean anything to the seemingly rushed conclusion, this long awaited final episode in the legendary Star Wars saga was just a tad disappointing.I had hoped that the progression that had seen the awfully lame Phantom Menace lead to the much improved Attack Of The Clones would continue and in terms of special effects and production quality it did.However what should have been the best of the new trilogy was let down by clunky acting, poor dialogue and plot holes you could drive a Star Destroyer through.Padme was reduced to little more than a plot device bit part and what happened to John Williams' soundtrack? There we are in the middle of a major fight in the control room of Count Dooku's ship and bizarrely no thumping soundtrack like the Star Wars music we know and love, it was like a key character of the story was missing and this made some scenes seem very flat and empty.The main problem for the film was that it had about two and a half hours to fit in a list of things that needed doing so that it led (badly) into Episode IV. They had to bring the audience up to date on what had happened since Clones, dispense with the Jedi by whatever means necessary and turn the Chancellor into the Emperor (a wonderful performance by Ian McDiarmid who was clearly enjoying himself immensely. Watch out for the funny looks he gives R2D2 during the crash landing sequence!!) Also they had to convert Anakin into a nutter almost overnight and get him measured up for the most famous suit in cinema history all whilst throwing a very long (too long in my opinion) final light sabre duel whilst dodging a lot of lava in the most implausible sequence in the history of the entire Star Wars saga! It may grow on me but I think I'll stick to the proper original theatrical release of episodes IV V and VI thank you very much!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Prequel that Rocked...,"In 2005, it was time to end the Star Wars Prequel trilogy! The previous two films in the Prequel trilogy have over the years been considered cinematic disappointments in the Star Wars saga, so it's a surprise that the final film in the trilogy would be considered one of the best in the series.The film begins with Anakin and Obi-Wan invading General Grievous' battleship to rescue Chancellor Palpatine, but first they encounter Count Dooku and cue the awesome lightsaber fight. This fight is super awesome and really fun, although watching Dooku get his head cut off is really sad as Count Dooku is the best.After rescuing the Chancellor they crash-land Grievous' battleship on Coruscant as Grievous makes his escape. After this awesome opening, the story focuses on Anakin. There are scenes that are quite powerful such as Anakin and Padme looking at each other across a city, and there are less powerful ones like Anakin having a childish tantrum in the middle of a senate meeting to the head- shaking disapproval of Obi-wan.Obi-Wan has a sub-plot too, as does Yoda, Mace Windu gets some awesome screen time, and Padme has some truly emotional scenes. Unlike the previous two prequels, Revenge of the Sith does a brilliant job in utilising its cast to create some truly tense and memorable moments.Obi-Wan's journey involves him trying to find and defeat General Grievous, it's very straight forward and does a better job than his assassination plot from Attack of the Clones which felt cloudy at times.Yoda's sub-plot is pure fan service. He visits Kashyyyk which is the home planet of the Wookies and we meet Chewbacca. But apart from that, there's nothing notable about this.Mace Windu does his usual political talk until he's alerted by Anakin to the fact that Chancellor Palpatine may be the Sith Lord they've been looking for, at which point he whips out his purple lightsaber and attempts to arrest him, but the arrest turns into a lightsaber duel between Palpatine and Windu which is, kinder awful!This fight is rather awkward as Ian McDiarmid, the actor who plays Palpatine, does not know how to use this lightsaber. He's swinging it around aimlessly and you can't take him seriously as the ultimate leader of the dark side.This is the turning point in the film where Anakin cuts off Windu's hand to stop him killing Palpatine, and Palpatine uses his force lighting to shoot Windu out of the window to his death, finally completing Anakin's turn to the Dark Side, as Palpatine crowns him 'Darth Vader', now we're getting somewhere.Palpatine gives the Clones 'Order 66', causing the troops to kill all the Jedi, with the exception of Obi-Wan and Yoda who manage to escape their detection. With most of the Jedi dead, Obi-Wan is sent to confront Anakin, and Yoda goes to confront Palpatine. Cue Lightsabers!First of all, we have Yoda vs Palpatine. This fight starts off similar to the Yoda vs Count Dooku fight from the previous film but soon changes to a force battle in the senate. I really like this fight, the scenes with Palpatine throwing the senate platforms at Yoda is very cool, and good use of the CGI. But then there's the big fight of the series, the pivotal battle that sets up the Original trilogy.The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is really fast and really epic, I love how intense this fight is and even though we know who the victor will be, we really want to see how this turns out. When you imagined what the final fight between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader looked like, this is probably what you wanted it to be.Obi-Wan eventually gets 'the High Ground', but Anakin charges against him anyway leading Obi-Wan to severe Anakin's legs and arms, and due to the fiery heat of the lava, his body is burnt alive.While Obi-Wan takes Padme to have her baby in a safe place, the Emperor takes Anakin's body and fits it into a life suit to keep him alive, enter Darth Vader! After giving birth to her two children, Luke and Leia, Padme dies because she's ""lost the will to live"" or something. Leia is taken to live with the Organas while Luke is taken to live with Owen and Peru on Tattooine, leading us straight into the Original Trilogy, finally!Ewan McGregor once again rocks his performance as Obi-Wan. Hayden Christensen is still not Oscar standard but he's better than he was in Attack of the Clones. Natalie Portman is more emotive here, and Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz and Ian MacDiarmid are once again great.The writing is better than the previous two films but it still suffers from some very awkward off-the-wall dialogue that is either really awkward because it was unnecessary, or so forced that the actors don't know how to say the lines effectively.So... Overall, Revenge of the Sith is the best of the Star Wars Prequels. It's dark and awesome and shows what George Lucas can do when he's just trying to create a solid story and not trying to juggle continuity and love stories, endless comic relief and off- the-wall dialogue. We get something worthy of his original masterpieces, something that's truly enjoyable...The Prequel trilogy is widely regarded as a great cinematic disappointment, but I feel that while not as good as the originals, they do get too much hate. While it's a wide opinion that the Phantom Menace really does suck, people are still divided on Attack of the Clones and fans really like Revenge of the Sith. They'll never be as good as the originals, but they're not as bad as most fans will have you believe...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars  Revenge of the Sith,"More aptly put: revenge on the audience. And for what? It seems that George Lucas, who can never be accused of understatement, has managed to do it not once-not twice-but three times. What has he done? Seemingly the impossible: that being keeping us totally bored while he destroys the universe.I am not a 'Star Wars' fan. I felt that the second film in the series presented some improvements-but not much. My only comment on this, the sixth film in the overdrawn series . . . is that if the last 45 minutes of 'Sith' could have been spread out through the former couple of hours, allot of wasted video might have been put to better use.A closing question to any readers. Did anyone catch what appears to be a tribute shot to ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"" near the film's conclusion? It comes as Padme's shuttle is lowering itself below the moon she later gives birth in. The framing, lighting, and position of the two people in the frame appear to have been deliberately placed as a 'signature' to the same sort of shot that appears in '2001,' as Heywood Floyd's moon shuttle lowers itself below the surface, as well.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doesn't suck?!,"Any spoilers contained herein are for the people who will be shocked to learn that Darth Vader is really Luke's father, or that Bruce Willis was dead all along. I'm just putting that warning there for good measure.My take on the Star Wars prequel trilogy differs from the consensus. I was a fan since childhood, and while I was disappointed with the later films, I realized first that I was not the target audience, and second that I could live with the disappointment. Prequels, by definition, are never an essential part of any story -- because they're simply showing us what we've already been told -- so my reaction to ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" was just a shrug.""Revenge of the Sith"", while not up to the quality of the original films, is a step above its immediate predecessors. Mostly this is the result of the film's darker tone: antihero Anakin Skywalker completes his descent into the Dark Side of the Force, abetting the downfall of the Republic and the creation of the Galactic Empire. Comic relief is cast by the wayside in favor of plenty of action; ""Revenge"" boasts the most lightsaber duels, space battles, and fight scenes of the entire series, and the good guys lose.By 2005 special effects technology had developed enough to provide George Lucas with a solid CGI foundation for all of his adventures. Much of it is still slightly cartoonish -- like the computer-generated clone troopers -- but it comes with greater depth and detail, so that the exotic alien worlds are much more exciting to visit. The space battle that opens the film is one of the saga's most breathtaking scenes, crowded with burning starships and hurtling debris through which Anakin and Obi-wan must maneuver their tiny fighters.And there we get to the series' main shortcoming: its actors. George Lucas has gone on record with his assertion that the wooden acting and clunky dialogue are all deliberate shout-outs to the Flash Gordon cliffhanger serials of the 1930s -- the music, the opening crawl, the caped villains, the fairy tale milieu -- but he seems to have run into some trouble communicating this idea to his cast, who appear adrift and confused. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman underplay their parts in a misguided effort at naturalism, which winds up robbing the prequel trilogy of an emotional center. Only Ewan Macgregor, Ian McDiarmid and the other British actors manage to out-perform the special effects, because their performances are a little broader and theatrical -- without ever crossing the line into tongue-in-cheek parody.In its better moments, ""Revenge of the Sith"" recalls the swashbuckling pulp adventures of the first Star Wars movies, even if it's never quite as satisfying. With tighter pacing (the editor was particularly lazy when cutting this film) it could have been a classic on its own, rather that just the final chapter of an anachronistic serial.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Could have been the greatest.,"Im gonna get straight to the point and say that Revenge Of The Sith could have been the movie to beat if they had focused more on the dialogue and lines. There's just some scenes with very bland dialogue which sadly brings the rating down a little.This review is by no means intended to be negative because this is the only problem i have with Revenge Of The Sith and im sure it could've been called one of the greatest movies and could've compared with Empire Strikes Back. This is still one oft my favourite movies, the storyline is Brilliant, powerful, captivating and it saves the whole prequel for me because i think it's two predecessors are pretty average movies, especially Attack Of The Clones.Im just disappointed i can't call this movie the best because of the dialogue.But still i give it a 9/10 because everything else is flawless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Lucas: Great storyteller, horrible director","This will be short and sweet...Episode III is by far the best of the prequels, however it is still not the Star Wars that we all grew up with, and I'm not even from the original Star Wars generation. Once again the acting is dry, really, really dry. Once again there is too much CGI. I really hate how Lucas feels the need to use CGI just cause he can. Real creativity and power come from those who choose not to use all they have at once...Lucas chooses to use CGI in EVERY scene! It's distracting and just plain annoying. When the first and second trilogies are visually compared generations from now people will wonder why the first looks so fake and then second so real. Nice job George. Like I said once again the acting is dry, like Episode I and II. It's easy to see that Lucas can just not direct actors. Even the amazing, Oscar Nominated Natalie Portman is boring here! So to all those who are rating this a 10, please stop. Casablanca is a 10, Chinatown is a 10, The Empire Strikes Back is a 10. Revenge of the Sith is not. It's nice to the trilogy come to a close, however I know that many directors could have made this 7 into a 10 and that would have been amazing! Through the 2+hrs there are so many poor transitions and slow scenes and then heavy action scenes that one can easily ask what's going on? Forget about character development too. Yeah Anikan becomes evil, goes to the dark side....but it's weak. His emotions are weak, and that just goes back to the acting. Go see this in the theaters, just because it's Star Wars, but don't get your hopes up. All in all this does not deserve to be 236 on the IMDb list, and it does not deserve a 10. A 7 yes...it's an entertaining movie, but nothing GREAT. Good, but only good. Go see is and wait for James Earl Jones' horrible line, you'll know it when you hear it. Please just stick to coming up with the stories George, get some help with the writing and just give the directing chair to someone else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Could have been better,"I, like every other Star Wars fan, had waited a long time to see this movie. To watch the story line finally come together was what we had been waiting for. Once the movie was over I was left walking out of the theater scratching my head. ""What just happened?"" was all I kept asking myself. There were scenes that should have been left out of the movie completely. SFX were great, as usual, but the dialog was lame. I wasn't at all into the movie until the end and even then I wasn't as into it as I had expected. The only thing I can say is Anakin's line at the beginning ""This is where the fun begins."" doesn't mean the movie.If you are thinking of seeing this movie I would tell you to see it only during a matinée so you aren't completely blowing your money.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A special effects demo by ILM, who seeks to be the Pixar of the blended live action/computer animation world.","After the previous two installments of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, discerning viewers know what to expect of Revenge of the Sith. A special effects demo by ILM, who seeks to be the Pixar of the blended live action/computer animation world. We know it's nothing more than a kids film, that the acting is uninspired, and that the absurdities will fly thick and fast.Revenge of the Sith has the benefit of actually having some storyline, making me wonder if the first two needed to be made at all. The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones could be condensed into about 20 minutes worth of key scenes, giving a full background to the events in Revenge of the Sith (which could itself be shortened by 20 minutes with no consequence).Lucas's reprisal of Star Wars film making is over with this installment, which might bring some relief to genuine Star Wars or science fiction fans. With practically every scene having CGI in it, I understood why Lucas didn't have the last two films directed by someone else like he originally intended. Given that most of the film is made in the computer lab, there wouldn't be much point in having someone else oversee the ILM computer animators.The computer effects are impressive, they're getting near the point of looking believably real but that point is still some years off. Impressive visuals are really the only merit of Revenge of the Sith and the entire prequel trilogy. In terms of storytelling, Revenge of the Sith is the only one to have its moments, but they are literally moments in an unbelievable ""history"" of the original trilogy. I will take episodes 1,2 and 3's version of events with a pinch of salt and stick to my original notions and beliefs of the original trilogy. I believe ""young Lucas"" knew what he was doing and will ignore the prequel trilogy, having satisfied my curiosity.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best prequel is still light years behind the originals.,"The best of the new Star Wars prequels is still light years away from the quality of the original movies. It's easier to examine the good things so i'll begin by saying Ian McDiarmid is superb as Emperor Palpatine. His character has real purpose and its something the prequels had lacked up until now. The general feeling still exists that is that big set pieces get in the way of telling a very important story. Before this film, audiences have had to endure Podraces, Jar Jar, droid factories, flying R2's and CG overload. What they really needed from this film,and this is something the original trilogy had in spades,was storytelling but instead we get a whole subplot where Obi Wan is chasing after some CGI robot with four lightsabres while riding some annoying sounding CGI animal and you just want to yell STOP!!!!! The developments between Anakin and Palpatine are interesting though, and McDiarmid recalls the same hammy brilliance seen in Return Of The Jedi. Hayden Christensen is still out of his depth as Anakin however and lacks the dramatic skill to really convey true menace. Another deeply disappointing moment comes when a suited and booted Vader is finally allowed to speak for the first time. There is a moment so embarrassing, it almost devalues the character forever. Nooooooooooooooooooo, he wails in the most unintentionally funny moment of the movie. So do we.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The very best of the Prequels,"this movie makes up for the short falls of it's two prequels. The two previous films didn't really fell like I was watching a star wars movie, instead they felt more like star wars spin offs that should have been called ""This Young Obi-Won & Anakin Adventures"".However this is not true of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.Revenge of the Sith manages to capture all of the Star Wars energy and all of its glory. this movie rocks the house. the music and special effects are excellent. The acting is good, and the story is great. I have already seen this film 4 times at the theater, and I cannot wait to own a copy of this for my own personal DVD collection, this will be one of those rare movies that I will be watching over and over again (and loving it more each time) As time marches on, there is no doubt in my mind that this movie will soon leave episode I & II in the dust and join the same ranks as episodes IV,V,& VI as one of the all time great sci-fi masterpeices",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best of the new bunch,"As with the previous two Star Wars, Episode III isn't as different as Lucas says it is. Sure, it's dark, but you know, it still has the same problem that Episode II does, and that's Hayden Christensen. If you didn't think that much of his mediocre acting in II, you won't mind that much here. But for those of us who see Star Wars in a different (non hardcore) way, and also enjoy movies that don't have Tie Fighters, the dry mouthed twenty something's whine will make you sad, and yet when he's got a shut mouth and staring into the camera with dark eyes, I was happy, especially by the time the suit was involved. Less lines for him would have been great, but understandably impossible. It kind of all depended on what his lines were and who he was on the screen with. Sometimes he was alright, when being talked to like a young child that he was acting like, not the next chosen one guy. For him, less would have been more, but that's just me. Thank god for Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan, which for the longest time has been shutting him up with the right words to make me feel just a bit better.I've read somewhere that Lucas' ability to work with actors was not.. very good, and you know I think that's false, which is purely based on this: Actors with a history are good in this film. Samuel Jackson, Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor (Especially. His Obi-Wan is the best part about all three films. He doesn't make his corny lines terrible, and composes himself fantastically while holding everyone else on the screen with him in a different light. He resonates, while the others try to shine.), and even a CGI Yoda shows better form than some of the lines that are more dry and boring than previous films.I will say this though: After making it through the first hour and a half of too much story to pack into one movie (there are so many things that have to do with the Republic and how things... Go - I don't want to spoil anything- that just kind of get easy answers, that it seems as if all of this happened in one really long, fast day. There was never the sense that this whole thing could go in the amount of time it takes to deliver healthy children), the setup for the ending and the last hour of the film is vintage, good Lucas, and almost perfect setup for a final ending. I still feel kind of odd about the fact that I was actually sad to see the fight scene. ""It's all led up to this"", I could hear myself saying. And really, it has. It took more than twenty years to finish this being for one man, that's taken most of us in our heads to another place, and though there was a real bumpy road to get there, it's END was impressive enough for me to give it at least one thumb up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas ends masterfully,"If there's only one movie you plan to see this millennium, make sure it's Episode 3.

The movie was no stop action and suspense and parts of it were quite sad, but overall it was a superb way for Lucas to end his well loved series, and I think it is quite possibly of of the greatest works of film for this and all future generations. Take in the moment as you see it, and then just sit back, relax and enjoy the awesome movie that will be put before you.

Check your baggage at the door - this ain't Shakespeare,"I get the feeling that people's expectations of this movie are such that if Lucas didn't deliver anything short of ""Hamlet"" they were going to resentfully dig a very deep hole in the ground and toss him in. Personally, I think I finally realized something about these Star Wars movies: they are the cinematic equivalent of comic books. I don't mean this as an insult. It's just that it's hard for me to take some of the negative reviews I've read seriously - harder to take in fact than Anakin's ridiculous reasons for turning to the dark side, or the much-derided love scenes between Anakin and Padme, or, well, Anakin as a character in general. However, Anakin as comic book hero-come-villain? Post it on Ebay and I'll bid.I really enjoyed Episode III. Perhaps it was the familiarities from the original ""Star Wars"" that crept in towards the end, I don't know, I just did. I was prepared for the worst, which is not to say my expectations were low. But I knew what to expect from Lucas in terms of negatives, after sitting through Episodes I and II (not to mention the Ewoks of Episode VI). Fortunately, and perhaps somewhat surprisingly, these were kept to a minimum in Episode III, while Lucas finally cranked up the positives. Seen as a comic book come to life, it's just amazing. Seen as Shakespeare it's, well, pathetic. And, my word, I've seen shorter books on the works of Shakespeare than reviews of this film (unfortunately for me, my own included).I just don't know that George Lucas is trying to deliver the film that people seem to be expecting. That is, I don't think he's really aiming anywhere near the ""Best Film of the Year"" award. I think the campiness is intentional. I think the hokiness is intentional. However, I also think there are times when the campiness and hokiness is just plain bad. Nevertheless, he's up against the collective memories of everyone who saw the first three films as an impressionable pre-teen and I just don't think he has any possibility of winning. What the viewer gets out of it will certainly depend on the baggage they bring with them.Put a completely different way, Episodes I-III are like major-leaguers hopped-up on a ridiculously large and deadly diet of steroids, such that, while performing at their absolute best within their league, they could also die at any moment. Such was the case that led to the demise of Episodes I and II. Episode III on the other hand, though suffering from permanent damage from all the steroid abuse, can certainly look forward to many years as a heroic, albeit damaged, veteran of the Star Wars World Series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I can die happy,"Having been raised on the Star Wars films as a child, played hooky from high school to catch the first showing of Episode I, failed a class to catch the first showing of Episode II and as a person who is not ashamed to admit that he has Jedi robes and a suit of Clone Trooper armor hanging in his closet ... I can die a happy man, because the saga is now complete. This movie is everything I could have asked for and then some. It is not only visually stunning but also emotionally powerful. For fans of the original trilogy who felt that the newest movies have been disappointments, it may come as a pleasant surprise at how many loose ends are tied up with this movie, as it does an exceptional job of linking the two trilogies together. I could prattle on and on about how wonderful I thought the movie was, but, then again, I also had the patience to find redeeming qualities even in Episode I: The Phantom Menace (they really are there if you have the inclination to look hard enough)...

The Franchise Strikes Back,"Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The SithIt's really a great fun film. It brought back Star Wars and brought back some life to the franchise again. They hit the right note with the prequels this time around, its just a pity they didn't for Episode 2.One good thing about it is the progression of the acting. Ewan's performance is really good in this one and much better than in the other two. He portrays a young Guiness Obi Wan for some parts while adding himself to the role. It works and it bridges the character gap. Hayden's performance is also that bit better. It seems this film suited him more but he had some bad lines to work with. Natalie Portman was good in all of the films in my opinion and seems to be one of the great actresses of this generation. However, she doesn't have really have a large role in this and doesn't get too much screen time. I would have preferred to have seen more of her in it. Samuel Jackson can't go wrong either. Another strong strong actor in a film with some wooden dialogue (and acting from some of the cast). However Ian McDiarmid steals the show. He is a superb actor that deserves more work in film and TV and it shows in this.Episode III also has a fantastic soundtrack from John Williams. Its the most darkest one he has done and at the same time, the most enchanting and haunting and it brings it together.The special effects are like they were in Episode 1 and 2 however it seems to be that bit crisper. The lightsaber fights are also awesomely done.Why did I give this film an 8? Its not a perfect film and it does have its *cringe* moments but overall its sound for Lucas' type of film and thats what the rating is on. As a Star Wars film it is a great film and as a film in general it works surprisingly well.It also bridges the gap between the saga and I've said it really all works.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Best of the Prequels,"I'm making my way through all six Star Wars movies in preparation for ""The Force Awakens"", and I just watched ""Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"".This is actually the first time that I've seen this movie since it was in theaters ten years ago. I had forgotten how good it is! A couple of minor tiffs aside, this is a really great movie, definitely the best of the prequels (even though I like all of the prequels!), and a very strong chapter in the Star Wars legend.The things I like about this movie:All in all this movie flows well and is well told. The gist of the storyline amongst the lead characters comes full circle, with Anakin making his way to the Dark Side, Padmé giving birth, and Obi-Wan having to take on his apprentice. The acting is much better in this movie than in the previous two films, with Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen each growing into their roles. I still find Christensen's performance to be a bit lacking, but he definitely puts on a better show than in ""Attack of the Clones"".The special effects in this movie are also the best of the prequels, and the whole thing just works in a way that is fun and enjoyable.Things I don't like:As noted, Christensen is still a bit off his game--I see that more as a failure of directing than acting, though. But he could stand to improve. Also, the emperor looks a bit too....something. It's hard to say, but the effects there are just odd and don't really look as good as in the IV-VI movies. And, my biggest beef with the movie is that late in the movie when Anakin has made his debut as Darth Vader in earnest, he has a brief monologue that is just downright silly. Once Anakin has the Darth Vader suit on, he should have been presented as the full fledged icon from the original series. His scene at the close of the film humanizes him way too much, in a way that takes away from the fierceness of the character.Those minor criticisms aside, this is still a fantastic film! 9/10 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Still not an Epic....,"History has not been kind to the Star Wars prequels. After viewing Episodes I and II, I had become more than disappointed in George Lucas, wondering why, after the tremendous impact that the original trilogy had on pop culture, he would feel the need to no longer base special effects around story elements, but story elements around the video game style effects he feels are oh so real. It was with this thought that I walked into Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. And, I must tell you, I was neither disappointed nor was I completely surprised by what I saw.To begin: the script. This film had an legendary story that everyone knew, the birth of Vader. So, the main idea of the story was in place, and had been for many years. So here, it was not the idea of a story around the FX, but the script. And it shows. The vast majority of the dialog in this film is poorly written, with sly, pointless punch-lines hidden in deep, and short, to the point lines, rather than some oratories I would have preferred. It is obvious with the dialog that Lucas wanted this to be a visual film, rather than a vocal piece. And in some instances, this worked well. For instances, the light-saber battle between Anakin and Ob-Wan at the end of the film begins and ends with dialog, with little to none in between, allowing us to feel the energy between the fighters. However, when Anakin and the Chancellor are spending time together discussing ""things,"" the dialog is weak and empty, and poorly put forth by the actors. It was at these times my focus to wander to the background and I would realize that Halo 2 sometimes looks more realistic.Moving on to the acting. Ewan McGregor was above par in this film, despite the poor dialog. I found it refreshing to see that he was still able to go all out for this film. Unfortunately, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christiansen, and Samuel L. Jackson did not hold up as well. Christiansen gives a terrible performance, however, only when vocally interacting with others. When he is the only focus, with no other main characters around, his presence in amazing, but his interactions make the film drop a notch, Natalie Portman seemed tired with the Padme role and appears to have given up, and Jackson just did not seem to care, much was the same with Christopher Lee, a brilliant classical actor who gave one of the worst performances in his recent career. As for Ian McDirmad, his overacting of evil was his downfall. Too many times he let the Emporer slip through when he was supposed to be good, other times he was just funny in his acting abilities. Another classical actor who just did not seem to care how their acting was.Plot for this film lacked in many ways as well. Watching this movie, I felt that there were too many story lines to follow at times. The ultimate problem with this is that at the end of many plot lines, there is no real climax. They were poorly written and left you wanting more. Much could be said of when Anakin fully crosses to the dark side, there is no logic behind it, and he seems to do it so freely that you wonder why it took him so long. The reason behind the crossover slightly makes up for it all in the end, and it is nice how the tie-in is not made in an obvious manner.Ultimately, the downfall of the movie was Lucas himself. Too much digital, and too many pointless camera techniques. The film abounded with close-ups, too stylistic fades, quick cuts, and overactive camera techniques. I like to see fast pacing action, but I also like the camera to move at a slow enough pace for me to focus on what is trying to be filmed. Lucas is not an accomplished director by any stretch of the imagination, nor is he a screenwriter. His knack is for producing and story elements. He needs to allow others to doctor the script or com-write with him, and leave the director's chair open to someone with vision.Additional to point out is the droid humor and the better technology. Watching this film, it is hard to believe that story wise, it takes place before A New Hope. Yet, the technology is actually an upgrade from A New Ope. R2-D2 has more features than I remember from the original trilogy. Also, the droid army is too humorous, dropping many lines to General Grievious that would be considered insubordination, but the General takes it. This greatly detracted from the feel of the film.Overall, the first hour or so of the film will hold one's attention as well as the first prequels. After that, the film is more enjoyable and the battles Yoda vs. Emperor and Anakin vs. Obi-Wan cannot be missed, as the are better than one could imagine. John Williams did a stellar job with the score in this film, ultimately making the light-saber battle of Anakin and Obi-Wan what it was. Walking out of the theater, I gave this film 9/10. However, after I thought about what I had witnessed, I realized that the film tried to be more than what it was, and what it was, and I lowered the score to 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Underappreciated epic film,"This film was what the prequel trilogy should have been. The phantom menace and attack of the clones were sub par but I believe this film nailed it for the most part. Aside from some corny dialogue and questionable choreography, this movie had some of the best moments in the saga. Anakin's turn was very well done, especially during the Mustafar scenes. It is a heartbreaking tragedy and I wish the previous 2 films would have set up this one much better. Nonetheless, this movie picks up the slack and delivers a great back story for the original films that we all love. Plenty of epic scenes to fulfill its hype. Obviously from a film making standpoint, this film is not on the empire strikes backs level, but from a entertainment value perspective I believe Revenge of the sith holds a light to empire.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than EP's 1 & 2, but still flawed . . .","Well, what can I say, I approached Revenge of the Sith with some trepidation, but was pleasantly surprised...to a point.I'm no fan of Phantom Menace, and though Attack of the Clones was sort of an improvement, they both suffered from the same problem; heavyweight plot ideas, supported by weak, underwritten, adolescent screenplays.RotS shows some improvement in the area of writing, but only to a degree, George Lucas really should handed over scripting duties to a REAL writer who would been able to shape his story ideas into the mature, fully-rounded scripts they needed to be - do I have to cite Empire? It strikes me that Lucas has problems with younger audiences in terms of trusting their level of sophistication with plotting and character development - witness the way the romance between Anakin and Amidala was handled in TPM - mawkish, adolescent and clumsy, are words that spring to mind.Direction on RotS is what you'd expect from George Lucas, breathtaking visuals, impressive handling of action, but a certain unrefined quality to non-action/special effects scenes. One suspects that Lucas is either impatient and/or uncomfortable with character-based scenes and feels compelled to move the action along just in case the audience loses interest and becomes bored - this is his flaw, Lucas doesn't TRUST his viewers attention span and therefore the story suffers.But these are minor issues when compared to the talentless wretch of a so-called actor that is Hayden Christensen, whose non-performance seriously undermines Revenge of the Sith. It shocks me that with the wealth of acting talent in North America, that Lucas could have cast such a pivotal character as Anakin Skywalker SO badly.I've seen table legs give better performances than this young man, who brings an entirely new definition to the term 'wooden acting' - his acting in RotS consists mainly of intense stares, more intense stares and for good measure, even more intense stares.This lack of thespian skills on the behalf of Mr. Christensen is very much highlighted when he has to share screen time with any of his peers - Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan) acts Christensen out of the water, as does Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine) even a VERY badly underwritten Natalie Portman (Amidala) acts the socks off her screen lover.As one would expect of a George Lucas film, production values are very high - Costumes, Production Design, Editing, Visual Effects are superb and even the Digital Cinematography looks good (for a change!).All in all, as the last (non-chronological) entry in the Star Wars saga, Revenge of the Sith acquits itself quite well - despite some of the shortcomings.Lata.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best star wars movie ever!,"The prequels are actually way more
depressing than what we thought. Throughout his
whole life anakin was plagued by a lack
of freedom he was born into the slave
trade where his abusive owner would take
advantage of his technical skills then a
group of jedi knights show up to rescue
him finally this is his big break and oh
wait no they don't give a about him
they just want to use his little racer
thing to win them some money but hey
after he risks his life for them after
he single-handedly gets them exactly
what they want the jedi return the favor
and free him from slavery but it's not
from the goodness of their hearts it's
because they now think he's their new
space jesus they couldn't give less of a

travesty happening on the planet see you
later little slave kids enjoy the desert
you feel wimps but it's whatever
anakin gets to become a jedi and learn
the ways of the force in a way it's
actually a really abusive system which
forces them to repress all of his trauma
hormones or attachment to any living
thing in the known universe despite
fighting their wars for them despite
bringing them countless victories for
their republic the jedi still take
advantage of his natural power and
blatantly ignore what he has to say
about it and so when palpatine comes
along the father figure he never had
someone who finally understands him hey
i get that the jedi are using you i get
that you have these romantic feelings
that are forbidden join me and
everything will be fine of course he
gives in but again palpatine is just
using him for personal gain and anakin
ends up paying for it he sacrifices his
moral code his best friend's trust and
the love of his life and after losing
everything after being left so hideously
scarred and deformed he has nothing left
but his loyalty to palpatine he's gone
too far to turn back and so he has no
choice but to spend the next 20 years as
an emotionally tortured puppet all of
this is changed by his son luke the only
person who hasn't lost faith in him who
hasn't been corrupted by him or murdered
by him and so when he sees palpatine
taking advantage of luke when he sees
history repeating itself anakin finally
has enough for the first time in his

Unbalanced story with great ending,"This movie definitely has its moments, in fact some scenes in it are the best of what George Lucas has ever directed in his life. And some of the music edited in those scenes is best what John Williams has to offer.But this movie has problems, big, big problems.First of all, the beginning. Yes, it looks good. Amazing even, but the way it was edited together and the dialog delivered during that huge battle made me question the exact need of the scene: I came in conclusion, that it was there just as a show off, nothing more.Secondly: some were tacky and wooden acting. And the dialog. In some places it's so horrible, that you feel like laughing. And usually for wrong reasons.But, I would like to say here, that there is good acting too. There is scenes in the movie, where everything just click in very well and the abilities of the cast really shows off. Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan), Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu), Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine), Natalie Portman (Padme) have some great scenes, which end up saving the over all movie.Anakin's (Hayden Christensen) turn to Darth Vader is told very clearly, it's made sure, that no one misses the points of his fall. And no matter what the general consensus about this is, I still feel Hayden is very good choice to as Anakin: he plays the part of an arrogant man, who believes he has the ultimate power.So, here's a summary: In start I felt a bit numb because of one too many underlining, poorly written talk sequences, but in the end it was more rewarding, it just is, that all the good things are left in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Saga Concludes To a Fitting End,"I just rented a Screener DVD of the movie, cos I missed it when it was in the theaters... I was under the impression of a great movie, with superb visual effects and excellent acting... I was not slightly disappointed...Like most Star Wars movies, the beginning of the movie is slightly haphazard... It takes a bit of time to realize that the Clone Wars are ending... But when Ian McDermaid is first shown he appears clumsy, with a lot of ""strained"" acting... Especially the scene where Count Dooku gets killed, Palpatine definitely looked pretty poor. Also the part when Anakin finally accepts Palpatine as his mentor, that part was kinda foolish. One moment he is wailing for attacking a Jedi, and the next moment he turns to Palpatine....But everything is overshadowed by the awesome ending to the movie, which portrays the final transformation of Anakin Skywalker to the Sith Lord Darth Vader... The death of Padme, finishing the transformation.. Ewan McGregor was awesome, especially in the final sequences of the battle when he wails out,""You were the chosen one..."" The special effects were very neat. Ian Mcdermaid also gives a stalwart performance, overlooking his errors at the start, as the Dark Lord Sidious. Natalie Portman, is also very well portrayed. But probably, the best acting was from Anakin Skywalker, Hayden Christensen. This was his movie, which finished what everyone wanted to know, ever since it was revealed that Darth Vader was a Jedi himself... His every move, his every look, had the gleam, and his every movement seemed to portray something... Right from the very beginning, when he learns that Padme is pregnant, we see a flurry of emotions...But the story is also very well crafted. We see that the one thing that drew him towards the Dark Side, his love for Padme, the urge to protect her, even at the cost of death, change when he turns his back to the Jedi. Ironically, his thirst for power becomes so great that he chokes Padme, in her delicate condition, in his anger for betrayal, that he felt for her and Obi Wan. The duel between Master Yoda and Palpatine is also very nice. For the first time in the prequel movies we find someone who is as powerful as Master Yoda, and who can wield the Light Saber as fast and efficiently like he does.There is so much to say about this movie that it can go on and on and on. Not everything can be said within a 1000 words. But one thing has to be mentioned, before concluding this review. The seduction of Anakin Skywalker to wards the Dark Side of the Force... This has to be mentioned. Lucas does a brilliant job of actually creating the sense of insecurity and doubt in his mind, about who to trust and who to follow. On one side he has his friend and mentor Obi Wan and the Jedi council, and on the other hand we have Palpatine. Both these sides manipulate him to come over to their side. Both use him as a spy for the other. But Palpatine has the upper hand, since he knows about Padme's condition, and he gives him an offer that he couldn't refuse. The false promise was the only thing that kept him from turning him over to the Jedi, or even killing him. In his mind, we see that his trust for the Jedi order has started to crumble, because he is asked to do things by his superiors which are exactly what is not supposed to be done by a Jedi.But overall this is an incredible pull off by Geroge Lucas. And we feel for the characters, especially Obi Wan. Perhaps only Ewan McGregor can be comparable to Hayden Christensen in this movie, due to his powerful dialogs.Quotes such as, ""Anakin, I've failed you, I've failed you...""or ""You were the chosen one... You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them, you were to bring balance to the force, not plunge it in darkness....""Or ""Anakin is the father isn't he... I'm so sorry....""but perhaps the best one is...""You were like my brother.... I loved you....""An amazing movie, and 8/10 from me.....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the prequel trilogy,"Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith is what I consider the best of the prequel trilogy and despite some flaws, is a decent addition to the franchise.The film doesn't start with trade negotiations or some shoddy romance, it starts off with a bang with an impressive battle sequence. Unlike the two prequels beforehand, this one grabs your attention straight away. Revenge of the Sith is a tragedy about the downfall of a hero. Lucas uses foreshadowings to showcase a layered and fully realised story that he was waiting to tell ever since the original film in 1977.However, the film is without its flaws. George Lucas was never an expertise when it came down to dialogue and this movie is no exception. There is some crummy romantic dialogue between Anakin and Padme, but not as much as in Attack of the Clones. There is a heavy reliance on CG special effects and while some of it has aged fine, some other uses seem pointless like the clone troopers body attached to a live action actor's head and a pilot's helmet for some odd reason.Revenge of the Sith is also the darkest entry into the franchise, even more so than The Empire Strikes Back. As a young lad back in 2006 when I first saw this movie on DVD, I was shocked at the movie's maturity level. It definitely deserved its PG-13 rating.The acting of Ewan Mcgregor and Heyden Christenson in the climactic fight is great and despite some odd dialogue from Anakin, you get the sense this is the ultimate clash between good and evil. Also, John Williams score shines with the execution of the Jedi and the climactic fight. It's the ultimate tragedy told well by George Lucas, who's an excellent storyteller.I'm not saying this reaches the heights of the original trilogy by any means. It's just a good story which despite its weakness, is a gem amidst an infamous trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I recommend to see this movie because the plot just keeps getting better and better as the movie progresses. Though at sometimes i find the movie a little too predicting. Each time something would happen i would have already have seen it. And the music from John Williams is Superb!I hope that you see this movie and rate it for yourself because i did.

Natalie Portman is as gorgeous as ever (she didn't look too good in Garden State) and the light saber fights are awesome. There is one scene in particular where Obi Wan fights a robot that has several light sabers in his multiple arms.The only problem I had was that the Jedi seemed to be defeated too easily after all when they have the force working for them they should be able to know when they will be ambushed. Only Yoda seemed to have this power but I guess he is the most powerful Jedi.There was a surprise appearance of Chewbacca and some funny parts with R2D2.

Star Wars Episode 3 Much Better With Some Flaws,"Star Wars Episode 3 is the best of the prequel trilogy from writer/director George Lucas who has somewhat redeemed himself from the so-so previous films that came before this one. Lucas brings his two trilogies to a sad yet satisfying conclusion that reveals more unanswered questions and the ending helps bridge the events in this film to the ones that will happen in A New Hope. Ewan McGregor is much better this time around as Obi-Wan Kenobi and luckily has more to do. McGregor had an uncanny resemble to the older character played by Alec Guiness which made him that much more believable. Natalie Portman does what she can as Padme Amadala who is trying to keep her marriage to Anakin a secret. Her character also discovers she's pregnant with Anakin's child(ren)(Hint ""spolder"" Luke and Lea). Portman gets less screen time than she did in the previous and less to do making her character feel like a supporting player who shows up here and there. Portman still does a decent job with her limited screen time. Hayden Christian reprises his part as Anakin Skywalker and he like McGregor seem much more comfortable in their roles this time. He also seemed more of a lead than Portman considering he gets more screen time since the movie does mainly focus on him and McGregor. Christensen's character goes through a major transformation in this one and he is convincing in the role. For those of you who have seen it I don't think I have to tell you who he eventually transforms into but I'll say it anyway. Christensen's Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader and his characters signature costume complete with that strange breathing sound are shown briefly revealing why he has to wear that suit. Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious is an effective villain who gets more to do including two light saber duels one of them is against Master Yoda near the end. Samuel L Jackson is back too as Jedi Knight Mace Windu but unfortunately his character's role is cut rather short. Jackson is good in his small role none the less. The same can go for Christopher Lee who also returns as Count Dooku from Episode 2 but his part like Jackson's is very small and he's written out of the movie quickly. The rest of the supporting cast including Yoda, C3PO, R2-D2, and brief appearance by Chewbacca are adequate in their small parts but don't get much to and none of them really leave an impression. Jar Jar Binks luckily makes a non-speaking brief blink and you missed it appearance before the conclusion. The special effects are amazing and the action/fight sequences are equally impressive. The ones standing out being the space battle that opens the film and the final climactic light saber duel between Ob-Wan and Anakin/Vader a very impressive fight sequence that was a bit long but very well executed none the less. The pacing was slow in between the action again at times and the dialogue wasn't the best occasionally either like the other ones but fortunately the good outweighs the bad. Lucas ends this film in a good way which could've been a little better but it was still a big improvement over the previous ones. Overall this film is much better than some of the other third movies in a trilogy that were disappointments like Spider-man 3, X-Men The Last Stand, and Pirates 3 to name a few. Despite it's few flaws Star Wars Episode 3 is still an entertaining sci-fi adventure with enough intense action, solid performances, and a fitting finale that makes this third film enjoyable to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Pretty Darn Good Star Wars Movie,"*Contains some very teeny tiny ""spoilers""*I went to this movie with as low expectations as I could for a Star Wars movie, and was going to be as critical as I could, because my friend had been ranting how bad it was going to be.Although the movie certainly did not need to be as long as it was, and some of the ideas were old/overused, such as the Destroyers rolling out to attack Obi Wan and Anakin (as in the first movie with Qui Gon and Obi Wan), this movie still gets a 7/10. I mean...R2-D2 got weapons, and a fire jet pack things in his ""feet"", and did some major butt kicking!!! I think he might have even been my favorite character in the movie! =PThis is my third favorite Star Wars movie.

Its not a big deal to me but sometimes its the small things that really annoy. I liked Sith a lot and think it went some way in redeeming the prequel series but i think we would all have been much happier if Lucas hadn't tried to do everything himself.

Wow.,"This is definitely the best prequel to date. George Lucas set million upon millions of viewers awestruck with the original STAR WARS, and he didn't let fans down with its two immediate sequels. This was the biggest movie franchise of all time (unless I'm wrong), and with good reason. The man and the films didn't disappoint. It was a thrill to watch. His first two prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, unfortunately, did. Talks of these films seemed to end with, ""Yes, it's a shame the man let us down."" The series lost popularity. But now, with REVENGE OF THE SITH, these movies inspire a spark of interest again. From its incredible battles to its dramatic finale, George Lucas has said, ""I CAN do this. Just watch."" The movie is a thrill ride, though, parents, take heed, this is not a film for your four-year-old to see. The PG-13 rating is for a reason. The characters are more real, and Lucas seems to have gotten his head around the special effects. When you leave the theater, you, too, will want to see the two TV series projects he has planned for us. This film can make the unbelievers into fans.

the final act of what could have been....,"Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the recent trilogy, but this really isn't saying much. In order to fully appreciate the film it must be considered the final third act of one piece of work. Unfortunately although this final film is much more entertaining and contains much that is worthy of credit, it has to pull itself up from the appalling first two films. I found the story of Annakin's rise and fall to the dark-side interesting and filled with dramatic potential and perhaps in better hands this would have been better realised. Unfortunately George Lucas's skills as a scriptwriter are non-existent and whilst the story is excellent, the realisation of it is very poor.It is hard to feel the emotion and pain of Annakin's downfall in the way in which we should because of the simple fact that every character is poorly sketched out (and acted). The other two films should have made us feel and relate to the characters. The poor acting is not i feel due to the actors themselves but is the fault of a lack of direction. That said Haydon Christiensen is very good in this film. Much has been made of George Lucas's lack of care for actors and character, this is a real shame as the story he is attempting to make is an entirely character driven and psychological one. If he had built upon the characters and encouraged the actors and nurtured the story lines throughout the first two of the films this final part would have been a stunning and moving experience but as it stands now it is a flawed but never the less entertaining film.I would recommend this film for people to see as it is extremely entertaining and full of excellent action set pieces. It is also very dark and it is intriguing and to see Anakin's fall and the pieces fall into place leading the narrative on to A New Hope. But you can not avoid the fact that the first two parts of the story are utterly lacking in every respect. This should be the final act of a great masterpiece and the final pin in a six part epic story. But instead is an entertaining film that makes you lament what could have been and that (perhaps) is more upsetting than the film itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The negative reviews seem a little harsh..,"OK, much of the dialogue isn't great, and Yoda's backward speaking sentences move to a new degree of tortuousness, nevertheless those people saying this film lacks any urgency, and/or is laughable, are missing some basic emotions, because despite the above, the climax with Anakin/Obi-wan and Palpatine/yoda is stunning, with a level of emotional investment way beyond the first two prequels, and the action itself is outstanding, having watched the battles more than a few times now on DVD.

Revenge of the Sith Stinks,"Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They're all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle.

Revenge of the Sith,"Finally it has arrived and i'm glad it did. The biggest nightmare would've been for me noticing monumental gaps in the end of the Sith and the beginning of new hope - fortunately all the loose ends have largely been tied up.The narrative sways full stream into the star wars universe introducing us to new characters and revisiting some old - namely chewbacca - albeit briefly. The action centres around the ongoing clone wars with General ken-obi and Jedi master sky walker vying to solve the every widening conflict. Assembled here is typically charismatic Lucas sci-fi event, plenty of CGI battle sequences, characters, worlds etc. But for me the most interesting should have been Anakin Skywalker's transition to the dark side. Unfortunately this is rather hurried, rushed and dealt with in a rather trivial way - it could've been so much more poignant, heart rendering and emotional, instead it was half hearted. Also the massacre of the Jedi's was weak and lacking emotion in that a heavy orchestral demise, with slow motion could've enhanced what was supposed to be an absolutely critical massacre (order no.66) This could've made the massacre more deliberate and informing. Again this seems rushed.The grand finale is well crafted with some excellent rhythmic swordplay between good & evil. The rise of evil (in the form of Darth Vader) is well placed and handled with invention. The pleasant surprise for me was the dynamic range of fighting ability and expressions of master Yoda, which was certainly a highlight.

It was OK,"I wasn't blown away by this last film by Lucas. I seen it a while back, and now I am finally getting around to post my thoughts about it. I was listening to all the hype like ""Oh, it explains everything, and that everything will come full circle and you'll understand it all."" Well, yeah it summed up everything. But, I personally think that Lucas is far more imaginative than having Vader burned up in a lava flow. It could have been better. Lucas is a genius, and I expected SO much more. So much more of the love between anakin and padme, more examples of what lured anakin to the dark side, and more problematic incidences tearing him and padme apart.

This movie was not very good,"I love Star Wars from the original 3 movies, but I won't like this one just because it has the same name. This movie(along with I & II) have a powerful legacy to follow and I was surprised at just how bad the script to this movie was. The dialogue was trite and cliché and there was little character development. In the original 3 movies, it was very easy to connect with the characters and to identify with the story simply because relating to the character's personalities was so easy. This should have been the *primary* focus in this movie. Special effects are wonderful, but they are icing on the cake and if the cake itself is ugly and no good, then the icing is suddenly very unimportant. Now I won't go as far to say this movie was ugly and no good(and maybe because I'm being nice to a degree), but the saying ""with greater power comes greater responsibility"" comes to mind. Much more should be expected of this movie because of its legacy and this movie did not deliver. I was tempted to rate it a 3, but I suppose 4 is probably more appropriate since I think I'd be letting my emotions get the better of me if I gave it a 3. I'm in awe that this movie had a user rating of 8 stars. Did we all see the same movie?",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best in the franchise so far,"This movie blew my mind as a child, I waited for years and years to see the conclusion to the greatest movie franchise of all time, to put all the puzzles together.The very start of the movie blasts you into a great battle scene, with fantastic visual effects and an outstanding soundtrack. While yes this movie does have its faults, like some of the dialogue, and some scenes that feel rushed or out of place, but as soon as this movie shots you into the action or really emotional scenes, you forget about all that,One of the most annoying this is this film's ratings, only a 7.6 on here when it should be at least an 8.3 or 8.4. It is sheer entertainment, with a great performance from Ian McDiarmid (Emperor).This movie ties in all the movies nicely, and while it does still have its flaws, that does 'not' make it a bad movie. There are plenty of bad movies out there that don't get same hate that episodes 1-3 get.9.9/10 brilliant film, my personal favourite of the franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the Prequel Trilogy,"Star Wars is back! Of course, for me, it never left. But for those who disliked Episodes I and II, Revenge of the Sith will (should, anyway) make you happy. ""Sith"" is the bridge of the series. It shows you why everything in Episodes I and II had to happen, but without the context of ""Sith"" when Episode I came out, I can see why fans were startled. I recall having people asking why any of Episode I was important. But it was. When Episode II was released, people asked why things happened the way they did. But they had to. Looking back, I suppose it was inevitable that some would lose heart in Lucas and the prequel trilogy, but to me, ""Sith"" changes all that.""Sith"" is a powerful film. The story is taut, linear, and tense the whole way through (this despite the fact that there are many humorous moments as well). Every word, every look, every shot drives the plot inevitably to its final frame with a relentless fervor.Lucas answers a host of questions about Episodes I and II without dragging us through dry exposition. Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader is handled in a sophisticated, realistic manner worthy of Vader's reputation. Lucas makes us invest emotionally in Anakin's destiny, in Anakin himself, and his wife and friends. Then, piece by piece, Lucas forces us to watch as the Repubic unravels, as the relationships are torn apart. He makes us hate and yet like Anakin.There are some incredible lines in the film. The performances of the actors are several notches above the Episodes I or II. Lucas reportedly was very specific about what he wanted from the actors, which is not something he normally does. This shines through in some of the best moments of the film. The romance scenes with Anakin and Padme, while still cheesy to an extent were not nearly to the degree they were in Episode II, and Natalie and Hayden handle the material much better too. One scene with the two of them somewhere in the second half of the film is one of the most powerful scenes of the Star Wars saga, never mind the prequels.I think we sold Lucas short six years ago with the release of Episode I. He once again shows us that he can weave a wonderful and powerful story together that can only be fully understood after that final episode. For that, he should be pleased. For that, we should be happy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Revenge of George Lucas,"I was one of the lucky ones to see on opening night in Leceister Square and I was willing to spend 250 quid or so for the ticket (my girlfriend also paid for hers).We proceeded with caution. After watching the mediocre Episodes I and II, I was fearful of how this one would turn out to be. I am a big fan of the saga but the previous two outings were slightly icky for my taste. The special effects were the main star, and the somewhat shallow plot and wooden acting (especially from the younger actors Christensen and Portman). And JAR JAR BINKS! I hated that bugger SO MUCH that I dreamt of stabbing him with my lightsabre! Little did we know that this film was at last the one we've been waiting for! We came out with awe that this movie was easily the best of the prequels and also unseats Return of the Jedi as the third-best of the two sagas.There are many reasons: the special effects are more developed, but also more contributing to the story line instead of being obstrusive, Hayden Christensen is more comfortable with his character and you can see it there (there's still a degree of thickness, particularly in the romance subplot, but such moments are rare), and, for the first time since Jedi, there's a real plot that shows the way. The first 20 mins, which are action-packed, are just a sweet and vital introduction for a film whose tone rapidly gets darker, and this feeling is what makes it interesting (it has a host of references from Greek tragedies like the Oedipus trilogy, among other things). The veterans Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee gives the movie more colour with their evil revelations (although the latter one is in it only briefly...), Samuel L. Jackson, a Star Wars fan himself, makes a great job as Mace Windu as he makes the character meet his fate as a hero. Ewan McGregor makes a very believable performance as a wiser and more experienced Obi-Wan this time (remember how he played the young man in Episode I?). I admit, Hayden Christensen has also done a very good job as the more mature Anakin whose insecurities promote his temptation to go to the Dark Side. The movie has a very strong emotional pull that fits the standard of movies like the Godfather, and in my case, I almost ended up crying after the film's tragic conclusion.The actions are well-staged and imaginative, and give the story movement and excitement (the Skywalker-Kenobi final fight at the volcanic planet Mustafar is a wow!). I must warn, especially the children, that this film is EXPLICIT and GRAPHIC in comparison with the rest, but its rating-- whether be PG-13 in the US, 12A here, M in Australia, FSK-12 in Germany-- makes the movie even MORE INTERESTING. The dialogue on some scenes-- particularly the romance sub-plot-- needs improvement, but again, it's nowhere as near as corny as the Phantom nor Attack and these two flaws-- the first being Natalie's mediocre acting-- are more like observations than real criticisms, and they are of no consequence.People either love it or hate, but this movie will remain as the the best movie of the saga since the Empire Strikes Back. And it's going to be the undisputed winner of the summer season and of the year. It's just a matter of time of who'll reach second and third. The series ends with a dark tone, but also with a bang! George Lucas finally enacts his Revenge on the critics. The Force is strong with this one.***1/2 (out of ****)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
By far the best out of the prequel trilogy,"For reference, I'm a 21 year old female in search of the best comfort films/series. Some of my favourites are Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, The Vampire Diaries, and I also enjoy shows like The Summer I Turned Pretty and Love Island. If you have a similar taste this review is for you.I'm proud to say that after the first 4+ hours of dragged out backstory, I FINALLY made it to the first film in the series that fits in. And I wasn't disappointed.Maybe it's the nostalgia effect talking, but I really enjoyed this one. I have a few issues, but it still captured my attention easily.The flow is so much better, and for the first time I was emotionally invested in the characters. I remembered the ending before watching, (probably the only thing I remember from the entire thing) but it was still cool to see it from my older selves perspective.The one thing I have to really complain about is dragged out action scenes. Some people really enjoy that, but it's just not for me. Some of them are important to the story, but I just feel like they could've shortened a few.All the other issues I can excuse by the time it was released. Most films from even 10 years ago have some cringey things, it's bound to happen. But I just see it as silly and goofy. There's a couple of moments that are supposed to be so serious, but because of the way they were edited or some of the acting choices, it ends up being so funny, and I love that.I'm actually excited to continue watching.

CGI vs. puppets: What does it take to make a good star wars movie?,"I have been an avid fan of star wars since I was a young boy. I have seen the old trilogy countless times and know many of the lines by heart. It is then expected that coming into this new trilogy, I had quite high expectations. Unfortunately, most of those died after Episode I and an insufferable Anakin Skywalker that looked like he was pulled out of Nickelodeon.Thankfully, episode III has been better, albeit still of a completely different nature than the originals. I am going to detail some of those differences here:*I TRIED NOT TO PUT ANY SPOILERS ABOUT THIS MOVIE, BUT THIS ASSUMES YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BASIC STUFF OF THE STAR WARS SAGA *1) The overuse of CGI animations over real locations and men dressed in suits gives the viewer a lack of believability in the story. This was one of the mistakes in this trilogy (on the other hand look at the success of Lord of the Rings).2) The original trilogy had a variety of side stories and side characters that made the story have so much breadth and depth (which contributed to the amount of games and comics created afterwards) Alas, these movies seem too focused on the main plot and miss out on its possibility to further expand the universe.3) I agree with comments mentioned before about the script, it is disappointing. I cannot say that the script in the originals was fantastic, but at the very least the acting (mostly done by British actors) was truly amazing. Sometimes when I watch the new trilogy I feel like I am watching an action movie.. which brings me to my next point4) Who the hell decided that we need a choreography for light sabre battles? Light sabre battles now seem more like dancing than actual fighting, in the originals when Obi Wan fought Darth Vader all they did was touch light sabres here and there, no fancy movements, just plain sparring. 5) The acting for the most part in the new ones is lacking. Especially with Anakin Skywalker, he got better on episode III, but Hayden Christensen.. I'm sorry, but you're no Darth Vader in my eyes. The love story between Padme and Anakin was not very believable and too childish (refer to Han and Leia in originals)So what makes this episode iii better than the others in the new trilogy:1) Well, pretty much it stuck to the storyline the most. It threw out some political commentaries here and there which are interesting, but so many movies nowadays are doing that too. What I found the most interesting is that you got to see the inner workings of Coruscant and the final development of Darth Vader. And finally, it has the most connections with the original story line than anything else.2) CGI has gotten better since episode I. Making movie more believable, ergo the viewer gets more involved. Although my personal preference is enhance sceneries with CGI, just use puppets and suits for characters.3) Thankfully we moved out of Episode I's childish aura and moved into a darker more ominous feel. Truer to Darth Vader's character (although it misses the mark slightly e.g. flashback to ""NOOOOOOOOOO"" scene at the end, ridiculous)4) I very much liked the Emperor, I feel that he remained true to his character from the originals and contributed to a lot of the success in this movie.Well, there's probably other things I can mention, but the list would get boring if it's not already. These are my two cents from a Star Wars fan, the last thing I have to say though is: Yoda what have they done to you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Darth needs psychoanalysis,"Best of the ""new"" trilogy.Great CGI.Corny and poor acting - especially Darthie's ""pre-evil"" character (only two emotions: anger and anguish).Nice wrap-up of all the loose ends from Phanton and Attack. Made the movie a little stressed, though - ""amphetamine rush"", compared to the two previous flicks' ""coffeine-buzz"".The movie is alright, but still doesn't even compare to the original one.If only someone had brought Anakin to decent EU for treatment of his burns, and some debriefing for his traumas....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Underrated classic, great film","I love all three of the prequel trilogy movies, but this one is my favorite, it's fun to watch, has great action/fight scenes and finishes an character arc that started in the first movie, in a really good way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Intense, emotional and action packed","Revenge of the Sith is the final prequel. First of all I want to say how this has the best action sequences out of any other Star Wars movie. By far the most intense, this movie illustrates Anakins transformation into Darth Vader cleverly, showing how manipulative palpatine is. It shows Anakins struggles and his anger, and gives two sides to the story, and ultimately you feel bad. After all that's happened to him, it's easy for him to turn and that is shown well. The script and acting has moderately improved since attack of the clones, although certain parts are still awful, however it doesn't really bring the movie down I'm a huge way. The final battle between obi-wan and Anakin is personally my favourite lightsaber duel of the saga. Although Star Wars is aimed towards kids as well, this movie will frighten them, especially from midway on. This movie connects the prequels and the original trilogy well, tieing up almost all loose ends. Although the movie as a whole does feel a bit uneven and edgy, the transformation was cleverly done and the action sequences are fantastic. Overall i rate this movie 8/10 for major improvements from AOTC, great battles and a intense and well directed story, although as a whole is slightly uneven.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
an excellent end that makes an excellent introduction,"First, I'll say that I don't feel any o this review is a spoiler, as all the things I said, as far as I know, have become common knowledge by now.I must say, to me, every flaw of Ep 2 and the forgettable experience of Ep 1 are forgiven after this one. I just came back, and man, that must be the most intensive Star Wars experience I ever had.That movie kicks ass. Pure and simple. The beginning is a bit over the top, with Obi-Wan throwing one-liners at us like he's Han Solo with a lightsaber, but after a while, he realizes he better be serious, and the real movie begins. It's not that bad, after all, as it establishes the bond between Obi-Wan and Anakin, a true friendship, beyond a mere master/apprentice relationship.The fights are awesome. They almost come close to what the Clone Wars creators made. The Jedi are fast, powerful, skilled, and it shows. And the fall of Anakin is shown from beginning to end, with all the good and bad reasons behind it. For the rest, well, it's pure Star Wars. The good Star Wars, like the Originals. Space battles like you've never seen before, not a fighter against a fighter, but a cruiser against a cruiser, with short-range cannons, like 18th century ships... Races against time, decisions you don't know if they're bad or wrong... Treason, Deception (for them), fun and excitement (for us) and right now I'm starting to feel like the grandfather in Princess Bride trying to explain what it's like to the grandson. (it has sports! sword fights! a princess!) You know what I mean... :)The ending alone is worth the price. It's incredibly... sad. I won't tell anything, no spoilers don't worry. Let just be said that the fight in the lava and what comes afterwards are on their way to be one of the most memorable scenes of the series, not only because they are, in themselves, full of emotion and sadness, but also for the hope they represent, the light in the dark, as we know what will happen next, in about thirty years (which is for us, twenty-five years ago. :p)The missing link, the last piece of the puzzle, call it what you want. It all falls into place, and that's part of why it's so damn good, because you finally understand who is Darth Vader. And you do not hate him anymore. You feel compassion.And I'll leave it at that. That movie made me change my mind about Darth Vader. And for all the things I knew about him before, I didn't know that would be possible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Once there was a hype...,"I enjoyed the old trilogy and liked the prehistory wondering how it would be realized. Disliking Part one the second aroused some expectations...From the first few minutes of ""Revenge of the Sith"" until the end, it felt more and more annoying. Annakin's shifting to the dark side theoretically is an appealing if not the most appealing aspect of the whole trilogy. Well it could be as long as there is a skillful writer for this job. If not, one's risking a script probably not better than a soap opera - as in my opinion holds true for Episode 3. The picture seemed to me uninspired and constrained. It's visual style isn't that good and the FX sometimes look very artificial (the CGI sure is the best thing of the movie and has impressing moments - but it's used too often and sometimes it reminds of a computer game). Acting has never been the strength of Lucas Movies. Suitable for the script, this time it's terrible. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are never able to express strong feelings for each other. Anyhow, one can't play these dialogues believable...On the whole a movie implausible, naive but what disturbed me the most (the other things one might expect and ignore): boring. For me this experience was not worth the money, not worth the time and not worth the old trilogy but the hype dies at last.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful Film... Stands Out... Bridges The Gap,"There is no getting around the fact that Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is a great film. It is unlike any of the previous Star Wars films, both the Original Trilogy and the prequels. The movie is very dark and intense, even brutal at times. It is not a gore-fest, but this movie is definitely not for little kids and the PG-13 rating is appropriate. The movie seems to stand out on its own as more of a bridge between the old and new than an ending to the prequel trilogy. It is the best of the prequels (and I liked the previous 2) and is on par with Return of the Jedi.What's Good? -The direction of the film is well done and I have to give credit to Lucas for actually working to make a good film rather than seeing what the limits of CGI are.-Ian McDiarmid gives an awesomely creepy performance as Palpatine and steals the show... the scenes between the Emperor and Anakin are worth the price of admission alone.-The score by John Williams is captivating and leads you into the original trilogy.-The special effects are seamless and take a backseat to the plot and the characters. The CGI is not the focal point of the movie, the people are.What's not good? -While Hayden is apt in many scenes, he seems to bring down some of the heavier scenes. I'm not sure that is his fault, it may be due to the dialogue, but some of the delivery of the lines in his performance hamper the film and prevent me from really lauding his performance. He is better than he was in Clones, but the jury is still out for as to the merits of his performance in Sith.-There is absolutely no chemistry between Hayden and Natalie Portman. Again, it may be the lines, but you don't feel much between them.-As a whole, the trilogy does not give you much time to like Anakin. He is extremely likable for the first 30 minutes of this film, the only time in the series you actually get to see any personality out of him. It is unfortunately too short for my tastes since he starts going batty really early in this film. Thus, you have only seen him as a child and a whining teenager, with only 30 minutes of seeing him as a hero, making his fall less significant than if you had actually liked him prior to his turn to the Darkside.Consensus The film is not perfect and has some hokey moments, but it delivers and may be a surprise to a lot of viewers. It is markedly different than the other films and it may be some time before we can actually judge its place in the Star Wars universe. Parents should be warned that some scenes might be too intense for young viewers. Most of the characters in the film do not meet their destinies pleasantly. Fore adults, the film should be satisfying. It gives the prequel haters what they wanted, a dark and adult oriented film and bridges the gap (with one or two inconsistencies that will probably be debated endlessly in the forums) and leaves the viewer with both a sense of loss for our favorite characters and a sense of completion that the saga has ended.I was very happy with this film and think it just may do the job painting the overall picture for this saga. We'll have to see if the good vibes about this movie continue as more people see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Butterfingers!!,"Well, I just saw Star Wars Revenge of the Sith today and there are a few things that I found a bit amusing. I think it is a good movie (much, much better than the last two) but not a great movie. But what I found was most humorous, was it seems that every Jedi knight can't hang on to their light sabers! It seems that in all six movies, they are constantly dropping their sabers. I would really like to watch all six movies sometime and keep count. Also, they are always hanging on for dear life to some edge to keep from falling into a bottomless pit or abyss. If the Empire ever discovers silicone spray, the Jedi are in deep trouble. Again, I'd have to watch them all and keep count. Lastly is a problem I have with Yoda. A great character, but from the first time I heard his voice in Empire Strikes Back, (I believe that was his first appearance), I always think of Fozzy Bear from the Muppet show. As all of you probably know, Frank Oz is the voice of Yoda and Fozzy. I keep waiting for Yoda to say something deep and meaningful followed by ""Waka, waka, waka,"" which is what Fozzy always said after one of his jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A light saber too far?,"For all the die-hard fans, this film is a dream come true. However, one of the film's strengths, it's special FX, is also a major weakness. Weakness in the sense of too much of a good thing and WAAAAAAY too many light-saber duels.The opening sequence continues in the tradition of the WOW/SOCKO openings of the previous films. However, BECAUSE of these too-numerous-to-count incredible effects what occurs is actually plain confusing. ""Less is more"" would have been useful here.If one ignores the physics of space, then one can accept what happens here and I'm sure this will only disturb the more discerning audience member. That said, Mr. Lucas could have been less ""childish"" and more scientifically ""precise"" and still attained his WOW factor. Unfortunately, it has been evident for several films now that toy revenue drives the creative here. Oh well.What Mr. Lucas achieves here is what we all paid our tickets for, the story of how Darth Vader emerges. Mr. Lucas has a credible answer to all of our questions and ties up the Star War loose ends very well.What is a continuing failure for Mr. Lucas is inability to write warm dialog. Even if one allows for the genre of the sci-fi movie serials of old that Mr. Lucas recreates and thus the painful words uttered by the actors, one can only feel the pain for Samuel L. Jackson as his character must utter some of the worst, and dead weighted lines in cinematic history. A far cry from ""Pulp Fiction"" for Mr. Jackson. I trust the paycheck eases the pain.If one ignores the subtle (and not-too-subtle) patina of liberal political overtones that Mr. Lucas (the French will embrace Mr. Lucas) puts forth (great contrast to the opposite political overtones in ""Batman Begins"") and I suspect most can, the film serves as a fine sci-fi epic.I suppose the film qualifies as a family film in that all the slaughter is usually befalling robots and therefore no blood. However, it IS ironic that for all of Mr. Lucas' liberal pretensions, he certainly is not sheepish in that violence IS the answer for his protagonists.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Meh ... :shrugs shoulders:,"At last it arrives ... the film linking the glory of the original Star Wars saga with the mediocrity of the new series.I am relieved it is finally over. It has been too painful to watch, but I felt I needed to get to the end.I suppose this isn't that bad of a film. I was 12 years old when the original Star Wars was released, perhaps today's twelve-year-olds will look upon this with the fondness I have of the tale of Luke, Leia, Han, and the Big Walking Carpet. I suspect they will, because in the nearly thirty years since the original release, this film series hasn't matured, hasn't grown, hasn't met the contemporary standards of quality film-making.Movies themselves have changed since 1977. Good filmmakers have built upon the ground-breaking work of filmmakers that have come before them. Spielberg built upon Kurosawa. Tarentino built upon Scorsese. Ridley Scott built upon John Ford. Everyone learns from those who came before, and therefore make better films.Not George Lucas.George Lucas has only looked upon himself. He wrapped himself in a world of his own creation, a world of profits, merchandising, and lavish praises from those seeking to capitalize on his earlier success. Yes, he made great advances in the field of special effects, but has lost all the soul, all the passion, all the emotion of good storytelling. He has not learned from those directors past, and is not paying attention to those great directors of today. If, for example, Lucas studied Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, he would have learned how to infuse a majestic, awe-inspiring, effects-laden magnum opus with heart, and love, and loss, and pain, and success, and failure. But Lucas did not, and therefore Star Wars languished in several reels of mediocrity.Visually, this film is too busy. Too much going on, too many effects, too much action, too much noise blocking the focus on the heart of the story. The performances are too wooden and so poorly filmed the tension and doubt are washed out. The story is so convoluted and contrived it's hard to see the political allegory that should be intended.Such a waste. Such a waste of icons of popular culture. It could have been so much more in the hands of a talented director.I give this film 7 out of 10, really out of the kindness of my heart more than on the merits. I grew up on the original series of films, even tolerating the Ewoks because of the message of redemption in Return of the Jedi. Sadly this film has no redemption, but I lend it some anyway.Barky",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Episode III is a cinematic masterpiece!!!,"I don't usually write reviews for movies and I don't like the insults that I've seen on previous forums. But when I have just seen a movie that I can't stop talking about and more than that has made me cry every time I have gone to see it then this kind of film deserves a review. My Dad took me to go see Star Wars: A new Hope when it was re-released in the early 80's and then me and him went and saw Return of the Jedi twice. I have been a fan of the films ever since. I have probably put more money in Lucas's pocket than I should. In Episode I yes Jar-Jar was annoying but I liked the story and even little Jake Lloyd as Anakin was not a bad choice at all. The critical reaction from fans on Episode I in my opinion is unfair. The same with Attack of the Clones, the romance between Anakin and Padme may seem a bit contrived but it needs to be told and come on seeing Yoda fight with a light saber even if it is a short time. Now on to Episode III which has become my favorite of all the Star Wars movies. I loved Empire but now it has fallen to second place. Revenge of the Sith is a cinematic masterpiece and I loved it. It was one of the most phenomenal experiences of my life. The light saber duels to Anakins dark transformation were wonders to behold. It was chilling, disturbing and overall just very tragic to see the domino effect that was put in place by Palpatine. Hayden stepped it up from Attack of the Clones. His portrayal of a tormented Anakin Skywalker was off of the charts. Also, unbelievable connections were made to Episode IV and the other movies. I don't care what box office this movie makes. Even if you are not a Star Wars fan go and see it. I saw it at midnight on the 18th and saw it two more times after that. Please go and see this film. It is well worth the price of admission.

It's still fun and tells a great story. It also has a good range of emotion, along with some amazing symbolism (which of course is a staple of the films). I feel a lot of people were too hard on Lucas at the time. I can understand where a lot of people were coming from though. I myself was not even a fan of some of his decisions at the time.

The resolve has never been stronger,"While it is not perfect, it is much better than any of the other Prequels. It has very good effects and fight scenes. The acting is much more subtle and good overall. The obvious standouts are Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi and Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine, but Hayden Christensen's Anakin also improved a lot. The story is excellent, with all of Palpatine's schemes and Anakin's conflict between the Light and the Dark. And the endgame with the two astounding lightsaber duels is just masterful.Overall it is a very good movie, one of the best in the franchise and luckily the Prequel Trilogy ends on a (very) high note and it restores the Balance in the Force.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This wins the golden toilet award for true awfulness.,"(Contains mild spoilers) I have seen many dreadful movies in my time, but this is the first one that left me laughing as I walked out of the cinema. Bearing in mind that this movie depicts the horrific deaths of many innocent people, (including children) that's saying something. So what's wrong with this movie ? Answer : Mainly, the acting. Watch this movie, dear reader, and prepare yourself for some of the worst performances ever to hit the silver screen.The Emperor wins the worst actor award hands down- watch, as Ian McDairmid gives the worst performance of his career. It is not an exaggeration to say that his acting almost reaches an almost pantomime level of quality (not to mention his hilarious facial expressions); he was something to be laughed at, not feared or hated. As for Hayden Christensen (playing Darth Vader)...he tries so desperately hard to appear ""evil"" and ""menacing"", but makes a complete mess of it. He's more like a junior version of George Bush than Darth Vader (complete with ""you're with me or against me"" speech to match). To Christensen's credit, having one of the worst scripts ever written didn't help him either. The rest of the cast was so-so; Ewan McGregor (Obi-wan) was less than impressive, as was Natalie Portman (Padame). Samuel L. Jackson's performance wasn't bad, though.The story was another 99% special-effects, 1% plot extravaganza just like the ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" before it.So that's the end. Star Wars is dead.It died with neither a bang nor a whimper, but with peals of laugher.1/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good Technology, but Character Development Doesn't Hold Up","I would give examples, but I don't believe in putting spoilers in reviews, so don't look for them here. This review gives only my personal impressions of what I saw on the screen.The visual effects of this movie are spectacular. The use of CGI was awesome. The technology has advanced rapidly from where is was just a few short years ago. The musical score was very good. The acting was great in some places and weak in others. The story line? That's another matter.The basic idea of showing how a man falls from grace into evil is a good one. Certainly we all wanted to know how Darth Vader came to be after we watched Episode IV, ""A New Hope."" And after a fashion, George Lucas has delivered the answer.But the answer isn't logical. The story breaks down. The reason for Anakin Skywalker's turn to the Dark Side just doesn't hold up. I've watched the movie several times now; I've even gone back and re-watched Episode II: Attack of the Clones to try to put the current movie into context, and I still come away with the same feeling. The character development of Anakin isn't believable - not even when I factor in his youth, his love for Padme, his raging hormones, his inexperience in dealing with his emotions, and the manipulation of the Emperor.The young often think they know everything better than those who are older and have more experience, and they make some big mistakes as a result. Sometimes tragic ones. But I don't personally know of, nor have I ever heard of or read of, a case where an individual was so easily driven to such a pure and all consuming hate as was Anakin Skywalker. Over time, it is conceivable a person could fall that far, but not after only a few sentences of conversation with the one person he had sworn to rid the galaxy of. I might have rated this film 2 or 3 stars higher, but for this failure.All of that said, the film is full of action, and some of the best sword-fight scenes ever put on film. In fact, there is so much high drama and fast action that it is difficult to now go back and watch the original movies with their light hearted approach to life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dignified end,"'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith'. Anakin's inner conflict comes to a head and becomes more and more extreme. The path to the dark side of the force seems to be paved.There is no lack of grandiose battles in this movie. The initial space battle alone is outstandingly realized, has not been seen to this extent in previous Star Wars movies and does not have to hide from its successors.Finally, Yoda himself twitches his lightsaber again before he goes into exile and disappears from the scene for the time being.And last but not least, the epic final battle on the volcanic planet Mustafar. During this battle, the previous events replay before the inner eye, how it could come to this situation at all.It also resonates with this pervasive tragedy. Anakin has chosen the dark path to help the person he loves the most. In the end, paradoxically, he himself is to blame for all the suffering he wanted to avoid. As expected, the mood is much darker than in the two predecessors.Episode III is a brilliant and successful end to the trilogy. You've taken part in Anakin's development and you've learned the background of why things happened the way they did. This part manages both to create a suitable transition to episode 4, as well as to lead the events from the previous two episodes to a coherent end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not brilliant but better than I expected,I am not a big fan of the star wars saga. I did really enjoy the classic films where there was a great storyline and brilliant action packed sequences but have found frustration watching George Lucas completely destroying it. In the other 2 prequels the films heavily depended on CGI and we're of poor quality yet in this film you can see some of the great moments we saw in the old star wars. The film takes place 3 years from where the {fifth or second its your choice} left off. The clone wars are ending and it is the time where Anikan faces a big choice in his life about who he should trust and who he wants to become. This film basically ties up all the loose ends. Hayden Christenson has improved a great deal since attack of the clones and another great performance by Ewan McGregor help this film end the great saga with dignity. I was going to rate this film a bit lower because everyone expects Star Wars to be a brilliant movie because of its predecessors but the film should be marked on its own merits.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Entertaining End to the Trilogy,"Revenge of the Sith's flaws stem from the previous 2 movies of its trilogy, combined with the Clone Wars show however, this film has a perfect setup and is much better. With occasional bad dialogue and some action scenes that drag on a bit, this movie is still very sad and has some of the best moments of Star Wars ever put to screen.

A spectacular action packed and emotional achievement. The best Star Wars film ever. ***** out of 5,"I actually camped out 20 hours in front of the AMC theater in Chicago before seeing this. It was a once in a lifetime experience and one that I will never forget. Being with my Star Wars fan friends and playing Star Wars Trivial Pursuit with them is a lasting memory.I will whole heartedly and unashamedly admit I'm a huge fan of the prequels. I believe a lot of the bashing they have received is totally undeserved and the only reason they get slammed so hard is because they were made twenty years later and with more sophisticated special effects. When you get down to it that's the only reason because these are true Star Wars films but with very different stories. They aren't about a pirate, a young Jedi and princess being pursued and hunted down by the Empire. These films are about how the Empire came to be. They are political and more complex by their very nature.With that bit of a rant towards supposed 'fans' that hate the prequels, let me carry on with my review of the film.I have long said 'Empire Strikes Back' is the best Star Wars film. The reason being because it was the darkest and most sinister of the films.Well, 'Revenge of the Sith' is about ten times as tragic and sinister. The only reason I could say 'Empire' is my favorite at this point is because of the addition of my personal favorite character in the Star Wars Galaxy, 'Boba Fett'.However much I love Boba though, I must say 'Revenge' is without a doubt my absolute favorite. I knew the film would be dark, but I never imagined it would actually become unsettling. The Chancellor's transformation into the cackling hag Emperor was enough to give one nightmares. It's downright demonic.And the slaying of younglings... wow.John Williams score of course accompanies all these memorable scenes and boy does the score swell with emotions. There are moments in the score unlike anything you've heard in a Star Wars film. Such as the conversation between Anakin and Palpatine in the theater there is low monotone choral work here. Then there's Padme's Ruminations where it becomes somewhat depressing sounding. And who could forget the Battle of the Heroes as Anakin and Obi-Wan duke it out? And perhaps my favorite moment is when Vader finally dons the helmet and Padme gives birth. The choral music that we first heard during Qui-Gon's funeral appears here and brings the audience to tears. I had thought the transformation would have everyone raising a fist in the air exclaiming 'yes'!, but instead we feel the tragedy at hand and when Vader breaks down once he finds out Padme is gone, it becomes one of the most heart wrenching scenes in all of Star Wars. Well done!General Grievous may perhaps be my second favorite character now. He's truly awesome. And the battle between droids and wookies in unbelievable!I felt that the acting and dialog was especially good in this film. Lots of memorable lines here.It's a perfect film and it leads right up to 'A New Hope' quite well. I couldn't have asked for a better film.May the Force Be With You!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I was looking at all the star wars ratings and its so sad to see how this movie was review bombed when it came out,"This is an amazing movie to say the least. It has good pacing, great fight scenes, a brilliant climax, an emotional ending. What more do you want from a film? Now I don't actually think this is a 10/10 film, maybe an 9.7-9.8 but you can't do decimals. But the fact that films such as, a new hope, a movie which I did enjoy but its much slower paced but a great introduction to star wars. The force awakens, which i think is an extremely overhated film, both of these have higher ratings when compared to this masterpiece. I think the star wars community needs to come together and get this film up to an 8 at the minimum. This is the film I grew up watching. This is and emotional, immersive masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Kind of like Star Wars, but too much","The Clone War approaches its end as Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi close in on Count Dooku and his nefarious sith master. Meanwhile, back at Coruscant, the political landscape is about to change as people elect to give more and more power to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. And in the midst of all this the Jedi Order must plot its course.Episode III was always going to be a huge movie. This was the turning point in the story, the beginning of the Galactic Empire, the foundation for the original trilogy. The first two films in the prequel trilogy had shown us a galaxy so vastly different from the one we'd seen before that we knew something massive was about to happen. And the movie doesn't disappoint. The story has been slowly building during the course of two movies and now we finally get to see the Emperor rise into power, the birth of Darth Vader, all that good stuff.Unfortunately we still have to deal with the unconvincing romance between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padmé (Natalie Portman). They are better than they were in the first film, having some genuinely good moments and some actual chemistry, but most of their scenes are still easily the weakest in the whole film. The movie is also in quite a hurry, having to cover a lot of ground in relatively short amount of time. Which makes certain scenes, some huge, important ones even, seem extremely rushed and almost glanced over.But, there's also a lot of good stuff. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid are still absolutely fantastic as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Palpatine, respectively. Samuel L. Jackson also gets a few good scenes in this one. The special effects are great, the movie has some of the best fights in the whole trilogy and as a whole the film seems to be a lot more polished than its predecessor. And when it needs to be huge, it does that very well. In certain scenes perhaps a bit too well, even, seeing as the final fight is absolutely ridiculous and over the top. I know that a lot of people like it, but for me it was a bit too much.Nevertheless, a good film, though a flawed one. For me the best film in the prequel trilogy is still the first one, seeing as it captured the spirit of the originals the best, but this one is a good film to carry you over to the originals in terms of story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is the best movie of the new Star Wars,"With my vote of 6 out of 10, it gets the highest vote to the newest Star Wars movies. The graphics were nice, the story was good, however when it comes to script writing, George Lucas couldn't write his way out of a paper bag. Absolutely terrible script writing. When comparing this to the original 3 Star Wars, this movie makes a mockery of what Lucas had created and wanted us to experience. This movie had potential to be one of the best Star Wars, but with a script that bad, it is hard to get past that fact.Another problem is that when the movie was over, you knew that all the loose ends were tied up, which is good. However, it was done in such a short span of time that you just felt exhausted after the whole thing. What with pretty much non-stop action, as well as trying to wrap up the saga of the story, it was just too overwhelming for me.It was a good end to the series, but it was done poorly.

Another Star Wars hit.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones, which I both liked very much, it's now the turn for episode III Revenge Of The Sith. Again I thought the story was more than okay, very enjoyable, so again no complaint from me here. By watching the saga in chronological order you get some surprises earlier than in order by release date but that doesn't bug me at all. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. Some CGI's are better than others, but it's not really an issue as the futuristic landscapes and sceneries make up for it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the third movie of eleven in barely 24 hours for me, tonight I'll watch Solo in the hope the quality stays the same.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing & Spectacular!,"As a fan of the old Star Wars Trilogy and one of those not too shattered by how glamor was given higher priority to quality in 1999's Episode I and 2002's Episode 2, I somewhat hoped Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith would be better than those. And I must say, it helped to be hopeful :-) The fact that this movie had to be a mere filler between the romance ruined Attack of the Clones and Star Wars IV: A New Hope (1976) probably helped a good deal. I'm also certain George Lucas finally heard the pleas of Star Wars fans not to wither away from the class that the original trilogy had, and how glamor and romance were not as important as the concept of ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away..."" Indeed, Star Wars III delivered very well. Good special effects, continuity (another lacking factor in episodes I & II), better acting, better makeup, less annoying characters (Jar-Jar, thank you for not speaking), and much better and maturer acting by Hayden Christiansen & Natalie Portman somehow managed to keep viewers attentive about the movie from the beginning to the end. From how Anakin was a hero of a Jedi to what drove him to the dark side - was illustrated exceptionally well. His transformation into the sith Lord Vader was the highlight of the movie, as was the final fight scene between Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi. Ewon McGregor played a role much older to himself but did a superb job as the Jedi Master. Samuel L. Jackson filled in well as Mace Windu, as did the animated and automated Yoda, R2D2 and C3PO (a little annoying but he was ""helpless""). It has always been a delight to see Yoda preach and fight. The introduction of Chewbacca and Plo-Koon the wookies was also well done. They could have added Hans Solo's introduction as well (he was a young pilot then according to the book X-Wing), but glad they did not as an actor would have to be as sarcastic and carefree as Harrison Ford from the old trilogy.Finally, the introduction of the black robe asthma-struck tyrant Darth Vader was dark and cold, appropriate and well timed.Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith was obviously the best of the new trilogy, and almost at class with the old ones.

A flawed masterpiece,"Many have been rather unkind to George Lucas's prequel trilogy to Star Wars over the years. This film is proof even as late as 2005, that he could still muster up something great. Anakin portrayed by Hayden Christensen, while somewhat wooden, can still deliver a performance of a fallen Jedi. The story is far more fleshed out than either episodes I and II. It seems as though there was much more of a story to tell this time. Unfortunately, Episodes I and II have overshadowed Episode III, leaving many to regard this film to be just as disappointing as those were. Recommended for those who truly love Star Wars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the new trilogy but still flawed,"At long last we have the third and final part of the new Star Wars trilogy  Revenge of the Sith. Critics have widely cited this to the best of the three parts, and I couldn't wait to see if it matched up to the original films and managed to improve over the decidedly average Episode II.In short, this film is a substantial improvement over Episode II both on a technical and pure entertainment level. The computer graphics are the most detailed of all the films, and Lucas has finally toned them down slightly, which gives this film a tad more realism that the previous two. The plot too holds together much better than previous offerings. Many people poked Episode II for its poor acting, and in this respect Episode III jumps over both these two films and possibly even the original Star Wars for quality acting. Hayden Christiansen finally feels right as Anakin and gives a stunning performance, proving that he wasn't just included for eye-candy. Add this to the list of excellent supporting actors including Natalie Portman, Euan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid, and there are no problems at all on this front.Lucas creates an emotional epic and the character development is such that the audience really feels empathy with the good, and some of the bad, characters in the film. The whole film is fully coherent, refreshing after the previous two outings, and enjoyable to watch. Arguably the most impressive aspect of this film is that it ties in so well in terms of semiotics with Return of the Jedi. Everyone knows that this is the film in which Vader emerges, and Lucas includes tens of hidden references to the final film in which Vader is converted back to good.Unfortunately there are still some serious flaws. The two biggest of these are Lucas's continued inability to use computer graphics appropriately with style and his decidedly dodgy script. Whole sequences are still computer-generated, used instead of real-life scenarios far too often. While the film is a massive improvement over Episode II, it feels unreal  it lacks the realism of the original trilogy. The graphics also feel out of place; they are far more detailed than either Episode I or II due to moving technology and already makes Episode I's graphics especially feel very out-of-date. However when juxtaposed next to the original trilogy the graphics don't appear to fit in with this either, especially in terms of the technical regression and changes in type of shot that appears to have occurred in the 25 years or so between the films. This film will suffer from the same fate as the other two; the graphics make it perishable and not timeless.Poor old Lucas doesn't give a good first impression with the script. The rolling screen text is absurd and poorly written, magicing a new major character out of no-where. Shortly into the film the characters stop and recite some cheesy lines, almost like a spoof, before the film continues. Frequently, the actors appear have problems trying to recite sections of ill thought-out dialogue with conviction. Several black-penned scenes leave you wondering what the hell they were for.Overall this film should be seen as a final ending to Star Wars. It's above the previous two films, however is still too flawed to make it a timeless great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Obviously the best of the prequels.,"Rewatching all the prequels as part of a Star Wars marathon (Eps 1 to 8) has been interesting. I still find Attack of the Clones a bit of a drag, even if it does work as solid set-up for Revenge of the Sith. The Phantom Menace is a mess, but parts of it were much better than I ever gave them credit for. Revenge of the Sith I've always liked, but I also think it's one that's better than I might've given it credit for some years ago.Essentially, it's the prequel where things happen. It probably gives people what they wanted to see out of a trilogy of movies that takes place before the original trilogy, even if part of me wonders whether this could've just been a duology; editing out the less exciting and more repetitive parts of Episodes I and II would result in many cut scenes, I feel.Actually, I think what weighs down each prequel to some extent is the pacing. Episode I is a drag for about 25 minutes before the final act, the entire second act and change in Attack of the Clones does nothing for me, and after the first 20 minutes of Revenge of the Sith, I feel like it's pretty slow-going for the next 20-ish minutes. But then things kick into hyper-drive and the final 90-ish minutes are a blast. It's Star Wars at its most soap opera-esque, and I think it largely works.The effects hold up, the action's fun, the acting feels improved from the last two movies (maybe the actors were just having a better time, or had scenes with clearer emotions to work with), and it concludes a flawed trilogy very well. It leads into the original Star Wars very neatly, but I don't know - it kind of works. It's striking how much better than the previous two movies it is, but at least there's one prequel that feels like it can pretty much be talked about in the same breath as the originals... I don't think it's as great, but it's not drastically far off or galaxies away; nothing like that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It could have been better..,"First of all, I'm not a big fan of the star wars saga. But I do watch all of the movies. What I say about Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith ? It's not a bad movie, it was good enough. I mean it did give us the revelation of our big curiosity about what had happened to Anakin, that could turned him into such evil. However, it doesn't give me a thrill when I found out what really happened.. I sort of think, that the reason wasn't quite dramatic as I would expected. There's nothing new, I've seen that similar reason in many movies I've seen. But hey... it's an old plot, it was developed in ... the 80s (is it... ?), that kind of plot might have been a new idea back then, but now... it's a common plot for me... Not that it was a bad plot, I just.. expecting something more, like when I was first impressed by the twisted ending on Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"", it was a quite uncommon plot back then.

George Lucas has failed to deliver the excitement and enjoyment craved by millions.,"I saw this when it was out at the cinema, and despite some poor acting, cheesy dialogue and the over-use of CG, I quite enjoyed it. I'm a fan of the original films and it was interesting to see how Lucas had written himself out of a sticky situation! However, having watched it again on DVD a few nights ago, I have to say that I found the film to be very disappointing.All my original gripes concerning the poor acting and dialogue and some ropey effects seemed to multiply themselves on second viewing. There's no way this film deserves its place in the IMDb top 250. I think people have been too keen to believe Lucas has redeemed himself; hence the high score. I won't go into detail but one or two of the things that annoyed me were as follows:The pacing was all wrong. From start to finish there was never any real sense of tension or excitement. It all felt very much like an exercise in getting from point A to point B and including as many references from the original films as possible. There didn't seem to be a natural flow or structure from a directional standpoint. Secondly, as I've already mentioned, the acting and dialogue just didn't inspire any kind of emotional connection to the characters. McGregor's delivery in particular ruins Obi Wan. Having said that, it is still a better performance than given in the other two prequels. The film consequently feels flat and lifeless.This in turn isn't helped by the effects, which also feel lifeless. At no point did I feel truly immersed in the Star Wars universe, which was one of the factors that made me love the original trilogy so much. CG was used really inappropriately. There are times when entire rooms, which would have looked so much better if they were built for real in a studio, are created in CG. What's the point when it looks so sterile and obviously artificial? The same with a number of characters. Again, when CG stormtroopers look so obviously artificial, what is the point? Lord of the Rings has shown how to integrate real life actors with agents created on Massive to huge visual success. I can't think why Lucas is so reliant on just CG. Has his past experience taught him nothing? Peter Jackson again had the right idea with LOTR; If you can create something for real (via men in suits, props, studio recreations and miniatures) then it will look a hell of a lot better for it.It saddens me to say that with all of the prequels, George Lucas has failed to create the excitement and enjoyment I craved when these films were first announced.Episode III is probably the best of the prequels but that does not warrant the prestige a place in the IMDb top 250 would imply. It is filled with disappointment and will be looked back on as a missed opportunity, or worse, an opportunity that should never have been taken.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Better than the other two at least,"I heard that this film was better than the other two (I, II). That is true, but after ten minutes or so I had the urge to leave the theatre. It starts out with utterly useless sitcom scenes with R2D2 which were hardly funny and really made me feel that the R2D2 from the original films (IV, V, VI) is some kind of an obsolete cousin of Revenge's R2D2. I am mentioning this due to the fact that it really feels like technology in IV-V-VI has taken an IMMENSE step back from I-II-III.The film itself is nicer than Episodes I and II because you start to get the gloomy feel of the Empire and the dark side. Still, Anakin's internal conflict is unconvincing to say the least and the scene where he pledges allegiance to Palpatine and gets a new name is probably the most pitiful in the whole film. Anakin, the pivotal character, is simply... bad. At no point was I willing to believe that he was led by either anger or passion or anything else.Lots of fireworks and little content. I don't know.

Yes I have cringed at times with wooden dialect but if I were to have watched the first 3 (IV,V and VI) films for the first time today I would probably be doing the same and also laughing at the SFX.ROTS gave us the finalisation of the story that was to become in a New Hope. At the end of the day we all knew what was to happen but I still wanted to see all the details of how annakin becomes Darth Vader.A lot of complaints have been made about Hayden Christensen playing Anakin that he wasn't strong enough for the part. I thought he did a great job of turning Head strong Teen Padoin to Confused and insecure Adult to Vader. I think People have preconceptions on how this character should have been and therefore disliked how the character was portrayed by Lucas.This film did add more emotion to the characters than the previous 2 and Obi won becomes more jovial than his early serious and unemotional character in TPM.I found there to be a few to many tie ins from the all the prequels to the Early star wars films. E.g the droids, Chewbacka, and even the asteroid where Han parked the millennium falcon in ESB. This is supposed to be a vast and huge universe. These were all the things trying to pander to the old fans but they were some of the things that left the movies a bit cold, which in my eye was the only flaws with the films. All these flaws were not to do with the actual films but because of my love of the old films and the ideas i had built up in my head of what i wanted from the prequels.The first star wars film a new hope had around 2/3rds of the Original scenes and dialect removed because it was so bad and it was replaced by more special effects and action sequences. I think if you took the dialect from the original movie then you would probably have about 10 pages worth, which kind of makes you think.The next point i would like to make is about the politics involved within the film, corrupt government and dictatorship that is said to resemble Bush although I believe that it resembles Hitler more so than Bush. All this may be tiresome to some people who just want action between good versus bad. Things just Arne't that simple as we learnt at the very end of ROTJ. For the younger viewers all this will be fresh and new and will probably scope a new generation of Star Wars fans who will think more deeply about who they vote for in the elections. The Old generation still holding onto the hope that there Jedi powers will kick in any minute so they can right the wrongs of the world.... Daydreamers.Overall I enjoyed the film, Acting 5/10 OK, so they don't have much to work on so we can forgive them. Story 8/10 its a much better story than the previous prequels. having said that this story is easier to tell. SFX 10/10 flawless and not as detached as the previous 2 films Overall i give it a 7/10 It was never as good as the first one a New Hope but then again neither was riding a roller-coaster for the second time or getting drunk for the second time or hearing certain records for the second time. We all love that time in 1977 when we first heard the music when we first saw Vader and the light sabre or even the fact that you were seeing space ships in space firing lasers at each other. Moments like that can never be redone to give you that intense feeling that something wonderful is going to happen.Until that next memorable moment in your life comes along appreciate what we have now.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A more extreme and less consistent Return of the Jedi,"Future directors, let Episode III be a lesson to you. If you do everything else right, but fail to make your audience connect to the characters, you'll never have more than a mediocre movie.Compared to I and II, Episode III has a much tighter plot. The editing was also very solid. I didn't leave the theater with the feeling that Lucas could have cut half the scenes and had a better movie. In fact, I believe that Episode III is on par with the original trilogy here. Bravo.World design was excellent, although Lucas continues to indulge in making absolutely everything a proto-version of something in the original trilogy. The effect is nice at first, but Lucas overdoes it to the point of disbelief, perhaps even desperation. Like Van Helsing's monster-rama, but more so.Special effects continue to be technically superb. However, Lucas's brand of special effects suffers from a cartoonish feel. You look at a scene, and your first impression is that it is just a picture, not something real. A human touch, a bit of empathy, is needed to get the viewer to suspend disbelief.Which brings us to Episode III's major flaw. The characters are even more extreme caricatures than before, yet still lack well, character. Hissing a lot or adopting a really bad vampire accent just doesn't make you scary, any more than looking stuck-up every time democracy is mentioned makes you a hero. Sorry. Lucas attempts to build a bridge by having people wear costumes from the original trilogy, but that only makes the gaps in charisma and presence even more glaring.The dialog also continues to suffer. Although better than I and II, you still find yourself wincing during more than one conversation. In addition, Lucas's new-found love of exposition is still alive and kicking. When the entire scene is screaming that X is happening, your characters do not have to comment that X is happening. X is blatantly obvious. The dialog should focus on the characters reaction to X.But overall, the result is adequate. If you are looking for a summer movie to while away some time, Episode III is worth watching. If you are looking for a classic, then this is not the movie you are looking for. Move along.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A Galaxy Far, Far Away...","I'm not quite sure how this film is being rated well. What is wrong with this film? Well, setting the Star Wars fan in me aside, this movie is just awful. The acting is completely horrible, and nobody in the cast is spared from that comment. The script is along the lines of Episodes 1 & 2, which is a long way of saying tremendously bad. Oh, I wish Lucas had brought in a screenwriter, someone like Kasdan (for those of you who are fans of the new trilogy, Lawrence Kasdan wrote Empire Strikes Back and ROTJ) who actually can write a screenplay.The hopes of a good lightsaber battle and my love of the Star Wars universe are all that kept me from walking out on this movie. As it turns out, even the things I was hoping for, when they were finally shown, were terribly done. The climactic lightsaber battle is done poorly, the camera often staying too tight on the faces of the participants. All you see is a lightsaber flashing across the screen like a glowrod. At many times in the film I found myself asking ""is this real?"" Episode III's dialogue was so bad I had to make sure I wasn't dreaming. This and the previous two episodes have failed the Star Wars franchise, and it is time for Star Wars fans who are hanging on to the idea that no Star Wars film can be bad to let their real feelings out. This was a terrible film, and should be admitted by Star Wars fans as such. If only the DGA had allowed Spielberg to direct this one!

A clash between memes and a touching tragedy,"Whether you're in for it because of the memes, lightsaber duels, the drama or the soundtrack this movie certainly has a lot to offer.

Even if your friends don't care about Star Wars that much they can still find something to appreciate about it and then like it for some different reasons than you.A quick rundown of the strengths and weaknesses of the movieStrengths-Visuals and the overall look of the movie. All the costumes and sets make the created world seem believable and real.-Heartbreaking character Anakin Skywalker. You may not agree with his actions in the movie but you still feel sad for him in the end.-Original score by John Williams. His music adds those beats and emotions to every scene to make them that much better.Weaknesses-editing and the pacing of the movie. There are times when you feel like you get pulled out of an interesting scene for a moment to watch something else. (This happens for example in the scene where Obi-Wan Kenobi is hunting down General Grievous)-The dialogue between the characters. It feels wonky and too pretentious very often. On the other hand this kind of dialogue has led to the creation of some great memes so it can also be considered a strength of the movie.SummaryRevenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie.

Lucas Had a Hard Task Set Out for Himself,"There has always been a fundamental difficulty for the three Star Wars prequel episodes: most fans know how it ends. The challenge with any prequel is to provide enough additional material and a strongly independent story line if one hopes to do more than create an extended prologue. Alas, even in the culmination of this second trilogy, Revenge of the Sith, we have precisely that: an extended prologue. The movie ends with precisely the things in place which which most fans are expecting to be in place, and no more: no little twists, no extra steps we don't know about, no treating this story on its own terms. The movie exists to establish the universe of the second (earlier-produced) trilogy.That said, Revenge of the Sith is a fun flick. The story moves along at a fast clip, and the extended action sequences are dramatically staged. Parallel story lines are well-interwoven, and the central, conflicting question of, ""What is Evil?"" is left in plain sight, so the viewer is never left to wonder what the point of the movie is. Episode III is enjoyable for some of the same reasons that ep's IV -- VI were: funky-looking aliens, a few cheesy emotional moments, sweeping action, in-your-face political drama, and the undeniable attraction of a complicated galactic setting.Ultimately, what detracts from Revenge of the Sith are not short-comings of story-telling or adventure, or even continuity glitches or questions about verisimilitude (a droid with a nagging cough?), but problems with the basic art of movie-making that simply should not be the case for a high-budget film of this sort. Ian McDiarmid's delightfully melodramatic and theatrical performance was the sole stand-out acting performance. Natalie Portman read flat, Ewan McGregor was overly casual, and Samuel L. Jackson epitomized phoning it in. Worse yet, the computer graphics continue to be the weakest point of Lucas' recent work. The rendered universe is too smooth and shiny, and ironically mechanical objects move too organically while living beings move like jelly.All in all is the movie worth seeing in the theater? Definitely if you're a Star Wars fan, only possibly if you're not. While it will make a fortune and will certainly reclaim dignity for this trilogy among many fans, it's not likely to win-over hard core IV--VI fans and it's not enough to cross-over to a lot of general audience or sci-fi fans who haven't had a particular taste for the Star Wars story-verse.Important Note: Parents, take the PG-13 rating seriously. This is a dark movie with a couple of truly brutal scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Did Lucas' children write and direct this movie?,"This movie had so much going for it, and in the end it didn't live up to any of my expectations. I disliked the dialog in the first two films in the new trilogy, but the dialog in this film is ten times worse. The acting is so emotionless across the board that I have to give R2 the best performance nod. It is hard to make all these great actors look like they are half awake. The worst part is however the plot. Padme was once a strong independent senator that made incredibly intelligent decisions. In this firm, she acts as if she has the IQ of a beach ball. Same thing can be said about Anakin. All the flying must have gotten to him in the end... People can love each other so much that they do horrible things, but the scenario in the firm is just not believable especially considering what is at stake. I might as well have read a short story on this and that would have provoked more emotion out of me. Shame on you Lucas.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Worth the two year wait.,"Attack of the Clones wasn't much of a movie, but it was enough to provoke my two year hype for this one. That's the second longest I've waited for a film's release (after Avatar). Well Episode III proved not only to be worth the wait, but in some ways it is the best entry in Star Wars.It is certainly the most important chapter. It is here, during the middle of the clone wars that Anakin becomes Vader. The first half of the movie reminds me a bit of Titanic. James Cameron dedicated a fair amount of time to reveal how majestic, strong and epic the ship was, and we the audience are meant to wonder just how is it possible that she is gonna sink in an hour and a half (movie time). In a similar manner, we see during the first act of Revenge of the Sith, that Anakyn has become a legitimate Jedi, loyal to the council, and far less egotistical than in Episode II. Just how could he possibly end up becoming cinema's most famous villain?Hayden Christianson, who was awful in Episode II, has managed to get into character this time, and is far more convincing. We the audience actually believe that he is tormented, whereas in Episode II he would just say aloud 'I'm tormented' and we are supposed to understand. The performance that drives this movie however, is Ian McDirmod as Emperor Palpatine (formerly Chanselor). He didn't have a whole lot to do in any of the other movies.From the beginning, Revenge of the Sith is engaging. It wastes no time on the kind of boring exposition that bogged down Episode II. Then again there is really no need. That is what the opening crawl is for.Episode III completed the saga, but these six movies will survive till the end of humanity practically. It kinda makes you wonder what George Lucas plans to do with the rest of his life.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The prequel that justified the trilogy.,"Revenge of the Sith is probably my third favourite Star Wars film, behind the obvious two. It is absolutely flawed, but I think it comes the closest to its full potential. From the very start of the film it's obvious that the quality is going to be better, with a fantastic opening shot leading into a visual effect spectacle that looks fantastic to this day. The film is such a technical leap from Attack of the Clones. The scenes have great visual depth that makes this feel like a living, breathing world, (with the exception of a few scenes where actors are clearly composited in giant rooms). The models are lit exceptionally well for 2005, the confidence to show General Grevious so closely was definitely rewarded.On a personal note, this is the first Star Wars film I actually watched in theatres. I didn't really understand half of what was going on (I was 9) but I loved it nonetheless. I still remember standing outside the theatre with the title above the door with the M rating (suitable for 16 years and older). It's probably the first M film I watched in the theatre. And the film needed it. This one is dark. Lucas pulls no punches as the trilogy reaches its inevitable, dramatic conclusion.I do have to admit, I was initially going to rate this higher. After watching The Clone Wars TV show, which fleshes out Anakin's character wonderfully, the events in this film make a lot more sense. Anakin is less of a whiny brat and much more of a tragic hero. His mental state is so much clearer, and his actions are far more logical as a result. It goes to show that sections of that animated show really should have been included in the trilogy - a lot of time was wasted with The Phantom Menace. But I think I do have to rate this as just part of the trilogy; it should stand on its own.I think Revenge of the Sith, more than any other entry in the franchise, encapsulates the 'space opera' tag that is so often associated with Star Wars. I can't think of any other film that shows politics and major events across a galaxy better than this one. And the events themselves are iconic. The second half of this film is blow after blow as we see the repercussions affect more individual planets than any other Star Wars film. The beauty of this impact is that it's all character driven. The more intimate moments have grand consequences.Now the film is still flawed of course. There are echoes of not letting a scene settle every now and then. The film does feel like it's rushing to the finish line a little too much. As I said, I think the first two could have had some of the events from the show and hell even this film, instead of what we got.Palpatine's action scenes were a little bit ridiculous. It definitely needed more wide shots with a stunt double than close ups.The romance dialogue isn't as bad as Attack of the Clones, but it's still problematic. Fortunately they seem to be able to act like human beings half the time in this one. Hayden actually gives a pretty good performance here.It's not just the romance dialogue though, there are some silly lines throughout the film that fans love to meme, and it can take away from the impact a bit. It's almost like watching a stage play at times.Additionally, I do think that one of Anakin's deeds was a bit too sudden still, anyone who's seen the film knows what I'm talking about. Lucas definitely doesn't trust the viewer enough to understand what's going on half the time. Just let the actors emote! Can't use 'Star Wars is for kids' this time George, the film is rated M! I know I watched it as a kid, but still.None of these flaws ruin the film or even take it into mediocrity for me. I do have to bring up the score once again. This is perhaps my favourite John Williams' score for an individual film. It embellishes the drama; the film is shot to accommodate the music more than the previous two films. And the sound design for all three is excellent as well. The creature sounds are all unique and memorable.The film is also shot better, from the opening to the panning down to feet stopping. There's so many memorable visuals.So when I think of the prequels, most of the time it's to do with this film. I don't usually like hating on things, I find it exhausting.The story is genuinely inspired and elevates the original trilogy, as The Clone Wars show elevates this film.I almost wish Lucas kept making live action films, but perhaps with someone else directing and channeling his ideas. Still, I'm happy he made the trilogy. It was like crack for me as a kid, and there's a lot of great material that built off of the world on display here. Rewatching and reassessing these movies has made me open to actually revisiting the sequel trilogy, which is something I didn't think I'd do anytime soon. Those films never reignited the excitement that 9 year old me outside the theatre had for the series, but perhaps knowing what to expect will make me appreciate them more?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Masterpiece,This film is a masterpiece and for me is the best Star Wars movie.Revenge of the Sith contains the best action scenes in the entire franchise and has so many iconic moments. The whole film from start to finish is gripping. George Lucas really captures Anakins tragic fall to the dark side.It completely amazes me how a film from nearly 20 years ago has better CGI than pretty much every film to have come out in the last few years. From the scenes in space to the aliens everything looks so real and holds up so well today.John Williams hits the ball out the park with another truly iconic music score.I know the acting gets alot of hate but i really dont see the issue with it.

This is the SW film that any movie watcher can watch and say 'that wasn't bad'. While I wish we saw more from Portman, McGregor shows a bit more range and the narrative stakes remain high despite those of us who watched the OG trilogy and knew what to expect.Christensen, in later works, shows a great deal more complexity but in the final act of ROTS we see a character who has developed, but perhaps not in the ways we expected. CGI has been a common critique of the prequels, and an argument can be made for the abundance of green screens and over the top special effects, but the story arc leaves you with enough to chew one that it is only a minor distraction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An Epic and Emotionally Charged Conclusion to the Prequel Trilogy,"Revenge of the Sith, directed by George Lucas, is a powerful conclusion to the prequel trilogy, focusing on Anakin Skywalker's tragic fall and his transformation into Darth Vader. The film showcases high-stakes action, intense lightsaber duels, and memorable moments that resonate with the Star Wars saga. It delves into complex themes of power, betrayal, and the blurred lines between good and evil. Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi adds depth and emotion to the character. Revenge of the Sith successfully connects the prequel trilogy, setting the stage for the original trilogy, and reflecting George Lucas's visionary storytelling in the Star Wars universe.

Logically Confusing,"Like so many others, I was looking forward to this film. And considering most aspects, viewers will not be disappointed. The action is relentless. The pace is breathtaking. The betrayals and reversals are heart-wrenching. It is exactly as predicted: the darkest of all 6 Star Wars movies.Lucas has been a stickler for perfection in his movies and in this case, I feel I've been let down. Darth Sidious tells Anakin ""Good and evil are just a point of view."" Then Obi-Wan Kenobi tells Anakin, ""Only a Sith lord deals in absolutes."" Well, Mr. Lucas, which is it? Are Darth Sidious and his apprentice truly relativists, as so many who are evil use relativism to justify themselves? Or are the Sith *absolutely* dealing in absolutes. And here's the true logical contradiction...if ONLY a Sith lord deals in absolutes, and Kenobi said ""only,"" meaning absolutely no one else, isn't that a logical fallacy? It's amazing how one misplaced line can make a terrific movie into something far less than it could be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas Getting all...Philosophical?,"""Well, that's the real trick, isn't it...The ""how"" and the ""who"" are just scenery, prevents 'em from asking the most important question: Why?"" -- Mr. X, ""JFK""To clarify, the Galactic Republic did not fall in a massive conspiracy which would make Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" look like a game of CLUE. But the above paraphrased quote from Stone's 1991 assassination film speaks a truth about what lies at the heart of ""Revenge of the Sith"".Why did Anakin Skywalker do it? Finally, at long last, this question is answered by George Lucas in a meaningful, not-nauseating (though certainly not flawless) way. 'Episode I' was a dose of bitter medicine, with way too much ""scenery"". It seemed like it took 'Episode II' forever to establish some semblance of a point. Finally, now, in Episode III, we get to ""the point"".As a younger fan of Star Wars, my introduction was of course through home video. When Obi-Wan and Yoda would talk in ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" about the self- destructive path down which Skywalker/Darth Vader went, I imagined in my mind that it was a relatively simple story: headstrong young man, impatient, insecure, and greedy for glory, surrendering himself to the easy yet evil methods of acquiring power. Basically, I figured Skywalker was Lucas' Machiavelli.In a sense, as seen in this film, he is. In his mind, the end will justify the means, even as it corrupts his soul and destroys his body. But there are an intriguing number of layers and emotions which go in to the final decision. Lucas is displaying a different sort of film-making ambition, choosing to dissect the riddle, ""What is the nature of 'evil'? How does man distinguish between good and evil?"" And in the various dimensions and answers of this question - Palpatine's shriveled and calculated manipulations of young Skywalker, Anakin's heartfelt but immoral desire to save those he loves, Obi-Wan's conflict of duty and brotherhood - this prequel attains what was critical to the first trilogy and sorely lacking through much of the two most recent films: complexity and development of the characters.I will concede that several scenes, though not all (which in and of itself is a major step forward from the first two prequels), contain dialogue that is, shall we say, definitely NOT the product of razor-sharp intelligence. But then, no Star Wars film was ever meant to be confused with a David Mamet play. Also, let's debunk a myth which seems to have grown with time and say the following: George Lucas was never a brilliant wordsmith. Legendary are the stories of how much Alec Guinness hated the script of the original ""Star Wars"" and supposedly concocted his character's death to escape further speaking of those ""bloody awful lines"" (that's a direct quote). Mark Hamill, in the DVD documentary on the original trilogy, recalled thinking at auditions, ""Who TALKS LIKE THIS?""The original Star Wars trilogy clicked so well because the story reflected genuine personality and depth in its characters. While ""Revenge of the Sith"" does not quite get to the level set by the 1977 original or ""The Empire Strikes Back"", it does a damn good job none-the-less. The film has a distinct, dark, raw intensity as it ties off most of the loose threads and known (though never previously explained) mysteries of the Skywalker saga. As David Ansen of Newsweek noted, the outcome of this jigsaw puzzle has always been known, and as result there is a sense of satisfaction at finally realizing how the pieces all fit together.That return to philosophy in the stars, the ""space opera"" style which inspired him so long ago, results in a film that Lucas and the legions ""Star Wars"" fans can be proud of. You may have noticed in this review that I've yet to mention the spectacular special effects or exciting fight scenes. They are certainly present, but for the first time in the prequel trilogy Lucas has successfully made a film which is about more than stringing the audience along until the next mind-blowing action sequence.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Can't get no satisfaction...,"I saw this movie last night with my seventeen year old son. This is the age I was when I saw the very first Star Wars movie. Interesting full circle. This was an important movie, but I felt somewhat disappointed. It seemed almost as if the movie makers were tired of making the series and just wanted to get it over with. ""Oh, let's just answer their questions, so they can get on with their lives!"" But in all fairness, I'm not sure what I would have been satisfied with. After waiting these many years for all the spaces to be filled in, it couldn't help but be a bit anti-climactic. All in all, it was well presented. But I never felt a thrill. Of course, it is hard to beat the thrill of seeing Luke use the force to fly into the heart of the death star and blast away.

Gerat CGI but not much else.,"The opening sequence is an indicator of just how good a movie this is. Although it is a very good CGI of ships in combat there is no real hart to this film. We are bombarded with the CGI capabilities of ILM, but for me there is no solid story telling, no great acting, no comic relief, and absolutely no chemistry between characters in this movie. All the elements that made the first three films more then just good movies, but something really great are missing.I would say that Yoda and R2-D2 are the best characters in this film. And R2-D2 has no lines at all. Lucas seems to be a very bad screenwriter. The inter-action between human actors in this film is just flat out boring. Really good battle scenes save the movie and the last 45 minuets are good enough to make it better then the last Star Wars movie, but there are no Oscar performances here, only the explanation of why there are three great movies to come. But what is really sad is that the three great movies were already made over 20 years ago.Ewan McGregor delivers a good portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Ian McDiarmid and Samuel L. Jackson deliver good performances as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Mace Windu. However, all of them fall victim to the sub-par screen writing.

Wookie's roaring like Tarzan, Anakin and Padme still exchange awful dialogue like when Anakin says ""You are so beautiful"" Padme replies ""It's only because I'm so in love""And would the Emperor seriously put himself at risk like he did at the beginning?? He put himself in some ridiculous situations during the opening half hour. How did Yoda and the council not discover Padme was pregnant and if they did, didn't anybody ask, or at least wonder who was the Father?? Why does Yoda flee his battle with The Emperor??

The Rise of Fallen Jedi or The Fall of Hope,"Alright guys, let's be real: Anakin isn't just a good Jedi making mistakes. No, he's straight-up competing for ""worst career move in history."" Where Lucas teases us with the ultimate Jedi vs. Sith showdown, we're instead watching a guy who, in between cosmic teenage meltdowns, flips to the dark side like he's swapping out a sweaty t-shirt after the gym. This dude has as much foresight as Jar Jar Binks on LSD, but somehow, that's exactly what keeps you hooked.And that's where I'm taking you, fellow Star Wars fans who grew up with lightsabers in your heads. Lucas gives us an Anakin who goes bad faster than a kid sneaking through a whole box of cookies. You sit there thinking, ""Dude, slow down, you've got the galaxy's future on your shoulders,"" but no, he barrels on, blinded by his fears, his love for Padmé, and the lies of Palpatine, that snake. By the end, Anakin's so deep in the dark side he's making Darth Vader look like a brooding teenager.Let's be clear: when it comes to spectacle, you'll get your money's worth. The action hits you at lightspeed (literally), and between space battles and lightsaber duels, it's like getting hit with visual punches on repeat. It's as if Lucas said, ""Alright folks, let's wrap this up in style. Throw the entire special effects budget in, we're gonna make them cry in their seats."" And it works- the final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is pure, epic gold. I'll lay down my lightsaber for that-much respect.But let's talk about what grinds the gears a bit. Anakin's turn to the dark side happens way too fast for my liking. He goes from good padawan to galactic psychopath in about the time it takes to make a cup of tea, and you're sitting there thinking he could've at least taken a minute to, you know, think. Then there's Grievous... we were expecting a real beast, but he gets handled like an extra on set, barely a bump in the road.Now, John Williams-this guy is the ultimate boss when it comes to cranking up the emotional punch. You want chills? He delivers. Whether it's during the epic battles or those tragic moments, he's dropping musical themes that cling to your soul like super glue. Honestly, without him, half the emotion in this movie would've stayed at home.By the end, when you see Vader in that iconic suit, you can't help but feel like it all comes full circle-the story you've known since childhood is complete. But of course, Lucas and Disney weren't done selling popcorn, so we got 3D re-releases and spin-offs galore. Even so, Revenge of the Sith remains a monumental thrill ride-a visual spectacle marking the end of an era and a farewell to a saga that shaped generations.It was beautiful, George. It was intense. And you took us on one hell of a ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good.. but,"It's a nice film with a good story, exciting action scenes, great visuals, and good acting; a HUGE upgrade from the last two in the prequel series (even Hayden Christensen's done better). But. There's a problem. The movie has too many villains and sub-plots, which makes it harder to follow and in the end we have no clue who is the real bad guy. All that said, it's totally worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
George Lucas redeems himself in spectacular style,"I was lucky enough to go to the cast and crew premiere at the Odeon in Leicester square today. Thanks to Deano who I now owe loads of beers for inviting me along(check out the flight deck of Bail Organas ship, he built it).Without dwelling on the relative disappointment of EP'S 1&2. I went into the cinema convinced that this one would be a winner. I wasn't wrong!!!!.This is my first review here so I'm gonna go totally spoilerless(I hope) ROTS kicks off with the best opening reel of all 6 films. Non stop action and some superb special effects and it really sets the film on it's path. It doesn't slow down either after that, there's light saber battles galore, and all the stuff you'd expect from a Star Wars movie.We all know the outcome of this movie, but the journey there was superbly executed, with Lucas very neatly sewing up the loose ends as he went, some with just a throwaway line, some with a bit more depth.The acting was typical Star Wars. Hayden Christensen did an OK job with the dialogue he had to work with. Ewan McGregor played a older and wiser Obi Wan very well. Natalie Portman didn't feature as heavily as the previous 2 films, and mostly went around looking worried(and very unconvincingly pregnant). Samuel L was Samuel L. Ian McDiarmid was great as Palpatine, just hamming it up slightly at times, but done well, because we all know he's the bad guy.As previously mentioned the script sometimes could have been a bit better, some of the worst lines coming in the Anakin/Padme tender moments, but......hey, you don't go to a Star Wars movies for the script do you? The special effects were awesome, ILM have really done themselves proud with the quality of them. Lucas has learnt by his mistakes and not given special effects centre stage here. They are seamless to the live action and there's so much going on the screen at one times, if there were errors, I never saw them. The attention to detail in the effects was up to Lucas/ILM's marvelous standards As usual the real characters that shine are the ones that aren't real. Yoda was superb(he kicks more butt too), and R2 D2 featured more than the last 2, and let me tell you............that little droid has had his ride pimped some more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. General Greivous was a superb piece of CGI, but only seemed to be in the film so there could be a light sabre fight with it.John Williams was excellent as ever. The score was a bit more understated in places than the previous films, but it was a good thing. There are scenes which in the previous 5 probably would have had music with them, but not in this one, letting the dialogue and the emotions do the job. Always nice to hear ""Duel of the fates"" again too.My only real gripe with the film was the lack of ""wookie time"". They only seemed to be there as a homage to the first 3 films, but they really didn't have anything to do with the plot.Lucas's directing was brisk, not letting the action slow, save for a few moments in the first hour where the plot is laid down. Editing, sound effects were all top notch ROTS is a return to the good ole days of Star Wars. George Lucas has done a brilliant job with this movie, and I hope the gets the credit he deserves for this one. He ties it up so well at the end that you could leave the cinema, go home, and put EP4 in your DVD and just keep watching May the force be with you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favorite out of the prequels,"Full of tragedy, lost hope, and more this movie was spectuclar. This episode actually had writing that was actually very good and above average for once and was pretty consistent. CGI was very impressive considering the time it came out in. The acting I also was impressed with and the sound composition which was well done also. The cheography was good the body movements had some problems though.Overall a pretty enjoyable flim that stayed consistent throghout until it ended.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Maybe...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Satisfying,"A very satisfying conclusion and easily the best of the pre-quels. George Lucas' previous two pre-quels both had their qualities and I actually enjoyed ""Attack of the Clones"" where ""Phantom Menace"" was a snore. ROTS more than makes up for the last two.The film starts out awkwardly with a rescue mission to retrieve the Chancellor Palpatine as he has been taken hostage by General Grievous, the leader of the droid army and Count Dookoo. Much of the opening sequence takes place in an elevator and resembles something out of the movie ""Speed"". Grievous' droids talk like cartoon characters and are'nt very formidable. This part of the movie plods along and seemingly takes forever but after that, the film takes off.We see more and more of Anakin's turn to the dark side and the turning point is when he is turned down the rank of ""master"" by the Jedi council. The council doesn't trust the chancellor and Anakin doesn't trust the council. When the chancellor convinces Anakin to turn against the Jedi all hell breaks loose, topped out with Anakin having horrible nightmares about his secret wife Padme dying during birth. Anakin has trouble controlling his emotions which leads to his descent.The action is very good. Even though Saber fights aren't new, they're still fun. The chase sequences work and I loved seeing the Wookie village. You never know what new thing you'll discover in a Star Wars film. Whether it be the Hoth Planet, Ewoks, Jabba the Hut, Jar Jar's underwater world, or the Cloud City. Although the diologue is still lousy, its an improvement over the last couple films, as is the acting as Hayden Christensen seems to do a little better as he gets to show his chops a bit more and not act like a whiny snot. The real star is Ian McDarmid as the Chancellor. He brings some needed class to the film much like Alec Guiness did.The film succeeds in tying everything up that leads to episode IV. It'll make you want to revisit the original film if you have not already. It's certainly a fun movie and a satisfying end. (***1/2)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I rate it 8.1,"Great story line, nearly makes up for the previous two films, awesome fight scenes, great music by John Williams as usual to go with it, the romance between Anakin and Padmé is finally done RIGHT. Links perfectly with the original trilogy and no Jar Jar Binks!The only con I would say is the dialogue in some scenes, mainly with Obi Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé.Overall a very satisfying Star Wars movie and by far the best of the prequels!I give it a solid 8.1",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great movie, perfect story","Star Wars fans will simply love it! Perfect script, every single detail of movie is very well tailored to the other movies.Lots of action, mistakes from previous movies are corrected (e.g.: Jar Jar Binks never says a word, better Special FX...)Well balanced movie in terms of SFX and the edition, never felt that the movie was boring or too long. The battles were just perfect.The initial scene takes you inside the movie and after that your attention is completely directed to saga.I'm not going to mention details of the movie, you must watch this movie.

Almost Good!,"Well, George Lucas has certainly gone a long ways to undo some of the damage he's done to his rep (and his own movies) with Ep 3. It's not a great film by any means--still present are the long stretches of painful dialogue, reams of paper-thin characters and uneven pacing. But without a doubt, the first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes are the best Star Wars work Lucas has ever done period, better than Empire. The last few scenes in particular are just flat-out amazing. Terrific action, emotionally engaging...everything the last two SHOULD have been. Overall, I would rank it above the last three, but below Empire and the original. It's not the masterpiece many are claiming it is, but it's certainly an entertaining, thoroughly watchable summer popcorn flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Technology is foe!,"I wasn't all that impressed with this final definitive installment linking the prequels to the original Star Wars Trilogy, but I still had fun and that's what really counts. Episode I, II, and III by no means comes even close to the magic of IV, V, and VI. I believe technology is to blame, and way too much of it. Lucas abandoned actual live sets for CGI and left his actors with nothing more than a green screen. No matter how technologically advanced our computers become they can never, that's right I said ""NEVER"", take the place of what is real. It may come close, but life is to precise in its detail to ever be captured completely. The original Star Wars was magic because of the ambition of it's creator and the lack of computer assistance, the greatest things in life will always be found in simplicity. Lucas spent so much time focusing on the computer graphics that he lost the realism needed to touch his audience. I felt incomplete when I left the theater as though the story still wasn't finished, however I still gave this film an 8, heavily influenced by my love for the first three films. If this film stood alone I would give it a 4, and suggest 20th Century Fox to declare a loss. Peter Jackson delivered 100 times better with Return of the King than Lucas and his Sith. I really wanted to love this movie! ):",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wasted opportunity,"Episode 3 is surely the best of the prequels but it really hurts to see how Lucas couldn't get over the wooden & cheesy dialog. He lost too much time in 1 & 2 with uninteresting story lines so he had to put all in 3 to tie up the loose ends.The Star Wars universe is so rich why didn't he manage to weave more of the world of 4-6 into the prequels. The story line is absolutely one-dimensional, and Anakin's switch to the dark side happens so abruptly and unbelievably.Imagine what good writers like Kasdan or the LOTR-Crew Jackson, Walsh and Boyens could have been made out of this story. No, better don't imagine, it really hurts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!","Well done George Lucas. The first movie I ever saw as a child was Star Wars, and after not being very thrilled with Attack of the Clones, this saga has now been put to rest beautifully. I know there are people who comment on the acting being soft at times but thats what its all about. The acting in A New Hope wasn't anything to give awards to either. What ever the acting may be, what about the transformation of this weak young man into an evil lord. This doesn't happen because of power, it happens because of weakness. Brilliant! This movie is a must see for everyone. Even if you are not a big Star Wars fan, the production and effects in this movie are unlike anything you've seen before. The operatic climax was wonderful. Bravo! 10 out of 10!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Highly flawed, but still effective","Do not get the idea that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a perfect movie. There are both issues that Lucas failed to confront from Episodes I and II that, unfortunately, still exist, and there are definitely questions about areas that are introduced in this movie. Nevertheless, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is still by far the best of Lucas' three prequels, and it does set the stage well for what is to come in what became the masterpieces of the saga.Among the problems with ""Sith"" is the still toxic dialogue between Hayden Christenson and Natalie Portman. Lucas still believes a positive exists in Christenson's inability to act, and he exploits it for the second straight time in trying to get him to form an affective relationship with Portman, whose true acting talents are somewhat hidden when she speaks with him. The words and phrases remain corny and disposable, and are easily forgettable. Lucas does have the common sense, fortunately, to add weight to Christenson's lines, so he doesn't remain some over-actor who brings down everybody else while happening to look good using a light saber.While Lucas does do a fine job of explaining how every factor leads to its state in Episode IV, making the transition from modern prequel to 70's sequel easier, there are still questions that a typical viewer would bring into focus. Why does a Jedi win a fight using, for example, the ability to repel or attract large objects from long distances, and yet, seem to abandon and forget this ability while fighting a following opponent? How does Yoda make the transition from saber-bearing warrior (as he also was in Episode II) to, after only 19 or so years, a wise yet feeble, ready-to-die, ancient creature? These are only a few of the ""problems"" I noticed, that Lucas seemed to either ignore or forget to address entirely.Despite its shortcomings, Lucas does what he can with an already-created past and future, and winds up with a respectable and surely enjoyable film. ""Sith"" does well to recover the path of the original three that was lost in the creation of I and II, and it reaches the dark levels required of a plot of its substance. Lucas' creation, most likely his last containing Wookies and droids, is not perfect, but it gets its point across, and with emphasis to spare. May the Force be with you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

All the feelings of a wet handshake,"After the ""first"" two films, I admit I wasn't expecting too much, but the hype had me hoping. Unfortunately, I was right to not expect anything above the others.The two main problems with this film are that, firstly, none of the characters have any sort of life in them. They are such mediocre people with no warmth at all. Even the love scenes are cold and distant. The second problem is the script. It's awful. Some of the lines that the characters say are so corny and cringe-worthy that you can't believe they were written by the same person that wrote the original trilogy.The SFX are, as always, stunning. The fight sequences are well worth watching. Unfortunately neither of these can make up for the rest of this disappointing film.Go to see it, just to complete the series, but don't go in expecting anything as engaging as the originals.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
well...what did you expect?,"Well, after having my hopes dashed for another groundbreaking trilogy by episodes I and II, I really wasn't expecting all that much from III and for once, I wasn't disappointed. I can accept that Lucas made these for ""a new generation"", but I can't help but feel .... an addition of open contempt for the ""old generation"" while watching them. Quite frankly, George Lucas is a lousy director and storyteller.While real actors like Ewan MacGregor and uh....Ewan MacGregor do their best with the material given to them, most of the heavy scenes involve Hayden Christiansen, who is to good acting what a pile of kindling is to good acting. He's terrible. In one or two scenes he brings it up to bad, but for the most part....the stink made my eyes water. I am unfamiliar with the acting of Ian McDiarmid, and after watching his inane scenery chewing performance, i can understand why. Maybe under the supervision of a talented seasoned director the performances could have been salvaged, but Lucas is at the wheel and...nuff said.Sure, there's visual effects galore, and if anything is gonna appeal to the new viewers, it's gonna have to be that. It sure won't be the plot. Once more Lucas proves he's a Tell not Show director and we're treated with exposition laden speeches the likes of which haven't been seen since the opening of Uwe Boll's Alone in the Dark. (Incidentally, I don't know who's better, Lucas or Boll) I think back to the clean, sleek storyline of episodes IV-VI and then to the jarring trainwreck of trade federations, droid armies, and racist alien stereotypes that comprise eps I-III and it boggles my mind that they could have come from the same person. Not that they did...maybe the original authors are buried out in the same vault where the original prints were stored.Did this flick even need to be made? Nothing I saw in this new trilogy fired my imagination the way the casual mention (e.g. a Clone War) did in a New Hope. The genesis of Darth Vader was one hundred times more engrossing when caught second hand from Alec Guiness and Frank Oz's hand up a puppet's butt. Does anyone want to see what Dorothy did the previous three months in Kansas before she went to Oz? Well, all negativity aside, I think the next one, episode IV, is gonna be GREAT.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?,"I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.

The most average movie ever to deserve an 8,"Leading up to 'Sith', people weren't optimistic, given the lacklustre standard of the previous two. 'Sith' shouldn't have been as good as it was.The start was a boring, heartless, CGI-feast - I was ready to walk out. The relationship between Anakin and Padme was really quite bad. The chemistry between Christensen and Portman - the main reason Lucas hired them - did not show. Christensen over-played Anakin too much, he tried too hard, and it showed. Portman even managed to look ugly in one shot. Both had dialogue which would have been better written by my 10 year old brother. The birth of the hugely significant twins was just crap, rushed and unemotional. McGregor was good, but no better than good. And really, it is fairly incomprehensible that Anakin could murder innocent young Jedi's after turning ""evil"" two hours before. Against all these odds, and many more, it is a triumph simply in that 'Sith' is actually a good film. The first two acts were almost B-grade, but something happened during Anakin's rampage that drew me in. The filming seemed better, the script seemed to appear to at least have been written by someone who passed English, and Christensen pretty much under-played Anakin, with passable results. But in the third act I raised by rating from a 4 to a 7.And then, the ending was just superb, setting the tone perfectly for 'A New Hope' giving the audience hope against such despairable odds. Immediately concluding this movie, I went home and watched 'A New Hope'. And because this movie made me do that, it really deserves 8/10, even though it really shouldn't have been that good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Really enjoyed it,"Star Wars has been a part of my life for a long time, and I'm very fond of it. I've watched all of the movies and most of the TV shows. Out of all of them, I've found that this one entertains me the most. While a lot of dialogue in it is a bit odd, and the romance aspect of it can be a bit much sometimes, lots of those aspects have been put in a different light to me from the millions of memes created from this movie alone. This movie also does a great job of connecting episodes 1 and 2 with the original trilogy in ways such as revealing the Venator class Star Destroyer, showing how Palpatine was able to wipe out the Jedi, seeing how Luke and Leia were hidden away on different planets, the rise of Darth Vader, and many more things. While this movie won't be for everyone, it's one of my favorite Star Wars movies and much better than anything Disney has made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awesome film,"I am not going to spoil the fun for anyone who has not seen this film yet, but let me just say I have loved Star Wars since 1977 (when I was five years old) and I was a little disappointed with the first two prequels (although I think Attack of the Clones was not as bad as most people think). Anyways, all I am saying is that I saw 'Revenge of the Sith' twice in the theater and I loved it. Even my wife (who is NOT at all a Star Wars fan) loved this one! Lucas has finally delivered the goods this time and has connected this with episode 4 very well!The acting is good, especially Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine really shines. The effects are mind blowing and the background music in some of the key scenes is very effective and pretty different for a Star Wars film. But it works great! See this film as soon as you can -- you will love it!I don't know about anyone else, but I really hope he makes Episodes 7,8,9 (Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are all still around still) so he can still do it and why shouldn't he?

afterthoughts to ROTS...,"I have read hundreds of comments after impulsively posting mine on the week that this film was first released, and they were all good, bad, and ugly. But mostly good and ugly for the record. Being that I have been a fan since seeing the original at the golden, impressionable age of six, I worshipped the original trilogy and watched the first two cringing with inner trepidation. And despite of their flaws (and God were there SO many), I still secretly enjoyed ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"". And going to that theatre with the same trepidation/defense-mechanism that I had developed since 1999, I was expecting the worst. Many elements that destroyed the magic that the OT brought us and the PT raped us of were still present: the wooden acting and 5th-grade dialogue; the overuse of CGI; the protracting exposition. Although Ewan McGregor always had command of his role as Obi Wan Kenobi and was always able to deliver the most ridiculous of lines with such panache in these films. He has always made these films watchable (Liam Neeson wasn't that bad either in ""Episode I""). Ewan's uncanny Alec Guinness-like presence makes one think that they tweeked archived footage from ""The Bridge Over River Kwai"" at times and used that instead.To begin with, this story knows what to do with itself instead of showing us stupid battles between Gungans and the Trade Federation. The camaraderie between Anakin and Obi-Wan is solid-- I think that Hayden Christiansen took an acting lesson (but only one) in between films. But I sat slumped in my chair in the darkened movie theatre expecting it to get worse after the crash landing sequence and the stupid cutesy voices to the robots, so that defense-mechanism was going. It didn't though, and I wasn't laughing out loud with the ""love"" scenes between Anakin and Padme as I did in ""AOTC"" three years ago. Hayden Christiansen delivered some absurd lines and doesn't possess the gift that McGregor and Natalie Portman have (see above), but in this one he wasn't all that bad. I thought that the dialogue was a tad better (but not MUCH), and I was glad that they cut the scenes short instead. It helped make the scenes ""passable"". ""Star Wars""'s dialogue always struck me as European-sounding at times,(until Lucas inserted American colloquialisms and syntex into the new trilogy now- like ""yippee"" from Episode I).So the first hour was very humdrum with the usual technical babble and events that were still alien and distant to us didn't seem to be the ""Star Wars"" that we know and love. But then Palpatine delivers a speech about the ""Legend of Darth Palegeus"" as if it were a creepy bedtime story to Anakin at the opera house. My interest started to rise, and the circulation was pumping again. By the scene where Padme and Anakin are looking toward each other in opposite buildings at sunset, the haunting music started to set the tone for how the film was going to turn out to be.As Anakin helps Palpatine defeat senior Jedi Mace Windu (Samuel L.Jackson) in hopes that he will learn how to save his wife Padme (Natalie Portman) from dying, he pledges allegiance to him and is christened as Darth Vader. From there, Vader goes on a killing spree as ordered, and the Republic's troops turn on the other Jedi advisors at the same time in a montage of systematic slaughter, a subtle homage to ""The Godfather"". And of course, it wouldn't be a ""Star Wars"" film without John Williams's score to raise the dramatic stakes...And guess what? IT DID! For the first time since I saw ""Return of the Jedi"" back in 1983, George Lucas was able to grab his audience emotionally and hold them there for at least the next hour. The magic was coming back, but unfortunately it didn't last as long as it did back in the Original Trilogy.The movie comes to a climax, and the catharsis is predictable yet some of the events aren't as much. Probably the most emotional scene to watch is near the end where Natalie Portman goes to find Anakin and sees that Obi-Wan's conclusions are correct, and Anakin has succumbed to the Dark Side of the Force. It's so dramatic to me because I found myself watching this, with flashes of memories and traces of these same characters from ""Episode's I & II"", and what these three had been through together...And where they were now. Almost like the demise of three has-been child sitcom-actors. When she delivers her line, ""you're breaking my heart"", it was on the Velveeta-side, but she was able to say it as if it were the Gospel. And when Anakin Force-chokes Padme, it was domestic violence ""Star Wars""-style. So it was very easy for me to root for Obi-Wan and hate Anakin even more.So after Anakin is defeated and loses his extremities, the aftermath montage was equally poignant, and Darth Vader's first breath under the mask is so chilling. Every time I saw that in the theatre, NO ONE talked. And Padme's funeral is so haunting.So one out of three isn't all that bad, but I wish that George Lucas hit the skin off the ball with this one. It bridges with Episode IV rather eloquently, and as other posters have stated that you will never watch the Original Trilogy the same way again. Well, that's true. Perhaps that is just something that distinguishes those sets of films making them classics and these not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visually Nice, but the dialogue, cover your ears","I'm sorry, but I expect more from a movie than imagery. I expect a story, characters who develop, who have depth. If there are plot holes, okay, but they must be somewhat reasonable, not idiotic. The story is dreadful, the dialogue juvenile (no not even juvenile, rather childish). There are so many holes in the plot, you could market it in the cheese section, under Swiss, but then again it could be just American cheese for the script itself. The main problem, I think, has to be there is no suspense, we all know who lives and dies. Why bother having a 10 minute light saber duel, when you know the outcome. Somebody once said Lucas looks to Kurasawa for inspiration, but watching some of those classic samurai movies, the duels are over in 5 sec., much like real world fencing. That would in this case be much more dramatic... But back again to the acting and script... the Jedi are incredibly dense not to sense the bad guys and anakin is so dim, you can see why he ended up being the second banana in the original movies. He obviously has trouble thinking for himself, seems to never gotten emotionally past 12. How he ever got Padme pregnant, we can't imagine. How she could love such a child? The whole thing actually left me angry at the end.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The saga is now complete.,"I was able to enjoy one of the few charity premieres of this film here in Denver.A note about the nature of Revenge of the Sith: I believe the average person will hate this film. Why? Because it's the darkest, most horrific, and most gruesome extreme in Star Wars. Anyone who hasn't seen the other films and goes to see this one will lose all hope for the saga, throw down their hands and say ""no more  I can't take anymore of this depressing series of films."" Everyone I've talked to who has seen it can't generally decide how they feel about it. Many walk out utterly depressed because, after all, Episode III is a tragedy, a prime element in mythology. And because they don't know how to admit their depression, they automatically assume they were disappointed in the film. They ultimately blame it on who or whatever they can, Lucas himself in predominance.This film wasn't intended to uplift its audiences like the other five; this film was intended to tie up the story line and finally provide a polar opposite emotion to audiences everywhere, a much darker and more gruesome feeling that, I believe, greatly enhances the beauties, optimisms, and hopes that are presented in the original trilogy of films (Episodes IV-VI).Overall, I believe Revenge of the Sith was produced to make the other films that much better, stronger, more beautiful. And for this reason alone, I absolutely love Revenge of the Sith. I love it, and it made me love Star Wars even more that I already do.For those of you who haven't seen the other films, you're screwed when seeing this one, but I strongly advise you watch the other films afterward, don't loose hope, because you certainly wont be disappointed by the whole series.A few technical notes about Revenge of the Sith: I'll have to get back to you on this in detail after I see it two or three more times, but, here are my overly critical observations in regard to the cinematic nature of Episode III:Acting and Characters  the ultimate drawback to this film I believe. However, in perception, I don't feel it any worse than the other five. But I think that the extreme emotions presented in this one significantly accentuate any lack in talent in this one. *Hayden Christensen*, I believe, did much better this time around than he did in Episode II, and freshly feel that he is wholly appropriate as Darth Vader. *Ewan McGregor* will not disappoint, as he upholds his performance consistently throughout the prequel trilogy, and also makes Obi-Wan that much more, excuse my language, ""bad-ass"" in all of these films. *Natalie Portman* disappointed me a bit, but given the extreme nature of emotions demanded of the role of Padme in the film, I merely give her credit for trying. *Ian McDiarmid* - all I can say is ""oh man."" By far my favorite actor in this whole movie, the man completely turned my negative opinions around for the Emperor in general. His performance was great, believability was almost flawless, and his overall presentation was inspiringly sinister. The Emperor is the ultimate villain. *Yoda*, whether it be Frank Oz's lovable performance or not, completely redeemed himself in this film. I hated him in I and II, but the way he was written, his actions, his dialogue  all his Episode III attributes make him a great character once more. *Everybody else* wasn't in or lived through the film long enough to care.Visual Presentation  Effects are great, lighting very appropriate, and overall visual presentation outstanding.Story  Amazing. It wraps up everything flawlessly. The only two things that disappointed me were the fact that I still don't understand why Yoda exiles himself and the fact that Obi-Wan wasn't called ""Ben"" before the end of the film. I am completely satisfied by this film's ability to tie up the saga for me. The saga is now complete. Everyone can see this and enjoy its pure storytelling essence.Other comments  I was wholly disappointed in the composition of characters and locations in the film. Star Wars always offers a wide range of expanded character implementation, and Revenge of the Sith generally deprived us of that. Most characters and locations within were hardly alluded to at all. The Wookiees had, at most, two minutes of screen time. Every Jedi beyond Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Mace were lucky to have a shot or two at all, and those that featured their own very short scene (probably a death scene) should be praised. This film was about Obi-Wan, Anakin, and the Sith. If you can think or want to see anybody else in this movie, don't try. The story's focused on them, and even the sequences like the space battle, and other battles for that matter, feel mostly like background material rather than prominent plot composition. As far as locations go, there are 11 or more planets featured in the film, but 8 of those are lucky to have more than 30 seconds of screen time.Another thing that I have to say is ""Order 66."" If you know what this is, fine, I wont spoil it to anyone, but the montage of sequences featuring this particular plot point almost made me cry, both in beauty and in sadness. It was great, and of my top five favorite scenes in the film.After all of you see the film, we can chat more. Most of the beauty in this film lies in content that should not be spoiled.My advice to all is to sit down, take this bad boy in, and appreciate it as a critical piece in the whole Star Wars puzzle. Revenge of the Sith is dark, depressing, however simply awesome in its own right, but it's nothing without the other films.Star Wars, I love you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better prequel with some faults,"While quite a bit better than the previous prequels, this STAR WARS still has some ""Grievous"" problems. I found a lot of the acting to be ""stunted"" and bland, and not compelling, particularly in the first half. These days it seems that special effects and lack of character development are the status quo. I still managed to make my way through the entire movie which I couldn't do for the last one. Other elements that bothered me were -why would a droid commander have a cough? Also, some of the old familiar characters like the Wookies are just thrown in for good measure. I miss the ""Harrison Ford"" romantic figures that seem like more realistic ""heroes"".

Fourth Best,"It's finally over. I viewed this film over the Memorial Day weekend. It was more as an act of faith than than a burning desire. The first two films of this new trilogy have left much to desire. Episode I was a kiddie film, Spy Kids set in a galaxy ""far, far, away."" There were good sections, but not a good film. Episode II was much better but Anakin Skywaler as a petulant teen got on the nerves. Thank God American teens can't access the Force! I know that the character was supposed to be a flawed and conflicted individual, but the story and dialog did nothing to present that case. Worse, Skywalker and Padme had no chemistry. This was supposed to be a love that shook worlds and destroyed governments. That's not what I saw on film.There are still problems in Episode III but it is visually stunning and moved with a purpose. As an action picture it was quite good. As a drama it was mediocre. There were things done in this film that should have had much more emotional impact than it did. Some of Anakin's actions were monstrous, but I never felt it. Therefore, you have my score--7--for action and visuals. Any higher score required things that were lacking in this film. It is the fourth best of the series. At least we finished on a high note.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

In this movie, despite the limiting dialogue, they shine (except for Christiansan). If Lucas had put half the amount of effort into the plot that he put into the graphics, we would have a MUCH different and better movie, no doubt.I am still going to buy the 6-DVD digitally remastered, gold director's special edition -- whenever the hell that comes out -- just because it closes the loop for those of us who can remember being in the theatre for one of the original Star Wars films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A warm fuzzy feeling,"The last installment of the epic star wars saga.On the whole, it's not really that spectacular in terms of total epicness, but the beauty of star wars is that the whole story across each of the six chapters is epic enough to make up for any lacking in a particular movie. To put it comparatively, it's not nearly as epic as LotR: RotK (which only had three movies to wrap things up) but it doesn't need to be.The long series makes it possible to explore the subtleties of the characters' development and interactions not just between their current friends and relations, but multi-generationally as well, which is a very rare thing in impatient, instant-gratification Hollywood these days. It also is a prime example of how actions- no matter how small they may be-lay seeds that create far-reaching consequences in the near and distant future.Bottom Line: It's Adequate.But how adequate! Ep 3 builds a solid bridge between the two parts of the saga (with all the necessary dramatic shouting and character transformation), and makes a 28-year-old story come full circle in a rich, satisfying way that leaves you with a full, warm, fuzzy feeling as the credits roll and you hear that theme song for the last new time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Of The  Prequel Trilogy,"Episode III is not only a spectacular and exciting conclusion to this trilogy, but it also proves to be a deeply moving one as well. The Clone Wars are nearing an end, and a battle weary Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor, superb) and Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen, good performance often overlooked.) pursue a defeated Count Dooku(Christopher Lee, not in this long!) and finally dispatch him, but in a way that reveals the growing darkness in Anakin that threatens his appointment as full member of the Jedi Council. It is this fear that drives Anakin to ally himself with the evil Chancellor Palpatine(Ian McDiarmid, extremely effective.) and betray the Republic, Obi-Wan, and put him on the dark path to becoming...Darth Vader.Well directed and written by George Lucas, this reveals the back story of Vader and the birth of the Empire in spectacular, larger than life fashion. Seeing how Anakin betrays everyone is really disturbing, and the stuff of epic tragedies. Witnessing the Darth Vader mask placed on his burned face, and knowing what will come, is powerful stuff.Can't overlook Yoda either, effective fight scene with the Emperor, but a bitter pill of failure for him to swallow...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Your lack of faith in these prequels is, broadly speaking, not disturbing.","If the final film of the original trilogy went out with somewhat of a bang, then this final film of the three prequels fizzles out with a bit of a whimper; the masking of the Vader character proving, it would seem, to be somewhat less enthralling than the unmasking. This is not to say that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is totally irredeemable, but its final act, the grand finale to the first half of the life-arc of a character that has captured people's imaginations for decades, plods to its destination and falls over the line instead of bursting through the tape, arms aloft. Much of this lies, I think, in the direction, which isn't entirely sure how to execute what is, in essence, a downer-ending to a summer blockbuster belonging to a franchise which has become synonymous with thrills; spills; excitement and, I suppose, HAPPY endings.""Revenge of the Sith"" consists of two strands: one is the development and culmination of a conflict initiated in the last film over power and trade between a rebel force of solar systems, operating out of rocky desert planets and consisting of coalitions of odd looking creatures, and a Jedi council based in a shiny metropolis that is a picture of modernity.The second is, at least is supposed to be, the depiction of a bleak; un-nerving descent of one man into the 'dark' side of his world's core philosophy - 'the force'. This character is Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden Christensen, whose great transition into this monster, we are told, essentially precipitates on three things: sulking over being hired to the Jedi council, but not made a master; sulking over not being permitted a mission he really wanted and, crucially, a mere nightmare of his soul-mate dying.The film begins with a sequence, which is too long and too akin to what the Bond films do pre-credits, depicting Anakin and his mentor, Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), in the middle of an inter-galactic battle with those the Jedi are fighting on account of the enemy having kidnapped a highly important chancellor. This rather chaotic sequence starts in outer-space with a dog-fight; sees the heroes infiltrate the landing area of a huge cruiser and the corridors of the ship itself; sees them confront the villains and attempt an extraction.The opening becomes jarring for the fact it begins to feel plastic, as if Lucas is ticking off a list of things he thinks fans want to see: swordplay; dogfights; R2D2 fooling about; comedy in near-death situations and Jedis on a mission. It is during this sequence we meet General Grievous, who is some kind of skeletal creature that hides behind, it must be said, fairly thin body armour and possesses a chesty cough. But he also has a small collection of light sabres, inferring, perhaps, that he has conquered Jedi in fights in the past.Eventually, everybody congregates back at Jedi headquarters and the film, as Episode 2 did, splits off into its separate strands involving Kenobi going solo to find Grievous in order to halt the war, and Skywalker remaining behind to be with his partner Padme (Portman). Cleverly, Lucas shoots Skywalker and Padme in the shadows of a great hall, dressed in black, when we first see them, highlighting how secretive or shadowy they must live given Padme is pregnant and this must be kept secret. You might also say, given Kenobi is in brighter, whiter clothing, the difference foreshadows the light/dark dynamic which will characterise Anakin's arc.From here, the film, though certainly threatening to fall apart, bumps along with a series of, often unintelligible, decisions taken by characters; bland second unit spectacle and scenes of genuine philosophical choice which, while interesting on paper, do not really get beyond the level of three out of five. Kenobi, just as he begins to sense doubt about Skywalker; Padme and the whole set-up, maddeningly agrees of depart the situation when he is, arguably, desperately needed at home.Meanwhile, besotted by Padme and terrified of losing her as per his vision, Yoda offers Anakin the Jedi outlook of not worrying about loss and refuting attachments to items and people. More tempting, however, is the Chancellor's (Ian McDiarmid) approach: keep those you really love alive forever with powers one can only acquire away from Jedi teaching and with the Dark. He has this chat with Skywalker during a strange operatic light-show, which depicts rays of light thrashing around from one body to another thus highlighting Anakin's increasingly scrambled outlook.Is the film's message here that love, ultimately, is a bad thing? Indeed, Padme even asks Skywalker whether love has ""blinded"" him. ""Seems it has..."" comes the reply. I could not believe there was no healthy medium between 'sever all feelings for someone' and 'become an incarnation of evil in order to save those whom you feel for the most'. Skywalker's descent into one thing over the other is not altogether convincing, and on occasion is flatly absurd for the aforementioned reasons: sulking over not being referred to as a 'master'? Really? Other things begin to unravel: does Christensen have the punch to really carry the material/performance? How did he think Padme, above all else, would react to his transition, or even murdering Jedi trainees?To some extent, Episode 3 is a departure from, not only the series, but Hollywood blockbusters generally: it isn't very often you see a mainstream film culminate with sadness; death; massacre and, ultimately, the beginning of a war, and I'm afraid it just doesn't quite come off. Neither does the meat of the project, a descent into a kind of madness, a tragedy, really have the snap it needs. It may not be as goofy as its cousins, but it leaves you feeling it could've been more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
And so started everything,"The Revenge of the Sith is the movie which completes the trilogy of prequels of Star Wars, storying the rise of the Empire, the transformation of Anakin to Vader and the begin of the conflict shown in the original Star Wars film and trilogy.From many points of view the film reaches perfection. The picture is amazing. Graphics of battles, mechanics, creatures, planets etc. are state of the art. The plot is self-contained and completely free of decorative and redundant elements and scenes, while it still binds perfectly elements and facts of all 5 other Star Wars Episodes and it still serves the goal of storying the domination of the Sith and the fall of Anakin. New elements are brought without annoying or disturbing. The hole mystery/ history of characters and facts of Star Wars is revealed in the best possible way and the continuity to Episode IV could not have been better managed. As Anakin gets closer to the dark side, with the help of Palpatin, the spectator conceives the dark side and its philosophy of power as never before in Star Wars. Finally, acting and dialogs are much more improved than in all other Episodes.And some remarks: after the slow-moving plot of Episodes I and II, III had to catch up with an overload of action and events. The film is quite condense. The spectator is challenged and overwhelmed (prefer watching the film someplace where film breaks still exist). Padme's role, though well played, is much more passive than in I and II. C3PO is put too much aside. The Jedi/Sith dismemberment fetish of George Lucas will test your stomach bearing. Connection problems: Ewan McGregor is too young to become Alec Guiness in IV, Palpatine is too old to exist in V, the Death Star was in much too advanced construction stage, only to be inaugurated in IV, Leia knew her mother far too little as to be able to speak about her in VI and Anakin is much younger and more good looking than the Jedi ghost originally shown in VI.There is a great generation bias in grading and commenting a Star Wars Episode. However, if you, like me, belong to the generation which first show Star Wars on TV screen and first lived in theaters the 90ties film industry then this will be an Excellent Movie and will become your Best Star Wars Episode.May the Force be with you (Es moege die Macht mit Ihr sein)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So it's complete.,"You may have heard how ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" ends, so I'll just talk about a few aspects.

But I would have said a long time ago that George W. Bush is basically the same as Darth Vader.In some way, maybe the movie is sort of a video game, but that one line made it really good. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christopher Lee certainly do the best with their roles.

"""I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.""","I have always been a huge Star Wars fan. I've seen ""the Holy Trilogy"" scores, if not hundreds of times, I've read the books, I've bought the toys, I even played the card game. All of these things make me not only a geek, but a person whose soul was crushed when he saw Episode III. I can't possibly convey to you using words my disappointment and horror as a reaction to this film. Harrison Ford's old quote to George Lucas, ""You can write this s***, but we can't say it!"" doesn't come close to embodying the sheer awfulness of the script. There is melodrama that is laughable, and comedy that just fails on every level. Lucas has squandered a great cast and elicited some of the worst performances in cinematic history (no hyperbole), and even Samuel L. Jackson was bad. The action and CGI are amazing, but they are the only redeeming features of the movie, and there is not enough of them to make it worth sitting through two and a half hours of Lucas' offensively horrendous dialogue.The story that every single one of us knows before we walk into the theater unfolds at such an awkward pace, that you almost feel like you're watching that one nerdy kid from high school fail to climb the gym rope. The character's levels of intelligence and skill change throughout the film to fit the needs of the plot. The Jedi who we have come to know and love are invincible when fighting the droids, but are timorous cowards when confronted by Sith or real soldiers. Anakin is stupid, and for someone who seems to have such a deep understanding of something like the Force, he seems to have an awfully hard time connecting events, judging a situation, and even telling friend from foe. This isn't helped by the fact that Hayden Christensen gives a performance that would have gotten him booed off of the stage in a high school play.The dialogue is bad. And by bad, I don't mean punny or evil, I mean that it's poorly written crap. This is, of course, to be expected since Episode's I and II had similar problems, but the sheer quantity dialogue ranging in quality from bad to atrocious is astounding, and you can only stand so much of it. Some of the actors, like Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid, relish the hamminess of their lines and pour their heart and soul into them with mixed results. Other actors, like Jackson, seem confused as to how they got talked into actually having these words come out of their mouths while the cameras were rolling, and their performances are just bad. Finally, there is Cristensen and Portman, who are both fine young actors (Portman far better than Christensen), but whose performances are deplorable beyond description.The movie ended up being awful, despite being wonderfully fun to look at and having great special effects and battle.

Best Star Wars film to date,"I believe this is what star wars truly is. You have great performances by Ewan Mcgregor, Hayden Christensen, etc. I do believe that the previous prequel films were not that good but I hate seeing this amazing movie being belittled by just the fact of being a prequel. Lucas could of easily just redid the elements that made the previous movies work, but no he didn't unlike what Disney did. He wanted to tell what us the story of Star wars in his vision. It wasn't about making money for him (Some of it was, but we are all motivated by greed in some way), it was about telling a convincing story of the rise of the empire and fall of the good. The Clone Wars series really made this film go from a 7 to a 10 because you create an emotional attachment to these characters and feel sad when things go dark.

The younger Portman plays the mother of the older Carrie Fisher. Wookies appear in Revenge of the Sith. We see C3PO, R2D2, Yoda and Jar Jar Binks.

It was worth the wait!,"I waited for this movie for 3 years and decided to see it on the opening day- something I have never done for any movie. It was spectacular in its special effects and battle scenes, and fast and effective in its story telling. It makes quite an emotional impact toward the end when Anakin finally falls in the river of lava and has to be rebuilt into the masked Darth Vader. The acting was excellent. Hayden Christensen shows the conflicting emotions very effectively. Ewan McGregor made me cry at the end, and so did Natalie Portman. Ian McDiarmid is back as 'the emperor' and the dark Sith Lord Darth Sidious. He is scary and disgusting at the same time. It is easy to see that Anakin accepts him as his master and does not question him out of fear. Anakin/Darth Vader spirals into the dark lord very quickly by killing the innocents. We keep wishing that he would return to Obi-Wan and the Jedi but we already know what happened in the original trilogy.The story blends very well with the original trilogy. The music is dark throughout, as is the mood. Occasionally there are lighter moments because of Artoo and Yoda, but basically it is an emotional movie that makes a big impact. Even with the violence, it does not go totally out of control, and I will have no problem taking children to this movie.

"No movie will touch the first trilogy, so enjoy this great film","While reading through the countless reviews that gave ""Sith"" less than 5 stars I can across one that asked ""Why do people give this movie 10/10?"" The same can be said for the people who give the movie a 1-3/10. While it certainly isn't as ""good"" as the first three films, Episode III is easily a great movie and should be looked upon as such. The acting is the most obvious downfall: Hayden Christenson may have looked the part (brilliant portrayal, physically) but his love scenes with Natalie Portman were lacking. However, the acting of Ewen McGregor and Ian McDiarmid (who was stunning as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine) make up for this.The special effects, despite the criticisms of some, are not overboard (like in Episode II). They blend nicely into the story, and are primarily background for more important facets of the movie. The opening space battle is breath-taking if you allow it to be. The lightsaber battles are spectacular and the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan is epic.Lucas does a great job of tieing in humor and minor characters as well. C-3PO and R2-D2 provide some slight laughs, although the biggest laughs of the movie came from the sarcastic actions of Yoda. I wasn't too thrilled about making Yoda, Mr. Wisdom himself, part of the comic relief, but it doesn't take away from his character (remember, Ep. V? Very funny). Chewbacca is in the film, but plays a very minor role (which was for the better in my opinion).The greatest part of this movie, however, is the transformation of Anakin. I'm someone who was very critical of Christenson's acting. So it came as a surprise when I was truly feeling the pain of Anakin. Lucas shows the true tragedy of Anakin turning to the dark side. I didn't think I would ever be feeling sorry for Anakin, but I was! In review, many people still expect too much from these movies. The first trilogy simply can't be touched. Therefore, enjoy this movie. It really is a great movie that is actually very dark and revealing. Even without the ""Star Wars Mystique"" I would have enjoyed it.9/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Final Star Wars Bears Messege (By Charlotte Higgins),"The republic is crumbling under attack from alien forces. Democracy is threatened as the leader plays on the people's paranoia. Amid the confusion it is suddenly unclear whether the state is in more danger from insurgents, or from the leader himself.It sounds more like a Michael Moore polemic than a Star Wars movie. But George Lucas, speaking as his latest epic was given its world premiere at Cannes yesterday, confirmed that Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, could be read as a parable about American politics.When he conceived his series of films in the 1970s, he says, he was thinking about Vietnam and Nixon, investigating ""democracy, and how a senate could give itself over, could surrender itself to a dictator"". He found historical echoes down the ages. ""I looked at ancient Rome, and how, having got rid of kings, the Senate ended up with Caesar's nephew as emperor ... how democracy turns itself into a dictatorship. I also looked at revolutionary France ... and Hitler.""It tends to follow similar patterns. Threats from outside leading to the need for more control; democracy not being able to function properly because of internal squabbling."" ""I hope that situation never arises in our country,"" he said. ""Maybe the film will awaken people to this danger."" Asked whether Star Wars Episode III openly alluded to the Iraq war, he said: ""When I wrote it Iraq didn't exist. We were funding Saddam Hussein and giving him weapons of mass destruction. We were going after Iran. But the parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we are doing in Iraq are unbelievable.""

It is a long movie but it doesn't feel like it. The script is decent, the acting, while still wooden at times, is vastly improved (especially by Hayden Christensen). The action scenes are breath taking and John Williams is tremendous as always, but that wasn't what made this film. The high point for me was the way it lined up so perfectly with the original trilogy. Every little detail was arranged so neatly.

The effects are awesome, but I think they go nuts and take away from the human element that existed in the originals. It feels like the Star Wars video game, not the Star Wars movie. I feel this doesn't enhance the movie which is why I gave it an average rating. The funny thing to watch is the change at the end from the crazy CG fx at the beginning of the movie to the simpler style and sets that are there to replicate the originals (which were cutting edge at the time). Apparently once the empire is formed they banned CG. And I guess the Empire also banned non-humans on imperial destroyer. The 1st two prequels are loaded with non-humans but as you see in the last scene of Sith the destroyer is staffed by human looking folks.Overall - a bit long, with some weak writing and acting.

"""Luke, I am your father...""","""...but this is not your father's Star Wars.""Ugh. Where to begin? These movies are horrible. Each one worse than the previous one; or at least all equally dire. I think we were all fooling ourselves thinking things would get any better after seeing Jake Lloyd was cast as young Anakin and Haydn Christensen as older Anakin. Besides that, though, an inordinate amount of time was wasted on endless hordes of ugly digital aliens and droids and pod races and very little on the story. Sadly, Lucas clearly did not care for the story, dialog and acting (he's admitted as much, as I understand it) and was more interested in cramming every possible frame with some digital creature or effect.As a result, we see no viable transition from good Anakin to bad Anakin; instead, we are subjected to possibly the worst plot contrivance ever devised, amongst a host of other ridiculous plot devices (to say nothing of the moronic coincidences that proliferate in these movies). The confounding thing is that even in this last film, where you still might be able to salvage some time and show a logical progression from Skywalker to Vader, there is plenty of time wasted and fluff to spare, including the introduction of one of the most pointless characters ever created, Count Grievous. I mean, why chronicle the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker, the main protagonist of the trilogy, when you can show a coughing robot? This could have been a true saga. Instead, it is a blight on the franchise and a travesty.As for the effects, I deplore the look of all these movies. They don't evoke the feel of the original films at all. It's all a big, headache-inducing mess. But its only fitting that the effects stink since the story is five times as repellent.

The magic of the originals has indeed returned...,"I was very excited to see this movie... it was easily the most advertised thing on television and those who had done reviews on it in the newspapers were strongly convinced. Not one single negative.I was excited, Episodes I and II were both a great disappointment, and even with my excitement, I still had a sickening feeling that Hayden Christensen was going to screw it up again, just like he did Episode II (though you could blame it on George Lucas, as it was him who made Hayden act in that annoying ""angsty rawr rawr"" manner) With this installment, the saga has been completed, and the dreams of every ""Star Wars nerd"" has come true. I don't call myself obsessed, I am merely interested in the story, it is all extraordinarily attractive, it contains life values of most basic or most important stature. Most importantly, it is the greatest journey one can take in the Star Wars universe.The opening credits were a great welcome, and despite my lack of knowledge on the cartoon series ""Clone Wars"", I knew what to expect, I had an idea on what had happened, and most importantly, I actually knew who the hell this ""Grievous"" was, unlike the majority of the viewers in the fellow audience.Without giving too much away, we all know what this movie is about. It's about the betrayal of a great power, the seduction of a once kindhearted man to the side of wrongdoings. Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader.But it was HOW Lucas was going to execute the occurrences into something interesting and watchable. Episode I left so much to do, and Episode II barely executed any of the things left to weave into Episode IV, but Episode III has managed to do all of these things without becoming rushed and confused. And interestingly, the cheesy dialogue people have come to hate remains, but I feel it is a necessary addition to keep the Star Wars saga true to the 1977 original.I have little to no gripes, Jar Jar Binks, though he provided comic relief for myself, was definitely far too annoying and heavily unnecessary to the flow of the story, and thankfully, he doesn't speak one line in this whole movie, hell, you see him in two scenes and only in the background.Most actors I expected bigger roles out of have been reduced to mere cameo-esquire appearances (Whale Rider's Keisha Castle Hughes is glimpsed for a mere three seconds as the Queen of Naboo and Grand Moff Tarkin appears for no longer than 10 seconds before he strays suspiciously off frame), but this fails to bother me, as it doesn't affect the flow of the story, nor does it ruin anything.Episode III is that long awaited bridge from the despised world of the prequels into the legendary world of the original trilogy. Though still set twenty-odd years before Episode IV, it is, in many ways, a direct prequel, and ALL unanswered questions that have plagued our dreams for nearly 30 years have finally been answered.If you have not yet seen it, do so, NOW.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This has bothered me, just because for all intensive purposes, he could have called him Darth ""Pencil"". Does anyone see this? I just thought it would be cool if his name held up to something, like Vader in some particular language meant to give life, or cheat death.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Plot weak, still lacks the fun of the original","Yes, it's got a spoiler, but there is no way to relate the problems with this movie without disclosing certain parts.The good part is this is the end of the Lucas star wars movies. I say good because I can now stop hoping that we will ever see another movie with the original spark, fun, chemistry and sheer joy as we did in the originals. In SW and TESB, the action was great and the actors acted like ... well they were being shot at and their lives depended on what they did. The action here is now special effects and the acting is... occasionally great, sometimes flat.But the biggest problem for me in this movie is the reason Anakin Skywalker turns to the dark side. He's going to betray all the Jedi because he has a bad dream and Chancellor Palpatine says the dark side has power over life and death? And then what does he do? He kills (or attempts to kill) the very person he's turned to the dark side to save? It's implausible. Oh yea, and when Chancellor Palpatine is revealed for the evil he is, Skywalker wants to give him a fair trial? (When just a few scenes earlier Skywalker beheads the beaten General Grievous.) And the moment Mace Windu lets down his guard, Palpatine seizes upon the moment to kill him. And Skywalker STILL doesn't see the true evil nature of the dark side of the force or Palpatine? It's just stupid. Oh yea, don't forget, ""special order 66."" That's real believable. Everyone becomes mindless robots? One minute you are fighting side by side, then you get special order 66, and how you kill the person you were fighting with just moments earlier without any thought at all? Stupid, stupid, stupid.It think too many people have forgotten what a blast the original movies where. Go and watch them and then go watch this one. Tell me you don't find a huge chunk of fun missing. Where is the chemistry between the actors? Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamilton and Harrison Ford should be given belated Oscars, because it's only through the last 3 movies do we really see just how remarkable of a job they did almost 30 years ago.There are some great moments in this movie. Some funny stuff with yoda and near the end Natalie Portman really nails the scene. There is also the line about how ""liberty dies to thunderous applause."" I can't help thinking that is what happening here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Far better than the first two, but not for the right reasons...","Revenge of the Sith occupies an odd position in terms of its' fans expectations--pretty much everyone who cares even a bit about the Star Wars saga knows exactly what's going to happen in the film, at least in a broad sense. The thrill that people flock to the theaters for is to see HOW it happens--how the monumental original trilogy will be connected to the far more lackluster recent two films to complete one of the grandest (at least in terms of popularity) movie sagas of all time.George Lucas, thus, has the best possible material to work here that money can buy. He gets to depict events that will be exciting to a Star Wars fan no matter how well they're done; even Jar Jar Binks (probably) couldn't spoil them. So does Lucas rise to the hopes of movie fans and create a movie that's considerably better than The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones? Not really. Don't get me wrong--the film is FAR more enjoyable than those two, but it's more in spite of Lucas than because of him.Just as the three original films followed Luke Skywalker, the three prequels follow Anakin Skywalker, and it is in this film that we bear witness to the great transformation that's been known to Star Wars fans for many years. This film's role, then, is to show how it happened and why. Well, it certainly does the former, but the latter doesn't fare so well. Anakin's development at first grinds along at a snail's pace and then suddenly kicks into overdrive, with him seeming to transform into a whole new character entirely in the span of one short scene. Of course Lucas has been hinting at this in none-too-subtle ways from the beginning of Attack of the Clones, but there seems to be no bridge of any kind between mere glimmers and the actual completed change. The one reason this film keeps pounding home seems rather flimsily constructed. Neither is the reason why viewers will find Yoda where he is in The Empire Strikes Back very convincing; the master explains it away with one cryptic line that left me asking ""...why?"" What this movie does do well is visuals and music, particularly in the battle scenes. And yes folks, this movie is loaded to the brim with fighting. Spaceships fight, armies fight, Jedi fight, even Wookies fight. And that fighting looks and sounds utterly fantastic. The four-armed General Grievous is particularly fun to watch. The acting is a mixed bag. Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor carry this film--Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's speaking roles seem comparatively minor. The few scenes the latter two get are unfortunately just as cheesy as their hammy romance in AotC, but blessedly are all much shorter.Lucas goes out of his way over and over again in this film to connect to the original three movies. C3PO and R2D2 are everywhere, often with no apparent reason, and even Chewbacca and Wedge make brief cameos. Jar Jar Binks is thankfully completely absent (he is seen a few times, but never heard). Unfortunately, Lucas has no subtlety, and much of these connections come from the various characters that recur later in the form of simply repeating, word for word, lines that they've already uttered in the sequels. McDiarmid's script is unfortunately particularly laden with this. Then again, the script in general is overall poor--filled to the brim with cheesy declarations like ""It's over; I have the high ground!"" and a prolonged scream of ""No!!!"" that makes William Shatner's ""Khan!!!"" in Star Trek II seem like Shakespeare in comparison.It's a good thing this movie is so damn pretty and the fight scenes so enthralling. They were all along, really, it's just this movie has so many MORE of them than TPM and AotC. It's not directed or written any better than they are, it simply removes a lot of what has been bad all along and replaces it with more of what's been good all along, in the process combining it with material that's only as powerful as it is because of the three original films. And while it does finally form the SW films into one cohesive epic, it does so in a way that never approaches, much less exceeds, the inherent quality of its material. While I will give this a 7/10, that grade is more for the special effect crews and the composer than anything more substantial.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Heros hanging from edges,"One can relate this Stars Wars installment to a roller coaster ride in a fantastic theme park. You know exactly what to expect, you know its not going to go off the track, and you know that things will be whizzing past you too fast to truly observe and absorb the stage.The heroes were hanging from edges once more, immune to barrages of enemy fire. The overall storyline is worthy of the memorable epic that Star Wars is but I felt that it lacked the intelligence in details that makes a movie timeless.Many times you will be left with the desire to pause the moment and appreciate the hard work that Mr.Lucas has put into creating monumental structures and planetary environments populated by his fascinating creatures.

A Fitting Conclusion of the Star Wars Saga?,"OK...I just finished watching the movie, about 30 minutes ago. All in all, the movie was good,, at the same time, I do have some complaints. There are a couple parts in the movie that do not follow the storyline set in the original trilogy (I fear that I can not be more specific without giving away the ending). Another complaint that I have is that the dialog in the movie, especially that of Samuel L Jackson (Mace Windu) and Natalie Portman (Padme Amadala), seems somewhat weak...as if it was ""dumbed down""(for lack of a better term). I am a big Star Wars fan, having loved the movies for years, and followed the story further, through reading the books. This movie was no different, I enjoyed it quite a bit, but was saddened by the lapses in detail and dialog.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Where's the beef...,"Part of my beef, is now 3 movies deep into the prequels... Palpatine and Anakin are still essentially normal ""good"" citizens. Their transformation is rushed, unbelievable, and mindless. The Sith needed to be more developed overall... and unfortunately there's no evil here to speak of, just some dopey fretting and rather conspicuous manipulation. Why should we care if the powerful Jedi's can only beat up some non-firing security-guard robots, and then some crusty Senator out of the blue can kick 3 Jedis and Samuel Jackson's ***... That's just resolving an outcome that's already been decided, with zero narrative to lead us there. It's like if Trent Lott suddenly had Jet Li's fighting skills and Nicolai Tesla's ability to fire electricity... with no explanation.For that matter, my second larger ""Industrial Light and Magic"" beef is this... these are pre-quels. The technology should be say, older and more primitive to the 4th New Hope installment. Why does the technology seem to be more advanced in these ""older"" movies, and seem to get more and more complex with each prequel... to the point we have R2D2 jumping, having the ability to catch items thrown to him... it's just dumb. The pointless waterwheel battle on wooki-oine...there's a scene where you almost expect to see Chewbacca water skiing... it's absurd. And stupid dragonfly ships. That whole planet battle scene looked like a bad Johnny Quest than a SW epic struggle. A friend mentioned a lot of the CGI ""concepts"" were stolen from various Japanese anime, like Obiwans' lizard steed... and this cut and paste aesthetic shows through as a desperation move by someone short on imagination. ""Um yeah, have uh, one of your creative team sketch something up for me, I'll be at soccer practice and okay it later.... wow, that looks 'different', sure let's go with it."" This corporate design-by-committee style just makes the prequel series totally bland and utterly uninspired.Gone is the sense of scale that made the originals powerful... the first image of the Star Destroyer filling the screen, the Jawa sandcrawler lumbering along, slowly being drawn into a monstrous moon-sized battleship, or massive dinosaur sized Walkers... those designs generated a sense of awe via scale, and convey power without overkill. As opposed to attempting to create awe via sheer mass volume... 2 light sabers... then four light sabers... millions of boring toaster-headed clones... spamming the viewer with millions of ships on screen battling all over the place. That's not dramatic or impressive or awe inspiring... it's spamming the audience with volume, quantity over quality.This prequel series was a pathetic missed opportunity... at the very least they could have had Spielberg direct one of them, alas Indiana Jones, just to bring back some wonder, real action, and real direction.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A fine end to the saga,"The final installment of the prequel trilogy is the best film among the three- which isn't saying much at all. Revenge of the Sith is a dark movie and even its few lighthearted moments come under a cloud of grim expectations. Although Revenge of the Sith is the third volume of the prequel trilogy, its quality places it alongside A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars has to offer. Its flaws are easily forgiven; it offers the same successful blend of high energy sci-fi melodrama, epic tragedy, and satisfying storytelling provided by Episodes IV and V. In many ways, Revenge of the Sith is the most important chapter of the first six episodes and, until its release, the Star Wars saga remained incomplete. Revenge of the Sith exists not only as a fine chapter in its own right but its existence improves the other five segments, adding context and depth not only to the two other prequels but to all three members of the original trilogy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not totally flawless but certainly the best of the prequels and also the most entertaining,"Almost thirty years in the making, George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" space opera has finally reached its conclusion (or has it?) and we are now able to judge the series as a whole.The good news is that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is not only the best of the prequels, but the darkest installment since ""The Empire Strikes Back."" The bad news is that it isn't half as good as ""Empire"" and not even as entertaining as ""Return of the Jedi."" The good news is that Jar-Jar Binks is only in one scene and doesn't say a single word. The bad news is that cartoon-ish CGI action sequences take his place and add to Lucas' increasingly childish ambitions.There's more good news and bad news. The fan-reviled Hayden Christensen, as Anakin Skywalker, has less dialogue than he did in ""Attack of the Clones."" Also, less time is spent on the love story between he and Padme (Natalie Portman). Unfortunately, when he does speak, or when they are required to be intimate, the movie stumbles  Christensen delivers every line in the same monotonous boredom that his devolution into the dark side doesn't seem all that big a deal  except for dark circles under his eyes and a jaundiced complexion, he appears identical to his earlier self. Another flaw in Lucas' story is that Anakin's decision to become a Sith Lord is too sudden; although there is ample emotional conflict in Anakin's past and present leading up to this, Lucas spends such little time detailing these feelings that Anakin really doesn't carry much weight as a character; when he turns, we don't feel anything significant is happening.The fault really lies within the material itself. Lucas should have employed a talented co-writer to polish up the script, as he did for the original trilogy. Not to sound unfair, but Lucas is simply no Mamet or Tarantino. His exchanges are clumsy, awkward and occasionally nonsensical. Lucas adds a mythic vibe to his jargon that is unnecessary; for example, his referral to children as ""younglings,"" or the whole ""Thy will shall be done Master"" attitude. I know it's supposed to take place ""a long time ago,"" but that doesn't mean it has to sound quite as fake as it does. (The actors' sordid delivery doesn't help much, either.) In terms of new characters, the one everybody's been talking about is General Grievous, a half-alien/half-mechanical hybrid with special abilities. Disappointingly, however, Grievous is a huge letdown. As a villain, the robotic General is hardly menacing; it's hard to fear a character that incessantly coughs, wheezes and cowardly runs away every time a conflict occurs. Not only is Grievous a wimp, but also when he finally reveals his four lightsaber-wielding robotic limbs, the pay-off is anti-climactic  in less than a minute he's handless. I am told he was much scarier in the animated ""Clone War"" films; let's hope so.It seems as if I'm complaining a lot, huh? Not really. These are just some of the things I disliked about ""Sith."" On the plus side, the last hour of ""RotS"" turns into a brooding, menacing feature; like ""The Return of the King,"" the entire layering of the film itself becomes clouded, caustic and caliginous  somber shades oozing through every frame.The final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin was far more exciting and entertaining than I thought it would be  coming from someone who feels the novelty of the lightsaber battles faded away with the quality of the predecessors. Instead, I found Obi-Wan and Anakin's fierce showdown is emotional and tragic  it is also centerpiece to the best moments of acting in the entire new trilogy (Obi-Wan shouting at Anakin about how he failed him is pessimistic, depressing and real -- arguably the most genuine sample of dialogue from any other prequel.) The reappearance of Darth Vader could probably have been presented slightly more dramatically than it is here (inter-cut with birth/funeral sequences), and Lucas' modifications to the famous suit  namely the thinner face area, more rounded helmet and distinctly fake-looking mid-section  make it look like a Halloween costume. But then the heavy breathing is heard and we all know, Darth Vader is back! Yoda gets some good scenes here and there's a cameo from an old friend halfway through the movie. The parts involving Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) are very entertaining and his battle with Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) is exciting. There are some really dark moments (such as Darth Vader's unexpected killing spree), even if they don't always feel totally genuine.Overall, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is not a flawless film and it does not solve all of the problems inherent in the other prequels. But (and this is a big ""but"") Lucas DOES fix up some stuff  as I mentioned above, Jar-Jar is pretty much gone, the lightsaber battles are more exciting, and most importantly the last hour picks up such a relentless, ferocious pace that it almost entirely redeems the earlier misfires. On top of that, it's stuffed with nostalgic references to the original trilogy that will surely whet every fan's lustful appetite.So while I can't necessarily say ""Revenge of the Sith"" is bereft of the criticisms of the other prequels, it's a generally solid closure to the trilogy and definitely the best of the three ""Star Wars"" prequels. I was willing to ignore many of its flaws because I was having such a fun time  and to be honest I think that's partly the case with every film in the entire ""Star Wars"" saga. The difference here, as compared to ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" is that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is actually an entertaining movie  and as a result you'll probably be willing to enjoy it as such and disregard the more frustrating moments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than 1 and 2, but still disappointing.","Visual effects alone do not make a movie. George Lucas should've learned this after Jar-Jar Binks bombed in Episode 1.What I didn't like...

Best of the 'new' trilogy,"This is the best out of the latest three star wars films, and possibly up there with ROTJ in my opinion. The action scenes are definitely the best in the whole series, and there are very few 'flat' moments throughout the film. As is expected, some of the dialogue is a little bit woeful but this has never been one of Lucas' strong points, and in a way this is a part of Star Wars for me. I'd probably say that you have to have watched the other movies to get the most out of this episode, as it ties up some loose ends very nicely. Good points - Very little Jar Jar Binks, lots of 'climactic scenes' (each action scene seems to be bettered by the next), decent Yoda fight scene. Bad points - Doesn't seem to be enough internal emotional conflict before anakin 'turns', Padme/Anakin's relationship doesn't seem to ring true (Lucas' dialogue) To summarise, I'd like to say that I'm not a die-hard star wars fan, but this film made me want to run home and put the original trilogy on...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The easiest to tolerate?,"""I can't watch anymore"". I understand you, but that really refers more to the entire Prequel Trilogy. When you put a line like that in... I mean, just look at the title of Intolerable Cruelty, and the tag of The Matrix Revolutions. But yes, my summary refers to the most recent three. And it does, indeed, not take into account how frenetic this can be. There's a healthy dose of action, and some of it does work... but much is overdone. The light-saber stuff varies, but some bits, with how casual its participants are, while the intent surely was to make it look cool, it just takes away the sense of danger, and the thrill and excitement go with it. At times, the fights are done in medium shots, which doesn't help any. The battle scenes, for really the only time in any of these movies, lack any kind of sense of progression, you can never tell who's winning, and it renders them little more than visual spectacles. The effects are amazing, I do give them that. Do the cameos add, or merely detract? The dialog(though it does have moments) and acting(come on, Hayden, you're better elsewhere... so's essentially everyone else) still need work. More holes in the overall canon exist from what is seen and heard in this. This does try to, and to some extent, succeeds in, bridging the gap. The efforts do range between abruptly sudden and too slow, but the middle is reached at least for portions. It's dark in tone, and this is fairly well-achieved. My conclusion after having viewed the entire PT in succession is that Lucas started where it would have been fine to end... Phantom Menace feels classic, and to me, it scores the highest marks as far as being entertaining goes. After that, it just went further and further, and the emotion and how memorable they were declined at the same rate. I imagine few will argue that George has too many yes-men around him, or for that matter that he clearly did not have the entire series in his mind whilst working on any one of the individual films. I would like to point out that I am neither a disgruntled fan nor someone who grew up with the OT and/or experienced a lot of hype for these. The DVD has over a dozen featurettes(of varying length), trailers, TV-spots, cut out material and a commentary track. I recommend this to those who wish to take in all of the canon cinema releases. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A must see movie,"After a poor start, Lucas seems to be back on track and at his finest. The attack of the clones was a well scripted and fine instalment for the star wars saga, however nothing had prepared me for the finale.With an explosive start and action from the offset this film was a pleasure to watch, pure poetry in motion.I had my doubts about Ewen McGregor, but he pulled through in the end, giving his finest performance of Obi One to date (one I am sure Sir Aleck would have been proud of).The rise of Lord Vader and slow Demise of Anakin Sky walker was one of the best character changes ever shown on the big screen, all questions answered, all aspects of the original taken into account, the subtle way a lot of old faces made appearances tied all the star wars films together nicely completing this overwhelming intergalactic experience.In short and hopefully not giving any of the plot away, this film is visually and musically stunning which will without doubt make it go down in history as an epic along side its 28 year old brothers, making Mr. Lucas's Mail box burst at the seams with millions of letters begging the Sci Fi Master to once again pick up his pen and pen down the final 3 instalments in the magnificent 9 part series we all know and love asStar WarsA truly awe inspiring climax through the first 3 instalments in this electrifying saga",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

But even then, and after having to endure sickeningly cute Vader (""Wizard!"") and petulant adolescent Vader (""They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM"") I still had hope for the final part of the trilogy. Surely that would be good, I thought. Only a moron could screw that up. And after all the good reviews, I thought that finally, at long last, Lucas had delivered another fine Star Wars film. Cue disgust then when Lucas not only produced a terrible Star Wars film but the worst one of all.There are many low points in the film but the worst has to be the Vader transformation. It's the bit that everyone has been waiting to see. It's the bit that is supposed to make the trilogy worthwhile. So imagine my disgust when Vader lumbers from the operating table like a constipated Frankenstein and when he cries ""Nooooooooooooo!"" in Seymour Skinner style when he hears that his wife has died. Pathetic. Now, when I watch the original trilogy, I'm only going to see a melodramatic drama queen under that tin can helmet.But I still don't even know why Anakin turned to the dark side. The plot just didn't make any sense. Anakin had some bad dreams, got worried about his wife and then turned to the dark side to protect them? Eh? What? It's absolute rubbish. And it's amazing how stupid Anakin is. Palpatine tells him a story about a ""person he knew"" and how this ""person"" had known a powerful Sith Lord. This ""person"" then learnt many things from this Sith Lord, including how to extend life. However, this ""person"" then killed this Sith Lord in his sleep. Hmm. I wonder who this person was? Gosh, it's a puzzle... But because of one or two bad dreams Anakin decides to trust this slimy scumbag on the off chance that his dream will come true. Of course, the dream only comes true when Anakin attacks his wife. Ooh, so it was a self-fulfilling prophecy? Oh, aren't you clever, George? Let me bow down before your writing genius.Er, or maybe not.But I just hate the idea of Vader being so stupid. What it amounts to is that he was tricked into becoming a bad guy. He had a few worries, some bloke came along and used them to his advantage, and there you go, he's evil. It's terrible. When the trilogy started I was looking forward to a nuanced story. I wanted it to be haunting, to be tragic and to be dark as hell. I wanted Vader to be truly troubled. What I didn't want was a pouting idiot with an inferiority complex. Unfortunately, that's what I got.However, the other bad guys are useless too. Especially the much hyped General Grievous. With a name like that you'd imagine a hard-as-nails villain. Instead you get a spluttering moron whose party-trick is to take four lightsabers and twirl them and attack windmill style. It's the equivalent of me getting into fight, twirling my arms, and running forward at full speed. Needless to say General Grievous cops it to a man with three less lightsabers.In fact, that villain, and everything else in the film, makes me wonder what the motivation was for these characters. I can just picture some animator or Lucas saying, ""Wouldn't it be cool if..."" or ""Wouldn't it be neat if..."" But of course, it's not neat and it's not cool. Just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should. I'm actually really pleased that Lucas made the original films when he did. It meant that he couldn't indulge every whim and that he had to focus on trivial matters such as story. After all, the originals have cracking stories. They may not be high art, and they may have hokey bits of dialogue, but at least they make sense. The new films on the other hand make no sense whatsoever. The plots are needlessly complicated, and not complicated in a good way. After all, I think that I'm a pretty smart guy. I can make my way through a dense story. But this story is only dense in the sense that it's incredibly stupid. All the talking seems to be an excuse to move to another bland piece of action. It doesn't matter that the plot is impenetrably fuzzy.But what about the action? Is it ""kewl""? Does it ""kick ass""? No, it doesn't. It's like watching someone play a computer game. It's tiresome and uninvolving. The only difference is that the graphics are better.Ah, but what about the final battle I hear you say. Surely that must be good. Well, it's okay, I guess. Although having said that, for the most part it's pretty forgettable. The best lightsaber battle is the one in Return of the Jedi when Luke fights Vader. It has passion and bags of emotion. This, however, is full of pointless gimmicks - they climb onto a tower and it falls and over and they float across the lava on little robots while trying to strike one another. I love the lava backdrop but they should have kept it simple. It needs intensity not stupid ""bits of business"". But having said that, the battle does contain the one thing that I liked in the film. I loved it when Anakin got his legs chopped off and when he caught fire. Now that was ""kewl""! Pity that Lucas had to mess up that piece of brutality with his embarrassing ""Noooooooo!""",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas finally again creates a very good movie,"George Lucas crafted a wonderful film in the original Star Wars, then turned directing duties over to others for the next two films (which resulted in The Empire Strikes Back, one of the great SF films, and Return of the Jedi, a very good film in its own right). But he retook the helm, insisting on directing, writing, and editing the three prequels.The first two prequels -- The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones -- were frustrating. They were by and large enjoyable films, good films even, but they should have been much better. Tighter editing, better dialog, and someone who was willing to tell Lucas ""George, drop the dumb Jar Jar 'humor' "" would have vastly improved them.Now, Lucas has completed the cycle, and Revenge of the Sith is a film worthy to stand next to the films in the original trilogy, and in fact in some ways ranks close to The Empire Strikes Back. Lucas seems to have rediscovered what made those films great -- tight editing, interesting lighting and camera angles (which Star Wars did not have, but Empire and to a lesser degree Jedi did), a good story. Add to this a depth that the original Star Wars did not have. (Let's face it, it wasn't until Empire that we really go character development.) Sith tells in convincing fashion how a good person can go bad -- who even realizes that he is going bad as he's doing it, but who can't pull himself out of the spiral). It's compelling and at times heart wrenching. And it features scenes we've waited years (in some cases, 28 years for), such as the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan (which was spectacular).A few other points worth noting. The soundtrack is incredible. Williams has turned it into a grand opera of sorts. And the effects are quite innovative; the space scenes are much darker than in previous films, and this makes a positive impact. And Lucas does indeed tie up the lose ends that everyone was wondering about.What doesn't work? The dialog could have been better in point. Oh, there's nothing that's outright awful (unlike in Attack of the Clones), but on the other hand, it doesn't sparkle the way the dialog in Empire did. And in a few cases, I would have like to have seen a bit more of a few of the characters, to better understand why they did some things. (Why doesn't Obi-Wan try to stop the Jedi council from asking Anakin to do something he knows is wrong, for example?) But overall, it was a wonderful film. It's good to see Lucas finish things off in grand style, after making two lesser films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas finally gets the finger out,"When the release date loomed, fans all over the world were looking forward with a perverse delight to seeing how Lucas could screw up the final prequel. The stilted, eat-a-dirty-boot dialogue of the previous episodes, combined with plots that tied themselves up in knots, gave Revenge Of The Sith so much to make up for. What it manages to do, aside from exactly that, is prove that Lucas had been capable of much better in 1999 and 2002. ROTS essentially stops and balances the fantasy special effects with the aim of the story, giving it a much more resonant edge. Most of the characters seem far more three-dimensional, and the demises that the Jedi meet have impact, something that nobody who had seen only the previous two Star Wars films would have ever expected. When I went to see the first session on the East Coast this evening, it was the first time in the entire prequel trilogy that I heard applause as the credits rolled.Okay, the film isn't all good. Some of the shots during the duel sequences really don't fit or are unclear. Some of the dialogue still seems a bit daft. When Anakin is expressing his fear of losing Padmé to Padmé, groans could be heard from the audience as the threat of more daft dialogue loomed. Thankfully, Lucas instead chose to concentrate on the corruption of Anakin as a character. The result is that Natalie Portman's role is reduced to somewhere between cameo and support, but she was never a highlight of the prequels, anyway. Hayden Christensen is far less whiny in this episode. It even manages to make one forget about the whining fit he had in the previous film. But the real surprise here is Ian McDiarmid, who manages to provide all the dramatic support for both Anakin's conversion to the dark side and the transition of the galaxy from Republic to Empire. I never thought I would say this, but this prequel actually featured good acting with actors who did not seem lost as to what they were meant to be reacting to.Some of this film is a bit badly-planned. How Darth Sidious disposes of Darth Tyranus and takes Darth Vader as an apprentice seems hasty. Given that Christopher Lee was about the only thing in the previous episode that worked, he deserved a little better than this. Sometimes the inter cutting of action on one planet to another works. Several times, however, it is as jarring as the constant location-hopping that took place in the previous two episodes. The story still suffers a little because the audience can get confused as to where they're meant to be. Fortunately, the actual story being told reduces this problem to a minor irritant.The dependency on having seen the original three films still remains, although this is the first time since 1977 that a Star Wars film can make sense on its own for more than half its running length. The secret lies in choosing to focus upon the Sith rather than the Jedi. As Ian McDiarmid twists the intentions and creedo of the Jedi around, we get to see things from another perspective that enables us to understand what the Force is and how it enables its users to do what they do, without having to ask fans of the original series. On the other hand, this prequel still relies on the earlier films to make audiences care why this youth suddenly becomes the symbol of fear in the galaxy. While the suit is being applied, and later as the suited Vader is throwing a fit or standing on the bridge with the Emperor, Lucas is clearly pandering to the same fans that he has recently derided for their criticisms of earlier prequels. That I am telling you this film is what The Phantom Menace and especially Attack Of The Clones (or Attack Of The Clods as I like to think of it) should have been, and am over the age limit Lucas has specified, should tell you something.Lucas' bragging about how this film earned a PG-13 rating at the MPAA is also pretty baseless. Attack Of The Clods also received the OFLC's equivalent rating of M. Both films are a pretty softcore M at that, and audiences above the age of five will have no trouble with this film. Assuming they understand what words like ""pregnant"" or ""dying"" mean. No, Lucas' claim that the children should be left home for this outing is purely a publicity stunt, and a fairly ill-conceived one at that. Not that parental guidance isn't recommended, but people who honestly believe that this film will leave their children with permanent psychological scars honestly need to get out more. It is worth noting that what violence is shown in this prequel is shown in a fairly theatrical manner. About the only time we get to see the consequences of the violence shown in this film is when Darth Vader is permanently burned into Anakin, so to speak. Otherwise, it is all strictly elliptical ""bang!"" ""you got me!"" fare here.If I had to give Revenge Of The Sith a rating, it would be nine out of ten. Yes, it is directed by a man who still doesn't realise that being told ""no"" is one of the greatest favours you can receive, and the promised answers to a few questions still haven't come, but otherwise, this is the best film of 2005. I bet nobody ever thought an old cynic like me would say that about a George Lucas film. I certainly didn't. Essentially, this is everything that the previous two Star Wars films should have been, and more. If you haven't seen it yet, and need your faith in creative souls who have more money than sense rekindled, then take the time to get into your local theatre now. You'll be glad you did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Even if you're not a Star Wars fan,"You MUST leap, run, skip, hitchhike... whatever it takes... to see this movie! I can't even begin to stress just how AWESOME this movie was! STOP reading here to avoid spoiler! It even made me cry(OK maybe not... but I almost did...when Padme tells Anakin he's breaking her heart I teared up a little...Natalie was great and her costumes were gorgeous, especially her death garb) I LOVED IT! Mace Windu's death scene with the Chancellor was pretty spectacular although not as amazing as Obi-wan's fight scene with Anakin aka Darth Vader. Really though... even ignoring the special effects, this was a beautifully shot movie. The first 2 episodes were just ehhh but this one definitely gets some oohs and ahhhs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Delayed Negative Reaction....,"When I first saw this film I was looking forward to it a lot like many other people. Yet after-wards I had mixed feelings about how Lucas ended an otherwise seamless saga. Unlike some, I didn't think the other prequels sucked. Episode I was a introduction so I could understand that we wouldn't see scads of Anikan in the first film. Episode II was good besides Anikan's whining and no Darth Maul. Yet Episode III was somewhat disappointing...It took until now to really realize how many faults there where... For starters, Anikan's fall to the dark side was not gradual enough. After he helps in Mace Windu's death he has the right reaction but then when confronted with an obviously evil Palpatine he surrenders to the dark side. Now by then I was like ""ok..."" but then he leads an army of clone troops to kill off all the Jedi in the temple just like that !The dialogue was not that bad but it wasn't up to par to the original trilogy. I agree with everyone 100% when they say George Lucas should not have written the script nor directed. As a producer and editor of the script and directive process I can see, but Lucas does not have what it takes to make his own story go out with a bang! Empire Strikes Back was written and directed by other people with George Lucas still involved and it worked out beautifully. Yet despite having that formula for the ultimate Star Wars movie he went back and did all that work for nothing.ROTS has it's good points but they are few and far between. The only actors that really made me impressed where Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee (who was screwed out of his screen time) and Ian McDiarmid. I'm sure Natilie Portman, Sameul L. and Hayden Christensen are good actors but they where denied by the sub-par script.I also must question Lucas for dropping the audience a bunch of characters and events only the most hardcore of Star Wars fans would recognize. Prime example is General Greivous and his coughing... many people don't know why he is coughing because it is not told in the film but only in the animated Clone Wars series that only 20% of the audience would have seen the episode that explains what happened prior to ROTS. Also Greivous despite being the major villain in this film is denied any justice by being beaten quickly. The whole film was rushed because of George Lucas's silly wipes and long introductions that don't tell anything. I also found it weird that he threw Chewbacca into the mix, created a plot hole with Padme dying when Leia was just born and making Darth Vader seem less ""scary"".I know I'm echoing a lot from what others have said but I guess the feeling is mutual. At first I liked the film but I think I was in denial... I didn't change my mind just because some people thought it sucked but I reevaluated the scenes after seeing the film a second time. After the fan enthusiasm and excitement was washed away after the first showing I realized these glaring errors that seemed to fall short of many a fan's expectations.There where some good points however... The score for the film by John Williams was one of the best I have heard in all the Star Wars films. If anything was excellent that was it.The action and lightsaber battles where satisfying especially the Dooku vs. Anikan & Obi-Wan fight. If only it lasted longer...Seeing the Taintive IV... C-3P0 golden and R2-D2 being a bad ass was very good. Even though the majority of the so-called ""comedic relief"" was lame I liked R2-D2's antics. Who needs Jar-Jar Binks when you have R2 in a scene? In all, ROTS wasn't what I thought it was... yet I'm still going to be a Star Wars fan but ROTS is not the best in the six films made. I will get it on DVD but don't expect it to be ""the best"" or a masterpiece in the Star Wars saga. It was enjoyable but not the bang that we all expected.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Why the Hate?,"I'll tell you why. Mr. George Lucas has taken the Star Wars myth, one of modern cultures most well known stories, populated with some of the worlds most beloved characters, and completely and irrevocably flushed it all down the toilet. For many others and me Lucas is a legend killer. I won't go into the gruesome details of this failure that so many others have already cataloged but will say that the blunders are legion. What is most frustrating is the total wasted opportunity. Lucas had the money, the resources, and the creative control to produce an epic, a timeless tale about the Rise of an Empire and the Fall of a Man, that surpassed the Original Trilogy and entered the pantheon of cinemas greatest accomplishments. Oh, what could've been? Instead we get ridiculous situations, phony characters, non-existent motivations, and fart jokes. Ugh! It should be noted that on the best of the OT, ESB, Lucas had the least collaboration. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Also, I do understand why these ""movies"" receive so much praise and adulation. It's the same reason why some people believe that professional wrestling is real and others believe that there is a dime's worth of difference between the Republican and Democrat parties.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Epic Conclusion !!!,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions when I think about ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith."" It's the film that finally brought the prequel trilogy to a close and bridged the gap between the old and new generations of Star Wars fans. Directed by George Lucas, this installment had the monumental task of tying up loose ends, explaining the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, and setting the stage for the original trilogy. In many ways, it succeeded brilliantly, earning my rating of 8/10.In conclusion, ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is a satisfying and emotionally charged conclusion to the prequel trilogy. It successfully ties together the threads of the prequels and sets the stage for the beloved original trilogy. While it may not be without its flaws, its visual spectacle, intense lightsaber duels, and tragic character arcs make it a must-see for Star Wars fans. It's a film that reminds us of the enduring power of the Force and the timeless appeal of this beloved franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Decent wrap up to the saga,"Caught up with SITH at the famous Cinerama Dome in Hollywood (where the fans SHOULD have been lining up instead of the Chinese where it ISN'T playing!). Can't say I can add much to what has been said already. Basically, I would agree that it's a generally satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and a marked step up from the previous two turgid entries. The final reel or so really takes flight and wraps things up nicely.The action and effects are the highlights, but Ewan McGregor and, particularly, Ian McDiarmid (who gives as good a performance as any actor in any STAR WARS film; which makes it doubly disappointing that he is buried under a silly Halloween mask for the last third of the film diluting his powerful portrayal) hold their own amongst the digital jungle. And, I'd agree that the dialogue is fairly rote and uninspiring - far too on the nose and explaining things and events that we either see for ourselves (character motivations and actions) or care little about (the tiresome political machinations). Natalie Portman, Hayden Christiansen and, of course, Samuel L. Jackson, have all shown talent in OTHER films, but again just seem stiff and lost under Lucas' direction (and dialogue). I can't pinpoint exactly WHAT is the problem, but all three seem utterly flummoxed as to how to breathe life into their parts.As these films are about larger than life actions and events, the failings of the screenplay and much of the acting are overcome overall, but there's a critical element lost in the tragedy of Annakin's turning to the dark side - we don't FEEL it. We KNOW it's a sad thing in our heads, but don't have a palpable sense of loss. Did anybody have an equal emotional tie to Annakin's downfall as they did to say... Luke finding out Darth was his father? That Leia and Luke were twins? That Obi Wan was now just part of the Force? That Jar-Jar was going to have increasingly smaller roles in each succeeding film? Grin (heck, I didn't even see him in SITH, though I heard he's in there somewhere!)On a technical note, I know that Lucas uses the finest Digital equipment in the world (as does the Cinerama on the projection end), but I still can't warm up to the way it looks. For SFX, Landscapes and brightly lit scenes, it can look fine. But, Digital still can't show BLACK. Real dark deep rich BLACK! It's just this sort of murky grey. I'd hate to imagine a Film Noir done in digital! And Digital still seems to have a dickens of a time trying to compensate when a room is naturally lit and there are exterior windows shining bright light in.Trivia: Nice to see one last Christopher Lee-Peter Cushing pairing if only as a prosthetic Cushing. Lee in both the STAR WARS and LOTR trilogies really acquitted himself marvelously methinks.Can anybody explain to me where R2D2's mobility went in the Episodes IV thru VI ?Same goes with Yoda! I mean it's only about 20 years between SITH and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (a pittance to a 900 year old being!), yet YODA somehow can't leap and fly about like Bruce Lee anymore, nor exert a fraction of the Force's powers! I guess this is just an area where Lucas figures nobody is going to really call him on it, because the more mobile Yoda and R2 ""just look really cool when they zip around!!""",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely in the Top 3 of the Star Wars Movies,"All the Star Wars Movies have had something special and different. Many people think the first 2 prequels were terrible but I think they were just right. Yes, there was some corny acting and confusing scenes, but you had to give it some hope, how else would you have told the story of the prequels. You couldn't copy the plot from the first 3 movies instead Lucas created a fine set of movies and something new and very fitting. To conclude, I think Revenge Of The Sith was a perfect finish to the prequels and more importantly, a perfect lead up to A New Hope. I'm very excited to see Star Wars The Force Awakens tomorrow and I'm sure Disney won't fail.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The ending in the middle,"This ending in the middle, following the curious episodes order of the Star Wars Saga fits very well in the circle, and this seems to have been the main goal of Director George Lucas. By the end of the film not only we know how Anakin Skywalker turned into Darth Vader, but we also fit many other pieces of the puzzle at the right place. That's good.On the other hand, this Episode 3 also has many of the flaws to be found in the other installments, especially in the more recent prequel films. The effects are superb, and I can be only sorry because I saw this film on small screen, on DVD, due to being busy or lazy or both. Poor excuse, I know and I am sure I have missed much of the experience only a theater viewing can give. But, and this is the big but, colors are superb, certainly computers graphics are very good, but we have already seen better for example 'Van Helsing' the last one in the LOTR series. Moreover the surprise of seeing a full new world brought on screen from pure imagination that we had in the first 'Star Wars' 28 years ago is not there any longer.And then it's the acting. Hayden Christensen is simply not at the level required by such a film and I would almost say 'like son, like father' because a similar thing happened to Mark Hamill, who played Skywalker's son in the next series (chronology-wise) filmed 28 years earlier. Natalie Portman is OK, but there is no chemistry between the two and the love story simply does not make it from the screen. Not that dialogs help too much, they are too close to chip science fiction, and the exception, the memorable 'This is how democracy dies - in thundering applause' seems more like targeting contemporary politics.Satr Wars fans will love the film, as everything coming from the Lucas studios. Good cinema fans will raise some brows. I am a little bit of the two, so I am a soul divided by now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't Be Jaded,"........I so very rarely write anything on these boards, but I do always read through them.....to at least see other opinions on a film. Look, I'm 29 years old, and have been a Star Wars fan for life. My first tattoo at 17 was a Rebel Alliance symbol. I've watched and re-watched the original trilogy no doubt hundreds of times. When I used to write film reviews for The Prodigal Sun (Buffalo, NY) I almost always tried to find a way to weave a Star Wars reference into my reviews. Even after I joined the military, and went overseas, and got stationed thousands of miles from my home, I sought out Star Wars fans to associate with, to talk with, to bring back memories with....to watch the prequels at the theaters with. I too was severely disappointed in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. But, after seeing Revenge of the Sith, that disappointment had evolved into satisfaction, even pure enjoyment. Yes, there is cringe inducing dialogue, painful ""romantic"" scenes to endure, and for lack of a better word, childish occurrences and pandering. I'm not going to be your typical fan boy and point out each instance....you fans know what they are. But let's be honest: the original trilogy has its puerile moments as well. It's just that we view them through the rose colored glasses of youth and nostalgia. They transport us back to different times in our lives. They are most definitely superior, but we remember/view/regard them differently. A New Hope was a breath of fresh air to an era plagued by Vietnam, Watergate, the gasoline crisis, etc...Their sequels were highly anticipated because they were fresh and new. But folks, we have aged, and our viewpoints have changed, and we have become jaded filmgoers. I ask you to do as I did, and go see the film with fresh eyes, and marvel at the spectacle, the effects, the score, the mythos....and you will not be disappointed. Just enjoy it as true summer cinema, not a ""raping of your childhood"" or whatever the hardcore critics have deemed the new trilogy. These new films will never equal the original....they simply can't. Star Wars is a cultural presence by now, but even by Return of the Jedi, the critics and haters sprung up, and the myth had tarnished. If you don't believe me, just use your beloved internet to do some searching on old reviews and articles. So, for all this film's faults, go see it without being bitter and jaded, and you will enjoy it....completely.

This movie aged much better...,"As a dude who was born in the 2000s and grew up with these as a kid instead of the old trilogy, I feel like this rendition gets unjust hate. Although the acting could be shoddy in the first two entries, by this movie I feel like the actors have came into their own, and the story the fall of Anakin Skywalker is by far the best out of any movie in the franchise. There's tragedy, there's sadness and it all comes together in possibly the best lightsaber fight in any of the movies. The stunning visuals, use of the environment, and just the movement and stunts themselves is insane in this movie, especially for the final fight. And while the campy originals are beloved by older fans, I feel like this movie stands the test of time as an actual film with a story that feels equal parts tragedy and hopeful. I think it's the best Star Wars movie, and while that may be controversial, I believe it fully.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the rubbish ones,"Last in the collection of Star Wars prequels is a good film, but absolutely nothing more.I detect a lot of the hysteria surrounding Episode 3, particularly on this website, is more down to overwhelming relief that it is nowhere near as awful as the drivel which preceded it. However, it is likewise nowhere near as good as any of the 'last' 3 either.As we all know, this episode centres on the switch of Anakin Skywalker to the dark side, aided and abetted by the increasingly evil Chancellor Palpatine. Other key Star Wars developments are realised here too, such as Ob Wan's survival, the birth of Leia and Luke, and the ultimate emergence of Darth Vadar.The movie begins with Anakin and Obi Wan launching an attack on General Grevious' party who've kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, and their saving of the commander.From there on in the plot slowly weaves its way to the conclusions we know from a New Hope.Ewan McGregor is Obi Wan, with Hayden Christensen once again the misguided Anakin. McGregor is his usual understated self, and while he's never anything spectacular, he's more than passable in the role. On the contrary though, Christianson is poor again - OK, maybe poor is harsh, but he's out of his depth as he was in the Clones. Fortunately for him, Natalie Portman's Padme is even more awful than he is, and when there are scenes with just the 2 of them you will do well to stop cringing.However, Iain McDiarmid's Palpatine takes all the acting honours by far here - a great show from him, and he does well to show an evolution from apparent sinister behaviour to pure absolute evil.The CGI is inconsistent at best - some scenes look great, but too often it looks flakey. For example, Obi Wan on the 'creature' that gives him a ride looks completely fake - totally unnatural. On the other hand the expansive city panoramas look fairly good.There is also a generous helping of cheese here, particularly at the end battle. Furthermore, I found that the environment's state leading up to the end battle had miraculously changed based on dramatic license. This won't make much sense now, but watch out for it.The plot in Episode 3 is OK, the acting is wildly varied, the special effects inconsistent. The most solid aspect is probably the direction, even if, as usual, it's a touch too fast for its own good at times.This is basically a decent film, but still not up with the best 3. Still, anything's better than the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's Just Bad,"Unlike the millions who have seen and apparently loved this newest , and supposedly final, installment of the Star Wars saga, I disliked this movie vigorously. Predictably for Star Wars, virtually every aspect of this movie was bad: the acting, the dialogue and that neglected part of summer movies -- what's that now? --, Oh yes, the plot.I realize that people went to this movie to wrap up the threads of story that were hinted at in 1977, and continued along in this latest trilogy, but the movie was just bad. It's first two acts were slow and predictable, leading me to conclude that if this were any other movie it would be denounced as a failure.The only redeeming part of this film was the final act which was rather well-done. The fights were good, the plot picked up and the story was tied together. I sensed in that final act a sense of story, a sense that something was being accomplished. The final 40 minutes of the movie almost made it worth sitting through the first couple of hours.But I'm sorry. You can't legitimately transform a good person into a bad person by using Grade B excuses. The first two-thirds of the movie, excepting some notable fighting, is solely a vehicle to transition the good guy to the bad guy and it's not even done well. I'll grant, as a storyteller, that it's not an easy task to make this transition, but that's because they made the kid from the previous two movies so damn flawless. I mean, give him some legitimate flaws.Give yourself some wiggle room. Otherwise, you're left basically creating idiotic and petulant excuses for someone becoming the ultimate evil. And regardless of whether or not this is the mother of all cult sagas, petulant evil is just that, petulant evil. It doesn't make you fearful in any respect. It's just sad. Andsad is what this transformation is, taking the penultimate bad guy and making him pitiable.Now, I recognize that there are a great many people who will buy tickets just to see the story resolved and that's fine. After all, that's what I did. To that end, you will not feel ripped off. It is abundantly clear that a great deal of love and care was put into creating this cinematic marvel. But let me put it to you this way. If the first trilogy had not created an entirely new standard of SCIFI back in 1977, if that Trilogy had not been made, this would be just like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. It's just a bad movie. However, that first time that an Imperial Star Destroyer crawled across the vastness of those stars, in a time when nothing like that had ever been made, it created a love affair with the past, not necessarily with the movie. And it is my opinion that this is why these movies are so often watched. They lucked out that the story had not been told in that way, with that technology, before. It's as simple as that.In conclusion, if you're looking to be entertained, take a crossword puzzle for the first 100 minutes and then watch the remainder. It really is good. If you're concerned about being ripped off, don't be. It's clear that they put a lot of time and effort into making something spectacular, so you won't feel jipped. but if you're going for a good movie, oh man, you need to look elsewhere because it just ain't here.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not deserving of the hype it got!,"I am and will always remain a Star Wars fan, and after watching episode 1, much as it wasn't fantastic it started the story off with an admirable goal but clearly it was lacking the charisma of the originals. Episode 2 however improved with greater depth of character, fantastic fight scenes and some of that comedy we all relished so much in the originals. Then here we are the last Star Wars instalment, it's been given rave reviews, comments that had me rushing to the cinema to see it! I was I have to say, disappointed. The acting ability seemed somehow to have diminished, in fact it became laughable. Scenes which should have been serious and touching were cringe worthy. Ewan Mcgregor as OB1 almost lost any ability to register emotion and it felt almost pantomime like. I will give some credit to the opening sequence and the fight scenes towards the end of the film, there was great light sabre action and it was only in the last 20 minutes that the film redeemed itself. We were all waiting for Darth Vader lets face it, the first breath through his ventilator was a great cinematic moment, but after that his gesticulations, his manner was inconsistent with the originals, it just looked like some guy wearing the suit! All in all I was not fulfilled by this film, it was like star wars by numbers, all the pieces of the puzzle were there, but the delivery was not up to standard and failed to complete the saga to the level it deserved. Yoda was by far the best thing in it, and he was CG! Maybe a re-watch on DVD might ease the pain, but I doubt it!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars a Major Let Down,"Star Wars has become embedded within today's culture. Everyone has seen at least one of the movies or knows about them. Since the release of Star Wars in 1977 (re-named Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope in 1981 after it was re-released), the once believed failure became a phenomenon, defining a new generation of geeks. Following the release of the original was The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983. Since then, they have been re-released in theaters in 1997 and the prequels Star Wars: Episode I - Phantom Menace and Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones have been released. On May 19, 2005 that last and final episode Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was released and much to my horror did not live up to expectations.The acting in Sith is atrocious. Hayden Christensen, playing Anakin who then becomes Darth Vadar, seems awkward in the part. In Attack of the Clones Christensen seemed a little childish and whiny but it fit the development of him character. However in this movie where supposed to see the beginnings of Vadar, a character well feared and Christianson is still being his usual whiny character. Ian McDiarmid, who plays Supreme Chancellor Palpatine looks as if he is trying to make up for Christianson and tries to be this over the top evil but it just comes off as too much. Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) is mediocre in his role. He pulls is off okay but sometimes if feels like he completely forget how he portrayed the character previously.The bad acting can always be made up with a well written script, but that was not the case for Revenge of the Sith. The dialog and the playful banter between Ewan and Hayden is not funny and does not fit the characters at all. In one of the beginning scenes, Obi-Wan brags to Anakin about the number of times Anakin had saved his life. When I saw this part of the film I was thought it was a dream of Anakin's because it was so off, but it wasn't. Padme, played by Natalie Portman, who was previously written as a strong woman in Attack of the Clones has seem to fallen to the dark side of love. Her character has now become inferior and seems to care less about universal concerns and more about Anakin. She comes off as little teenage girl, hanging onto her boyfriend. Anakin also becomes evil far to quickly. It goes from Anakin being happy about his wife Padme's pregnancy to him calling Palpatine ""Master"". Though the movie drags on for what seems like eternity, the change is far to sudden. Also, Anakin's turning to the dark side lies on the relationship between Anakin and Padme which is hardly shown. There is not much for the viewer to see in their relationship in the movie, so we're left to assume that the two deeply love each other to the point of killing.The digital effects themselves were over the top and fake looking. In the first scene there is a fight scene between Obi-Wan and Anakin versus Count Dooku, a fight the two lost in Attack of the Clones in which Anakin lost an arm. The fight, which seemed unreality to short considering the previous battle was such a struggle, involved some jumps and cartwheels done horribly by CGI. The jumping figures were obviously computer made and just looked funny. Lucas also overused the CGI. When Lucas could have had something real, he instead made it with a computer. For instance, sometimes the clones were without helmet. Instead of having an actor in a suit, Lucas digitally made a body and plopped a head on the image. The result is a hilarious fake looking image.The major turning scenes were also very pitiful. When Samuel L. Jackson signed to play Mace Windu he requested two things - a purple light saber and a good death scene. Jackson got the purple saber but the good death scene Lucas did not deliver on. Jackson ends up following out of a window after being hit, screaming like a fool. The fighting scene between Obi-Wan and Anakin has a good, promising start, but the end made Anakin look pitiful and far from the powerful Darth Vadar. Then of course there is the scene where we scene Darth Vadar, suit and all. This film is the time all Star Wars fans have dreamed of and hoped for. However its completely ruined by over the top acting, yelling and over-dramatizing. I honestly laughed out loud in the theaters when I saw it.There was one good scene in the movie. In the original Star Wars the only jedis left were Yoda and Obi-Wan. So what happened to all the others? The death scene, with music provided by John Williams, truly was well done. The scene shows the unsuspecting Jedis being murdered. The slow motion and music come together for perfect unity. The scene truly brings tears to any true Star Wars fan. This could quite possibly be the best acting by extras in movie history.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a must see for any and all fans. As movie in its Sci-fi genre its okay. However as a movie alone its horrible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thoughts,"Well recently I have just seen Star Wars Revenge of the Sith. I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't a little bit disappointed with the film. Don't get me wrong it was a very good film and it had its strengths and weaknesses, as does any film. A few things that I'm getting a little sick of in movies recently is the reliance on the special and digital effects. It's almost as if Lucas has gotten lazy. Episode 1 through 3 is absolutely bombarded with digital effects. Like Yoda, in Episodes 4-6 Yoda was a puppet and it worked. But in the new ones he's completely computer generated. Another thing, is the comic relief that Lucas threw in there. There was too much and it made the film seem corny. A third thing that I didn't like, was the acting. Hayden Christiansen is not the greatest actor in the world, nor is Natalie Portman. But Hayden played a good Darth Vader and you felt his pain and suffering. All and all it wasn't as good as I was expecting but it was very entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Good Star Wars Addition, Falls Short Of A Great Movie","Sometime between Clones and Sith, I've gained a critical eye. To me, Sith was a minor let-down. It simply did not have the artistic elements I look for in movies now. As with the other prequels, holes can be shot in this story, and many of the characters' actions are not believable. The story had GREAT potential, and REALLY utilized most parts of this, however only after the viewer had read between the lines and patched up most of the holes themselves. (A long-time Star Wars fan will have no problem justifying almost any part of the movie, but typical movie fans will have some problems.) Furthermore, the scenes were over-exaggerated, a trend which has struck Hollywood recently much to my disliking. I go to the movies to watch movies, not to simulate rollercoasters as we whip the camera around a battlefield.However, who in their right mind goes to Star Wars to look purely at the cinematography!? Star Wars is still arguably the most fun series to hit Hollywood. Despite the major differences in technology and style between the original trilogy and the prequels, Sith does a REMARKABLE job connecting the two. In fact, as a film-making enthusiast, I CANNOT IMAGINE they could have made a better transition. It's just unfortunate George Lucas decided to make Episodes I and II SO different from the original trilogy.All in all, good story (if you're willing to do some work and justify its weak points), GREAT POTENTIAL (will stimulate your imagination, even if only to supplement Sith's shortcomings), and altogether an almost perfect transition between new and old. Still, it falls short of being a GREAT film.I will also add, young, curious, eager minds will gladly devour Sith, for accompanying Sith's potential is the ability to read between the lines and develop your own conjectures and answers--a feeling I've not felt since...Empire!8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Circle is now complete,"This is not Lucas' finest, but after seeing what he had to offer for the first of the prequels, that is still an improvement. George Lucas insisted and insisted that he put nine hours a day into writing this film, and wanted a really great product for Star Wars fans to bid farewell to the saga with. Does it match up to original trilogy? No. Is is still worth seeing? Yes. Is it worth seeing several times? I would say so. It answers the most important questions to lead into episode IV. It definitely has some excellent action sequences, combined with eye-popping visuals. And unlike past Star Wars films, Lucas does not make the visual extraneous. They are all over the place, but still solid. The major downfall of this film is the characters. The truth is that you just need Luke, Han and Leia to truly make Star Wars Star Wars. The characters in all the prequels including this one just go through the motions. Compare Padme to Leia. Leia is strong, and fights for the common good with devotion and love for humanity. An occasional smart-Alec line decorates her still loyal determination to the rebellion. Padme is basically in love with Anakin in this film still, and just naively lets Anakin decay into Darth Vader. She is constantly asking him to be more honest with her about everything, and just sits back and worries. Leai would join thfight. Padme just waits around and worries. I was worried she was gonna get suckered into suffering Anakin's fate. At least she has some sense. Yes, you do feel sad when Anakin becomes Darth Vader. It is is especially sad from the perspective of Obi-Wan, and even more so from the perspective of Padme. But I never really felt a great attachment to their romance entering the film, so there was not enough to feel. Still, Natalie Portman does her most with Padme. Not bad for a girl who admittedly grew up, hating Star Wars. Ewan McGregor is definitely Obi-Wan. Everythng about Obi-Wan you envision is in Ewan McGregor. There is a look of loyalty and devotion. And you know he is a character who is determined to preserving the good for all the galaxy. Hayden Crhistansen has shown he knows how to act. He is better off playing a dark, angry, and nearly insane character than he is at playing a winy teenager. And the ways in which you see Chancellor Palpatine seduce Anakin without him even knowing it is eerily appealing. The weakest character was General Grievous. And then, you have Yoda. He becomes interesting at then when he leaves, realizing that he has failed the Jedi council with Anakin, but he is mainly just a pawn in the film. He was exciting to watch fight, but was bland theatrically. There's no other way of putting it. In short though, all the characters just interact with each other to the minimal use. There is no real rapport you feel with with any of them. The action and visual effects were the best in this film. All the shots on Coruscant, Kashyyk, and in space were fabulous. Just give me some more lightsaber duals. The oh so anticipated dual between Obi-Wan and Anakin may not meet up to everyone's expectations, but how could it with that much hype? I mean the dual was quite intense though. The lava sequence, which ends in Anakin almost melting is truly awesome. And it does not get so ghoury, that they are trying to make this a PG-13 movie. The most disappointing fight was between Cont Dooku and Anakin/ Ob-Wan at the beginning. I won't spoil the film with details, but it lacked energy. That is the most I will say. All the battles in the fighters are solid. Do not expect ti be like those in the original trilogy. The republic has some new surprises to use. All in all, the film works. It is not to be classified alongside the original trilogy. Whatever happens, those were three remarkable pieces of film-making that will never be replicated. The force was stronger than ever with George from 1977-1983. But don't let that say that he can not still make a good movie. And now Lucas, I say bring on Indiana Jones IV.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
not too shabby.,"The first thing I thought to myself when I saw the opening space battle was that Lucas' faith in CGI was founded, and I did understand why he opted for CGI as opposed to the old-school models that we found so appealing. It was always said that the beauty of A New Hope was the opening; once the audience bought it, you had them where you wanted them. The same can be said of Revenge of the Sith. It didn't live up to all our expectationsin a way, that'd be hard to dobut with that said, I went out of the cinema thinking that it wasn't too shabby, which is more than what I can say for the memories that were Episode One and (the significantly better) Episode Two. I still don't buy Lucas' statements that the Star Wars story is Anakin's story; I see it as one big mix of nuts.I would recommend that everyone sees it, but the real people who would see it are probably those who've kept up with the story since the beginningin some way, it'd probably mean a lot more to them than it would someone who's riding on the wave of hype that the movie has understandably raised. There were some bits that we'd all cringe atthe perfect example would be the ultracheesy dialogue between Padme and Anakin. But if you think about it, it fits Star Warsand who knows? People from long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away might have spoken like that. And you can definitely feel the matinée-like atmosphere that Lucas has been so desperately trying to raise with the previous two episodes. In a sense, it's like he decided to sit back, relax and roll with this one. I suppose that he just decided to dump the pressure and have some fun.Extra kudos goes to Obi-Wan and Anakin's traded banter in the beginning. It felt like a buddy-cop movie of sorts. Also, Artoo is one resilient droidbut it does give some sense of satisfaction seeing him kicked around. Literally. According to some friends watching, the Millennium Falcon makes a brief cameo. I couldn't see itaw, well. There's always the next viewing to try to catch it.I brought a lightsaber to the premiere here in Kuala Lumpur. It was a big hit with the ladies. I wish. There're not enough fanatics here to start a cult.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"good, good your love of this movie has made you powerful","i like many others last night went to watch revenge of the Sith and i like many others was blown away by what i saw. Yes there are arguments that the prequels are not as good as the original, but i have to say first off that no matter what Lucas did it would never match the originals, as well as our expectations. But this is where everything changes!!! I like many others thought that Lucas left himself too much work in terms of linking them together after the first two,and asked myself whether he could pull it off.I'm glad to say,""the boy done good"".Frst off,the action is immense and well done. A big shout out for ILM for making the film settings appear more organic, than artificial. The acting particularly of McDiarmid is fantastic, the plot even though we know the general story still hits us with a few surprises and overall the film runs like a Greek tragedy. we are not only hit by the sadness of what happens to Anakin, but by the end your very sad at what is the Jedi's fall from grace. you see Yoda and others disappearing off to a new start that will bring a new hope. (pardon the pun)on a final note though, when you watch this movie you will find yourself excited for the rest of the day. But beware i'm now on the path to my own dark side as i have to come to terms with the fact that unless Lucas has a change of heart, this is the last of star wars and lets be honest i cant see him coming out of retirement as lets face it he ain't getting any younger. Believe me you may read this and think this wont happen to me but it is inevitable once you realise this is closure your left with a void that you where left with at the end of 1983 when there was to be no more star wars.

"Nice wrap-up, decent story, bad acting & dialogue   but overall satisfying climax","The Clone Wars is nearing an end; the Separatists have been driven away and talk of peace is finally spreading in the Galactic Republic. But bubbling to come up underneath a bottled lid is Anakin Skywalker's own morbid ambitions, pride and disloyalty to the Jedi Council. Zooming in more than ever on his psyche, this last Star Wars installment is a much darker and more character-driven piece that explores the gloomy nature of Anakin  how far will he go to get what he wants?First, let me debunk the myth that this is an excellent film, as the IMDb rating of 8.0 boldly suggests. It is largely a satisfying end to an uneven saga, successfully interweaving all the clues, characters and elements together in the final wrap-up without this process feeling too rushed or too unbelievable. In this sense, yes, Revenge of the Sith is a well-sewn together product and following the low expectations that Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones set it hardly disappoints. But scratch the surface of a fancy-looking sci-fi facade  coloured with beautiful visual effects and adrenaline-pumping dark action sequences  and its flawed individual parts became glaringly apparent.It starts well enough, however. In the first scene of the film the story tips over into intense sci-fi action sequences of chase scenes and Jedi martial arts. Suffice to say that George Lucas follows this no-nonsense approach throughout the film, which is appropriate and what he does best. He also clumsily botches his way through a few romantic moments between Anakin and Padmé as he goes  as usual, his heart isn't in it and as a result, the lovestory suffers greatly. But then, it was never that good to begin with. It is every bit as cheesy, badly acted and over-the-top as in the previous installments. The greatest source of humour in the film is in fact the rapport between Anakin and Padmé. Example, Anakin admiring his wife on the balcony of their house:Anakin > ""You are so beautiful.""Padmé > ""It's only because I'm so in love with you.""Anakin > ""No, it's only because I'm so in love with _you_!""It is difficult to decide if the above is wrist-slashingly bad or if it is a total stroke of genius. Either way, it is hilarious. The good news is that Revenge of the Sith abandons most of the campy fluffy one-liners á la Jar Jar Binks humour that was present in Episode I and II, simply because it is too busy navigating the darker side of the story, the gloomy themes of death, destruction and lost love, and the difficult psyche of Anakin Skywalker. Hayden Christensen has stepped up in his acting slightly but with poor writing it is no wonder that he still chokes on his lines. Nevertheless, toward the end his inner transformation feels both credible and poignant.For an overall evaluation, Revenge of the Sith perhaps feels more like the original trilogy than either of the prequels. Beneath the over-the-top sci-fi visuals and overdoses of sleek technology of the 21st century, it is still apparent that its core is closer to the original fibre than what could be expected. There are no longer endless trade disputes, lofty politics and constitutions as in the Phantom Menace and there are no longer embarrassingly corny humour as in Attack of the Clones. It returns and reconnects with the saga and hearing the deep voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader is just staggering to fans and agnostics alike.7 out 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

blockbuster entertainment,"Only looked at my watch once, during a quiet bit shortly into the movie - otherwise the time flew by. The FX and smooth editing hold the attention of the viewer.I have nothing but praise for all the actors; with the exception of one, they all patiently submitted to the director at the risk of what many perceive as 'bad acting' They aren't acting badly at all; they are taking direction well - it is the director who is acting badly! If you want to see any of the cast act, check out their other movies. This one belongs to George Lucas. In the case of Ian McDiarmid, he is a skilled stage actor, and with a long relationship with the Star Wars saga, I suspect Lucas didn't use any of his director-spin. That would be good, because, suitably, McDiarmid's character, Palpatine, has the best development. 'Revenge' is the progression of Anakin to Darth Vader, via the machinations of the 'dark side' prompted by Palpatine. His costumes rival even those of Padmé (but not quite; he can't compete with the hair).This movie is 'big' - with huge cgi scenery and sets, a fast-moving story, drama, several of the best duels in film history (including Obi-Wan vs. quadruple-threat Grievous), and a great score.

It wasn't with me.,"The force, I mean. Now it is commonly known that the force has left George Lucas a long time ago, but he still keeps shooting movies. The latest addition to the Star Wars saga is, in my eyes, the worst so far. It is a nearly random collection of battle scenes, sometimes even jumping back and forth from one to the other, which I found really annoying. But cut out an hour of battle out of this overly long film, and all you have left are pathetic dialogs, which wouldn't really make it that much better, either. Lousy acting, particularly from Hayden Christensen, adds to the pain. Watch it for completeness, but don't expect quality.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great film, but it drags","The only problem this movie has is it's tendency to drag.

It explains why Yoda went into seclusion, how Obi-Wan can talk to Luke from beyond the realm of the force, and, a cryptic solution, why Vader {Anakin} cared so much for Luke that he realized the mistakes of his past and killed the chancellor: He loved Padme.All things considered, this is an excellent film and definitely worth the full ticket price.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best Movie of the Star Wars Prequels.,"This one is the most strongest within the Prequel Trilogy and that's saying a lot as it's the worst Trilogy in the Franchise.It has its flaws, but I still like this one all the same as it felt like a Star Wars film, as soon as the beginning started, which is described in the first film by Obi-Wan.Hayden Christensen has improved slightly and is bad-ass and looks intimidating when fallen to the Darkside of the Force (while he keeps his gob shut), the Emperor is funny when he goes psycho, and my two favourite scenes are where Palpatine tells Anakin the story of Darth Plageus and the battle scene on Mustafar. And it's amazing that James Earl Jones reprised his role for the movie as well.If I had to pick some faults in this movie, it would be the dialogue, General Grievous's fight (which was way too short) and the fact that three powerful Jedi Masters went down much too easily by Palpatine. I guess he is a powerful Sith Lord, but you guys were trained to fight off the Sith, you just went down like a sack of spuds, which left me a little disappointed.

I love this guy in ALL his other movies, he is talented as hell, but here he is trying to be the wise old Obewan, (Alec Guiness) instead of being a younger more vibrant Obewan.With all due respect to the creators and the team at Lucas Films, more time should have been spent on quality story lines with actors who have chemistry, not just take a nice picture for the poster.
