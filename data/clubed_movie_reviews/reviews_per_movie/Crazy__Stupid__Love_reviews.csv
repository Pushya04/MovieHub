"Bittersweet, emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious","Crazy, Stupid, Love. is one of, if not the best, American romantic comedies of the past decade. This may come as a shock to some (as it surely took me aback) but there is no other way to describe it. Going into an advanced screening of the film earlier this week, I had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic. But instead of tripe, I got one of the most unexpected surprises I have seen all year.Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) have hit a rough patch in their long-time marriage, and Emily inadvertently announces to an entire restaurant that she wants a divorce. Down and depressed, Cal starts drinking away his sorrows at a local bar, attempting to make sense of his predicament with anyone who will listen. Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a professional bachelor, takes notice and makes it his personal mission to help Cal get over his wife, and become a new man in the process.But this is just the main plot thread of the movie. It also follows Jacob's relationship with the absolutely stunning Hannah (Emma Stone), throws in a bit of curveball with Emily being romanced by David (Kevin Bacon), and even has a bit of a focus on Cal's son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) pining over his older babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). It may sound a little packed with threads and too many characters, but Crazy, Stupid, Love. is able to navigate between each character and couple with ease. It reminded me a lot of Valentine's Day, and how its main goal was to depict how different love is for a sizable amount of couples and singletons. Except it failed miserably at it, and stood out more as an example of every rom-com stereotype you could imagine. Thankfully, Crazy, Stupid, Love. takes the higher road and breathes new life into a stale genre.While the impeccable cast is more than enough reason why the film succeeds so well in being an atypical film in the genre, it is the crew behind-the-scenes that surprises even more. The film is written by Dan Fogelman, who is best known for a string of Disney films and the atrocious Fred Claus, and is directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who wrote and directed the sadly little seen I Love You Phillip Morris and wrote the now classic Bad Santa. These three would not be the first group on men I would turn to for a film like this, but their relative lack of expertise helps propel the film to the heights it reaches. It takes darkly hilarious turns in certain instances, plays other sequences totally unconventionally, play even more out with a foreboding sense of drama the trailer merely hints at, and trumps more than its share of genre stereotypes. Weaving between the plots lines, they make the film feel unique and different from others, all while giving it an aura of authenticity. While they stumble a bit in the final act with a series of sitcom-like shockers that border on ludicrous, they manage to pull off the rare feat of actually making the audience wonder if these characters will all end up together in the end, or if they will walk their separate ways; something that is truly uncommon for this genre.Acting wise, the film delivers in spades. Carell gives one of his best performances to date as Cal, moving as swiftly as the script requires between depression and humiliation, and touching and hilarious. The film stretches his dramatic muscle more than most, and allows him to give a performance that does not rely on laughs. The expressions on his face are just devastating in some sequences, and the wonder in other scenes is ridiculously hilarious. It is a performance I hope to see him come back to again, and make even better. Gosling plays against type, and gives an absolutely hysterical performance. He shines brightly in every scene, nailing every line and mannerism, while making this scumbag of a lothario become someone to really care about. He exudes chemistry and helps make everyone else's performance better. Moore and Stone also give great performances, easily balancing the humour with the drama. They are not given nearly as much to do as the guys, but hold their own on- screen.The supporting cast does even better. Bobo is phenomenal in his role, conveying an innocence and naivety that is more mature than I thought possible. He acts like more of an adult than some of the older cast does in many instances, and gives the performance a well-rounded other young actors would be incapable of. Tipton is not nearly as good, but plays the role of a confused teenager a little better than you would imagine. Bacon does great in a small turn as does Liza Lapira as Hannah's best friend. But it is Marisa Tomei who steals the show from everyone, playing one of Cal's conquests. She is dementedly unhinged and ridiculously over-the-top, but never falters. Her performance may be one-note, but it is easily the most memorable thing about the film.If I hold anything against the film (other than the final act stumble and the oh-so convenient way one particular scene comes together), it is that it ended. I know I have harped on how unlike other typical romantic comedies Crazy, Stupid, Love. is, but there is really no other way I can rave about it. I easily could have spent more time with these characters, and pined to find out what happened to each of them after the final fade out. The incredibly unlikely pair of Ficarra and Requa has crafted a truly wonderful and hilarious film that is nothing like what you could have expected watching the trailer. It is bittersweet, and easily one of my favourite movies of the summer. And this is coming from someone who loathes almost every single romantic comedy ever conceived.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Creme Brulee or a Divorce?,"Greetings again from the darkness. From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage. Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.The intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others, but still mess it up sometimes.After moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob's incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal's negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first, the makeover ... wardrobe, haircut and conversation skills.The polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood - these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah (Emma Stone) who has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend (Josh Groban) who offered her a job, rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And that's just the stuff I can tell you! Cal's first conquest utilizing his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes, but as usual, Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played well by Analeigh Tipton, but it's interesting to note (in real life) she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah (Stone).All of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night (with Tina Fey). Julianne Moore is solid, though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly offbeat, dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for super-stardom. She was really good in Easy A and has a star-making turn in the upcoming film The Help. After that, it's on to the new Spider-Man for her.Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are the co-directors and were responsible for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris, with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman, who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.No question women will enjoy the film, but the surprise is, many men will relate to what's going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough strong writing to say this is a very good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Crazy, Stupid, Love literally sums up my life right now.","The ironic and embarrassing thing is, the person I was watching this with knows how relatable the theme of ""finding your one true soul mate"" is currently. This will be difficult to review without affecting me personally, but when a film does that to you it just goes to show how powerful the art can be. We follow a variety of characters as they explore the emotion of love. A middle aged couple going through a divorce, a babysitter who has fallen for her employee, a young boy who's in love with the babysitter, a promiscuous dating expert who eventually finds ""the one"" and a young woman hoping for a proposal. Eventually, we find that these characters interlink in a sprawling narrative detailing the joys and sorrows of love. Despite all that, the biggest element that resonated with me the most was to never give up fighting for the one you love. And I know the person this refers to in my life will read this review, and I know they will do everything in their power to not acknowledge my true feelings...but it's worth fighting for right? Absolutely, and the film conveys that message eloquently, particularly in the third act which I did not see coming at all. I literally shouted ""no...nooo...NOOO!"" as one character attempts to regain a form of relationship, albeit goes terribly wrong. The narrative consistently switches between characters, reminiscent of the classic rom com 'Love Actually', which keeps the pacing interesting. Acting was emotionally investing from everyone. Ryan Gosling shows us that his comedic timing is excellent, Steve Carell is able to perform some dramatic scenes and Julianne Moore is always dependable. Emma Stone's character needed a larger amount of screen time, I felt her character was unevenly balanced. We see practically nothing of her in the first two acts and then she becomes the main attraction in the third. It just meant I hadn't warmed to her like I did with the other characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this though, I laughed, teared up and smiled. Love hurts dammit!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Carrell / Gosling Synergy Drives This Zany Buddy-Film / Romantic Comedy,"When it all comes together in an ensemble romantic comedy, it takes a great script, spot-on casting, inspired acting, timing, synergy, and brilliant direction. Crazy, Stupid Love has it all. Arguably, the best romantic-comedy of the new millennium era, CSL synchronized two directors and a screenwriter who had all previously been noted for their top success in animation films and television including the 'Cars' franchise, 'Tangled' and 'Angry Beavers' (in addition to non-animation film), along with the brilliant Casting Director Icon Cindy Marin who had casted 'Juno' a few years earlier.The casting could not have been better, and with the inclusion of Kevin Bacon, connects the film (within 7-degrees of Bacon) to generations of great romantic comedies.I can count on one hand the number of great romantic comedies in film since 2000 - they are rare, hard to pull off, and this is one of the very best. TV Series are a much better platform for comedy, as the comic moments can be spliced together without having the wrap a complete linear story around it in just two hours - TV is 30 minutes of gags; next episode.Pulling-off a quality 2-hour story like this one, within the comedy genre (that is both sexy-sweet and funny at the same time;) requires effectively synchronizing a lot of moving parts.Everyone involved in the production of CSL brought their A-Game, and it shows.The key tandem in the film's success is Steve Carrell/Ryan Gosling - Without those two delivering the goods, the film would have failed.They deliver big-time, making this Buddy-Film disguised as a Romantic-Comedy an all-time film arts success.The Carrell/Gosling best-buddy relationship centers around a man in his 40's (Carrell) in the process of being separated from his middle-school sweetheart and first-and-only-love wife (Julianne Moore), reluctantly entering the modern singles dating world for the first time in his life.He is completely unprepared and out of step with the times and the game, but runs into the Yoda or ""Miyagi"" master of ladies-men (Gosling) at a popular local singles bar, who decides to take him under his wing and mentor him in the ways of successfully meeting younger women after observing his wallowing in breakup pain and ineptitude in the singles game. The Pygmalion-like tutoring and transformation is truly brilliant fun to watch.A complex intertwining connection of the entire cast starts to reveal itself piece by piece, and the hilarious apex of the film is one of the most memorable pay-off moments in comedy-film history.The supporting cast orbits around the two new-best-friend buddies, and their acting excellence results in CSL rating as one of the all-time great ensemble comedies.This was the first of three (as of 2021) successful movie pairings of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, each subsequent project propelling both into higher orbits of superstardom - the third pairing 'La La Land' resulted in multiple award nominations, including an Oscar win for Stone, and with Hollywoods penchant for staying with winning formulas, it is likely we shall see more of these two together in film.CSL fits the new millennial era culture well, and perhaps years from now will seem dated to this period (filmed right before the dating App explosion that occurred from 2012-2015 that replaced and swiped-away bar meetups, it is already aging in that regard). This just means everyone ""got it"" during its production, and certainly transferred that ""get"" to the screen with notable comic skill.On my IMDb list of Top 25 Best Comedy Buddy Films.Needless to say, I ""highly recommended"" 'Crazy, Stupid Love', and give it the proverbial two thumbs up! 👍👍",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I love this movie!,"Such a wonderful rom-com with great writing! Ryan Gosling is superb as the ladies man and I love how Steve Carell is great in the drama aspect. Crazy, Stupid, Love is so enjoyable throughout with amazing charm and soundtrack! Not like most divorce films which is a pleasant surprise; every scene has feel-good entertainment embed in it perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I enjoyed everything about this movie.,"My initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that I've seen in years. The genre has been pretty devoid of quality lately. So, I don't know if that plays a part or not and I really don't care at this point. I enjoyed everything about this movie. It has tremendous heart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters. A certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know. Steve Carell's character is the one everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the ""A"" story you wonder why and start to think that the ""B"" story is going to be muddled or cliché or one to endure. Well, they're not and everything comes together in a wonderful fashion. The entire cast here is perfection. The overall message may be one to debate but it doesn't matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well done.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It works,"You know usually I'm not into romantic comedies, as I find that most of them fall short & are extremely cheesy. I really liked this movie though. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great. Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for them in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve Carell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes though, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan Gosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a ladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after splitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almost never happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute. This movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most people would enjoy it. 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"I have mixed emotions about Crazy, Stupid, Love","I have mixed emotions about Crazy, Stupid, Love. I think there are some charming moments in this movie, but a lot of it didn't work for me. It's a little too long and it took a while for me to warm to it. Plus, there are a couple creepy plot points that the film tries to pass off as cute. Even though I enjoyed the performances of Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, and Emma Stone, I don't think this is a romantic comedy I could recommend to others.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Crazy, Stupid, Love is a real crowd-pleaser","It was roughly two-thirds of the way into Crazy, Stupid, Love when I realized how invested the audience in my theater had become. The key scene involved a mom cleaning her daughter's room, a seemingly mundane moment that produced gasps and cries of ""Oh no!"" even before the character makes a very revealing discovery. It's a scene that, much like the rest of Crazy, Stupid, Love, a heartwarming and, at times, painfully honest depiction of three couples at various stages in each of their relationships, unfolds not with predictability so much as inevitability. Unlike your average, generic romantic-comedy, this movie focuses less on the end, on who will end up with whom, than on the special and often surprising connections that are made along the way. What's more, it achieves the remarkable and all-too-rare feat of actually moving the audience to care about the central characters, to cheer when they come out on top and sympathize when they don't.Using a witty, compassionate and ever-so-slightly subversive script from Dan Fogelman, directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who are best known for writing the pitch-black comedy/satire Bad Santa and only have one other directorial effort under their belts (last year's I Love You, Philip Morris), guide the production along with subtle ease. They strike an ideal balance between humor and drama, allowing the overall tone to develop organically. Laughs come mostly in chuckles at the cleverness of a line or its delivery and are never awkwardly forced in to lighten up a scene, while the emotions feel genuine without becoming manipulative. Most of all, their restrained approach allows the actors to breathe and to fully embody the characters they've been given.Speaking of which, has there ever been a more likable group of people assembled for a film, much less a romantic comedy? The cast gels remarkably well, and at no point is anyone singled out as a villain; even when a character threatens to become unlikable, the actor portrays him or her with such keen understanding that it ultimately becomes hard, if not impossible, to not root for each and every one of them. Whenever the film tiptoes the line toward schmaltzy, they pull it back, making every line and emotion feel utterly real. As the unquestionable lead of the film, Steve Carell displays a tenderness and dramatic depth he'd only hinted at in previous works like the unexpectedly moving The 40-Year-Old Virgin and occasional episodes of The Office, while Ryan Gosling, all immaculate grooming, sly grins and twinkling eyes, is perfectly cast as his foil, Jacob, a suave ladies' man who's really using all that money and swagger to disguise the emptiness he feels inside. Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are both lovely as Emily and Hannah, respectively, radiating a down-to-earth presence and relatability that many other Hollywood actresses seem to lack. Also worth noting are Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo, who form Crazy, Stupid, Love's youngest romantic pairing and have been all but ignored by the movie's publicity campaigns despite their obvious talents.What truly sets Crazy, Stupid, Love apart from other modern-day romantic comedies, aside from the perceptive writing and direction and a dream cast, is that it strives to be meaningful, rather than just mindless, predictable fluff. Though the movie employs its share of clichés (precocious kid, guy falls for the one girl who initially rejected his advances, etc.) , it's often done with a knowing wink, most obviously when, after an altercation with Emily, his ex, and rain begins to pour down on him, Carell's despondent Cal mutters, ""What a cliché."" It shows that love is messy, irrational, sweet and universal, filled with regrets and tears as well as hope and joy. It celebrates movies like Say Anything or Jerry Maguire where sentimental wasn't a bad word and love meant more than sex, diamond earrings and expensive, candlelit dinners, where those small, precious moments of quiet intimacy – a shared look, a simple but honest conversation, a laugh, a smile, buying a mint chocolate chip ice cream cone, a spontaneous phone call – speak as loudly as the grandest, most dramatic, craziest gestures.In short, Crazy, Stupid, Love does what the best romantic comedies do: it gives us a glimpse into the raw, human moments that collectively build to bring two people together – or, at times, tear them apart; we fall in love with them just as they fall in – or, out of – love with each other. It's the perfect date movie, and so much more. To all the other ones, the mediocre, cornball, lazy, offensive rom-coms and chick-flicks out there, Ryan Gosling has a message for you: be better than The Gap. Be better than The Gap.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilarious n entertaining.,"I first saw this a decade ago on a dvd which I own.Revisited it recently with my family aft seeing the trailer of Licorice Pizza.The similarities in both movies are noteworthy n one can easily make out that Licorice Pizza is copied from this movie.Inspite of not being a fan of romatic comedy movies, I enjoyed this movie then n now too.It is hilarious n the acting is top notch.The movie is about a man who seeks to rediscover his manhood and is taught how to pick up women at bars.The star cast is top notch n the film moves at a decent pace.The babysitter is played by Lio Tipton who was 23 during this movie but she succeeded in portraying a teenager's role.Her nudity n sex scenes in the movie Compulsion was kinda shocking for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Thought it was going to be better,"Like so many other movies I have seen, it started out great but ended weak. Gosling was perfect in his role and Carell was hilarious as always. Emma Stone was also very good, and crazy hot. The problem I had was that the situations between everyone became more unbelievable as the movie went on. But those situations, while not great, weren't terrible either. The one thing I did have a major issue with was the son. Every time I saw him I wanted to slap him and shave his head. Maybe that is a little cruel for a child that can't act to save his life and has an absurd haircut, but whatever. Still, if the movie had wrapped up nicely it would have all been worth it. But the speech at the end went from dumb to just plain ridiculous. And if what's her face's dad was mad before, I wonder how he will react to being the father of a registered sex offender. You know, the polaroid deal. I mean, seriously!?!?!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sweet and Sour,"This was my first time watching this movie. I can appreciate Cal and Emily's story, cringey tho it may have been a few times. I can appreciate Hannah and Jacob's story... although more time should have been spent on them IMO. I can sympathize with Jessica's inappropriate crush, and with Robbie's similarly inappropriate fantasies. The thing that made me gag... was the closure between Jessica and Robbie. If their genders were reversed we would immediately see it for what it is; gross and creepy. It surprises me that this movie was made in 2011. I thought those years were better than that. This movie is riddled with problematic missteps; while championing noble values at the end, it enjoys dragging us through a lot of mud and muck to get there. It's a sweet movie, but it left a decidedly sour taste in my mouth as well.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Pleasantly surprised, a great movie overall!","I saw this expecting an amusing, albeit predictable, movie. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!Steve Carell plays a man, Cal, blindsided by his wife's sudden request for a divorce. While wallowing in self pity at the local bar, Jacob (Ryan Gossling) decides to turn him into a project, and introduce him to the wonderful world of womanizing.....But you've seen that from the previews right? What comes next is a great look at love, from first crushes to long term marriage.This movie is the perfect blend of funny and sweet (the entire theatre was laughing throughout). Great performances from the whole cast, including a surprisingly refreshing change for Steve Carell. The writing was perfect, the pacing was great.... A perfect date movie!

"A very surprising Rom-com, and one of Steve Carrell's best ever performances","I have nothing personal against Rom-coms, it's just that sometimes a film really surprises you in a good way or it falls flat on its face. Crazy, Stupid, Love fortunately belongs in the former category. If there was anything that lets Crazy, Stupid, Love down, it was that the film stumbles a little in the final act.Everything else however works, and the result is a surprising and hugely enjoyable Rom-com. The filming is never cheap and often stylish and pretty and the scenery is very striking. The soundtrack also compliments the film very well, as does the direction. The story is very clever too with seldom a dull part, only the final act has signs of inconsistency.For me, what lifts a Rom-com especially is the cast, the chemistry and the quality of the script. Luckily, Crazy, Stupid, Love succeeds in all three of those areas. The script is funny in a witty, droll and infectious sense, with plenty of moments to warm your heart and touch you too. The chemistry of the actors is also there and very believably done.Steve Carrell is brilliant here, while I do consider him talented with good material, I don't think he has been this good in a while. Ryan Gosling exudes charisma in his role, Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are very charming and Marisa Tomei while perhaps over-the-top is memorable.In conclusion, very surprising and really well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
fresh & clever comedy,"Romantic comedies aren't usually my kind of thing but I thought this film was great. The cast is strong (Gosling, Stone, Carell) which is the main reason I chose to watch this film. It is quite a long film but the plot is really clever. There is plenty of different things going on in the film and the way it all gets linked together is brilliant and certainly something I did't see coming.There are some genuine laugh out loud moments and the film is straight to the point. The cast is great and all work together well, the plot is fresh and clever and it really was one of the best romantic comedies I have seen (haven't seen many but still) - Would recommend this film to anyone.8/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Crazy Stupid Love,"Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve Carrell. Watching him on ""The Office"" for all those years was painful, because his character, and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman, I hadn't seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and believable.Yesterday, I was at the movies, pretty much the whole day, and decided to check out ""Crazy Stupid Love"", because it had decent critical and audience reactions, better than I expected for a romantic comedy, and it had some of my favorite people in it, including Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. And, to say the least, I was caught by surprise.One of the reasons for this, is because ""Crazy Stupid Love"" works as a romantic comedy and a drama. Most romantic comedies, I find, are predictable, stale, and essentially one carbon copy after another, of the same exact story, played out in a slightly altered way. You probably won't guess where ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is going. While the ending itself is a lot like I predicted it, there's a big plot twist that presents itself in the climax that I really didn't see coming. And that's reason enough to see this movie.However, there are many (better) reasons. One of the big reasons is that it avoids making any of its characters caricatures. Each character is real, and flawed, screwed up and deals with his or her problems in a very grounded and grown-up way.It revolves around Cal (Carell), a man who has been married to Emily (Moore) for 25 years, and is rocked by the revelation that she wants a divorce, after sleeping with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). Cal begins hanging out at a chic pickup bar, where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a lothario who takes a different woman home every night. He picks up on Cal's depression, and helps him turn into something of a womanizer. Meanwhile, Cal's floppy-haired thirteen-year-old son Robbie has a crush on his older babysitter, who has a little crush of her own. Also, Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone), a young lawyer who has heard every pickup line, and therefore, has a quite jaded outlook on love.And it is the first film or TV show to portray Steve Carrell as a human being. He can act! Who knew? I actually liked him in this role, because I felt that he wasn't Michael Scott, or that guy from ""Get Smart"", or ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", but an average guy whose life didn't turn out as he had hoped. I bought him in this role. He more than keeps up with the rest of the film's stellar cast.Another revelation here is Ryan Gosling. I've mostly seen him in depressing dramatic roles (""Blue Valentine"", ""The Notebook""), while here, he proves himself to be a cunning comedian. He has spectacular comedic timing, and clearly has a lot of fun here with the other actors. He seems to be the superficial funnyman at first, and, like the rest of the cast in this terrific film, opens up, and surprises the audience.While Julianne Moore is always great, her character and Carrell's character mesh in a way that makes you believe that their marriage lasted 20+ years. Emma Stone is on fire right now, doing a great role in ""The Help"", she shines just as much here, if not more. Her character is instantly lovable, and I can't wait to see what she does next.This film also features Marisa Tomei, who gives a fierce, and very funny performance as a recovering alcoholic schoolteacher who dates Cal for awhile after his divorce. Kevin Bacon also made me laugh, as Emily's co- worker, who was her post-divorce rebound. While these two have brief roles, they are very funny and make the most of what they are given.What makes this film memorable for me, is that it is realistic. It doesn't paint love out to be this magical thing that will automatically make anyone happy. It knows that love doesn't always work out, and occasionally ends in heartbreak and/or violence. And while it's somewhat a cautionary tale, it ends hopefully and overall, kind of happily. It made me cry a little, and it made me laugh a lot. And while it could have been a bit longer, and given its characters some more room to grow, it was a satisfying overall package that I would recommend to someone who's trying to escape the summer of superhero flicks and sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not as great as everyone says but it's still a notch above the usual romantic comedy.,"After seeing the trailer a million times at theaters I was looking forward to seeing Crazy Stupid Love as it has one of my favorite actors in it, Julianne Moore. It looked to me like a smart romantic comedy for adults with a bit of an edge, which is exactly what it is, the story is fresh and appeals to a broad age range, the Steve Carrell/Julianne Moore storyline appeals to the older married demographic and the Ryan Gosling/ Emma Stone storyline appeals to the younger hipper generation.Steve Carrell gives a terrific performance as the poor guy whose life just seems to go from bad to worse, I think he will be nominated for a golden globe or something like that, he is a very funny guy to watch no matter what role he is in, the rest of the cast is fine also, Miss Moore once again proves she us an actress with a spectacular, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have excellent chemistry together which makes them entirely believable as lovers, however one person steals the show and that is Marisa Tomei in all her nutty glory, her scenes are exceptionally funny but they are too few and far between.This movie does have it's flaws, the end twist is too far fetched and unbelievable, I think it would have been better if they gave you some clues as to how the story all comes together in the end, the Gosling/Stone relationship isn't given enough time to make you really care, and also it's a tad too long. But other than that this is a nice, funny and overall enjoyable film to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The connections that you finally couldn't see from a mile away...,"I will admit from opening bell, that I do enjoy sappy love movies. It was a movie that made you laugh,cry,wonder and cover your eyes. Steve keeps true to his on screen character and his own real life strength but never forgetting to mumble some sort of funny line even in his most ""sappy-est"" of moments. I give this movie two thumbs up for its twist at the end and keeping it out of viewers sights so well! I do however wish that they would have developed a little more back story with Ryan's character but still, a movie to be enjoyed by all. Emma delivers some nice side humor along with her friend in the movie as well! I believe Steve may have surpassed expectations of his ability to play that main love role and still maintain his ""funny guy"" image.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly funny terrible romantic comedy,"Overall this is a terrible romantic comedy. But jokes and acting carries you through.The plot is really stupid, and at times very unpleasant. Some will object to the underage sex angle, some to the stalking, some to the womanizing. What I found most grating was the idea of a sex-class system, where a girl should date someone not on her class level. And the story hinges on a girl dumping a guy for not realizing he is not on her level.On the plus side though, the acting is mostly solid, and there are a lot of really funny moments scattered about. And I do like seeing a womanizer teach another without being a complete Barney Stinson copy. The ending though, Jesus... It is really bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Mediocre,"I feel compelled to write as I can't believe the rating this movie has. We've seen it all before many times and this movie brings nothing new. OK let me begin, the first 40 minutes are funny, if it ended there it would be 10, Carrell & Gosling give good performances and really gel as a duo but like so many comedies it loses it's way and the mid section drags only to find that the finale is a big sentimental schmaltz that really shouldn't be present in a comedy. Why do American comedies always do this (Sandler, Carrey)? It's better than Just go with it, it couldn't be any worse!, and the performances are all first rate, it's just a pity the project is wanting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Fun in Parts, But Overall A Big Letdown","I really tried to like this movie. After watching quite a few fun movies from recommendations I got from friends, I started this movie and throughout the movie I just couldn't get on board with the film. I kept trying to like it but it kept giving me stuff I wasn't on board with. In parts the movie was quite good, but as an overall experience I was very underwhelmed especially considering the great reviews I heard.Coming to the story, this movie is basically about Cal (Steve Carrel) getting divorced from his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) after she cheats on him with the infamous David Lindhagen (one of the most memorable and funny gags in the entire film). Up until this part I was quite involved but it's after this that Cal meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling) and basically learns from him how to bed women.Honestly saying it this way may turn others off as much as it turned me off. Jacob is a very typical rich, spoiled brat who spends all his time hitting on women. Overall, this was my biggest disconnect. Even the jokes here just came across sexist or something, but never landed for me. It felt more like objectification than anything else.Then there was the plot thread with Cal's son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) falling in love with his babysitter who likes Cal, and this got creepier over time considering their ages and all. Especially the climax scene which is basically sending the message to pursue your lover regardless of anything and the scenes between Robbie and the babysitter. Maybe this movie just aged very poorly and me watching it in 2022 is getting me to rant about it this way.What I could get behind was a twist in the pre-climax which was quite clever. That twist and a few laughs here and there made me question whether I wanna make this a 4 or 5 starrer flick, but it largely felt like a bore and I can't really get behind this movie and even the one watch didn't feel enjoyable.Overall, I just couldn't get on board with the messages this movie was sending and found it quite regressive so maybe it aged like crap, or maybe I just don't get the humor. Not my cup of tea or something I would be recommending for most viewers.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not without flaws, but ...","There is a moment (or two), where the movie is close to lose its way or get off its track. But it's only a momentary thing that will go away almost instantly. It manages to go through the clichés without hurting itself. And while women might only be interested in Ryan Gosling (and who can blame them?), there is more to the movie than that. It is rare that a romantic comedy can be as good as this.And while other movies try to up the ante on raunchiness, this one almost goes the opposite direction and does a great job in doing so. With Carell, Gosling, Stone, Moore and Tomei you have excellent actors who can convey almost anything, if the material is right. And right it is! Even if the end feels a bit like a cheat, it gets away with it. You won't really mind ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Warm, Surprising, Funny, Grown-Up. Worth Seeing","""Crazy Stupid Love"" is funny, warm, well-made, and grow-up. Ryan Gosling gives an Academy-Award winning performance as the lounge lizard who outdoes all lounge lizards. There are unexpected, politically incorrect, farcical moments, and at least one classic love scene that did something no other love scene I've ever seen has done. I laughed out loud and came close to crying.Emily (Julianne Moore) tells her husband, Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce. Cal begs his wife to ""stop talking."" When she keeps talking, he throws his body out of a moving car. As a woman who has tried to talk to men about serious issues, and been frustrated by their occasional inability to respond, I loved that scene.I thought I knew where this movie would go. The movie surprised me. Its biggest surprise was Ryan Gosling. Gosling has done nothing so far that made me look twice. ""The Notebook"" was one of the blandest and most forgettable movies I've ever seen, and his smaller movies tried too hard.Gosling's Jacob the Lounge Lizard is one of the funniest, sharpest, subtlest performances I've ever seen. In every smarmy smile, in every delivery of the hackneyed pickup line, ""Do you want to get out of here?"" Gosling performs a razor-edge between dead serious and flat-out parody. Jacob is both a big joke on bar bravado and an awed salute to masculinity. Gosling demands that we grant Jacob the due of an alpha male, as if he were a silverback gorilla – or Frank Sinatra – even while he invites us to laugh uproariously at him. He's Buddy Love on steroids. And, finally, we are invited to see poignancy and even some heartbreak. Even if I hated the surrounding film – and I did not – I'd watch this movie again and again just to see Gosling in it.Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has an unquenchable crush on his baby sitter. I kept waiting for the film to do something conventional with Robbie's love, but it never did – in fact it got a little weird – and I liked that. When I was that age, I was capable of that kind of love.There is a tangle of subplots that weave together into a beyond-chance farcical lawn party that made me laugh and cry at the same time. The audience watches characters have their hearts ripped out, their dreams and plans smashed – and yet has to laugh. What feels like death inside of participants' hearts looks like a screwball ballet to observers.""Crazy Stupid Love"" includes a quiet love scene that is worthy to become a screen classic. It involves two cell phones and a pilot light. This scene poignantly salutes what real, adult love really is, at its best. Steve Carrel could not be better in this scene.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Crazy,Stupid, Love Movie","I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie at the theater,but I am really glad I did. The characters are well played out, not very likable at first, but after you get to know the cast, you really feel for everyone. I thought Julianne Moore & Steve Carrell had great chemistry with their relationship. Super script, nice directing, great casting with Robbie, the son. This movie will surprise you at how good it is. I loved how you saw the characters at work, at home, at the bar & with their friends. This was very well played out & comes together in the end extremely well. Ryan Gosling is very hot even when he is sleazy. Great date night movie!!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Strong In Every Area,"Usually, I'm not a huge fan of this rom-com genre. There are just too many opportunities for films of this nature to go astray, from acting to story to ridiculousness. Fortunately, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" doesn't fall prey to those traps and instead provides a tight, stylish, funny, and even moving production that appeals to a broad range of movie-watchers.For a basic plot summary, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" sees a middle-aged couple (played by Steve Carell & Julianne Moore) get a sudden divorce, shaking their family to the core. Concurrently, a suave love-guru (Ryan Gosling) takes Carell's sad-sack character and tries to turn him into a ladies man, all the while pursuing a mysterious, fresh-faced girl (Emma Watson) who is unlike any girl he has met before.The calling-card of this flick is its ability to carry multiple plot lines over the duration of the film until they all converge in the end. There is never a shortage of things going on, all related to the central concept of the ""craziness of love"".The acting has to be great for a movie like this to succeed, and that is exactly what we get here. While all the actors are impressive in their own right, it's their chemistry that really shines here. By the end, all of the major players have interacted with each other, and it all comes off seamlessly.The ""polish"" of this film is also impressive. Everything is just so slick, from the dialogue to the clothing and especially the young cast members (Gosling & Stone, in particular). In short, this movie lacks nothing in the production-value department.Overall, then, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is a film that can be enjoyed by teens on up for a variety of different reasons. I watched primarily for Carell's acting, but was quickly drawn in by the innocent beauty of Stone and the slickness of Gosling. I'm sure you'll find a reason to be sucked in as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It is an enjoyable movie for most part until the writers gave up leaving the stars to carry it on their own.,"The build up, humor and chemistry between characters was so good in the first half, the remainder felt like watching a totally different movie with generic writing that just runs through the motions. While talking about the good parts, it is remotely inspired by a subtle combination of 2 iconic movies of the genre - 'American Beauty' and 'Love Actually' with performances inching close to the former.Cal (Steve Carell) has just been asked for divorce from his wife of 25 years Emily (Julianne Moore). His son Robbie (13) is infatuated by his babysitter Jessica (17) who in-turn has feelings for Cal. Emily is reluctantly seeing her colleague David (Kevin Bacon) while Cal meets a mysterious young womanizer in a bar Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who teaches him how to loosen up and get score girls, Cal makes decent use of it. When Jacob meets an interesting but nerdy girl Hannah (Emma Stone) and decides to put an end to his ways and meet her parents, all hell breaks loose. My synopsis has taken a bit of effort to finish both from my side as well as yours (if you haven't taken a nosedive midway), well that is how the characters are linked and I have not included all. The story is about these relationships blended with slightly intentional dark humor. More than the script it is the performances that make it work. Be it the comic timing, just the beauty of watching them or the emotional depth (nah). Like I mentioned earlier, had the second half been handled with a bit more care and some innovation, it would have become an instant classic. The first half makes smart references of contemporary verbiage, Carell's unique histrionics and giving enough screen time for rest of the superb cast portraying well developed characters. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone continues to shine in every endeavor they take up. The kid who plays Robbie is very entertaining. The background score, cinematography and editing does not deserve any special mention here.It is an enjoyable movie for most part until the writers gave up leaving the stars to carry it on their own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pleasant,"Crazy, Stupid, Love is a rom-com that gathers all the codes, clichés and stereotypes of the genre.Yet, the acting is perfect, there is a good chemistry between Gosling and Carell, and one can easily empathize or sympathize with one of the characters. The script relies on a basic story, but well developed, dynamic, without overlong passages; the dialogues are well written with a good dose of humor. The cinematography is also quite good, as dynamic as the script.All in all, this movie turns out to be enjoyable, without revolutionizing anything.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A perfect mix of Cute and Serious,"A surprising movie on many levels. Sassy humor mixed with grounding reality. The story seems to sprawl a little, in the way it goes all over the place at times, and yet it manages to create a fun gem of an evening. I haven't laughed so hard in a theater in a long time--and it wasn't over the crude humor that so often gets the crowds going (which I don't care for). Yes, there is crude humor--it seems to come with the territory in Steve Carell movies--but that is not the basis for what makes this movie great. Nor is it ""great"" in the sense that I expect it to land a bunch of award nominations. But if you're looking for a movie that mimics life, but presents it in an entertaining way, you'll probably enjoy this one. The actors portray their characters well, the plot twists keep it interesting, and it is really a deeper story than the surface value suggests.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A rom com worth watching,"I'm not much of a fan of 'rom-coms' (maybe being a guy?!), but I am a big fan of Steve Carell, so I figured I'd give 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' a go and, I'm pleased to say, that I wasn't disappointed. If you've ever watched one romantic comedy then you've pretty much seen the formula, i.e. boy meets girl, boy loses girl etc. And, 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' doesn't really deviate from this (is that a 'spoiler?'). However, just because it doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of story-telling, doesn't mean it isn't fun.In this case, 'boy' has already met 'girl,' as the film opens with Julianne Moore telling Steve Carell that she wants a divorce. From there on he goes off the rails, spending his nights in bars, drunkenly lamenting his failed family life, until he's taken under the wing of (near 'professional!') pick-up artist, played by Ryan Gosling, who then helps him learn the ways of the Force (in 'Star Wars' terms), or at least talk to women.The distinctly A-list cast makes up for the tired format and the bottom line is that 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is funny. Yes, if I was going further I'd say it was 'uplifting' and has a 'positive emotional message.' However, ultimately I was looking to be entertained and this film did just that. The characters are decent enough for you to care about them without ever becoming caricatures or cliches. It mainly focuses in the three stars I've already mentioned, but you also have Emma Stone and Kevin Bacon in there as well (who aren't used possibly as much as they could have been).If I can one main criticism it's that the film is actually quite long for a romantic comedy (I even thought it was coming to a close around the hour mark!) and it does slow down in a couple of places (in fact, it was around the hour mark that Emma Stone's character - properly - comes into it). The ending is what you'd expect, so if you can forgive the lulls in pace here and there, it is actually quite good fun - especially if you're happy with plenty of sexual gags and situations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
very different yet very dramatic dark comedy,"just the usual storyline..parents break up in the beginning and get back together at the end..but the things that happen in between makes this movie a lot different, a lot better than other movies of same genre.. the positives are the way they have treated this story line, the cast, their acting -steve carell keep this movie going and Ryan gosling looks really stunning with his perfect abs..but the screenplay cud have been bit better..most of the scenes takes place in the bar..those thing make the movie go slower..and also the same old clichés like mom cheating over dad, and dad getting back to the family in a thought provoking, eye opening speech in the end are bit dramatic...but whatever said, if only the pace of the movie was good then this movie could have become one of the best movies in this genre",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Crazy, Stupid, but quite funny","In a world where Hollywood repeatedly churns out 'comedies' which are about as amusing as bowel cancer, it does seem that Steve Carell is actually becoming as sure fire bet as you can get in the movie industry to be actually funny every time.Okay, so Crazy, Stupid, Love is not a laugh-a-minute fest, but, right from the start, it raises a fair few chuckles. It's helped by having a decent cast. Although, I would say that everyone apart from Carell should be described as 'supporting cast,' as all the best laughs are generated from him. He takes his 'loveable, but bumbling' character we're so used to seeing him as, and applies it here to his cringeworthy attempts at dating.Ryan Gosling is good too. However, he's merely Carell's straight man and the movie does slow down a bit in the second act when the story focuses more on Gosling over Carell.However, it picks up near the end, before ending how you've probably guessed it would (assuming you've seen a romantic comedy before).All it all, some decent fun with a fair few adult situations and gags.Small criticism: might have benefited by being cut in length by about twenty minutes - just to tighten the comedy up and stop it dragging in places.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A smart insight into the middle-aged man.,"Crazy, Stupid, Love is a poise between perfect love and the perfect heartache. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's movie is toned with a blessing of an appealing cast and a catalogue of emotions, accompanied by a sentimental description. The narrative is smart, counteracted by the bizarre irrational, dealing with love cheats, the self-pitying and the young and the wild. Steve Carell's role exploits the confusion of the male bearing. His wife Emily (Julianne Moore) declares her unfaithfulness due to her exasperated feelings of their long serving marriage. Cal (Carell) moves out in an attempt to clear the air, or in his case languish in his broodiness, wandering how his perfect suburban marriage crushed before his very eyes. Whilst in this fragile, yet sympathetic frame of mind he takes the time visiting a lustrous modern bar where he meets lady's man Jacob (Ryan Gosling). Jacob is a people watcher, a male spectator, inviting his services to help a man revitalise his sense of masculinity in an attempt to whisk the ladies off their feet and prize a night under the covers. Cal represents the typical middle-aged male stereotype, a lack of fashion sense, appalling hairstyle and a list of terrible handbook jokes. With Jacob's tuition Cal sets out on an operation to tangle with as many women as possible in a stab back at his unlawful and dishonest wife.The film's ending cunningly weaves all our lead characters together in an unexpected round up of commotion and revealing confessions. Although we are familiar with Carell's usual role as the family sweetheart or the exile trying to bind his way into the mainstream, his usual temperament is recognised with mischievous tones that we adore him for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Heartfelt rom com,"Crazy, Stupid, Love. Is an endearing look at how messy, chaotic and unpredictable relationships can be. It cares about its characters and that imbues the film with a genuine warmth as it shows every side to each relationship. Everything connects neatly thanks to a great twist that only makes the proceedings funnier and thanks to the 2 hour run time every plot thread gets ample time to shine.It's nice to see Steve Carell be so down to earth. He's a gifted comedian who now does a lot of dramatic roles (plus Gru) and this one is in the sweet spot that gives him the opportunity to do both in a subtle fashion. Ryan Gosling is effortlessly charismatic here whilst still displaying hints of Kenergy and Emma Stone is super likeable with really strong chemistry when paired with Gosling.Glenn Ficarra & John Requa direct in an unobtrusive way that still finds time to do some dynamic things. They know when they've got a pairing that works wonderfully and they can just let that rapport go on for a while. Especially when it comes to Gosling and Carell, they get some real comedy gold out of their scenes together without letting any joke or moment overstay its welcome.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Healthy Addition to a Sappy Genre,"I had three reasons for originally seeing Crazy, Stupid, Love this weekend. 1. I heard bad things about Cowboys and Aliens. 2. My girlfriend said so. 3. Emma Stone is gorgeous.Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised with the end result. The scriptwriting was clever, witty, and never stiff, while the directing was top-notch. However, no matter how you play it, this is a character story.Steve Carell plays Cal, a likable middle-aged man whose wife, Emily, (Julianne Moore) suddenly requests a divorce after 20+ years of marriage, along with an announcement that she has cheated on him. Heartbroken, Cal eventually turns to the rich womanizer Jacob (Ryan Gosling). His story of ""re-discovering his manhood"" (read: seducing women in a bar, including the wonderful Marisa Tomei) soon intersects with the story of the young, smart, and aspiring lawyer, Hannah (Emma Stone) as well as a deranged love triangle between Cal's middle schooled son, his babysitter, and Cal himself.It was refreshing to see Mr. Carell play a not COMPLETELY incompetent character for a change, and he plays it well. Needless to say, all of the actors and actresses played their parts well, but surprisingly, I was most impressed by Ryan Gosling's performance, a man who I previously viewed as pure woman's eye-candy.For the most part, the on screen relationships were honest and endearing, with the exception of the middle schooled infatuation with the babysitter (call me cynical). The ""bedroom"" scene with Hannah and Jacob is especially engaging (even though I usually hate montages). Steve's love for Emily never seemed silly, and the babysitter's crush was played out just long enough not to be tiresome.I also liked the ""twist"" (are twists allowed in romantic comedies?), which I didn't guess earlier on. The laughs were also plentiful and hearty enough without being too lowbrow/slapstick.However, I have yet to see a perfect romantic comedy, and Crazy, Stupid, Love has its share. For instance, Hannah and Jacob's relationship is squeezed in and never given time to develop. They are given one scene to fall into unconditional love for each other, and although the scene works great, the relationship feels distanced. Also, Emily's reason for divorcing Cal is never fully explained. Yes, she cheated, and he's apparently boring, but she seems to want Cal back from the moment she leaves him.I won't harp on Cal's son's wince-inducing endeavors for his love, but lets just say some of it was over-the-top. And of course, no movie in this genre escapes clichés (note to screenwriters: climax scenes of public embarrassment/expression of love where the on screen audience has no relation are NOT funny. Please stop). Finally, the first half flowed much better than the second, and guys will feel conned by the necessary Hollywood ending.All in all, I found myself laughing, smiling, and enjoying this flick much more than I thought, and that's what entertainment is all about. I recommend Crazy, Stupid, Love.Oh yeah, and there's Kevin Bacon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Less kid love, more adult love","This film should've gotten 10 stars. My only problem with it is it spent too much time focusing on the 13-year-old boy and his 17-year-old babysitter. It was amusing at the beginning of the movie but overdone for the rest, and all of those scenes could've been stripped to get to the good parts. I will forever be a fan of Steve Carell because of ""The Office"" and regardless of Michael Scott being removed from the TV show, Carell is just all kinds of funny. I never knew who Ryan Gosling was before seeing him on ""The Notebook"" (and a co-worker telling me a guy who looked like him from a side profile asked her out -- made me wonder, ""Why in the world would you say no to that?"") but after that movie, I decided to check out his other work. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" was in the 2012 MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss (""Twilight"" one although after seeing this film I think ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" should have) and I was wondering why Emma Stone was dripping wet and running in a bar. I got my answer and I rewound that entire scene (from the bar to the bed) four times. I liked Ryan Gosling paying the down-home character in ""The Notebook"" and like Michael Ealy, I just didn't take him as much of a comical character. But like Ealy did in ""Common Law,"" Gosling pulled it off, slaps included. I didn't just watch the bar-to-bedroom scenes for the romantic parts. I watched it again and again because Gosling's and Stone's comedic lines were as good as their flirting ones. Same goes for watching them at the beginning of the movie with the lawyer jokes and terrible pick-up lines. I had zero sympathy for Julianne Moore's character Emily Weaver, but I'm always entertained by Marisa Tomei (been a fan of her work since she played Maggie Lauten on ""A Different World"" and later on with ""My Cousin Vinny"").Great movie. I'd watch it again and fast forward past all the babysitter stalking. By the way, Carell looked HOT in this movie and I don't mean good looking. I mean ""where's the air conditioner"" hot. He really was wearing way too many clothes. The ""scuba"" line cracked me up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A lot of characters - and they're all great,"I noted in the trivia section for this film that Steve Carell didn't like the title 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' because he couldn't imagine a group of guys going along and asking for tickets to a movie title like that. And I tend to agree with his reasoning. In fact I was probably in that same boat back in 2011. A film with an amazing cast who obviously all signed on because the film had a great script, and yet I had no interest in seeing it because the title didn't sound like something I would enjoy at all. And it's a shame because the film is actually really good.I found every scene in this movie interesting. It really is a great script. It comes at you from a lot of angles. There are a lot of characters and they all have their own thing going on. But there isn't a single character who is less interesting or whose scenes I was bored by.Eventually it all culminates into one chaotic scene and it was one of the funniest things I've seen in a film in a long time. The only area the film let itself down a bit was when it tried to get a bit preachy and wrap all the character's arcs up in a neat little bow at the end. It was unnecessary and the one time the film didn't feel like it was in complete control. Otherwise though, this was an excellent film. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It's Definitely Crazy.,"""Crazy, Stupid, Love,"" a film directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, definitely lives up to its name of being crazy and sometimes stupid, however I wouldn't say I loved it, but I liked it quite a bit.At first the plot of this film may seem rather simple. It follows the story of family man, Cal Weaver (Steve Carell), who is living the perfect life; he has a wife and a couple of children. But his world comes crashing down when his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), declares her desire for a divorce after confessing to an affair that she had with her colleague. Feeling down, Cal finds himself in a single's bar sulking about his current situation. It is there that he meets playboy Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), who offers to take Cal under his wing and help him regain his lost manhood. Accompany this plot with many intricately woven sub-plots and you are in for a wild ride.""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" uses common genre clichés and use them to their advantage to the extent that the film resembles a British farce more than a romantic comedy. In most films, drastic changes in tone may seem out of place and sometimes, can even ruin your viewing experience, but in this case, it makes for better storytelling.The cast of this film is noteworthy as well. Carell provides an entertaining performance, and brought a lot of energy to the film, yet I couldn't help but notice the similarities to his other works such as ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and NBC's ""The Office."" Although he recycles his usual gimmicks, his performance never seems to get stale. Gosling also takes a fresh new take on his acting career. He is unexpectedly hilarious and steals every scene that he is in. This is not something that I expected from an actor that tends to take on a more dramatic pallet of films. The chemistry between Carell and Gosling mustn't be overlooked. It was very genuine and sincere. Even the child actors in this film were pretty good; their performances were not unbearable like some other child actors their age.The dialogue and characters felt so lifelike and fleshed out. I applaud the directors for being able to pull off such a complex task so well. You can tell that a lot of care went into these characters.Of course, this film is not without its flaws. There were times when the pacing slowed down and caused the film to drag on. It is understandable why the directors chose to do this. This choice made room for some of the best character development that I have seen in any romantic comedy. I simply wish that it had been executed more effectively. The soundtrack in the film was also bland and forgettable. It was simply a compilation of 80's pop songs. They rarely served relevance to the plot or scene at hand, and when they did it was so on the nose and blatantly lazy.All in all, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" was a great take on an often worn out genre of film. Solid performances, some witty comedy and a heartfelt script make it better than most modern American comedies, and is definitely worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Top Quality Rom Com,"Generally the Rom Com genre is full of crap. Cheesy, shallow, predictable they usually end up being.Crazy, Stupid, Love is a whole different evolution of the genre.Typically I wouldn't have even been that into seeing it in the first place. At a glance it just looked like the usual romantic crap. Though my main reasons for seeing it were Gosling and Carrell. I'd been a fan of the first 4 or so seasons of The Office, but dropped off it at this point. Gosling was hot off one of my favorite movies of all time ""Lars and the Real Girl"" and I was already hyped for Drive which was to come out 2 months after this. So the two of them were the main reason I saw this on a whim.Gosling is just so goddamn charming in this. Sure, he's got a player/womanizer aspect, but he's never a creep or forcing women to do anything they don't want to. He's just has figured out the formula that will get most women to bed with him. His character uses his talents to pass along his wooing skills to recently separated Carrell. They are the focus of the movie, but each side character get their own fully fleshed out story.From his wife's struggle of missing the man she separated from while possibly moving to another lover, to their babysitter who holds a secret crush on Carrell, to their son who has a crush on the babysitter. They encompass many versions of love through each character. Separation of love, young naive love, stuck in a relationship where you're partner isn't all in, someone who has never been in love finding it. It really does a fantastic job covering all sorts of relationships and what love is to each person.The twist at the end is completely unexpected as there are no hints to it at all and you wouldn't expect there to be a twist at all. It leads to the culmination of a really funny scene at the end, though it's really only effective the first time you see it.It's just a well put together story of all types of love that life has. Gosling's performance is a strong suit of the movie and really helps improve an already great cast. He really shows that he's got the comedy chops as well as the serious stuff like Blade Runner 2049 and Lars & The Real Girl. It's also a really good looking movie. The bar the two guys frequent has a somber atmosphere.Crazy, Stupid, Love is a solid romantic movie that anyone from any walk of live can enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pleasantly Surprised,"I'm always skeptical of RomComs and whatever movies my girlfriend ""recommends"" but this was a great watch!

Stupid and annoying movie,"Somehow the makers of this movie took two of my favorite actors - Julianne Moore and Ryan Gosling - and made them so phony and annoying that I could barely watch; and they magnified all of Steve Carell's most annoying traits so that he was even more obnoxious than usual. I don't think it was supposed to be that way, based on other people's reviews, but that's how it hit me.I guess Carell fans love anything he does; gasp with amazement any time he manages to cry or to read a line without making a funny face or a funny noise, and tell themselves what a great dramatic actor he is in addition to being the funniest man in the world; and they probably don't care or even notice how anybody else comes across. That's the only way I can account for the vast multitudes who rave about how profound (huh?) this silly, irritating movie is and how phenomenal (awesome, anybody?) Carell is in it. I don't get it, but then I'm obviously not a fan.And I'm sick of movies that get laughs from pubescent boys getting caught doing what they all do in their rooms any time they're alone and of angst-ridden teenage crushes on older men/women. Those two dumb themes have been done to death.To summarize this review: this is a stupid, boring, obnoxious and annoying movie that wastes at least two great talents in a stupid, clichéd story about stupid, totally obnoxious and unbelievable characters.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not as good as it should be yet better than it could have been,"I am a big fan of the rare flower that is the original rom-com. Crazy,Stupid,Love is such a film, and it is remarkably well-rounded with a cast that I would easily follow into much choppier waters than these.Ryan Gosling shines as the man he naturally looks to be, Emma Stone is deliciously mature and naive at the same time. The best scenes in the film play out between these two highly-talented hotties.The mature pairing with Steve Carrel as the boring guy who's been married too long is a trope I have seen before (by him), and while well executed it is still not enough to rise above the cliché.The juniors in the film add an edge to the humor that is distinctly uncomfortable at times, and the scene where conflict is to be found (I'm being vague for spoiler reasons) is far too convenient and feels shoehorned in. Especially our main characters seem to step out of what they have been so far in order to push the plot forward.This is a brilliant film in many senses, yet lags in so many others really have trouble deciding if I like it or not - it is over- stuffed and at a run-time of two hours over-long...perhaps another viewing is merited...oh JOY!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Absolutely loved it!,"Absolutely loved 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. It's one of the better romantic comedy that I have seen so far. The story balances humor and sadness so well. It is also brilliantly written and directed, making the story feel heartwarming and uplifting. The humour is perfect for my liking; brilliantly executed by the actors and actresses. The acting performances in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' was amazing. I was really impressed by the performances of Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.

The Plot and the Characters are Unbelievable,"There had been a lot of good words about this comedy called ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Although I am not really a guy who would go and watch a romantic comedy, I watched this one for Steve Carrell, whom I believe is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood now.This movie starts with Emily (Julianne Moore) telling her husband of 25 years Cal (Steve Carrell) that she wants a divorce while they were dining in a restaurant. OK, so now I know that I have a black comedy ahead of me. The movie follows Cal who was ""helped"" by playboy Jacob (Ryan Gosling) to get him ready to meet other women. One of the women he hooks up with is Kate (the hilarious Marisa Tomei). Emily on the other hand, takes up with David (the ever smarmy Kevin Bacon).Side stories include Jacob hooking up with young lawyer Hannah (Emma Stone), who in turn was hoping her colleague (Josh Groban) would propose to her. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily's 13-year old son Robbie is sure that his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (America's Next Top Model finalist Analeigh Tipton) is his soul mate. But she is in love with a much older married man. Such is the complicated web that this movie weaves.Steve Carrell again does very well with this sad-sack character that he seems to know so well. His deadpan delivery in some pretty funny situations that Cal gets himself into was spot on. The character of Ryan Gosling though, I find preposterous. I agree with Cal's belated realization that this guy is one big creep. The women basically play straight men to the male characters, with Marisa Tomei shining in the laughs department despite her short role.While I liked the surprises in the climax and the touching scene at Robbie's graduation, the rest of the film did not really appeal to me too much. Yes, there were funny parts but a lot fall flat for me. I must say that for conservatives, there can be a lot of uncomfortable situations that may be hard to watch in this film. I know women may disagree with me about Ryan Gosling's part though.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Trustful. Meaninful, Funny.","I think the greatest in this movie was to show many types of persons in love and what it makes in our lives.

And even if we are sure about our feelings, sadness and dissapoittment can blind us.

useful,"I am far to be one of the fans of Ryan Gosling. But this film changed a lot in my perspective about him. I saw, very often, Steve Carell as a decent comedy actor. But , it this film, he gives more than a conventional demonstration of his skills. The film has the virtue of apparence. It seems, in the first part, another one about relations, a sort of genius from lamp changing the life - sentimental first- of a family father, couple crisis and nice comedy. But its developpment is real impressive. It is a film about love, off course, but, more significant, about small things defining each of us, from family to acceptance of yourself.

Awesome and funny movie that works on a lot of levels,"I was pleasantly surprised, and really enjoyed seeing this movie at a premiere this week.I wasn't sure what to expect, so it took me a bit by surprise that it was so funny and touching in a lot of ways.It seemed to try to demonstrate that every person in this world has unique, loving, characteristics and that they might not be readily apparent on the surface.It reminded me a lot of ""Playing by Heart"", and in some ways the less enjoyable ""Love, Actually"".Those two movies had similar characteristics but weren't as funny as Crazy, Stupid, Love.The comedic aspects of this movie will appeal to the guys in the audience that don't normally like sappy love stories, so overall this is a movie that has something for everyone.Highly recommended, and I give it a 10/10 even though its not perfect (but what movie is?).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Breaks the chick flick mould,What could have been a predictable plot was lifted by good characterisation and a lurch from the expected. My husband laughed.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
O-M-G! A sappy comedy that even works for the male audience,"I can't even remember the last time Steve Carell was actually in a good movie. In the past decade he's been in a lot of ""hit or miss"" type flicks. Emphasis on the ""miss"" with movies like Dinner for Schmucks, Date Night, Get Smart, Dan in Real Life, and especially Evan Almighty. Don't get me wrong, I still laughed, just didn't enjoy the cinema. The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine were the only true Carell flicks that I enjoyed in roundabout way.With that being said, 2011 brings us Crazy, Stupid, Love. A quaint little rom-com flick under the direction of duo Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who came together once again after their tag team direction of R- rated rom-com I Love You Phillip Morris. Being released two years apart, their movie direction definitely improved.On to the movie review itself.Crazy, Stupid, Love begins with the divorce dinner of two of the main characters, Steve Carell's Cal and Julianne Moore's Emily. Cal is immediately deemed by the audience be the ""loser"" or ""40 Year Old Virgin"" type character he does so well. Even a little bit of Michael Scott from NBC's The Office can be felt. I was definitely excited at this point and the movie just started!The next scene introduces us to Cal's 13-year-old son, Robbie, played by Jonah Bobo. For being only an age older in real life, I thought little Jonah Bobo did a spectacular job. Immediately we see that he is madly in love with his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica, played by Analeigh Tipton. This situation alone fuels some of the comedy.The casting really does add so much more appeal to this film. Details ahead. I was also surprised to witness how funny a PG-13 rated movie really could be, while maintaining a classy feel. No raunchy comedy here. No ""F-bombs"" here. No slap-stick. Sure, the characters cheat and seem to be angry at times, but they understand their mistakes.We figure out that Emily is fooling around with a guy at work played by Kevin Bacon. Interestingly funny is Bacon.After Cal finds himself completely depressed by the thought of his divorce, he sobs at a local cocktail bar. Here he overhears, thus finding Ryan Gosling's character, Jacob, who is undoubtedly the complete ladies' man. Even actor Ryan Reynolds admits his abs to be more superior than his own. Ryan Gosling is the superior actor as well. Really enjoyed his performance.From here Jacob agrees to help Cal make the most of himself and teaches him the way of the ""Ladies' Man."" That's when the movie really begins. The humor that perspires from the interaction of Cal and the women at the bar was delightful.The movie does slow down towards the middle with cliché montages, but seemingly picks itself up.Eventually Cal finds himself a real catch in the form of Marisa Tomei's character named Kate. While this is going on, Jacob, the man who taught Cal how to score all those girls, falls in love with Emma Stone's character, Hannah. Cal is not happy about that.Without giving away too much of the plot, I will say that I really enjoyed all of the O-M-G worthy plot-twists that took place. You'll just have to see for yourself. Take a date.8/10 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Intertwined, Clever Storyline","The best thing about this movie is the way the storylines weave together and the connections between everyone. It's extremely clever. The cast is pretty great and everyone is pretty believable in their role. This doesn't have the usual ""dumb"" Steve Carell, but his lighter, slightly more realistic humor, which I actually really enjoy. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are each in finest form and do a wonderful job in their roles in this film, similarly to many of their others.This movie has a few cringe moments, but overall it's a nice story. I would recommend this movie for someone who wants a light comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"More horrifying than ""Saw"" or ""Hostel""","So, I thought I would check out the state of the contemporary rom-com, and this seemed like a good bet. I mean, actors like Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei, how can you go wrong?Very,very wrong. What I got was one of the most appalling movies I have seen in a long time, a sick demented number full of crazy stalkers, that entirely endorses and promotes stalker-ish behavior. Because, you see, as long as YOU are convinced that the target is your ""soul-mate,"" it can't be considered stalking.Hello, Mr. Screenwriter! Have we forgotten that John Hinckley was fully convinced that Jodie Foster was his soul-mate? We know how that turned out, correct?Ah, well, I guess we don't. So keep on pursuing your ""romantic"" thesis, and thanks for the details on 13-year-old boys masturbating and 17-year-old girls taking nude pictures of themselves. You are keeping it real and contemporary!By the way, the answer to the burning question, What kind of dad hangs out at the same singles bars as his offspring? is, Creepy-as-Hell Dad!Apart from pointing out the descent into the moral pit that this movie represents, I must also ruefully report that there is nothing of any aesthetic interest or pleasure here. No sprightliness, no style, no charm, not even such as might show up in the service of an entirely misguided plot. Not a single shot worth looking at, not a single line worth listening to. The characters are utterly boring, contourless screenwriter creations - no interests, no hobbies, no thoughts worth sharing, nada. No actors no matter how good could do anything with this material.Steve Carell certainly cannot convince us that he could suddenly become a swingin' SoCal ladies' man, effortlessly picking up women half his age - and again, given the third act revelation here, it's a big yuck that he would want to.Have fun.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Flawless comedy! A lot of good laughs and very entertaining!!!,"Once in a great while I watch a movie that I really enjoy... this is that movie. The actors in this movie are great! Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite actors now. Prior to this I had only seen him in Drive, The Believer and Lars and the Real girl. Just on those 4 movies alone, talk about a diverse spectrum of roles. The confident all around cool guy is the role you would almost expect him to get type casted into, but this is the first time I've seen him play that type of character. Coming from a hedro, he's one sexy bitch!!!Emma stone plays her same character, which I totally dig... and why not, no ones better with the sarcasm then she is. Marisa Tomei is classic in this movie. Hilarious!! For me it's the best role I've ever seen her in. They must have been dying on the set, when she was busting her stuff out.The movie is well written, the story line is nothing new, but never done this well. It's basically just a love triangle that comes to a head. The message that the movie leaves us with is kind of lame and borderline stalker.Anyways, This is a great movie in any setting.

I like him well enough, but his movies have usually left me mildly amused. In this film, he shows a depth of emotion that he had only hinted at before.But the character who got to me the most was Ryan Gosling. His performance was amazing.

A Kind of Love between Crazy and Stupid,"The title for this film is a solid choice: CRAZY, STUPID LOVE is. Thought he reviewers and the general public alike seem to rank this as one of the greatest films of the decade, for some other viewers this seems tired and trite and a faux showcase for some excellent actors to overcome a tawdry story. Writer Dan Fogelman (Cars, Cars 2, Tangled, Bolt, Fred Claus, etc) may be taking a step up form his previous work and that is a good sign, but when directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have shown their sensitivity in the much maligned if not sadly ignored treasure 'I Love You, Philip Morris' it feels odd they should go for this script.Difficult to classify as a Romance or Comedy or Drama the film falls into the familiar category of a RomCom. Opening a film with an embarrassingly public announcement of a marriage dissolution over a wife's infidelity and dissatisfaction with her nerdy but good father/provider husband this story embraces about every situation about falling in and out of 'love' imaginable. The idea of a monogamous clueless husband being 'changed' by a smooth talking, much bedded lothario isn't new nor is the 'finally met his match' idea fresh. The manner in which the children of the couple respond with their own needs and damaged outlooks on relationships works OK, but the manner in which the in the process of divorcing couple work through their problems holds a mirror up to today's marriages. The stories surround us in everyday life: the film merely magnifies them.It is always amazing when the marquee boasts the names of some of our more interesting actors as being involved: Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, et al deliver what they can. The 'star' is Steve Carell according to the script, and you have to like the caricatures he creates to relate to him here. There are some fine turns in cameos by Emma Stone, young Jonah Bobo, and Liz Lapira; when they are on screen the film lightens up. But in the end it is a two hour formulaic condensed television series type story. And yet the Bravos form the audience must mean there is a craving for this type movie.Grady Harp",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Could've been greater,"First off, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the perfect cinematic couple, unreal chemistry in every pairing they've ever had. Julianne Moore and Carrell are also great. The rest of the cast brings down this film by a lot for me, especially the babysitter and the son, terrible storyline. I don't ever remember being so annoyed at a storyline this much to the point where it brings down what was otherwise a really fun romcom.When the film is at it's best, it's really fun and enjoyable. Everything with Gosling, Stone, Carrell, and Moore is so entertaining. May have gotten a bit too melodramatic at times for my taste, but it was fine. Gosling has the rare talent of totally elevating a film whether it is a comedic or dramatic performance, he sells it every time. The reveals are fun, even if they're spoiled for me, the backyard scene works despite having to incorporate the stupid son/teen girl storyline, and not to mention how disturbing their last scene is and how the film plays it off as cute.

David Lindhagen.,"I adore this movie. From the opening with the New Balance sneakers to the incredible third act reveal, there is so much to love about Crazy, Stupid, Love. The movie is raw and sad, but also joyful and full of optimistic love.The excellence of this film starts with the writing, specifically the character-centric stories. Dan Fogelman is a screenwriting genius and I will watch anything that he is attached to. His treatment of every character is with delicacy and thoughtfulness. From Jacob's closeted insecurity to Robbie's confident affection, every character is relatable and lovable.Crazy, Stupid, Love. Is storytelling at its finest. The dialogue is on-point, the story connectivity is unreal, and the the emotion felt is consistent throughout. The cast is perfect for each role and there is not a dud in the bunch. If I hear that someone has not watched this movie, I will recommend it every time. Charming and complex (in a good way), this movie is not about the happily ever after, it is about fighting for what (and who) you love.Best Character: Jacob

"Top of the Line Comedy/Drama - Crazy, Stupid Love","Delicate subject matter handled in an intelligent way is really not the trademark of most Hollywood films; however Crazy, Stupid Love transcends that problem in several ways. Divorce is one. How can you make divorce bearable; or even funny at times? This film finds a way. How should we handle our first disappointment with love? How much should we trust our children with adult relationships? How should we reconstruct ourselves after a divorce (or should we)?
One issue the film avoids, however, is how the children we lived with every day no longer live with us every day if you are a man (most likely). But it does tackle those difficult issues mentioned above. It also tackles making new relationships and the bar scene. It has one hilarious scene with Tomei as a teacher at a bar, and she NAILS it. I have been with a few of these teachers many years ago; and she got it right on the nose. Steve Carell is perfect in this film, as is the supporting cast.

"Crazy, Stupid, Love. :: Funny, Smart, Movie.","This film is recommended.Crazy, Stupid, Love. is not really crazy or, thank God, stupid, but it does speak eloquently of love and relationships with a honesty sorely lacking in most rom-coms these days. The film is a refreshingly honest glimpse of love and all its complications with a large amount of humor and pathos to spare.After 20 plus years, Emily wants a divorce from Cal, a happily married family man, although he'd rather have the Creme Brulee on the menu than hear the news. Set adrift, Cal is forced to enter the world of dating and is mentored by Jacob, a six-packed sexy ladies man who is slicker than slick. Meanwhile, Jacob goes from woman to woman until he meets Hannah, a no-nonsense savvy young lady. Both men are suddenly in free fall, quickly in need of re- evaluating their vastly different lives.Solidly directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, Crazy, Stupid, Love. ( Yes, that is the correct punctuation for the title. ) is a rarity in romantic comedies. It is romantic and it is a comedy with genuine laughs that do not sacrifice characterization or plot structure. It does not pander to cheap laughs or raunchy sophomoric humor. It is a mature look at mature people acting immaturely. ( Even teenagers, like Cal's son, Robbie ( Jonah Bobo ), who has a crush on his babysitter, Jessica ( Analeigh Tipton ), who has a crush on Cal, are handled with respect and poignancy. By the way, both young actors excel in their roles. )The film has a biting sense of irony with its clever and witty dialog throughout most of the film until it veers into sitcom territory with some of the absurd circumstances foisted on the characters. Yes, there are also some nifty unexpected twists towards the end, leading to a totally improbable situation of farcical proportions, that, while played for laughs, is a tad illogical. Also, some of these characters' excessive reactions become a bit cartoony with silly responses that undercut the deeper and more heartfelt moments that the film successfully captures due to the well written script by Dan Fogelman and the fine acting from the gifted ensemble.High praise goes to Steve Carell and Julianne Moore as the divorcing parents, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as the young lovers. Carell displays a piercing vulnerability that commands the screen and I was even more impressed by his dramatic acting skills than his usual everyman droll persona. Moore is his perfect counterpart, a woman conflicted by age and complacency, caught in a marital middle ground of uncertainty. Gosling takes an unlikeable Lothario role and layers it with fresh humor and impeccable comic timing. Stone adds an easy charm and poise to her cynical professional character. The roles of Cal's and Emily's rebound lovers, played by Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, though well acted, seem to be from another film and are played for much broader laughs, one of the few missteps in this fine comedy.￼Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a humorous and insightful film that sees our crazy stupid human flaws and celebrates them with laughter, love, and much wisdom.

A list actors for B list movie,"The film relies on an excellent cast. I would particularly praise juliane Moore for her performance. Beside that the story is unfortunately predictible at every turn. I could not really get onboard on most of the jokes and the plot is full of too many plot twists. It seems to me the movie tries at times to pretend it is gonna be more original that you classic romcom, but just when you see some interesting door opening, it immediately falls back on the beaten (and very much worn) path. Seeing the list of actors and the general plot is certainly enticing but the movie could have been wildly funny if it was a bit less shy! I recommend watchers to resist the urge to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
NOT CLICHÉ AT ALL!,"I don't often watch rom-com movies, but this one I have to admit that was beyond of what I expected! Excellent, different than other rom-com's movies!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not funny.,"Crazy, stupid, love? The middle word aptly describes this ridiculous movie. Steve Carell and the other cast members are completely unfunny in this movie that purportedly is a comedy. The story is dreary and implausible. Steve Carell's character is so unbelievable that no amount of literary license can make it plausible. When Steve Carell throws himself out of a moving car, that sets the tone for this movie. Not only is this movie not funny, the story is warped. It asks the audience to accept certain premises that are not are not only untenable but destroy whatever humor the story may contain. As a study of domestic dysfunctionality, the movie does better job, but frankly that is not supposed to be the theme of the story. There is nothing funny about a man ejecting himself from a car after he learns that his wife wants a divorce and that his life has been turned upside down. That's tragic. If someone is expecting an amusing movie, prepare to be disappointed. The same can be said if you are expecting high drama. In fact, it might be best of you wait until the movie goes to DVD land.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"One of the best romantic comedies ive ever seen, must watch","I'll start by saying I have never reviewed a movie.
I didn't know know if to expect too much from a romantic comedy, although I love this genre the movies are mostly average.
The movie started off quite ok and just got better as it movies on.
When I was a kid I used to cry quite easily from romantic comedies as they used to be good, and today I don't cry anymore from these kind of movies (probably because they are not good enough).
I'm proud to say I cried in some of the scenes 🙂.
The movie is amazing and is a must watch no doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
My favourite romantic comedy,"Yes, I think it is:
The cinematography is actually decent, the soundtrack is sweet, the acting is pretty great, it has the right amount of self awareness, it can be hilarious at times but emotional at others, and while other movies have this one particularly entertaining scene, there are SO many fantastic scenes in it, and, you know, Ryan Gosling is the man",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love this non-stupid rom-com! Call me crazy but I do!,"Call me crazy (as many have), call me stupid (see last comment in parentheses), and call me love (as many females that have called me crazy & stupid have), but I think the romantic comedy ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is one of the best romantic comedies of the last few years. Before I continue, I must confess that I am a master of crazy & stupid puns and there will be more coming your way in this review. So let me get to the cool crazy of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". Steve Carell stars as Cal, a dull husband & father who suddenly is dropped the bomb by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) that she wants a divorce. Cal's streak of hits with his wife comes to an abrupt end and he must cope in living a new single life. There is where the slick Jacob comes in, played by Ryan Gosling. As Cal embarrasses himself profusely in a stylish singles bar by yelling out the name of the man that slept with Emily, lothario Jacob takes notice and takes it upon himself to help stop the Calsanity. So then Jacob befriends Cal and shows him the tricks of the singles trade and the notebook to pick up women, Gosling can't seem to let go of those notebooks. Then we have Hannah & her Sisters, actually just Hannah, played by Emma Stone. She is an aspiring lawyer who is self-confident and initially does not let herself be another Jacob conquest when they first meet. Hannah wishes to be proposed to marriage by Richard, an uninteresting lawyer at the practice where she interns; it is quite evident that the charismatic Hannah is in a higher court than Richard, who is really a dick, by nickname of course (coughing twice). There is a quasi-creepy side plot in the movie of the babysitter of Cal & Emily's kids that I will not provide too much info on because that would be downright stupid to spoil it for you. Co-Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa do incorporate crazy in the movie with a lot of love, but it is hardly ever stupid. So yea, I do commend Team Ficqua for their crafty orchestration of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" and for not letting it drown to the formulaic pitfalls of most romantic comedies. And it sure looks like Dan Fogelman was the write man to pen up the witty screenplay of the movie. I could not think who else can ""Calify"" to play Cal than Steve Carell himself, and he was up to par with a steady performance as Cal. Julianne Moore once again brings more to the table in each role and here is no different with her solid work as Emily. I would have liked to see more of Emma Stone (in more ways than one, call that one under the stupid comment category) but she continues to shine with each thespian assignment; and yes, it is another performance that earns her an Easy A in acting. Gosling was a scene-stealer even though at times I was thinking that he was auditioning for the remake of ""American Gigolo"". There were some fine supporting work also from the underrated John Carroll Lynch as the babysitter's father (sounds like a scary movie), Marisa Tomei as a teacher that becomes a one-night Cal gal, and Kevin Bacon as a colleague of Emily who wants her to eat his bacon to another degree. I did tell you that there were crazy, stupid puns in this review! So stop yelling at me!! Anyways, if you reached to this point of my review, you must be crazy. But please do not be stupid and miss the enjoyable ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". ***** Excellent",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very good romantic comedy,"There are some pretty good redeeming qualities to this movie. There are some true to life scenes. Overall the movie descends just under excellent and stands just below the Descendants which was an easy 9 star flick.Ryan Gosling stands out with an excellent performance as a womanizer with style, class and a hint of humanity in his mentor ship to Carrol's character.Some scenes seem to not be right for the movie and some seem to be made to slide under a cookie cut like movie.Overall it is an above the fray movie and stands as a great watch and a worthy addition to any DVD collection.Definitely not a family movie as I wouldn't watch it with the kids due to embarrassing and adult content but I might not be adverse to a teen watching it.Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly good,"Surprisingly good, especially for a romantic-comedy, as the bar is set very low in this genre. It's more the comedy than the romance that works though. Very funny, and at times a parody of rom-coms. Gets a bit silly and contrived at times but thankfully these moments don't last long. Ending is also a bit trite and unprofound, despite seeming to be heading for something big.Great performances all round. Steve Carell does his usual nerdy guy- next-door thing, Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as the smooth operator, Emma Stone is great as his love interest. Solid work from Julianne Moore and good support from Analeigh Tipton, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei and Jonah Bobo.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Ever Lasting Love,"The comedy-drama genre, or ""dramedy"" is a tough nut to crack and a problem can be that films lean too far into drama and the comedy on offer is usually very light. Crazy, Stupid, Love fortunately breaks that model and is actually funny, as well as dramatic.Cal and Emily Weaver (Steve Carell and Julianne Moore) are a married couple who have two young children and Emily ask Cal for a divorce after she admits she had slept with co-worker. Cal is heartbroken, loses his friends and spends his time at a bar bemoaning his situation. A successful bachelor and womaniser, Jacob (Ryan Gosling), takes pity on Cal and tutors in the ways of picking up, gives him a makeover and a new wardrobe and after some mishaps becomes plenty successful himself. But he still longs for Emily and there still seems to be a spark between the two.Despite Jacob's success with the ladies there is one woman who knocks him back, a very attractive law graduate, Hannah (Emma Stone), and this is the woman who he actually has a connection with whilst Hannah actually longs for being more exciting.Cal's son, Robbie (Jonah Bono), is a 13-year-old boy who is infatuated with his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), embarrassing and hounding her. But Jessica is a bit of strange girl and actually fancies Cal himself.Much of the comedy is based on awkward situations, mostly at Cal's expense, a little like The 40 Year Virgin. The situation and humour portray is in a slightly exaggerated world, but for the most it works and we can believe most of the situations, except maybe why would a 17-year-old fancy a man like Steve Carell. He does not strike me as a person who teenagers would fall for.There is a great cast in the film and they are excellent throughout. Carell and Gosling were the best of them all. Carell is a natural comedian, making his character believable despite what's happening around him and is a natural delivery of his lines. He is also great at the more dramatic elements and I would like to see him in more dramatic roles. Gosling has shown he is a very talented actor and can tackle almost any genre and he shows he has excellent comic timing. What is even more remarkable it would be really easy to dislike Jacob as a character, but Gosling and the writers were able to making him into a more interesting, likable character simply because he because he formed friendship with Cal.Moore plays the most grounded, serious character and she does a good job with what she has to do and she is always a pleasant screen presence. Stone is a strong, fun loving character, with plenty of spunk and when she was with her friend a great person to be around, but the she did get the shaft with screen time and her story was lacking development. Tipton shows she is an actress with potential and she really felt like a naïve, young 17-year-old, both physical because of her small frame and braid and also the way she act and properly why she has a daddy complex, because it is safe.There are a few visual treats in the film to keep film fresh. The best example is a montage where the camera pans around a bar as we see Cal become a ladies man and see him pick up a number of women in an excellent 30 seconds.Crazy, Stupid, Love is a very good but there a few faults. There are funny scenes and characters, but Marisa Tomei's role as a teacher who Cal sleeps with was someone who simply mugged and overdone when the character and the comedy should have been more grounded and awkward then overblown. It is even more annoying because Tomei is a very talented actress. Also because of the large cast of characters some of the character really did drop off the screen at times. This was the case of Hannah who is physically not in the film for large portions of film: but Stone is a strong performance and has excellent chemistry with Gosling and her friend played by Liza Lapira.A more minor criticism is the role of Cal and Emily's daughter, Molly, played by Joey King who seems market the uncharacterised child role. I can understand why she was included because it would have been weird for a 17-year-old girl to only babysit a 13-year-old boy, but Molly could have had a few more scenes.Crazy, Stupid, Love film is an enjoyable film that is funny for the most part and does build on its dramatic elements and character development. Crazy, Stupid, Love has sometimes been classified as a romantic-comedy, if that is the case it is a great example of a film that avoids clichés and is a film that people who do not like the genre can enjoy. It makes an big constant to Gosling's other romantic film, Blue Valentine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Light-Hearted Film not Weighed Down by Heavy Themes,"A real nice arc coming together for a semi-surprising (near) end, allowing for a rom-com a little different from usual to flourish, without breaking any new ground. Fans of any of the main cast are likely to enjoy the film without any difficulties, as Carell plays the role everyone is used to him taking - in fact the opening act is very reminiscent of a less-funny 40 Year Old Virgin.Despite hitting heavy themes, it's lighthearted throughout, and although never funny enough to provoke any real laughs, it's a fun watch. There is no particular engagement with the characters as none stand out as being the 'hero' of the story, but in a way this supports the background of a faltering relationship.Good performances throughout, Stone features fairly lightly as emphasis falls onto Carell's and Gosling's shoulders. The chemistry is there to a decent enough degree and no complaints can be had, not even for the child actors. There's no real impact from the film, but it is an easy watch, with a fairly poor title.It does end with potentially the most disturbing interaction between a 17- and 13-year-old though, funny in a shocking way, but also unbelievably creepy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Presents Infidelity as Catalyst for Growth,"""Crazy Stupid Love"" presents a problematic and unsettling perspective on infidelity, inadvertently glorifying cheating by downplaying its severe consequences. The film fails to adequately address the moral complexities and emotional devastation caused by infidelity within relationships.Instead of responsibly portraying the pain and damage inflicted upon partners and families, the movie often romanticizes extramarital affairs, depicting them as catalysts for personal growth and fulfillment. This portrayal undermines the gravity of cheating, glossing over the betrayal and emotional trauma experienced by those affected.The narrative seems to celebrate infidelity as an acceptable means to rediscover passion and self-discovery, disregarding the inherent breach of trust and the devastating impact on the betrayed parties. By portraying cheating as a catalyst for personal enlightenment rather than a deeply hurtful act, the film sends troubling and misleading messages about the nature of relationships.""Crazy Stupid Love"" misses an opportunity to offer a responsible portrayal of infidelity, instead opting for a narrative that minimizes the pain caused by cheating and inadvertently glorifies its consequences.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Funny and cute- a must watch,"I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this film, but I've now watched it three times! The way that it follows a lot of different story lines makes it interesting, and all of the actors made their characters believable. I especially like the character of 13 year old Robbie ( Jonah Bobo) - I think that he plays to his character very well- and it is a very real portrayal of a teenage boy. Steve carell shows that he can play serious roles, and Ryan Gosling is the perfect choice for the character of player- Jacob palmer. There are a lot of funny moments, and some more serious but heartwarming scenes. With some cute speeches and a theme of 'fighting for your soul-mate', this film is a great hit with teens and adults alike, and went down well with my whole family. The characters are relatable to, and it's nice to hear their individual stories. I would definitely recommend this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Contrived, but surprisingly believable.","Looking at all the plot contrivances in ""Crazy, Stupid Love,"" I can't believe I found this movie so engaging and believably. I don't much care for Steve Carell, nor did I find his character very likable or sympathetic. Julianne Moore, while a fine actress, is not one of my favorites, either. However, the ensemble cast is good, especially Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Analeigh Tipton, Jonah Bobo and, in an incredibly thankless role, Marisa Tomei, that I found myself carried along by this broad, sometimes farcical story.Writer Dan Fogelman's screen is so eccentric, it drew me away from obvious conclusions with snappy dialogue and directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa make no mistakes, as even one would have caused ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" to come crashing down.Some don't understand WHY Julianne Moore cheated and HOW Steve Carell changed. The answer is that Steve Carell took his life for granted and never developed his innate romantic skills. He had to discover his dark side before finding out WHO he really is. He reveals this in his climactic speech.While production values are top-notch, they are also suitably forgettable. The important thing for me is I watched the closing credits with a smile on my face, new found admiration for Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei and discovered what a fine comedic actor Ryan Gosling can be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Romantic Comedy with a Crazy Twist,"**No Worries, No Spoilers** Crazy, Stupid, Love is a perfect title for this movie! It's all about love obviously, and how it can vary between gender and ages.

Well, if you go to watch it, don't worry about it, because the end shows all the connections in a hilarious way. It has to be one of the best endings to a movie that I've seen in a while. Steve Carell is a great actor and shows his softer, sad side, but does it in a quirky, funny way. Ryan Gosling also plays his character to perfection!

Sexist and without charm,"I'll pretty much watch Steve Carrell in anything, but this was creepy in several ways, starting with the lounge lizard (Ryan Gosling) being the wise guru and effortlessly bedding woman after woman (sorry, I don't care what his abs look like). The script lacks charm, and it's a waste of a lot of interesting actors (Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei). There's also one crazy, stupid plot twist you might say. The 13 year old and 17 year old characters are in there in a way that's far more disturbing than authentic, especially that gift of the nude photos that was absolutely god awful.

"Crazy Stupid Love is heartfelt, hilarious and grounded in reality!","I couldn't be more happy with this film! The story is so grounded in reality. The writing is so perfectly heartfelt and hilarious. The cast is incredible! It's just a wonderful movie and kind of a nice break from all the big action films that have been dominating the summer. True, it is a romantic comedy, but I think it is one that the guys will enjoy just as much as the girls.It may fit in the typical romance movie cliché every now and then, but overall the story is much more realistic. It skips the lovey dovey elements of a normal chick flick and introduces you to a married couple, Cal and Emily (played by Steve Carell and Julianne Moore), who seemingly have a normal life.. a stable living, kids, they were high school sweethearts. We meet them, though, at a not so great time in their lives because she wants a divorce. Now, Cal must navigate in the role of a single man with some assistance from a ""professional bachelor"" (Ryan Gosling).Even the most serious of moments in this film are dashed with a flavor of quirky comedic relief.. the kind that life so graciously grants us so that we don't totally fall apart in a horrible situation. I also liked the fact that this film not only explored the topic of love many years after the couple had fallen for one another, but it also took a look at young love, as well; that first time a guy falls for a girl because it is like he is seeing women for the first time. Or the first time a younger person develops an interest for someone much older than they are. Everyone can relate to this film.The casting truly was perfect. There a lot of times when a film features so many big names that it just tries to sell them and loses track of the story; the heart of the film. Playing alongside Carell, Moore and Gosling were the talents of Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei, Emma Stone, Josh Groban and relative newcomer Jonah Bobo. Each brought these characters to life in such a way that you forgot they were big name actors and just got yourself immersed in the story the characters were apart of.It's definitely a film that you won't want to miss! Truthfully, I fell in love with it! When it comes to romantic comedies, I don't often find ones that I really like, but this is just a fantastic film!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Really well done,"A shockingly intelligent, adult romantic comedy. Steve Carell, in his best film role, stars as a man whose wife (Julianne Moore) admits to having an affair. She also wants a divorce. After a couple of nights of loud whining at a bar, super-stud Ryan Gosling decides to teach Carell how to be a man - that is, pick up women. And it works! But that only seems to ruin Carell's life more in the long run. Meanwhile, Gosling, always the cool cat, falls for the one girl who is too smart for his schtick, Emma Stone. Stone is the best thing about the movie. She's so utterly charming and intelligent. She can elevate a mediocre movie like Easy A. In an already good movie like this one, she raises it to a whole other level whenever she's on screen. I also loved the subplot about Carell and Moore's son, Jonah Bobo, and his crush on his four years-older babysitter (Analeigh Tipton), who herself has a crush on Carell. The film also co-stars Marissa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, John Carroll Lynch and Beth Littleford (Carell's real-life wife). About the only thing I didn't like in the film: Stone's sassy Asian friend (Melissa Tang), who apparently has no sex life of her own. Apparently we've moved away from the gay best friend stereotype and moved into the Asian best friend. But besides that one tiny element, we really don't get that many comedies with this level of writing. It's a gem.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Nice cast, shame about the movie","I do my best to support my neighborhood, single-screen movie theaters, theaters such as the Vogue: they charge reduced admission for mid-week screenings, they don't run commercials, and they usually only make you sit through a couple of coming attractions. So when I saw the cast for this movie, I figured ""what the heck, why not?"". I suppose maybe I need to see more movies; this one seemed curiously under-baked to me. As I waited for the laughs to start, I found myself pondering random thoughts: cinematically, are noses as incompatible as Julianne Moore's as Steve Carrell's indicative of doomed relationships?; is there only the one bar in all of Los Angeles?; would the Giants line-up work better with Orlando Cabrera batting lead-off?; and is there a chance of my actually picking up Prince Fielder on a waiver claim in my fantasy baseball league? It's that kind of movie; the pace is somewhat leisurely. There are subtle rewards: the high school girl saying ""my lips are *seal clapping*"", which provided the only laugh for me (and made me want to listen to the Go-Go's), and seeing John Carroll Lynch (who I always think of as Norm Son-of-a Gunderson) in a movie is always rewarding. But for the most part, I fear that I'll remember this movie as a squandering of some very estimable acting talent; it's the only movie I can think of that has ever made Marisa Tomei seem ridiculous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Amazing script, outstanding comedy","The best thing about this movie (and there many great things) is the screenplay. Though I thought there were a few script problems toward the end, perhaps some shortcuts had to be made in order to keep the movie under two hours.The second scene between Jacob and Hannah is absolutely amazing, as Hannah unintentionally gives Jacob some important perspective on his life, and not by way of a lecture. For example, Hannah makes Jacob self-conscious about his appearance--compare that to a similar earlier scene. The Jacob/Hannah encounter is so well-written, so funny, and so well-acted, it's one reason I want to see the film again soon.Another instance of amazing screen writing is the scene which has Emily on the phone by the kitchen sink. The script furnishes an occasion for an actress to put so much across without really saying anything important, and Julianne Moore is terrific.Marisa Tomei is given the chance for a star turn, and does it perfectly.There are some flaws toward the end, and this is not a perfect film. But nearly so: extremely funny, well-written and well-acted.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I will never watch it again - but the first viewing didn't hurt as much as I thought.,"I don't deliberately look for rom-coms in movie listings for the same reason I don't try on pairs of high heels before settling on my latest Nikes; I am not the potential consumer they had in mind when they manufactured the product. Put another way, I don't think ads for Crazy, Stupid Love were in high rotation on sports channels or in the pages of FHM.But I have a 5 foot tall bundle of pent-up aggression that I must periodically pander toCal (Steve Carrell) and Emily (Julianne Moore)are a married couple in their mid 40s on date night at a plush restaurant. After perusing the menu for a moment Cal asks his wife of 25 years what she wants, she replies ""a divorce"". So the restaurant is not exclusively a la carte then? (I would also ask why date night seemed a good time to break out the news. I mean really, enjoy your meals guys.) Cal obviously had no inkling of the impending bombshell despite Emily previously admitting to a fling with a work colleague, and he seems to have understandable trouble in processing the news that his last quarter century has abruptly ended. Upon moving out he takes to drinking alone in a plush nightclub, annoying anyone who will listen with all too detailed specifics of the reasons behind his malaise.Enter Jacob (Ryan Gosling *SWOON*), a younger man who similarly frequents the same club, but a man cut from decidedly different stock. Jacob is everything Cal is not, he is bold, smooth and aggressive, the kind of man women only see in slow motion. The kind of man that seems to command the attention of all eyes in the room. The kind of man that can calmly eat dinner at the bar of the nightclub, wipe his mouth and immediately approach a woman sitting two tables away with the express intent of picking her up. For reasons unknown to anyone but the scriptwriter Jacob pities the older lion and he promises to 'reawaken the man in you', cue the lengthy montage where he does just that, and Cal is systematically reinvented from the New Balance sneakers on up.Now normally that would set the scene in a typical rom-com, with the ingredients in the bowl it would simply be a case of playing out time in the unnecessarily complicated dance of inevitability, with whichever couple is deemed worthy of enjoying the purest form of bliss smoocherooing for the final few seconds before the credits roll.But Crazy, Stupid Love is a deal more complicated than even that. There are numerous subplots and peripheral characters dancing here simultaneously in an out of proceedings. The proliferation of characters is a strength of the film – Col's son in particular is hilariously awkward and clumsily blunt – but it also requires a suspension of disbelief larger than more out there films such as Source Code or Limitless. The spoiler-free version acknowledges that a rom-com demands coincidences and twists, otherwise where is the muted suspense to come from? But this film calls for far more than mere coincidence, the karma forces at play here are so very strong that I would suggest the chances of actual occurrence would be the equivalent of winning the national lottery three weeks in a row.But ultimately this is neither rom nor com, Crazy, Stupid Love has its share of romance (I guess) and is generally amusing without moving too far into either twee or gross-out territory – a line that seems to be getting harder to navigate – and although there are precious few laugh out loud moments on the plus side I never hated myself for sitting there, predominantly due to the strength of the leads, Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore are so likable that it seems a shame that their fake movie marriage ended, Emma Stone is rapidly making her name as the down to earth chick that threatens neither male nor female and it would be hard to resent Kevin Bacon even if it was your wife he was hunting.Which brings me to Ryan Gosling, the current dreamboat for thirty-some women everywhere, nice and non-threatening enough to introduce him to the folks yet ripped enough to leave them weak at the knees.I actually like the guy, but I don't really understand the allure of a softly spoken man who constantly slurs his speech like Gosling does, regardless of how hot the boy is. I'm pretty sure that the drawl thing is a turn on when he's whispering in your ear, not so much when you're asking – for the 6th time – why he hasn't managed to take the bins out even with those great heaving muscles.I guess that's the beauty of the rom-com genre, for a couple of hours the normally unlikable becomes likable, the illogical somehow logical and the reprehensible strangely 'hensible'. Crazy, Stupid Love takes several disparate individuals and has them variously hurting each other in many ways, yet we as an audience can't help for some if not all of them to get together in the traditional male/female marital unit sense at least.While I still haven't seen The Notebook (and hope I never will) I think Crazy, Stupid Love is a more palatable alternative for guys, and about as bearable as the rom-com genre can dish up.Final Rating – 6 / 10. I will never watch this film again, but my first viewing didn't hurt as much as I thought it would.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Twisting your standard romantic comedy into something that's hilarious and refreshing,"Love is the be-all and end-all of life. It's crazy, it's stupid, but you have to put everything towards winning over your soul-mate. That is what all of the characters believe. Except Jacob (Ryan Gosling). He believes that people who are in love are pathetic. Thank God for Ryan Gosling. I've been saying that a lot recently, but it's true. He makes everything he's in better.Here, he wants to improve Cal (Steve Carell). Cal's wife (Julianne Moore) has announced she wants a divorce, so he jumps out of the car and winds up at a very swanky bar. The bar is basically Jacob's turf where he knows how to win over all women and get them to sleep with him. Disgusted by Cal's pathetic demeanor, we then get a man-makeover.The best part of this movie is that they make everything funny. From divorce, to objectifying women, to inappropriate soul-mates, to depression, everything is funny. It's not darkly comic or making you laugh out of awkwardness, but taking real situations and making them genuinely funny. I frequently found myself laughing just waiting for Gosling's next line. His comedic chemistry between both Carell and Emma Stone was perfect.Analeigh Tipton, a young Liv Tyler-type actress, plays the babysitter with the inappropriate crush, but I liked her. She added another layer to the role with a little bit of sassiness and a fresh take to the character.""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is supposed to be your standard romantic comedy, where you know exactly what you're getting. But it is directed by the comic geniuses behind ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" and ""Bad Santa"", and you should know by that that this really isn't all the predictable. It has twists. I know, a romantic comedy with twists! They're inventive, fun, and most importantly, hilarious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Oh, dear God, this was awful","I appear to be alone in this thought, but I thought this was awful, just dreadful. Bad script, bad acting, bad close-ups, but most of all -- bad directing.Staring off with the most annoying actress to ever by on screen -- ANALEIGH Tipton. Oh, please you can barely look at her she is so awful. Every shot of her and everyone else is so tight it makes you uncomfortable. There is so much wrong with this film I really don't know where to start, so I'll just say: the big ""twist"" is just plain stupid -- who cares? It doesn't add anything to the story. The child porn thing is just creepy. The main story element of the failing marriage is never really fleshed out. The other main story point -- of Steve Carrell's character becoming a horn dog -- is odd and off-putting. The whole movie is just plain weird. That's as best as I can sum it up. The casting is especially odd. Marissa Tomei and Kevin bacon are thrown in for -- oh, I don't know. The 13-year old son is bad. The little girl has no lines at all. Julianna Moore is just not good here -- comes off as a harpy. The only saving grace is -- Emma Stone. She is kind of radiant, if that makes any sense. But the story line she has really doesn't make sense, because Ryan Gosling also plays a horn dog with no sense of goodness, who only goes after really hot chicks so, no -- he would NOT seek her out from a crowded bar.Not worth your money.

"Highly recommended and yes, a romantic comedy that even boys can enjoy.","Middle aged Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is stuck in a marriage that is doing OK but has little gas left in the tank to overcome the next hill.When at dinner, Cal asks what his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) would really like, she asks for a divorce, just as he plumps for the safe choice, Creme Brulee.The film pulls no punches when it comes to the break up and Carrell proves again he can act and conveys real pain in the enforced silence and awkward moments after the initial bombshell. Top tip, always lock the car doors when relaying bad news.Hanging out at a pick up bar, he comes to the attention of Uber smooth guy in the form of Jacob (Ryan Gosling), the sort of guy who could pick up chicks even without his designer shades, clothes and moves. Taking pity on the newcomer, after hearing once too often about Emily's new lover, he decides to provide him with a makeover.We have the usual movie montage of designer shopping, Jacob advises ""be better than Gap"" whilst imparting tips and tricks to enable Cal to score, and once he gets going, he certainly puts some runs on the board. Kate (Marisa Tomei) opening the flood gates and Cal gets swept along on a wave of opportunity. This sounds rather tacky and tasteless but it is done with such charm and intelligence, that all can be forgiven. Gosling surprises with a light comedy touch and Carrel's funny bone credentials are already proved, here toning it down to ordinary man level and is all the more effective for it.Kevin Bacon plays the office person of interest for Emily and perhaps gets the best line in the film. Emma Stone continues to add to her growing resume, rebounding off her on screen wet rag of a boyfriend by bewitching ladies man Jacob, after a charming drunken date, which then leads the screenplay into unexpected directions.All the cast do good work even down to the love struck thirteen year old son (Jacob Bobo), complete with odd haircut and a hopeless unrequited crush on his babysitter (Analeigh Tipton). At times resembling a french farce, this is spirited, amusing self aware cinema with a great script. But also has time for poignant quiet scenes, notably the remote relighting of the boiler, which mark the as film as well above average.Nobody is really bad. Selfish and self absorbed they maybe but the ensemble have reasons to act in the way they do and in a welcome change, unnecessarily hurting people is not on the agenda. You care about the characters and they get a chance to breathe, grow and change, so not your usual teenage sex comedy at all.SummaryA great comedy, full of charm, intelligence, humour and unexpected twists and turns.Highly recommended and yes, a romantic comedy that even boys can enjoy.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A nice twist to the Ro-Co,"I hate to pigeonhole it to the Romantic Comedy genre, but I gotta call a spade a spade.There's a twist though.This is no 'boy meets girl' story of magical romance with cheap laughs thrown in. Crazy Stupid Love packs a tightly written script along with some great performances. Obviously, there are plenty of 'only in the movies' moments. The quirky parts also tend to miss the authenticity mark, but the laughs don't always come when you'd expect either.I liked the fighting for love theme. It provides a reminder to all those who watch traditional Ro-Cos and might idealize those stories, that this is a much more likely ending -or rather, that we don't really know the ending nor do we ever find the perfect love, but nonetheless, it's still worth fighting for. That was nice to see in a Hollywood film.The gloss is there, but there is something more for those of us who look for that kind of thing in film. It's a well made film and I enjoyed it.7.5/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Decent rom-com,"As far as romcoms go in terms of plot, this one is pretty decent. The people are pretty, the laughs are there and the drama is overcome in five minutes.The supporting characters are great and have interesting storylines in and of itself to support the main storyline. Which in my opinion has a fatal flaw: why does Steve Carell's character have to feel bad and try to make up for the wife's mistakes? Why does he have to change, make a grand romantic gesture etc.? Because he didn't wear the right clothes (and stopped making an effort), it was enough for his wife to cheat. If the roles were reversed, and the male would've cheated on the female because she let herself go after childbirth, there would've been riots.Apart from that, an overly dramatic speach and the necessary montages, it's a decent rom-com.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

For Your Soul Mate,"Estranged Carl (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) sit in uncomfortable school chairs in the silent hallway waiting for their parent teacher conference for their eccentric son Robbie (Jonah Bobo). Carl says, ""I miss you Em."" He confesses his anger for not having the courage to fight for her, "" because you fight for your soul mates."" You fight for your soul mate. That is what distinguishes and touches your heart about ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". Directors Glen Ficarra and John Requa in tandem narrate this hysterical and poignant portrait of life.I did not notice that Ficarra and Requa co-helmed this voyage until the end credits. In retrospect, this makes sense given the distinct narrative threads that poetically intertwine. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is one the best movies of year. Julianne Moore is amazing, deserving of an Oscar Nomination. Ryan Gosling as master player and Carl's mentor, Jacob, is awesome in his bravado and reluctant compassion. Gosling too deserves a Supporting Nomination nod. Steve Carell is invisible in his understatement; though his performance as Carl is all authenticity, vulnerability, and courage. His speech at the story arc is in character, and powerfully touches your soul. He is brilliant.The transparency and fluidity of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is the genius of Ficarra and Requa. They seamlessly envision the screenplay by Dan Fogelman. The innate brilliance of Fogelman is that in this world, people are smart; it's just sometimes we all do stupid things. The most courageous of us forgive. Carell and Moore have astounding chemistry. I was in awe of the scene at night where Carl sneaks into his home to garden the lawn. While their kids have ice cream in the kitchen, Emily calls Carl's cell in another room. She invents a washing machine problem to ask Carl's advice. He plays along, all the while watching Em from the lawn. What resonates is their unspoken love.As ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" opens we witness all too familiar Carl and Emily having their scheduled dinner date, while the kids are left with the babysitter Jessica (sharp and beguiling Analeigh Tipton). Out of nowhere Em announces that she wants a divorce after 27 years. On the drive home Em also confesses an affair with co-worker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). Bacon is awesome in his charming smugness. When Em refuses to shut up, Carl ejects himself from the moving car.Back home Jessica finds herself in the midst of Carl and Emily's implosion. Jessica secretly is in love with the solid Carl—why she takes the gig. Previously, to the deathly embarrassment of their son Robbie, Jessica unexpectedly witnesses 13 year-old Robbie's crush on her. For Jessica, Carl is the fantasy opportunity. For Robbie, he is perhaps alone on an island.Carl moves out of their home into an apartment. Clumsily and desperately he begins frequenting a local bar. Slick handsome master player Jacob dressed in his Dolce' suit has compassion for wallowing Carl, whose wife slept with David Linhagen. Carl begrudgingly agrees to a makeover and Jacob schools him in the art of getting with women. One tip for Carl: Never talk about yourself. Amazingly sound.In the meantime, smart and beautiful Hannah (Emma Stone) is a law student studying for the bar exam, with expectations of joining the firm where she interns. More specifically, she is holding out for marriage proposal from the firm's deadly bland attorney Richard (scarily boring Josh Groban). Hannah's friend Liz advises that she can do way better. She also warns Hannah that she has a ""PG-13 love life"". While the two are having a drink at the bar, Jacob makes a play for Hannah. Jacob is bewitched by Hannah, partial, because she seems immune to his charms.Later when Hannah's world collapses, she tracks down Jacob to ""bang"" the hot guy who hit on her. He queries, ""They still say banging?"" Emma Stone is wonderful. She is naturally self-deprecating with a big heart. When shredded Jacob takes off his shirt, Stone says, ""Come on! It's like you're photo-shopped!"" Ryan Gosling is ripped, but that is eclipsed by his amazing performance. He humanizes the transforming cad, who finds his soul mate and is completely defenseless. Gosling evokes a quiet power. When Carl tells Jacob that Hannah is too good for him, he gazes into his drink and admits, ""I know""The cast all have their moments. Tipton is a surprise as Jessica. She captures the angst of the teen growing into a woman. Marisa Tomei is restrained comedic brilliance as Kate. Bobo as Robbie is harder to peg. At times he seems relegated to appointed jester; however, he poignantly reminds his Dad that you fight for your soul mate. Writer Fogelman culturally whips everything at us, from hysterical sexting, ""Twilight"" jokes, to even ""Dirty Dancing"". At the end one concluding narrative thread on the surface is humorous, and perhaps unintentionally creepy. Probably chalk it up to the eye of the beholder. Acknowledge and applaud Ficarra and Requa for the poignant and humorous catharsis. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is all about the possibility of finding and fighting for your soul mate. Sure love can make you crazy or sometimes do stupid things. And love is the only thing that matters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A poor imitation of love actually,"Crazy stupid love feels very much like Love actually- in that it features multiple pairs of characters in love and all linked to each other. Crazy Stupid Love is not a bad movie, but it lacks the warmth, the atmosphere, sweetness, and the sincerity of Love Actually. It is also not as funny as Love Actually. Crazy Stupid love is not well written, in that it's dialogue is banal, and it's plot progression quite predictable. Like Love Actually, it's also overly ambitious- I felt that the focus of the movie, on a mopey, pathetic middle aged man, to be not particularly interesting. I would have much rather the film focused on the relationship between the Emma Stone and Ruan Gosling characters. Its observations on love are also trite, banal, and uninspired, and the film never explores anything about true love- the characters use words like 'love' and 'soul mate', when the writing suggests nothing more than simple affection and infatuation between the characters. It is not a romance built on mutual appreciation of each other's qualities, or on complementarity, rather it is one built on the cosmic- the unexplained, and supposedly inexplicable attraction between people. That does not make for particularly believable romances between our characters. What the film does have is good acting, though these talented actors are let down by a poor script. Emma Stone is good and funny, but with very average dialogue, she is not given much to do. Gosling is also suave and confident as the Don Juan, while Steve Carrell is good as the middle aged, pathetic Cal. But beyond its good acting, and several moments of effervescence sprinkled sparingly in the screenplay(for instance the Jacob-Hannah bedroom scene), Crazy Stupid Love is predictable, not very funny, and not very interesting. Not their finest hour.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Everything a romantic comedy should be!,"This was strangely one of the best films I have seen in recent years. I went into it expecting it to be just another ""chick flick"". I came out with almost completely the opposite feelings. First off, what a stellar cast in this movie! Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, and Marisa Tomei?! I was expecting it to be very similar to ""Dan in Real Life"" (a disappointing watch). Crazy, Stupid, Love incorporated all the elements of what a romantic comedy should be. The name itself is enough to summarize the story. Ryan Gosling portrayed a very different role that we know him to be; an unhappy, rich-boy who has an epiphany and meets the right girl. His normal role is one who starts out happy or sad, and just dives deeper down the rabbit hole (Stay, Drive, U.S. of Leland, etc.). Crazy, Stupid, Love was an incredible movie that evoked numerous emotions out of me (which is hard to do) and would probably everyone else who gives it a shot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a bit uneven but good writing and excellent casting make it entertaining,"After twenty-five years of marriage and multiple kids, decidedly uncool Carell is devastated to learn that wife Moore was unfaithful. This sends him into a downward spiral until he crosses paths with virile, insatiable womanizer Gosling, who promises to help him reclaim his manhood. Meanwhile the seemingly self-assured Gosling finds his own personal challenge when he meets beautiful ""game changer"" Stone, an aspiring law student who sees through his smooth-talking routine. What begins as a straightforward, occasionally raunchy comedy eventually shifts tone into a more serious, family-oriented drama; this throws things off kilter a bit, but there are some unexpectedly effective twists, good lines, genuine laughs, a meaningful (if familiar) message, and when cast to perfection like this it's really hard to miss.

It would be nice if we knew what we were getting into, even with a netflix viewing.It's otherwise an honest film that pulls off some unlikely good moments which sounded hard to believe on paper, like the dirty dancing scene. Just when you think every romcom has been made, a pickup artist pulls a loser out of a slump which turns feel good for us all.There was no setup to explain the infidelity properly, and some of the proposed soundtrack was pulled which would have provided another layer of feels.So many complaints that the co protagonist appeared to be filthy rich, you can't please everyone, especially in the 50 shades age where nothing is mysterious anymore.Surprisingly the feminists haven't attacked the film for portraying the irrational nature that causes women to feel attraction.

"Fun, occasionally anarchic rom-com","Armed with an all-star cast, Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy from 2011 about a couple going through a separation and the fallout of that as they both try to move on. When a charming womanizer notices husband Cal (Steve Carell) sitting in a bar feeling sorry for himself, he decides to try and help him out.The film opens with Cal being told by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) that she wants a divorce and has had an affair with a co-worker (played by Kevin Bacon). They separate and Cal, who is struggling with this new information, moves into a new apartment. He then spends his days going to bars alone, drinking way too much and failing to engage with other people. The resident playboy ladykiller, Jacob (Ryan Gosling), frustrated by how lost and miserable Cal is, takes it upon himself to try and coach him to become a lot less rusty when it comes to asking women out.This is not unfamiliar territory for Steve Carell as Crazy, Stupid, Love definitely channels the likes of The 40 Year-Old Virgin, Dan In Real Life, even Date Night, in terms of his character. That said, the film comes into its own about halfway when it starts throwing us curveballs and giving its characters unexpected emotional challenges. This cleverly culminates in a truly chaotic moment when all the plot threads collide at the same time as everything is revealed to every character in one go. The movie's climax after that fails to live up to this key moment but there's more than enough nifty ideas in Crazy, Stupid, Love to make it worth watching nonetheless.Characters who initially feel shallow and one dimensional slowly develop into more substantial, fleshed-out people thanks to a sharp script that may not get everything right but cares enough about its characters, and audience, to develop them fully. This is a genuinely funny romantic comedy with an excellent cast that visibly has a great time, especially during the wackier parts. The twist with one of the characters near the end is handled very well but there's a sense throughout that the film is maybe trying a little bit too hard.A similar twist is attempted earlier and it, frankly, feels a bit unnecessary. As does the whole babysitter subplot with Cal's son which is done well enough but never feels quite right with the rest of the story, as if it simply belongs in a different film. Had the film and its script, which is still quite good regardless, been a bit tighter (the garden stuff is also redundant) we could have had a hilariously crazy, stupid ending with that brawl sequence quickly building up to a genuinely sweet reconciliation instead of the tedious school speech scene. Some of the performances, here and there, are also a bit bigger than they probably should've been for comedic effect but this only translates into mugging at the camera, not so much laughs.When it comes to mainstream romantic comedies, it's really rare to find something genuinely original and worthwhile. There's the occasional gem but, most of the time, we are looking at either a complete cheese-fest or a boring dud. Crazy, Stupid, Love tries something different and, while it's far from flawless, it manages to feel fresh, get quite a few laughs and provide a good time which makes it a cut above a lot of rom-coms.Uneven but likable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fantastic Movie,"Crazy Stupid Love is with no doubts the best (modern) rom-com ever and it's without doubts, my seventh favorite movie and I'm not a fan of romance movies. Let me tell you why I loved it, first of all, it doesn't include those Hollywood cliché, what makes it an original movie, the plot was amazingly written, it had a few genius twists and every single part of it was fantastic. The cast was fantastic, it included one of my favorite actors, Steve Carell, who was just amazing here, It included Ryan Gosling, his great performance was worthy of a Golden Globe nomination. It included Julianne Moore, who was just okay here. It included Emma Stone, who was amazing here. And the cast also included Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon. The soundtrack was amazing and the rest was also amazing. Sow, as you can see, so far, I didn't said there was something bad about this movie, for one simple reason, there isn't, what leaves me able to say that Crazy Stupid Love is a perfect film. Sow, men, women, movie lovers, you all should watch Crazy Stupid Love, it is a rom-com surprisingly cliché-free, it knew how to separate the romance from the hilarious comedy and providing you a fantastic movie with a few touching moments and a few hilarious moments. Watch it right not if you haven't, it's the best (rom-) comedy I've seen since Horrible Bosses, it's worth watching it more than twice because all of the viewings will be an amazing waste of time, a waste of air by the big quantity of jokes and a waste of tears, at least for girls, not for me.Crazy Stupid Love: *****10/10: Sow, Crazy Stupid Love is one of the first rom-com's that can be recommended for men and women and it's clear that everybody will love it, I mean, I'm a man and I consider Crazy Stupid Love one of the 10 best movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Pleasant Surprise,"This film surprised me, despite liking most of the actors in it I always assumed this would be another cheesy chick-flick with some gags thrown in but, it was so much better!The script is simply great. Nearly every actor in this film performs well and it is obvious they all got along well whilst filming. The roles of Julianne Moore and Steve Carell worked well but I particularly liked scenes with Ryan Gosling and Carell talking in the bar because there are some points where you can see they are both trying to hold in laughter and I love seeing that in films. I like to know they enjoyed acting as much as I enjoyed watching this film.Towards the end of the film it begins to get cheesy but not to the point where you start to lose interest. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments in this film and it can leave you in tears with some comedy sequences.Emma Stone's role in this was probably the best. She was hilarious as usual in this with her storyline being quite bizarre. That was my main objection to this film, everyone's storyline was great or at least really funny despite being unbelievable but, the story between Carell and Moore's son and his babysitter was just ludicrous. Not even funny, at some points it was just awkward watching it - especially at the end. I of course will not give anything away but it is the main factor of this film which wasn't really needed, it did provide some laughs but it got to the point where you just didn't want to see them in the film at all.Overall, this is a really good film. It's been a while since I saw a really good girl's film. I would recommend it to those who like comedies but particularly romantic comedies. If you don't like that genre then maybe this film isn't for you but you will still laugh at some parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"'Crazy, Stupid Carell!'","'CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Steve Carell returning to what he does best, emotionally sweet but honest comedy-drama. After a couple mediocre to dud films (like 'DATE NIGHT', 'DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS' and 'DESPICABLE ME'). It's nice to see Carell getting back to higher caliber quality comedy (like his much better earlier films 'THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN' and 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE'). He's not the only reason to see the film though, like those earlier noted films, this is an ensemble piece made up of a lot of great talented actors such as Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei. It's directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who also co-directed 'I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS') and written by Dan Fogelman (who's worked on the screenplays for several kids' films including both 'CARS', 'TANGLED' and 'FRED CLAUS'). The film tells the story of a recently dumped father who attracts the sympathy and mentoring of a younger popular 'ladie's man' bachelor. Carell plays the sad father and Gosling co-stars as the hip 'hot shot' womanizer. It's a well made and effective buddy film with a lot to say about love, relationships and family life as well.The film opens with Cal (Carell) and his wife Emily (Moore) sitting down to a nice dinner in a beautiful restaurant when Emily tells Cal she wants a divorce, much to Cal's surprise. On the drive home she also lets him in on the information that she's had an affair to which Cal responds by jumping from the moving vehicle. Cal takes it like a man and moves into a small apartment but is devastated inside. Their two young children, Robbie (Jonah Bobo) and Molly (Joey King), are hurt by the news as well. Robbie is a thirteen year old with apparent wisdom well beyond his years and has just professed his love to the family babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who secretly has an obsessive crush on Cal. While telling his sob story repeatedly (to anyone who will listen, or won't even) at a local club Cal attracts the attention of Jacob (Gosling) who offers to teach Cal all he knows so he can hopefully 'regain his manhood'. The two bond during their experiment but things become complicated when Emily begins to show feelings for Cal again and Jacob falls for a young lovely woman (Stone).The film is grade A material and production values all around; the cast is outstanding (especially Carell and Gosling, two of my favorite actors), the directing is decent, the film looks great and the script is smart and fun. It's equally as funny as emotionally charged and honest, although it does lose it's way a little towards the end. Like many, many comedic dramas before it the movie takes brief turns into somewhat sappy slapstick. It's a minor amount of screen time but it does come at key points in the film, which does take away a little from it's otherwise greatness. This is it's only true flaw though and you get so much more good from the film than bad. It's like at least twice as good as something like 'DATE NIGHT'. It's refreshing to see Carell return to form and actors like Gosling and Moore branching out a little (from their usual all too serious Oscar bait). As a buddy film it really works, as an emotional drama it really works as well and as a comedy it's equally as impressive. Other than the previously mentioned flaw it is a near perfect example of it's genre and definitely worth checking out.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOOi1HDSXyA",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

An endearing & effervescent rom-com that benefits from its polished script & brilliant direction, and is further strengthened by earnest performances from its fantastic cast, Crazy, Stupid, Love never goes full crazy or stupid but it nonetheless manages to deliver a pleasantly satisfying experience.

"A Nutshell Review: Crazy, Stupid, Love.","Crazy, Stupid, Love. is this season's equivalent of He's Just Not That Into You, Valentine's Day and other recent romantic dramas and comedies that sprawl in their dealing with that titular emotion that can drive you wild when things are going your way, or mad when things aren't, and especially the latter which is what this film had its multiple narratives dwelling on. The ensemble cast makes it a bonus to sit through with its star power on display, with a good mix of veterans and the Hollywood youths stamping their mark to make this a lot more memorable than your typical, formulaic romance.With multiple threads running, we have Steve Carell and Julianne Moore as husband and wife Cal and Emily, who begin the film with an announcement that their marriage is doomed, setting off a catalyst of events and series of stories involving their son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) being infatuated with the family babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), the latter's own infatuation for Cal, Emily and her romantic dalliance with office colleague David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) being the root cause, and Cal being helped by the suave womanizing player Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who falls hard for Hannah (Emma Stone) a lawyer who had spurned his advances, which has so far snagged him all his targets, and is now imparting his technique and knowledge to Cal to help him move on. Think of it as Hitch who doesn't provide a bill, but there to overhaul wardrobe and attitude.Crazy, Stupid. Love. just about covers an entire spectrum both good and bad, well, mostly the challenging aspects about being in love with someone, from the feelings of being unrequited, that of what would be a stable relationship drifting apart, of loving someone much older, office affairs, bar pickups and one night stands, playing the field and being played, and the list goes on. Writer Dan Fogelman packs so much into the narrative though its near two hour runtime doesn't get felt thanks to the superb pacing in giving each aspect, and narrative thread, plenty of room to develop and breathe, not leaving you feeling that they are being rammed down your throat.Some may balk at how convenient the story lines all play out, and frankly the way how the convergence was done was something that Bollywood comedies do on a consistent basis with everything coming together and the revelation being a moment where you inevitably pause to take stock and shake away your complacency, and work at your memory to pick up the clues that have been peppered throughout. It's the same case over here as I didn't see much coming, save for directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (whose previous film was the remarkable I Love You Phillip Morris) to pull the rug from under my feet and making me go ""I should have known"".I'd always prefer Steve Carell in non comedic roles such as Dan in Real Life, that while there are funnier moments, he doesn't draw too much attention to his comedic side unlike his well known 40 Year Old Virgin role, which in some ways this contained shades of. Ryan Gosling aces the player role with his smooth talking charms until his washboard abs got in the way, and Emma Stone was well, Emma Stone in what would be a typical young adult female stuck with that fantasy that her prince charming will finally propose. Julianne Moore was a delight to watch as the woman who had betrayed her husband and still getting confused over her emotions, while Jonah Bobo almost stole the show with his performance as the young man so determined and infatuated with his babysitter, it just hurts. Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon add wonderful supporting screen time and star-studdedness to the ensemble.With some incredibly witty lines that do make you want to sit up and note that real people rarely talk like they do, scripted in a certain way and delivered with impeccable, deliberate timing, Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a romantic comedy that punches above its weight. It may be rote and formulaic in some parts, but as mentioned its Bollywood comedy inspired plot development is something fun to behold. Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"The film conquers the viewer from its first scene. The importance given to each parallel plot is also one of the secrets, making us fully involved with the characters","Screenwriter Dan Fogelman builds a web of funny romantic plots that grows and intertwines as the story develops. A single family serves as a nucleus for us to follow how each one is affected by the pain and happiness resulting from mere infatuations to a great and lasting love. From the father to the pre-adolescent son, the affective attraction captures everyone. However, more than interesting narrative choices, the film gives each of its characters a pleasant authenticity. The comic is always present, but it is the tragic that makes them all so successful. The main character is Cal (Steve Carell), a man who sees his love life fall apart after his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce in the middle of dinner for two. From then on, he starts to act in the most childish way possible, getting drunk every day and insisting on spreading the word to the heavens that his wife cheated on him with a certain David Lindhagen, a name that you never get tired of hearing during the exhibition. Without hiding his fragility, the protagonist conquers the audience by never denying his feelings and allowing himself to be carried away, even if temporarily, by his male instincts, when he has always been the partner of only one woman.The tonic is repeated with the rest of the characters, never sounding tiring. They do what they want, say what comes to mind. Anyway, they are true people, extremely common and, for that very reason, full of defects. They distance themselves from any cliché of the genre. If they sound like stereotypes initially, the next two acts reveal who they really are. In this way, we are introduced to Jacob (Ryan Gosling), an authentic representative of the ""takers"" who avoid any involvement, other than sexual, with women. He even gives conquest lessons to the inexperienced Cal. But it's Jacob who falls in love when a charismatic lawyer named Hannah stands in his way.The exchange of sex for a mere conversation is enough for him to become a more complex man than he appeared. The scene, by the way, is one of the best in the entire film as it displays sensitive and comical dialogues, showing the beginning of a relationship marked by a lack of shame and prejudice, allowing for a relaxation that only brings them closer together. If they are kissing, a sudden hilarious experience in the massage chair lightens the mood, keeping the plot light. Much of the conviction of this recent affection comes from Hannah. The sweetness, mixed with a funny immaturity, of the woman-girl is really conquering.But the premise, more than adequate for a romantic comedy, is just the surface of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"", which develops through an impeccable script whose structure deserves applause not only for being able to provoke organic surprises to the narrative, but also for fulfilling the function of inspiring laughter. In this regard, he is obviously aided by the talented cast, from Carell, who creates a perfect arc in his character composition, to Moore, who demonstrates Emily's divided nature well. Meanwhile, Gosling and Stone use the dynamic between their characters in the evolution of their performances: the former, by showing himself increasingly emotionally vulnerable; the second, by gaining a self-confidence that he lacked at the beginning. In addition, the feature also makes room for John Carroll Lynch, an actor who always does a good job; for Kevin Bacon, who transforms his character into a much more complex type than we might have expected at first, fleeing the stereotype of the ""scoundrel"" that seemed obvious; and for Marisa Tomei, who stars in some of the production's best moments.Complementing the renowned cast are Jonah Bobo (as Robbie) and Analeigh Tipton (as Jessica), respectively, the boy who enjoys his first love and the family nanny who sees Cal as much more than a friendly boss. All of them share sequences, receiving due attention from editing, an important issue in feature films with multiple plots. Only the coincidences presented at the end of the film sound wrong, in an unnecessary search for laughs and surprises.Filmmakers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa exemplarily lead the narrative, whose dramatic climax is also its comic apex, balancing perfectly between sleazy comedy and pure romance. The situations coming from a starting point so common for us, but at the same time so strange for a film of the genre, are hilarious. The female sex will certainly be amused to see in Cal, Jacob and Robbie what has always troubled them. Men, on the other hand, will certainly identify with at least one of the three characters. This is due to the way in which the directors seek to use already well-worn clichés in favor of inverted and curious situations (starting with the choice to leave women as peripheral and subjective characters (the ""horrible"" of the time), while men gain a sensitive deepening and dramatic). Aware that it's all just a nice joke with the greatest truisms of the genre, the filmmakers even use a certain amount of metalanguage when playing on the screen moments in which the characters themselves recognize that they are going through situations they've never seen before. That sense of humor then gets caught on a fine line between commonplace and originality.For the formula to work, a very competent cast was cast, who knew how to tune in and make the situations in the script something even more refreshing. Starting with the most experienced, Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling, who fit like gloves into their roles. Carell for seizing the opportunity to bring to life a character who is within his limits as a dramatic actor, and Ryan for embodying a stud in an unconventional way. Julianne Moore and Emma Stone, as they were mostly ignored by the directors, have little chance to present their artistic talents, but they still work miracles when they enter the scene. The surprise even comes from newcomers Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton, who shine in moments of pure inspiration from the script.Yes, there is something non-sense about the composition of Ficarra and Requa. However, it is not surprising to see all the originality and freshness go down the drain when the plot engages for the final moments. After all, even if different, it is still a romantic comedy, and all of them must have a dose of predictability appearing sooner or later. The ugly slip, however, comes at the time of trying to introduce a somewhat high dramatic load in the endings, when it is already too late to dramatize the situation in excess.The interesting thing about the script and direction is to gradually insert the clichés and play with it, with full awareness. The classic scene is when Cal, caught lying, is left by Emily in the rain and says, ""What a cliché!"" Another clichéd scene is Robbie giving a speech at his own graduation about ""there is no such thing as true love"", causing his father to get up and start a speech about his life story and how he met his mother. The film is also careful not to appeal with scenes of a sexual or scatological nature. The sex scenes that exist are subtle without being vulgar.Lee Haxall's editing is one of the best in recent years and makes the film flow like few times we've seen it, giving notorious fluency, especially in the final twist scenes and in Cal's transformation scenes, when he wears new clothes and flirts at the bar. Andrew Dunn's cinematography and Sue Chan's art direction only contribute and are also excellent, as is the soundtrack by Christophe Beck and Nick Urata.""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" conquers the viewer from its first scene and the narrative is so interesting that time passes very quickly. The importance given to each parallel plot is also one of the director's secrets, making us fully involved with each of the several main characters. A pleasant surprise that pleases everyone with the same strength.Able to please both sexes, this different comedy really focuses on showing male feelings in the face of love. If for men this may seem embarrassing or even embarrassing, for women it is a good opportunity to get to know the sensitive side that is not always expressed by their partners. If it doesn't yield a session of good laughs, at least it promises a reassessment of the traditional concepts of a loving relationship. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa share the direction of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" giving the narrative a pace that never slows down and cleverly using the common soundtrack, which becomes special for the romantic and dense tone that they manage to include in several sequences. But it is the script and the cast that are largely responsible for the asset that is the film, transforming it into a light story that is easy to identify, that touches the heart and makes you laugh in equal proportions. After all, who never did something crazy or stupid for love?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Perfect mix of comedy and romance,It is a movie which you watch and it feels good afterwards. It is a very funny and romantic movie with a little bit of twist at the end.

another Ryan Gosling triumph although that's hardly a surprise,"Aside from the superlative Mr Gosling (God Bless Canada - and here I'm referencing his nationality not a movie he made previously) which makes it a given, this movie is both great and good, and easily one of the best rom-coms I've seen in a very long time (Friends with Benefits the only other one recently). Described by a friend as a ""modern day Parenthood,"" if you remember that ?80s Steve Martin masterpiece, it too is a look at an extended family/social circle and how it falls apart and comes together again. Carell plays it straight and leaves his silly characters behind (much better than Date Night) and this is the first thing I think I've seen him in that I really enjoyed. He was perfect as the hapless cuckold, opposite the under-utilised but memorable Julianne Moore. Gosling and Carell seemed to have good chemistry (as did Gosling and Stone but who can blame her opposite Hollywood's rightful goldenboy du jour), with Gosling being the comedy-timing genius of the piece, and he was perfect. Flawless. Marissa Tomei often over-acts and is a little too samey but here she pitched it just right, and showed her superior quality for such a small rather silly/crazy role, Kevin Bacon the same bringing quite a bit extra into his few appearances. The younger cast were surprisingly good and I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Bobo, who showed maturity and confident delivery in quite a complex child part. In short, all the cast were great - also mention the actress who played Stone's best friend; very funny.Well scripted, acted and with a lot of heart as well as humour, CSL is up to date and relatable. A great family movie, or just for the eye candy that is Mr G it's worth a peek; if you can watch the Dirty Dancing scene without making an impromptu squeaking noise when he takes off his shirt - or react like Stone does - its time to call the paramedics - I'm just saying, as he is startlingly lovely. Overall its an interesting look at dating psychology, a rather cynical look at it actually, but also looks at true love and friendship too, and what matters in a relationship. Heart warming, and enjoyable, I prefer Parenthood although this one has Ryan Gosling (Parenthood has Keanu Reeves) so it's a close run thing. Loved the surprising garden scene - didn't see that coming, shock - was a little distracted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The worst movie I've seen in a LONG time.,"Aside from an occasionally inspired moment or two from Marisa Tomei, this movie is an unstructured, poorly-scripted, badly-edited waste of some very talented people's time. Steve Carell took it upon himself to shepherd this to fruition quite unwisely -- maybe he should think long and hard about the material he wants to bring to the screen. Between this and ""Dinner For Schmucks,"" he's done a poor job of working the post-""Office"" movie angle. The script left no hint as to what anyone was feeling, and we had to take it on face value what was going on in the characters' heads. We were never given a clue as to whether we should like Carell, Gosling, Moore, Bacon, etc. I don't know how you get anything this wrong.Oh, and Julianne Moore was miscast.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

If you want some scary facts, look up the historical incidence of STD's in the USA--Herpes is one example: check the graph from 1967 to the present, up every single year--There were 15,000 monthly visits to doctors regarding herpes in 1967--That number is now 350,000!!

real potential down the drain,"I went to see this movie only because Steve Carell was in this and he is always good, given the right material. Given that this is a romantic comedy, I wasn't expecting anything new considering it's the same story over and over again. The movie had a good story and the first half was fun and entertaining, but into the second hour, the movie lost me because like all comedies, eventually the fun draws to a close and it just becomes ridiculous. A lot of this movie is implausible and would never happen in real life and there are way to many stories going on which makes the script more convoluted than it needs to be. Julianne Moore and Kevin Bacon are bored as heck on screen with barely anything to do except to spike the movie's budget up for a few known faces in the industry. This movie also has way too many twists ad turns to knock you on your ass and bewilder you. With a cast as stellar as this and two directors, you would think it would be more unique and to the point, but this becomes a mess and fast. I was really looking forward to this and wanted like it, but as a whole package, it just gets soggy after a while.

Julianne Moore, Steve Carrell, and Ryan Gosling delivered in their roles as well as Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon who get caught up in the family conflict. Steve Carell, as Cal, was the husband who reacted with the cold, silent treatment when his wife and lifelong love, Emily (Julianne Moore), asked for a divorce. He then embarked on a freewheeling lifestyle with advice from Jacob, self-proclaimed dating expert, played by Ryan Gosling.

Wonderfully written sharp comedy drama,"Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) starts struggling with life when his wife of over 20 years Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) wants a divorce. When he meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) at a club however, he starts to look at life in a whole different way.Crazy, stupid, love is crazy. It's also diverse, humorous, contains tremendous comedy performances and is superbly written. Starting off with a wonderful scene between Moore and Craell the tone is set for a bittersweet tongue in cheek lash out loud comedy drama. This is wonderfully balanced, taking into account Cal's emotional dilemma and the conflicting decisions of his wife.Steve Carell, renowned for his more slapstick style of humour expands into a great main role in this film, playing a dramatic styled performance but giving the grown ups some great one liners. After he gets over his first hurdle there is a scene where he walks into the pub, like he is the king of the world. This is fantastic and you will be smiling, pure comic timing genius.Julianne Moore fits her role well as well, playing off the other characters with ease and necessity.But Ryan Gosling is the real star of this 2011 picture. His bravado out for himself protagonist is cocky, is arrogant is whatever negative adjective you want to use. And yet he manages to seduce every woman he sees, making him the envy of everyman and the eve candy for every woman. This film for me excels through its drama rather than the comedy. Taking into account the situations the characters find themselves involved in, the story plays out slowly, getting deep into the character's minds and expanding to deliver a pinch of comedy at the appropriate moments.In many ways the film may have exceled more if there was more screen time for Kevin Bacon and Emma Stone. The stories involving Weaver's son and his crush is rather stretched and playing off on last ditch attempts to win one another's hearts only takes the film so far without giving the viewer anymore hope.This story also contains some great observations on love and what it means for people of all ages and who should know what love is and how to go about proving your love from someone.

All of those elements make Crazy,Stupid,Love a fantastic and entertaining Comedy-Drama that is worth the time.Set in Los Angeles,California,Crazy,Stupid,Love tells the story of Cal(Steve Carell),a man who's wife and High School sweetheart Emily(Julianne Moore)wants a divorce. Heartbroken and emotionally scarred,Cal receives advice from Jacob(Ryan Gosling),a smooth talking ladies man who that not only becomes Cal's friend but also teaches Cal to and to pick up woman at the clubs and bars and become a new Cal that is more confident and self-assured.Most would agree that Romantic Comedies,while successful at the Box Office are predictable,sentimental and sappy but every once in a while there is a gem or a diamond in the rough to be found in the Romantic Comedy genre that stands out from the crowd and gives viewers a fresh take on the genre and one of those gems and diamonds in the rough is Crazy,Stupid,Love,a wonderful,hilarious and truly bittersweet Romantic Comedy-Drama that was a Box Office success but was overlooked because most people thought is was going to be another Romantic Comedy but the film is very underrated and is one of the best and better films of the Romantic Comedy genre. Crazy,Stupid,Love is a great movie that seems like from it's title is going to be a typical run-of-the-mill Rom-Com but the movie gives viewers something that is a little different from the norm and showing us a film that is very funny and heartfelt as well as fascinating and observant about love,romance and relationships because in Crazy,Stupid,Love themes of love,romance and relationships can come in all shapes and sizes with an hilarious and very interesting look at concepts and subjects such as failing relationships,beginning romances and unrequited love that effects people of all ages. This is a movie that just keeps you glued to the screen and will give viewers many emotions and feelings such as laughter,sadness and heartbreak while telling viewers to have a good time with this bittersweet tale of love and romance. The Comedy and Humor in CSL is funny and amusing and does a fantastic job striking a balance between going over the top and playing it straight because there is moments throughout the film that will make you laugh out loud while there are funny scenes that are more subtle. What also makes CSL funny is how unpredictable it can be at times and the twists and turns you won't see coming at all. The movie not only gives viewers the main plot involving Cal and Jacob but subplots involving other characters a subplot involving Jacob falling for working girl Hanna(Emma Stone)and another subplot about Cal's young son Robbie(Jonah Bobo)who's in love with his babysitter Jessica(Analeigh Tipton)who in turn has a crush on Cal. The many story lines and plots all mesh together well in CSL and there is not a wasted scene in the entire film. What I also enjoy about CSL is that the film is not afraid to be a little serious and dramatic especially with some of the characters giving them depth and tons of weight which makes the characters real and sympathetic while at the same time being over the top. The screenplay by Dan Fogelman is terrific and well-written,with Fogelman giving each of the main characters great dialog that is funny and interesting with many memorable scenes. The ending of Crazy,Stupid,Love is wonderful and a good cap-off to the film although some will find it predictable and obvious because of the genre and it's conventions but I like the ending. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is great. Steve Carell is excellent and hilarious as Cal,with Carell being funny and serious. Ryan Gosling is brilliant and funny as Jacob,with Gosling being cool and charismatic. Julianne Moore is wonderful as Emily,Cal's wife. Emma Stone is terrific as Hannah,Jacob's love interest. Analeigh Tipton is amusing as Jessica,a babysitter who has a crush on Cal. Jonah Bobo does a fine job as Robbie,Cal's son who's in love with Jessica. Kevin Bacon(David Lindhagen)and Marisa Tomei(Kate)are fun and memorable in their small roles. Beth Littleford(Claire),John Carroll Lynch(Bernie),Liz Lapira(Liz),Julianna Guill(Madison),Josh Groban(Richard)and Joey King(Molly)give good performances as well.The direction by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa is great,with Ficarra and Requa always moving the camera and giving the film and nice tone and visual style. Wonderful direction,Ficarra and Requa.The score by Christope Black and Nick Urata is fantastic,quirky and matches the bright tone of the movie. Fine score Black and Urata.In final word,if you love Romantic Comedies or Comedies in general,I highly suggest you Crazy,Stupid,Love,an excellent,hilarious and underrated Romantic Comedy that you will watch again and again.

"Charming, touching, surprising and fun to watch as well as being easy to identify with","Dan Fogelman, who wrote Cars and other successful animated movies wrote this well thought out comedy about all too human relationships. He wrote it having Steve Carell in mind as Cal , the middle age guy around whom all the actions swirls as his marriage suddenly falls apart. Carell loves the project and decides to produce it with Warner Brothers coming on board to make it a big studio film. The team of Glen Ficarra and John Requa are brought in to direct it. They have been working together since their college days at Pratt in New York City. They have written Bad Santa and Bad News Bears as well as recently directing I Love You Phillip Morris with Jim Carrey. After meeting these three talented people at our screening we can see how their chemistry worked for this character driven comedy with a wonderful cast. Ryan Gosling played Jacob, the cool single but obviously complex guy who takes the recently jilted Cal under his wing. Julianne Moore is Emily, Cal's wife who is going through what she describes as a mid-life crisis. Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon round out this all star cast with each putting just the right touch on their characters. Special mention should be made about young Jonah Bobo who plays Robbie, the 13 year old son of Cal and Emily whose emotional experience helps all the characters and the audience understand the essence of the movie. The result is not only a funny comedy but a touching story which examines love that can start as teenagers and sometimes be destined to last a life time with trials and tribulations. It also looks at teenage ""love"" that may only just feel like love. The story line is close to being brilliant as the characters evolving relationships are charming, touching, surprising and fun to watch as well as being easy to identify with.

Fun and well made,"Crazy, stupid, love is a movie that managed to be fun and entertaining throughout the whole screen time. Well made, it presents a complicated love situation which involves more people within different ages. The actors were well chosen for their roles, making it easy for them to perform solid acts, often making the movie funny. Ryan Gosling is by far my favourite, adding a lot of value to the screen.The main ""problem"" with this movie is the idea itself. Simple yet complicated, this movie doesn't dive deep in its theme.

"Crazy Stupid Love, thats what it is","Funny and intriguing at the same time is what I have to say about this movie. It's interesting to see how dots connect in a different field of our society, where a younger person teaches a middle aged man how to discover something he is not familiar with.Definitely a thumbs up for the comedy which although not always ""laugh out loud"" type comedy, but definitely puts a smug grin on your face. The screenplay was vivid with no sense of interruption with aspects diverting away from the point of the story. One is glued really to the screen as it curiosity is raised as to what happens next.Casting for the roles could not have been better. With Ryan Gosling playing a more jocund character than normal and Steve Carell being himself, the combination is ecstatic.This movie cannot be missed for those comedy aficionados and neither for the fans of these two stars.

CSL,"What a pleasant surprise this was. A charming, clever, fun exploration of the various forms of love that take place in the lives of our ensemble cast. Love isn't always, sweet, romantic and clean. Sometimes it's messy, complicated and people can fall out of it just as hard as they fall in.The latter part I really appreciated for the majority of this. Even aside from that though, everyone is doing such excellent work here that I found myself getting invested in most of the relationships.It does run into the problem that all movies like this seem to face though. Getting all of these divergent storylines to meet up takes a heavy dose of plot convenience to make work and I frankly never buy it. I also have some issues with the ending that I won't go into to avoid spoilers.Still, this is a fun little movie. It's a bit of a shame that it's been severely one-upped by better films (La La Land and Marriage Story cane to mind) but this is still a pleasantly enjoyable watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"This is crazy, unashamedly stupid, this is love - just a shameless but hilarious portrayal of love","Well, it's certainly not your average romantic comedy. Like other films of similar genre, though, it was still clichéd. I wouldn't find this among the Hollywood cheese, but I wouldn't find it as a classic. It still had that small spark that let it down, which I appreciate because it wasn't major, and it didn't try too hard to be funny. In fact, this film was pretty relaxed and like people say, the unabashed humour just made it a feel-good as well as a romantic comedy.I loved the actors who played their characters, I like Steve Carell for his dry humour, Ryan Gosling was supposed to be the lady-killer who was actually quite funny, but I wasn't as attracted to him as much as the rest of the characters. As well as Emma Stone, I really enjoyed Kevin Bacon's little role – I mean, who can get more awesome than him, especially with just such an awesome name?I was right, this is a great ensemble of characters, it was extremely funny, and because of the shameless (quite) realistic portrayal of how love works, this wasn't your usual romantic comedy from Hollywood.

Feel-good romantic comedy that hits the right notes,"Do we each have a soul mate? Is there one person for everyone, and if so, shouldn't we do everything in our power to fight for that person when we find them? Those questions are at the heart of Crazy, Stupid, Love., and even though this film might not provide definitive answers to these questions, it does a great job of providing some entertainment along the way.Steve Carell is excellent as Cal, a 40-something man who has only ever loved his wife (Emily, played by Julianne Moore), and whose world falls apart when he finds out that she has cheated on him and wants a divorce. Following that bombshell, Cal meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling) at a bar, a good-looking, smooth-talking womaniser, who seemingly goes home with a different woman of his choosing every night of the week.Crazy, Stupid, Love. Isn't a film that will change your life in any way, but it does what it does really well, and will make you laugh, smile and enjoy the two hours you spend with it.

Interesting but too raw,"We get multiple story lines showcasing all the different forms of love (teen, struggling, lustful, immoral, true, forbidden) that comes together in a major climactic moment which was both ridiculous and funny. It was an interesting watch, it showcases pretty well how messy life can get if you let the feelingy type of love take the wheel. The first part of the story that romanticizes the womanizer, sexually adventurous lifestyle was just a memento for all the dumb cliché romcoms which try to show this as something ""fun"". It didn't help that some of the jokes were the typical romcom sex jokes. The movie redeems itself in a way at the and when it comes to some kind of conclusion where it admits that this lifestyle causes harm, and true, faithful love is better. Everything is still kinda messed up but hopefully people learned. So we have some things to think about here (if we try to take this seriously and not just watch a funny way of bringing a lot of substories together) but the way it is portrayed is mixed. Anyway Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are great, especially their chemistry. Steve Carell is good and nothing more can be said here. Cinematography, music, everything else is just ok. Its the story and the aforementioned actors that bring the movie on their back.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It jumps out of the car in its final moments.,"'Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011)' almost lands on the right message, but eventually caves into the age-old cliché of 'one true love' in the worst possible way by essentially endorsing stalking. Seriously, the Robbie and Jessica storyline ends in such a terrible way; I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with that one. Elsewhere, though, this is an enjoyable and generally sweet romantic comedy that somehow manages to make you eventually care about an unlikable womanizer who's initially insufferable save for the fact he's played by the very charming Ryan Gosling. Steve Carrell is funny and compelling as the led-astray lead, Julianne Moore grounds the film as something more than a simple comedy (it has dramatic chops when it needs them), John Carroll Lynch is perfectly cast once you realise what his big scene is going to be, and Emma Stone is wholly convincing as the cute lawyer capable of making Gosling's pick-up 'artist' actually want to settle down. There are a fair few funny scenes sprinkled throughout the affair, and it's also packed with several unsuspected twists and turns that have you kicking your feet with glee when they're revealed. For me, however, it isn't as consistently engaging as I'd like; it never quite gets out of third gear. It's enjoyable and amusing enough for what it is, of course, but there is quite a bit of untapped potential considering the amount of on-screen talent involved. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, some of its messaging is pretty dodgy and you do spend quite a bit of time watching some rather objectionable behavior. At its best, it's charming and bubbly; at its worst, it's ill-conceived and slightly dull. It's one of those movies that reminds you just how long ago 2011 really was, if you know what I mean. Still, it's a decent effort overall that ought to provide at least some entertainment to fans of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Very enjoyable on so many Levels,"Let me start by writing how much I enjoyed this Movie. It is funny, quite original, stylishly directed and the acting of the main characters are very good. Jacob(Ryan Gosling) and Cal (Steve Carell) do make a very good team and they add to every scene they have together in their very own way. Ryan is the confident and handsome young man and Cal is the at first quirky and awkward yet funny older guy. I also liked that both Characters are getting enough screen-time of their own and also that we see where Jacob is coming from and how he can actually afford his lifestyle which was something that I was dying to find out. I gave it 8 out of 10 points for the simple reason that it had too many resemblances to 2 other movies which kind of robbed this movie of being its very own piece. The first movie is obviously ""Hitch"" starring Will Smith which follows a similar story-line but more on the ""funny chick flick"" side. The second movie is ""40 year old virgin"" which coincidentally also stars Steve Carell and he also gets a lot of help to (re)discover his manhood.One point bothered me a little bit. I would not go as far and call it a plot hole but it makes you think. How come that Ryan Gosling has to dress smart, be extremely confident, has an incredible upper body, has to ""do certain moves"" and throw money around to get girls and on the other hand there is this lawyer guy who managed to score EMMA STONE'S character with none of the above mentioned. Think about it ;)Nevertheless, this movie has a lot of laugh out loud moments, a great cast throughout and very entertaining twists. If you are looking for a great movie night in, not only with your girlfriend but with your friends and family, this is the movie to watch as it will have something for everybody. A lot of pretty ladies for the guys, Ryan Gosling for the ladies and a very witty and entertaining storyline for the whole family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very funny,"This is the funniest film I have seen in a long time. It's a strange film in a way as it's billed as a Rom-Com but is far edgier and much funnier than that.I am not a particularly big fan of Steve Carrel but here he excels as a man left bewildered when his wife admits to an affair. What follows is slightly surreal as he is taken under his wing by the charming Rylan Gosling and taught about how to woo women. The results are hilarious as both men change the way they think over the course of the following months.An excellent cast featuring great performances from Gosling, Julianne Moore and the impressive Emma Stone make the very funny script come to life.

"If you didn't like it, you didn't 'get it.'","I thought this movie was hilarious. It made a bit of a mockery of the 'PUA' lifestyle, which if you don't know what that is, you wont get some of the jokes. There was a few rude things in there, but it wasn't over the top like the disgusting and unfunny movie, 'Ted.' I found myself laughing out loud, Carells sense of humour is like an art, and he is just so natural. I read some people complaining about the story line, editing and humour. They claim there's no romance or humour. Trust me, there is. If you find certain sexual topics a bit uncomfortable to watch with you family, be warned. They aren't graphic or disgusting, just a bit awkward. Overall, very funny movie, well worth the watch, and not a second of boredom!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Still good all these years later.....,"7.0/10 (Recommend)Another great romcom that gets a little messy and rocky with its storytelling, but it definitely hits a spot of love. I didn't pay attention to who was in this movie, or watch the trailer and I'm glad I didn't. Every time someone came on screen I was taken aback and enjoyed their character more. The chemistry is all there though and that's what makes this movie standout a bit.This movie is funny and kind of cute. It's not necessarily laugh out loud the entire time, but you get some solid chuckles in. The chaos almost enhances it sometimes.It gets a little confusing at times because at one point there's five or six different plots you're trying to track at the same time, but it eventually shakes itself out. The pacing is relatively good. There were a few spots I got a little bored, and almost zoned out, but I managed once things picked up again.I did enjoy the morales of the story. People can change. Love has to be worked for. Rocky roads may come, but the cliff doesn't have to. You can't give up, but you may need to give space for things to workout.Overall, definitely a movie I'd recommend. Solid cast with great chemistry. Slight pacing issues, but an enjoyable story with some comedy to get you through the rough patches.That's all for now.

"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","After their ill-fated director debut, I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS (2009), duo filmmakers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa comes back with this sleeper hit in the lukewarm summer last year, it is a G-rated rom-com, composed of run-of-the-mill scenarios, but exquisitely draws me head over heels for it.It took 6 years for Steve Carell to upgrade his 40-year-old-virgin status to a 44-year-old- loyal-husband honor, whose sexual object has remained as singular form with his soulmate (then high-school sweetheart, now the wife for 22 years, who is submerging into a quotidian middle age crisis). Steve exudes a tremendous bent of poker-face acting in this film, flavored with a whiff of sarcastic and knowing jokes; it is also a delight to embrace Julianne Moore back to a mainstream rom com since LAWS OF ATTRACTION (2004), her role is well-measured and no one will ever doubt her capacity to be competent for it. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone pair suffers from a shorter screen time for their corresponding story about an invincible womanizer meets the girl of his life; but Gosling has the qualification to stride swaggeringly in the Hollywood now because his filmography proves that he is the next George Clooney with a much earlier inception (judging fairly by his three films coming in 2010). There are a third love lateral in the film, a 13-year-old boy's puppy love, could have been a filler, but owing to youngster Jonah Bobo's precocious strain, it parallels immaculately with the main artery. Another two big names here Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, the former's short appearance is the most hysterical part of the film and the latter is unworthily unprepossessing.Near ⅔ of the film, there is a sterlingly concocted plot twist which could be a gratifying surprise, which attests not only Dan Fogelman's well-structured script but Ficarra-Requa's ingenuity as well, I have seen a budding spark from this worn-out genre of Hollywood film industry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Yet another romcom,"This is yet another romcom drama movie. It did not appeal to me much although the movie has many positive aspects.

The slow motion shots just make the movie more cheap. I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies and I wonder whether they got inspired from Bollywood.On the positive side, you have excellent music score and amazing acting with big names associated with it.

"Smart, sassy, funny and loving all mixed into one","I never once thought I would give a film such a high rating but this film truly deserves it! I never once wrote a IMDb review before but this film was too amazing so I just had to write one!I love how it has separate story lines but cleverly intertwines towards the end. All the cast were perfect and could not ask for a better one. I thought it was a great idea to mix all famous 'in' actors/actresses that usually appear in one particular genre. For example, Emma Stone and Steve Carrell usually appear in comedy films whereas Ryan Gosling usually appears in more serious films but oh no, the film has everything. It's funny, sexy, sassy, smart and really sweet all mixed into one which rarely pulls off but this film truly did pull it off.Furthermore, this is a great story, giving a moral message about soul mates and love and how age doesn't have to be a limit.If you haven't seen this yet, go watch it now!

Depressing anti-romance,"Some Hollywood writer who's been burned at love decides, ""Hey, if I have to be miserable, I'm gonna make everyone around me miserable too."" Thus is born Crazy, Stupid, Love.But to sucker the public into the theaters they have to market it as a rom-com, so the stars do the publicity tours and call it a wonderful, funny movie. Then you go see it hoping to get what's been advertised, but it soon takes a turn away from the nice, funny story it starts as and harps endlessly about infidelity, child porn, the futility of trying to get back together and the hopelessness of life.Against all this negativity and depravity they throw in some really ham handed slapstick (the actors must have been embarrassed while they shot some of these scenes) and a cute kid, the boy who plays Robbie and steals the show, and some surprise twists. A twist is OK, it spices up a movie, but you know they're desperate when they put in another surprise twist, and then another one, and then another one.And then they end it all with a lecture delivered by the leading man, whose embarrassment at delivering the lines seems to go beyond acting to reality.I tried to give this movie a 3 rating because of the humor, which is good in places, but I just couldn't. On the IMDb scale of 10 it gets a 2.There are Tragedies and there are Comedies, and if you are one of those people who likes Tragedy I guess you'll probably think this movie is OK.

I loved it ... but the wife hated it.,"I rented this movie thinking I would score big points in selecting a funny, romantic movie on the night of my wife's 43rd birthday.She ended up not liking it, but I, on the other hand, thought it was a hoot. So, guys, don't be surprised if you end of sleeping on the couch after renting this one for your date or significant other.This film represents the romantic changes and challenges we face as we mature.Seen from all perspectives (15-year old boy, 18 year old girl, 20-something bachelor, 40-something parents), you come away bewildered at the complexities of love, marriage and relationships in general.How do we marry and keep it fresh after so many years? How does a career bachelor finally find true love? How does a boy express feelings about his babysitter? How do we know we are with the right companion? I liked this film because it touched a nerve with me, and spoke certain truths that I hadn't considered before.My wife, on the other hand, couldn't get past the multiple triangles of relationship building (especially amongst the younger characters), and I think checked out mentally before she should have.This is a quality piece of work with some solid acting, character development and a few surprises at the end.

Surprisingly enjoyable,"I watched this movie on the back of viewing Drive (also starring Ryan Gosling) and was not expecting anything particularly groundbreaking. I'm a big fan of Steve Carell and greatly enjoyed Easy A mainly due to Emma Stone's performance so the film did offer some possibilities for me. I watched it half-grudgingly, as I usually try to avoid any form of romantic comedy due to their usual formulaic nature.However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which didn't follow the usual formula of crass romantic comedies of the past few years. It made great use of its actors comedic skills, and predictably Carell comes off the best. However, Stone gets some great lines and delivers them like a seasoned pro. Gosling even manages some great subtle reactions, full of suave raised eyebrows and casual charm. I even managed to not hate Julianne Moore's bizarre facial expressions as much as I usually do.I wonder if it would be possible to turn out a decent a film with just this cast and nothing else, even the lesser known actors do an incredible job and in the case of the kids and teenagers, often show up the adults. The bar scenes between Gosling and Carell are the best in the movie, but the climax at the school graduation and the showdown in the garden are so incredibly well written its hard not to be impressed no matter what your taste is.As far as I could ascertain, everyone is either related or in love with each other, but the complex relationship web is easy to understand and you really begin to root for the struggling lovers and even the not-so- struggling in the case of Gosling. Carell manages to dispense of the Will Ferrell-inspired random shouting for genuine awkward hilarity which shows he only continues to grow as a comedian. The young cast also turn out impressive performances and Marisa Tomei's role is not only perfectly cast but magnificently played.For anyone who has felt the sting or unrequited love, or the problems that can arise from a stale marriage or a relationship that seems dead, you'll find an extremely accurate portrayal in one of these plot threads. They really do speak from experience and the ways in which the characters come full circle and tie together so beautifully at the end of the film is inspired.The story is nothing magical or particularly inspiring, but it has a great pace and is effortlessly told. My only issue with the film from a business standpoint is the title, it will turn off a lot of guys won't want to watch it because it sounds like another standard chick film. It shouldn't be a surprise of a good film, but it is. I watched it as an agreement with my girlfriend and it turned out to be win win, my advice is not to be put off by the sugary title and ridiculous cover shot and watch it, as there really is a different movie underneath the saccharine that is so easy to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Brilliant addition to the romantic comedy genre,"Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Hulu.

A playboy at the bar is sick of hearing the whining and offers to help the divorcee get back to being a confident man that can once again attract ladies...This movie is codirected by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who also worked together on Focus, and stars Steve Carell (The Office), Ryan Gosling (Barbie), Julianne Moore (Boogie Nights), Emma Stone (The Help), Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny), Kevin Bacon (Friday the 13th) and Lio Tipton (Warm Bodies).This picture is well written with a unique premise and fantastic characters.

Here is a romantic comedy written with intelligence, driven by its story, and delivered with actors who are both competent and charming. And, what do you know, people actually know about it.The movie is about a set of individuals who have, in their own personal way, lost track of true love. A few of them may have never even experienced it in the first place, but their story is about how they get there. Let me tell you about them real quick. Cal and Emily Weaver (Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore) are a middle-aged couple whose marriage has hit a major bump. Emily has confessed to being guilty with adultery, and is now requesting for a divorce.Cal, in obvious shock, is swift to break the news to his children. Most affected is 13-year-old Robbie, who is in the middle of his quest of winning the heart of his 17-year-old baby sitter, Jessica. Kids, at the height of their hormones, can be relentless in their romantic pursuits. There is a lot of comedy between their encounters.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/crazy-stupid-love-movie- review/",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Let's get out of here,"Steve Carrell is getting a divorce. He's typically Steve Carrell until he meets Ryan Gosling who's rich, kind of mean, and slaps Steve repeatedly into having a fashion sense and a way with women. Their chemistry is great on screen.If you can get past the rather painfully-aged womanising and general uncomfortable humour of the first half an hour, the film is an elegy to soulmates and a sweet if sometimes cringy one.After a fun twist and the ensuing brawl the plot probably could have cut straight to reconciliation. It's not horrific but the film is slightly too long as it stands and doesn't quite maintain interest all the way through. With 20 minutes to go you may find yourself wishing Gosling would come and offer you a way out of your seat...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A fresh breeze of original love comedy!,"It's been a long time since a movie made me smile so much. Why was I putting it off for so much time even though it was on my list? A refreshing love comedy with deep meanings, fantastic humor and plot strength that keeps it interesting until the end. Excellent casting, the roles are made 100% for the chosen actors, the chemistry was phenomenal!

"Return to genre of ""Good"" Date movies","Good date movies, or RomComs as they are called, are getting rarer these days. Sure we've regular barrage of typical Jennifer Aniston and Katherine Heigl movies, but a good RomCom, we haven't seen in years. The kind that peaked in 90s with Meg Ryan movies( You've got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle), Love Actually, and Notting Hill. This is why Crazy, Stupid, Love comes as a breathe of fresh air. It covers all the basics. I know it is not realistic, but RomComs are not supposed to be so. They are supposed to fill you with a bittersweet feeling, they've to be in words of Notting Hill: ""Surreal, but nice"". CSL is story of Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore, as they try to fight their mid-life crisis, story of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, as they find love in one night stands, and story of teenagers as they experience their first love. And it goes beyond depicting love at different life stages; it shows how they are inter-connected and love, despite of what is your age, is just love. And finally music. Any good RomCom has a great score and CSL is as previously mentioned, has a great score for a RomCom after many, many years. Songs are beautifully woven in the fabric of the movie. You begin to sense bitterness of a divorce in ""Alamanc"" and ecstasy of a great closure in ""Blood"". Shakespeare invented RomCom genre with his plays. It has romantic element and is a comedy because it ends with a positive closure for characters we've begun to love. CSL is RomCom of true proportions, where comedy is not used as a cheap selling point, but a smile on viewer's face comes from the subtlety. Here is where CSL scores. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The romance is all over the place but the talent makes it work,"Our ultimate expectations of a romance film are hypocritical. On one hand, we expect a grounded film: real people in real relationships with real feelings doing not necessarily sane but at least rational things in the name of love. On the other hand, we relish in fairytale depictions of love and the idea that true love finds a way and other poetic notions such as soul mates. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" fights this battle longer and to more extreme degrees than anything before it. Those with the fairytale soft-spot will take to it instantly, but even those who tip their scales in favor of believable romance will find something that resonates.Heartfelt and natural performances from a range of excellent actors yanks this out of the rom-com nebula and into something seemingly more tangible. With talents lesser than Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, this would not only be a rom-com, but also the flamboyant marshal of the rom-com parade. Although powerless against the cliché moments and improbable romantic gestures of Dan Fogelman's script, they add incredible emotional realism to his smaller, more intimate moments.Carell stars as Cal Weaver who in the opening seconds learns that his wife, Emily (Moore), wants a divorce. After throwing himself from their car when learning she had an affair with David Linhagen (Kevin Bacon), he goes home and prematurely squeals the news to his babysitter, high schooler Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who happens to have a crush on him. His 13-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), also overhears — and he's got a crush on Jessica.Once again, with generic rom-com mainstays in place, bringing a sense of realism to this convenient and nearly farcical romantic chaos would've been almost impossible. Carell has his character on lock down, blending his ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Dan in Real Life"" characters into an earnest yet loony portrait of a middle-aged man learning to float after his lifelong stability gives out on him. Moore deftly navigates the territory of a woman in midlife crisis who's emotionally unsatisfied but completely unsure how to handle it. In contrast, Robbie is so completely far from a typical 13-year-old boy it's insulting. If his relentless pursuit of Jessica ever finally clicks in any form of the word, it's not until the very end and the fact that it basically works at that point is nothing short of magic.Then there's Jacob (Gosling), the handsome (I'm underselling him) womanizer who takes a dejected Carell under his wing and teaches him the ways (""Karate Kid"" references abounding) of the bar pick up. He's such a smooth natural in his role he could pick up someone watching this movie despite their knowledge of being played. Jacob's backstory (why he's at this bar every night picking up women) ends up a casualty, which was really a big mistake, but Gosling has such a strong way with transparency that we believe all Jacob says or does. There's no doubt that he actually feels something for Hannah (Stone), even if it materializes way faster than it should.Quickness and exaggeration are two of the chief factors of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" that threaten to derail it in the eyes of those looking for grounding to their romance. Cal's gut reaction to his wife's divorce request, not trying to rectify the situation instead of bailing for the bar, seems hasty. After learning well from Jacob and becoming a ladies' man himself, his attempts to get Emily back don't gel, perhaps because they come at the ushering of his unrealistic 13- year-old son. Especially when the film reaches it's big revealing climax, the rash reactions and failures to communicate get really frustrating.""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" dashes willy-nilly between moments of emotional realism and romantic exaggeration and realistic humor and comedic exaggeration, enough to make your head spin. After all, this was directed by Glen Ficarra and John Requa, the team behind ""Bad Santa"" and ""I Love You, Phillip Morris,"" both of which go extreme and dark places for laughs yet try to stay human.So how does it all — for the most part — ever manage to unscramble? The performances are truly the key, but the film's success comes down these intimate, down-to-earth moments throughout, like when Emily calls Cal without knowing he can see her from the backyard. These quieter moments give the actors a chance to shine and Fogelman's dialog has some real bright spots too. These moments help build support for the characters, a support and general liking that mostly doesn't tear apart throughout the absurd and unrealistic moments. It's a completely wild ride between two drastically different approaches to romance, but considering that all the contrast and paradox only bolsters the title ""Crazy, Stupid, Love,"" it has to be considered a success.~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

good for man and woman,i really like Juliana Moore she is pretty and so is Emma stone she is so i don't know there is just something about her and then Marissa tome is also really pretty. I don't usually like romantic comedies but this kind of wasn't it reminded me a little of 40 year virgin only better because it gave perspective of younger people and the older. if this is a twist and you haven't watch don't read more i didn't know until it happened in the movie Emma stone is Steve carrels daughter. that scene to follow made me laugh it was great. it got me to thinking to about dating and stuff and i can kind of relate. maybe you have to connect with the characters or find them attractive i don't know but coming from a 28 year old male i liked it and would watch it again,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Funny the way it should be,"Cal Weaver (Steve Carrell) is happy in his marriage and dotes on his two children. Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) is dedicated to the pursuit of one-night stands with beautiful women. And Hannah (Emma Stone) is a soon-to-be lawyer in love with a man who her best friend believes is beneath her but who Hannah (Stone) is genuinely hoping will propose. But Weaver (Carrell) is blindsided when his wife of more than 20 years, (played by Julianne Moore) confesses she's been unfaithful and wants a divorce.We soon find Cal Weaver living in an apartment spending an inordinate amount of time at a local pickup joint drinking heavily and repeatedly stating the particulars of his wife's infidelity to the establishment's clientele. This puts a serious crimp in Jacob's evening and so he offers his advice and services as a life coach, of sorts. Meanwhile, he's made several overtures to Hannah only to be rejected every time.I'll admit, there are few moments where the characters find themselves in situations so embarrassing, that I can't bear to watch. That said, this is easily the best comedy I've seen this summer, and perhaps this year. Good premise, great characters, and amazing twists you do not see coming.

I thought this was a comedy...,"So my wife an I were at Blockbuster (yes Blockbuster! haha) and were looking for a good comedy. Saw Steven Carell on the movie box, and said ""This should be good, let's go for it"".hmmm, my wife fell asleep on minute 30'. I fell asleep on minute 50'.If I could sum up the movie in one word I would say... ""cheesy"" The writers of this movie need help. Just having Steve Carell in the movie doesn't make it funny... you need to write funny stuff. It had a lot of drama sequences and some funny skits.. but nothing original.Ryan Gosling's character was so corny. He is a good actor, but his lines were so false sounding that I thought I was watching a Saturday Night Live ""lady's man"" re-run.I'm surprised it has a high rating here in IMDb.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fun!,"'Crazy, Stupid, Love.' is a fun film to watch. It's a well-made, entertaining & superbly acted romantic-comedy, that earns itself a viewing due to it's true merits.'Crazy, Stupid, Love.'

Oh yes yes yes,"Saw this movie some time ago, but never got around to reviewing it for some reason. Anyways, like I said in the description, this is definitely one of the best romantic comedies I think has ever been made. The actors portray their characters wonderfully, and the characters themselves are just so well written and gave depth to them. The dialogue in and the writing is hilarious where it needs to be and touching and heartwarming where it needs to be. Julianne Moore and Steve Carell have undeniable chemistry between each other, and that chemistry is definitely electric and alive. Also Julianne Moore is so hilarious here, she made me cry with laughter in several scenes. Steve Carrel is perfect here, no other actor could've done this character justice like he did. Also Marisa Tomei was very funny even though she wasn't in a lot of the movie. This movie is definitely not shallow, it's very deep with a lot of that subject matter and it really shows how intelligent the writing is. The comedy is top niche and the writing and acting is also of the highest possible quality. Ryan gosling and Emma stone do their jobs well and carry their characters all of their own. Stone and gosling also have great chemistry with each other, and that works well. There really isn't any downsides or negatives to this movie. I can't think of anything that didn't work well. 9/10 for Crazy Stupid Love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I had expected a better movie than this and the twist in end I found as been put together forcibly just because they want some twist to regular story. Well let me talk about performances: Steve Carell is good, gets advantage as he is producer of film. Julliane is OK..Kevin is small role(really good actor), Emma stone just lost her one fan in me. I mean seriously. Ryan is OK and gets little scope but good as flamboyant playboy. His story is undeveloped and should have been better told. Steve Carell's youngest daughter is really good actress.

Not roll on the floor, but thoroughly enjoyable to the very end. I would see it again. I happen to think Steve Carell is one of the best comedic actors and he proved it again in this movie.The surprise for me was how funny Ryan Gosling was.

Watching pre-pandemic movies makes you wonder what happened??,"This is ironically a movie I missed until just now. I don't have a lot of faith in Netflix's content, I wasn't expecting this movie to be more than another one Netflix's flatlined originals and I was wrong. Then I looked at the date and the publisher and realized that I was more right than I thought I was...Not a big fan of romantic comedy but this was fairly well done. Genuinely funny and touching and that too with a cast of well known actors. Its a bit unreal to see something like this today, feels like a relic from a long lost civilization that no one even remembers. Its like making a good script is an lost art that has been replaced by heavy CGI superhero flicks and controversial statements. The movie focuses on a faithfully wedded man since he was 17, suddenly having to discover the bachelor lifestyle after his soulmate, spontaneously asks for a divorce. He is befriended by a well meaning womanizer that helps him find his bearings in his new life all the while both of their personal lives slowly starts spiraling out of control.Was never a big fan of Carrell and I was expecting more simpler character than the one I got and it was refreshing to see him play a more relatable person than a kooky character from the office. I actually forgot who Gosling was prior to the pandemic. He felt like an anomaly that just suddenly appeared on screen during the pandemic. It took me a minute to connect the two since its sort of hard to imagine the Grey Man having much chops to play more complex and human characters. Its like watching Jason Statham jump from the Guy Ritchie films to one trick pony action flicks. I you just can't see this person play anything other than a hardass.Its rather ironic that Netflix was created for movies but seems to lack some serious quality and variety in that area and there are less than a handful of shows that make it barely worth the price. Anyway if you are bored from the bottom feeding garbage that masquerades on netflix, give this a shot. Might actually surprise you by holding your attention till the very end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nothing but fun,"This movie is great. Cast is perfect and story twists and turns also keep you engaged. Personally I can relate to few situations too. Nothing makes man workout more than a broken heart. And after that, you keep proving yourself something, but deep down inside you are searching for a girl that will ask you something about you, smile with you, and love you. There is something so real about this movie, tho situations are exaggerated but they prove an exact point in each and every moment. This is type of romantic comedy I actually like and everyone this fantastic job in their role. For me, this movie was a retrospective 15 years bacn in few moments (all the act while single), but the part ""ask me something about me"" got me thinking - man do I understand this moment.

"Crazy, Stupid, Love creates contradictory feelings with inconsistent values and judgments, spending too much time glorifying activity that it later condemns.","Crazy, Stupid, Love had me conflicted. So here are my likes and dislikes since its hard to untangle my feelings for a cohesive review:Pros:The relationship between Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling's characters is a unique take on friendship not generally seen in movies, with the characters challenging each other to move beyond their current circumstances and grow.There were some surprising plot twists I didn't see coming that kept a longer rom-com more engaging and interesting than expected.Cal's love and yearning for his family, no matter the hurt and heartbreak they caused, was truly endearing.Steve Carrell is always a pro, a true gem of a human being.Cons:
I should have expected it, but the movie's trivialization of sexual relationships was frustrating. Women were treated poorly and disrespected. It is hard to ""root"" for characters that are that self-centered and arrogant.I was annoyed with the inconsistency of how the film treated characters' failures and indiscretions. Julianne Moore's character was very unlikable because her character stood on the moral high ground over Steve Carrell's despite cheating on him.The movie is classified as a rom-com, and while it has some funny moments, it's hard to consider it entirely comedic. It grapples with serious subject matter that keeps it from being as lighthearted as the word ""comedy"" would imply.Crazy, Stupid, Love has a higher rating from me because of the fun friendship between Carrell and Gosling, the ultimate focus on commitment at the end, and Steve Carrell just being in the movie. It has a different feel than many other films in the genre, which is appreciated. Ultimately, Crazy Stupid Love boasts some great elements and a charming resolution, but the road to get there has some speed bumps.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A good rom-com.,"Rom-coms are normally not the kind of comedies I would go for as often they're just too cheesy but this one was quite enjoyable to watch. The ending took me by surprise which is rather rare as most of the time these comedies are very predictable. The acting was very good, as expected I would say with a great cast like this. Steve Carell is always funny, here he was a bit more serious and that was certainly not bad. Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore and Emma Stone have nothing to prove anymore, all good performances.

"""Hold on a second. Are you the billionaire owner of Apple Computers?""","My biggest takeaways from this film were the duo of Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling: Ryan's character, and the duo of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, along with their characters. The scenes with Cal and Jacob were great; Jacob's character, in general. The scenes with Jacob and Hannah were great, also. Those cast members, their characters, and those aspects were what made this film.Going into this film, I knew it was nearly two hours long, which stood out to me. That seemed a tad long for a rom-com. Having now watched it, it was surprisingly ""serious."" Sincere. The runtime makes sense now. Sure, there was comedy throughout, but it was subtle, for the most part.I didn't like, and this is my kryptonite, all of the scenes with Cal trying to pick up women. Oh, my God. The cringe. I couldn't even watch it, so I switched to another tab. And I'm alone. Watching this with another person would be too much. I can't even imagine how more cringe it would be. Stuff like that or in a similar vein, like people on stage and whatnot, give me second-hand embarrassment. Knowing that an instance like that is fictional doesn't help. And, while probably a vast generalization, that seems to be something women enjoy watching; the ""drama"" of it all. That didn't make any sense to me. I wouldn't say I like it.Performance-wise, pretty much everyone carried their weight/brought to the table. Steve Carell was good, and so was Julianne Moore. Their performances were grounded. Ryan Gosling's performance, too. His performance started as more of a caricature, but then came the depth and character development; I liked his character the most. Marisa Tomei and Emma Stone's performances probably stood out the most, in a good/entertaining way.Now, as far as the story's concerned, I'm not sure. I found myself to be more interested in things that were happening rather than the underlying reason. The whole thing about soulmates and one-true-loves was fine, and I think it makes sense to try and cling on to that through whatever comes your way, although moving on is good, too.The thing is, I'm not sure whether I agree with the way it went, at least in this context; I'll explain why in the next paragraph. In real life, I think that way is the preferable one in most cases in relationships where no abuse and the like is going on. The complexity of life comes into play, though: because, even in cases like that, going the other way, while rough, would probably be the best or better decision. As for which one will end up better, that's unpredictable: I'm sure, for some, one worked out and the other one didn't: for others, the opposite. That's life.In fictional land, it's more simple than that, usually. That ""real"" complexity isn't as strong, even if it's still there, in a sense. The perspective you have because it's a film and you're a part of the audience makes it easier to come to a proper conclusion if the way it went was ""correct"" or ""incorrect"" based on the context.In this case, it seemed more like an ill-mannered message because of how it connected to the plotline with Robbie and Jessica.That plotline shouldn't have been a thing; it would've been better if Robbie wasn't such a ""Nice Guy,"" but it still shouldn't have been a thing. The way it concluded was even worse.The way the main soulmate/one-true-love moral-of-the-story thing also had to do with that was weird. And that sort of tainted its message, the moral of the film. It was still fine regarding the forefront of that element; Cal and Emily, I guess.Moving on, the technical aspects of the film were all decent. The two stand-outs were the cinematography by Andrew Dunn and the soundtrack, although the latter didn't necessarily capture me; there were a few songs that did, and I liked them.Regarding that twist, it came out of nowhere to me. But not in the way you're thinking. I saw that scene on Youtube before, years ago. The funny thing is that I completely forgot; it was as if I was seeing it for the first time. Truly. That scene was the pinnacle of the film, an opinion that most people would agree with from what I've seen. And in a different vein, the way it connected all of the plot threads was great.So, overall, while there were a couple of hiccups for me, I was still very entertained by this film. There were plenty of things to like, and they were very effective. And that's why I've rated this film as high as I did. I'll go as far as to say that this could be one of the best films, if not the best, that I've watched so far this year.I feel like it has some good rewatchability; it never gets old. It could also be a perfect one to watch with someone else: maybe even more entertaining.Other thoughts:Beth Littleford could easily pass as an older sister of Cameron Diaz.The actor playing the guy on the left when Hannah drank the gin looked a bit like Tobey Maguire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Great movie, but not all that funny.","Crazy Stupid Love, was an okay movie. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but it did have a good plot. They should remove the genre of ""Comedy"" from the movie because it's a normal drama with different love stories along with a few funny parts, just like any other movie. My favorite character in this movie was Jessica (Emma Stone), she's a great actress and played her roll very well. She and Ryan Gosling's chemistry was actually believable. I love how the two completely different stories link together towards the middle and end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a drama film as well as a funny story line, plot and cast members.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly made me want to rewatch,I Did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. Definitely a bonus that I saw this with my sweetheart. Had a great time watching this with her. It Definitely made it more enjoyable. Enjoyed the comedy and the nuance in the film. I also loved how the different love tracks met at the end of the film. All the actors gave their best even the kid with his weird but endearing in a way love story. Can't believe that Zoey King played the young daughter character. (Makes me feel so old) And I Liked the various messages regarding relationships in the film and they made some of the icky parts of the film bearable. Definitely a rewatch even though I don't usually watch Romance films.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A perfect Rom-Com.,"Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy film directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and starring Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon.A middle-aged man, is heartbroken when his wife asks for a divorce. However, to get over his loss, he starts picking up women at a bar on the insistence of his new-found friend.This is probably one of the most finest, entertaining, hilarious and perfectly made rom-com in recent time. The film is perfectly balanced and is filled with lots of funny twists and turns and will keep your funny bone tickling throughout the film.The plot of the film is good and the execution is superb. The film is very funny, humorous, hilarious and few of the scenes are worth re-watching. Screenplay of the film is engaging and will keep you glued.Acting is also superb and in Steve Carell was just outstanding, Ryan Gosling was equally impressive and they've got great support from Emma Watson, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon.Climax of the film is equally funny and the film ends on a perfect note. One of the most recommended rom-com to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Focused, Brilliant, Love","I was absolutely delighted with this movie. First the bad:
1. Steve Carell does Michael Scott twice, resulting in really clumsy scenes which temporarily wrecked the movie's pace. This was tedious.
2. The final scene where the dad interrupts the son's speech.... who comes up with these scenarios?That said, the cast was completely brilliant. The characters were all likeable and intelligent, except for the antagonists.
The women in the cast were wonderfully animated. Rarely do actresses get to explode into comedic rage.Two scenes were gems, I don't want to oversell the movie so stop reading if you haven't seen the movie.
The parent teacher meeting. OMG, rage!!
Jacob meets the parents... as classic as the dinner scene in The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer.
Interesting note: I'm a gun owner and was horrified at the line ""I bought a firearm, and I'm going to shoot you in the face"". It was meant to be funny, but I thought ""what Hollywood nutjob thinks that gun violence is funny?""
The next night I watched the movie again, this time with my wife, an anti-gunner. She laughed at the scene.

Fun With Characters,"The movie suffers perhaps from too many characters and subplots but all the actors appear to have fun with their characters. The script, by Dan Fogelman, is unusually and gratifyingly bisexual - i.e., it boasts scenes from both the male and female points of view. And the The movie's biggest surprise is the revelation of Gosling as cunning comedian. The complexities of the heart are given a dispiritedly glib once-over in Crazy, Stupid, Love., a comedy-drama that pretends to be a honest look at relationships when it's really just burdened with simplistic characters and sitcom set-ups. Star and producer Steve Carell provides a dependable soulfulness to this story about a troubled marriage, but the increasingly preposterous plotting makes the film hard to love or even like.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Great Ensemble of Cast,"I'm the great opponent of actors judged based on name not on performance. However, cast of 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' have both. I love how the actors do not overact. Many movies dealing with lighter subjects become low quality because directors and actors overdo it, trying too hard to be funny or romantic. However, this one is special because characters portray themselves as they are, very natural nothing serious. It becomes one of feel-good and heartwarming films. Chemistry among cast is wonderful as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
HK Neo Reviews: Crazy Stupid Love,"Crazy Stupid Love works because it put a lot of focus on characters, casting the right people and pure cynical-ism in the mix. Steve Carell is outstanding as the tormented soul turned player/father and Emma Stone steals scenes like she always does. As for Ryan Gosling, he is almost unrecognisable as a ladies' man. One of the best pick up line involves responding to a female target with ""boring and impress me"". Still, this film isn't about picking up, but rather about life and more defined – the process of life in general. Unlike most films, the ending here does not really matter, but rather the long process of getting there. A good film with good acting and probably something to say in the process as wellNeo rates it 7.5/10.www.thehkneo.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Very Enjoyable Rom-Com,"These kind of cheesy romance films are very hit or miss with me. Generally they depend on whether I can connect to any of the characters, and in that regard at the very least 'Crazy Stupid Love' succeeded. Steve Carrell's character really does carry the film, and the emotional moments surrounding his character and his relationships were the driving force of the film. It helps that Carrell himself is great, as are all of the actors. The ending was really heartwarming and felt very satisfying, although given how packed the story was, it kind of had to be. I think the film deserves credit for making the actions of every character understandable, and it made the film a lot more enjoyable to watch. There wasn't that much humour, but when it was there it tended to land. A few moments dragged, and the subplot with the younger girl having a crush on Steve Carrell felt a bit unnecessary and at least a little bit weird. But overall, this was a really enjoyable time that I would defo recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

An unexpected gem...,This is one of the funniest films I've seen ever. I went into this with zero expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the performance put on by Steve Carell. What elevates this film above others is that it perfectly blends the depressing and realistic aftermath of divorce with subtle comedy.This is a challenging feat and the majority of other rom-com films struggle to maintain realism often favouring cliche plot points to deliver a cheesy happy ending. This movie ends on a relatively happy note but the complexities regarding infidelity are explored in a unique way.We are left questioning the immoral actions of the protagonist and if they are any better than those committed by his spouse. Even after delving into these rather serious themes this movie still manages to deliver some truly iconic comedy.This movie is definitely worth a watch and I truly believe that this is one of the very best rom-com films out there.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good Unwinder,"This is a delightful light film to evening relax to. Steve Carell's role is pivotal to the performance of the main character. His prior appearances prepare us to accept this performance as an audience as he has to deal with the events unfolding in the film.

10/10,"An all-star cast leads this modern day take on Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, with all the wrong people falling in love, giving the audience an insightful study of amour in all its various complexities.I was first introduced to the talents of Julianne Moore in a long-running soap opera called As the World Turns. I could never have predicted that she would go on to grace the big screen. But grace it she has, and this film clearly showcases her wide range of emotional expression.Jonah Bobo is delightful as the outspoken, plucky eighth grader. Steve Carell's character truly tugs at your heart strings, especially in the very poignant scene where he is standing in the backyard of the family home, and watching as his wife calls him to get instructions on how to turn on the water heater, which he can see was clearly an excuse just to phone him.Emma Stone's acting is always a stand out and she doesn't disappoint in this movie either.With clever dialogue and lots of dry humor, this is a fun and relaxing way to spend an evening.

Might be the best romantic comedy ever made,"I saw this movie some time ago, but never got around to reviewing it for some reason. Anyways, like I said in the description, this is definitely one of the best romantic comedies I think has ever been made. The actors portray their characters wonderfully, and the characters themselves are just so well written and gave depth to them. The dialogue in and the writing is hilarious where it needs to be and touching and heartwarming where it needs to be. Julianne Moore and Steve Carell have undeniable chemistry between each other, and that chemistry is definitely electric and alive. Also Julianne Moore is so hilarious here, she made me cry with laughter in several scenes. Steve Carrel is perfect here, no other actor could've done this character justice like he did. Also Marisa Tomei was very funny even though she wasn't in a lot of the movie. This movie is definitely not shallow, it's very deep with a lot of that subject matter and it really shows how intelligent the writing is. The comedy is top niche and the writing and acting is also of the highest possible quality. Ryan gosling and Emma stone do their jobs well and carry their characters all of their own. Stone and gosling also have great chemistry with each other, and that works well. There really isn't any downsides or negatives to this movie. I can't think of anything that didn't work well. 10/10 for Crazy Stupid Love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Disgusting Mockery of Middle Class America,"Crazy, Stupid, Love promised kindhearted, if not benign, pokes at the unpredictable misadventures provoked by being in love. Helmed by directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, whose previous film I Love You Philip Morris was an effortless blend of cynical sweetness and charm, Crazy, Stupid, Love seemed like an easy homerun when considering the superbly talented cast they had assembled. Sadly, this film only serves to prolong Steve Carell's post-40 Year Old Virgin slump, joining the likes of Dan in Real Life, Evan Almighty, and Date Night in the actor's past mistakes. It is obvious Crazy, Stupid, Love prides itself on its candidness. Characters blurt out whatever is on their minds, and act upon any impulse no matter how foolish. The film begins with Cal and Emily Weaver (Steve Carell and Julianne Moore) out to dinner during one of the most ritualistic of 21st Century suburban events – the date night. When Cal unassumingly asks his wife what she wants for dessert, she compulsively exclaims she wants a divorce. It turns out Emily has been unhappy for quite some time, and even confesses to having had an affair with her coworker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). Cal is understandably blindsided by these revelations; he is one of those dopey husbands that assumes everything is fine when no one is complaining. Apparently being a kind, caring husband and father is not enough for the new bourgeois American wife weaned on The Real Housewives and other such filth. This film's portrayal of men and women, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers are, simply put, disgusting. This is a film where boredom is an understandable justification for divorce. Where we are expected to sympathize with a woman that kicks the father of her children out of his home without giving him any chance to mend their issues. Cal, having been cheated on and cast out from his family unit, is the one expected to ""change,"" and to be the one that fights for the marriage. This is a film that glorifies Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a 20-something club-hopping womanizer who lives off of his dead father's inheritance. With no ambition beyond sleeping with every attractive woman he comes into contact with, Jacob is most likely a degenerate sex-addict, bringing home a new girl every night. For Crazy, Stupid, Love Jacob is a hero. He is the savior to Cal's humdrum suburban persona, and promises to help the hapless ex-husband learn how to meet women. This includes maxing out his credit card on new suits, and memorizing every manipulative line and mannerism to trick, I mean motivate women to sleep with him. This film quickly goes from bad to worse, adding not only a silly B-plot involving Cal and Emily's teenage son and the babysitter, but also a misaligned C-plot involving Jacob and the girl of his dreams (Emma Stone). It is by way of these useless and underdeveloped subplots that Crazy, Stupid, Love sacrifices structure and common sense for shallow twists and nonsensical character development. It tries to sell depravity as charm, and selfishness for self-reliance. It portrays women as shallow and superficial, men as emotionally unconscious boobs, and everyone as oversimplified instinctually confused wrecks completely incapable of empathy or self-restraint. This was the worst movie of 2011. *IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW PLEASE COME TO MY WEBSITE WWW.CONTROLLERUNPLUGGED.COM FOR MORE*",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Fight for your soul-mate,"¨I'm so mad at you; I'm really mad at you for what you did, but I'm mad at myself too; because I should not have jumped out of that car; I should have fought for you, because you fight for your soul mates.¨ Once every year out of the dozens of formulaic romantic comedies that come our way, one or two manage to stand out above the rest. Crazy, Stupid, Love is one of those films that manages to remain fresh and original, and balance the comedy and romance well enough without relying on the usual rom-com formula. It is one of those films where the chemistry between the actors feels real, and love is actually depicted like it can be in real life. It is one of those movies that manages to surprise us by remaining fresh and never letting us know for sure what direction it is going to take on every turn. You can predict how most romcoms are going to end from the very opening sequence, and even if you might do the same in Crazy, Stupid, Love; you will definitely not expect some of the twists that come your way. It also has the perfect emotional balance that will bring you to tears at some points and laughter at others. The cast is absolutely amazing and everyone does a terrific job. This is Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's second feature film after last year's critical success with I Love You Phillip Morris. That film was very risky, and in a way so is Crazy, Stupid, Love because it doesn't follow the basic formula that other romcoms do. There are several scenes that could have been a total disaster, but really worked because they served as transitions from comedy to romance to drama and so on. The script by Dan Fogelman (Cars, Bolt, and Tangled) is another highlight of the film because the dialogue in this movie was great. The actors were given great characters to work with so every piece seemed to fit in perfectly for this film.Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) have been married for 25 years; they live with their two children: Robbie (Jonah Bobo) and Molly (Joey King) and they seem to be living the perfect life. That is until Emily asks Cal for a divorce because she seems to be going through a sort of mid life crisis. She tells Cal that she slept with another co-worker, David (Kevin Bacon), and that is more than enough to end the marriage. Cal moves out of the house and begins frequenting bars and moping about his miserable life. At the bar Cal meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a playboy who always gets the girl due to his charm. Jacob promises Cal that he will help him recover his manhood with a few lessons. The first thing they do is change Cal's wardrobe, then he teaches him how to pick up girls in the bar, and pretty soon Cal becomes an expert on seducing women. Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone) one night in the bar and can't seem to get his eyes off her. Hannah doesn't fall for Jacob's charisma at first, but Jacob will soon discover what being in love is really about. All the characters seem to intertwine with each other at one point or another making the movie all the more hilarious. For example we have Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), the 17 year old babysitter who has a crush on Cal, but at the same time Robbie, his 13 year old son, is in love with Jessica.It's these love triangles and confusions that actually prove that love can be crazy and stupid at times, but wonderful at others. There is a great amount of time dedicated to each character, and the focus isn't solely on Steve Carell and Julianne Moore. There are several more relationships that the movie deals with, but it never loses the main thread. The film balances the romance with the comedy really well, making this a very emotional film. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit. The entire cast was just brilliant. I loved the mope performance from Steve Carell, although we've seen it before in other films like Dan in Real Life. Julianne Moore is always a talented actress and she brings her game. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are very talented young actors and the chemistry between both of them was really believable. Gosling has to be one of Hollywood's best modern young actors around. The actors who really surprised me however were the relatively unknown ones: Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo; they share the funniest scenes in the film. Marisa Tomei also has some screen time, and she is great as always. Crazy, Stupid, Love is just a complete film that manages to deliver on all levels. It is my favorite romantic comedy of the year so far, and will probably be on my list of best films of the year. This is a movie you will want to go see.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Good story and funny just a little slow in parts,"This movie is good. There are a few faults, but overall it is one of the better movies about relationships and different kinds of love. It's not a laugh a minute film but it is a laugh out loud film when it is funny. The silly title suggests a more comical plot but it has more of a laid back not over sentimental feel. Enjoyed Steve's makeover that wasn't too extreme. The different aspects of the plot lines come together very nicely. One part I found very realistic but amusing was the take on divorce from the man's point of view and the relationships that fill the void. Julianne Moore is a bit haggard looking. Steve is his usual self - lucky the movie doesn't rely too much on him looking helpless as usual. Ryan is cool, good to see him out of his usual serious role he could do more comedy. Emma isn't very beautiful but she is expressive so interesting to watch. The kids who played the baby sitter and son could have been more endearing - they were a little bit unappealing. A few faults: It is a bit draggy in parts. Some scenes could have been shortened and cut. Some cringe inducing parts could have been left out. I think the director needed to tighten the story and cut about 15 minutes or so. Also there are some times when the characters reactions could have been toned down. There are some over reactions eg Marisa Tomei's. Overall still very enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Smart, Dexterous Roundelay of Love's Labor Lost","I tend to underestimate Steve Carell on the big screen probably because of titles like ""Dinner with Schmucks"", ""Evan Almighty"", and of course, ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"", but when given the opportunity as he did in 2007's ""Dan in Real Life"" and as he does in this grown-up 2011 comedy, he can provide unexpected dimension to an otherwise put-upon, sad-sack character. Co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Dan Fogelman, this movie is overlong at 118 minutes and has contrivances galore, but it's also smart, shrewdly observed, and richly character-driven. These qualities override the flaws primarily due to a well-assembled cast that also includes Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei. Fogelman's screenplay punctuates big life lessons with clever scenes and ensemble set pieces that really snap and play like a Shakespearean roundelay.The plot centers on nebbish suburbanite Cal Weaver, who after two decades of seemingly content marriage, finds out his wife Emily has been unfaithful with her co-worker and wants a divorce. As the reality of his situation settles in, he moves from comatose to resentful to relentlessly morose at which point he has a chance meeting in a trendy bar with a self-confident womanizer named Jacob Palmer. Through reasons that go unexplained, Jacob decides to make Cal his pet project and make him over into a smooth-talking dating machine in an amusing montage that climaxes with a date with Kate, a jittery middle schoolteacher who turns out to be something of a nymphomaniac. Emily stumbles in her newly liberated state, while her and Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie grapples with a long-standing crush on his high-school-age babysitter Jessica who is smitten with someone substantially older. Meanwhile, Jacob goes through a transformation of his own as he falls for a sassy-smart young lawyer named Hannah who initially doesn't succumb to his fool-proof pick-up lines. All the characters intersect rather conveniently, and needless to say, complications ensue.Ficarra and Requa have a nice way of shaping Fogelman's dialogue into the pacing of the scenes, but they spend far too long in the middle of the story making the loose ends look more pronounced toward the end. Dexterous performances which effortlessly balance the comic and humane elements are essential to making the shenanigans work, and they're here in spades. Carell mines his character Cal in unexpected ways but doesn't lose his keen sense of comedy. As Jacob, Gosling is a nice surprise as he breezes through a role that could have been far more repellent had love not befuddled him so completely. Stone, currently Hollywood's ""It"" girl, nicely complements him as the acerbic Hannah, and their extended sequence at his elegant home is really well played by both actors. As Emily, Moore is the rare actress who can play a character who commits an unforgivable act and still can elicit viewer sympathy. Jonah Bobo plays Robbie with deadpan precociousness, while the too-thin Analeigh Tipton fluently brings out all the awkward gawkiness in Jessica. Tomei's turn as Kate is brief albeit a memorable one highlighted by a very funny classroom scene, while Kevin Bacon plays Emily's co-worker with his character's smarminess in check. This is one of the better comedies released this year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not what you might expect,"On the surface that trailers supply for us, this film looks like a run-of-the-mill How Cal Got His Groove Back. We follow Carell's character (Cal) after his wife, Emily (played by Julianne Moore) blurt's out over dinner that she wants a divorce. It's not a stunning hook, since we kind of already knew it was going to happen from the trailer, but it works well. In a Rom-Com, that's basically what you are looking for. New ways to freshen up a cliché, or fresh takes on familiar situations. Crazy, Stupid, Love essentially lives in the latter as we find Cal as the perfect dad who's only real sin here is that he is content with his life and family, and it is the wife who gets cast in the shallow role.Simultaneously, we get the story of young Hannah (Emma Stone). She's an aspiring attorney who is about to take the BAR exam and really hoping that clean cut, gosh-golly-shucks Richard (Josh Groban) will ask her to marry him. If you want foreign, here it is. The sexy, brilliant girl wants Ned Flanders instead of smoking hot Jacob (Ryan Gosling). Totally a dude crush here. He's cut, he's not a high school football player who loves country music, and he's definitely not hanging around some lady with Alzheimer's. He's the ladies man who considers himself a gentleman because he knows how to get her home, and get her to want him so much she basically begs for it.On the outskirts, a puppy love story between Robbie and Jessica. Well, sort of. Robbie is Cal's son and Jessica is his babysitter. Hilarity and awkwardness ensues. Honestly, this is one of the greatest treats of the film as Robbie (Jonah Bobo) carries the scenes between he and his dad, and there is palpable tension between Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) and Cal's ex, Emily (Moore), as Jess has the requisite crush on the dad, and thinks Emily is crazy for leaving him.That is your basic set-up. The comedy style is little bit Carell, and little bit Americanized-British humor (awkward situations and social faux paux). The main reason I didn't give the movie 9or ten stars is because we have rich characters to play with and they barely scratch the surface. We get an 80s montage of verbage from Jacob to explain why he hunts women the way he does, an unexplained purpose for the mentorship of Jacob toward Cal (other than some character development for Jacob), and some mind-blowing insight from a junior high student (Bobo) that we have no idea where he picked it up. The main point is to say, if you like Carell, you'll like the movie. If you like romantic-comedies, this one will twist you up and leave you delighted. If you are a fan of things like love and marriage, this film will remind you of some reasons you think people are crazy for not getting married and taking a chance that this person might just be your soul mate. The characters are crazy, they do some stupid things, and, for better or worse, it is all for the glory of love.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Crazy, Stupid, Love: Review","Like a breath of fresh air, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE rises above the heap of lifeless, senseless romantic comedies, and presents us with something more. What the directors mainly focus on iswait for it: love. But not just love, but adolescent infatuation love, teenage infatuation love, guilty love, regretful love, real love, fake love, all of these different types of relationships and feelings, that are not simply displayed, as in most other entries into this genre, but truly felt, and that's where the movie gains a heart that not only makes it fairly believable, but makes it alive and more than shallow. Above all, it focuses on two very specific thoughts on love: the one of the one true love (cliche at best) and then the sexual love. And the strength of the film is when the characters (who do in fact have feelings that are adequately portrayed) gain clarity on the difference. It's not the most sensitive or poetic way that the message has been portrayed in the past, but the movie never tries to be an art film, just a smart, character driven comedy. We get a series of different situations, which at first seemed too fragmented to make an impact. On that matter, I still believe the film suffers from not letting us spend enough time with, say, Emma Stone's relationship with Ryan Gosling, and though I don't believe it tries to cram in too many plot points, I do think that the balance is slightly off. Not enough, of course, to jeopardize any enjoyment of what's going on. All of these fragments pay off in the third act of the movie, when they come together in a way that might have seemed predictable, but actually made for some great character moments and hilarious scenes. It is this fact that the directors and screenwriter Dan Fogelman can take the clichés of the genre and use them to advance the emotional storytelling that's taking place. This doesn't work all the time: an almost cringe worthy moment happens towards the end of the film that strays into an area far beneath its smart writing and wonderful performances. Speaking of the cast, they were incredibly assembled and are what makes this film what it is. Steve Carrell's best performance, slick work from Ryan Gosling, another example of Emma Stone's throning as Queen Bee of Hollywood, and, most importantly, the always sublime Julianne Moore, who starts off this comedy with heartbreaking sequences featuring Carrell that make this more than just a feature for laughs. The best romantic comedy since 2009's 500 DAYS OF SUMMER, this film presents the very nature of it's main subject. Love IS crazy, love IS stupid, and we love it. A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
crazy stupid crud,"I love my wife. Let me say it again, I love my wife. I have sat through Brokeback Mountain and I have watched The Notebook (for a trade-off for her to watch Shaun of the Dead). Tonight I willingly tried to watch Crazy Stupid Love. I have never seen a movie that was so predictable. The characters, the lines, the situations, come on! I don't watch movies to see someone's abs, or someone's chest. I watch movies to be entertained. This movie was so far from entertaining it was ridiculous. Steve Carell was enjoyable, not as much as in The 40 Year Old Virgin, but not bad. The only thing is, this type of character can only pull a film so far. It is the epitome of female fantasy. Cute young guy, older aging guy, old ex-wife, young female love interest. Where did they hope this film was going to go? It went nowhere. At least The Notebook had a story, ( however sappy), Brokeback Mountain was a cinematic marvel (kudos to Ang Lee). This movie has nothing.

One of the best of the genre,"This is not an all time great in the overall category but for the ROM-com genre it really is one of the best. The difficulty with making a good ROM-com is that it is difficult to stray away form the formulaic, and this is not exactly a new type of ROM-com. This film combines a mixture of a quick and witty script, fantastic performances and a story that is actually engrossing. Cal (Steve Carell) is stumped when his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce seemingly out of the blue. He goes through stages of depression until he is approached in a bar by Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a serial womaniser who takes pity on Cal and offers to spruce him up and bring back the confidence and manliness that Cal has lost over the years. This is a cliché but I really don't want to say anymore as you need to watch it basically blind (and the trailer in my opinion gave too much away). I rarely laugh out loud while watching a film and it does take quite a lot to make me laugh but I found this film absolutely hilarious and at the same time very heartfelt. This has to be accredited to, as previously mentioned, the script and acting. Steve Carell was perfect. He steered away from his typical ""Steve Carell"" type character in this role a lot more than usual and possessed streaks of brilliance. Julianne Moore was very good as expected. Ever since ""A Single Man"" the actress has been on fire. But what can you say about Ryan Gosling? He is a incredible talent who is getting bigger and bigger every year. His presence was felt throughout the film and he put in the kind of performance when you missed him when he wasn't on. Emma Stone did very well but her part was sadly too small. The youngest member of the cast put in a really memorable performance portraying first love which was both nostalgic and very funny. Seriously watch this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A funny and slick yet clever and unpredictable must see!.,"Unlike many romantic comedies, Crazy Stupid Love manages to leave audiences satisfied with a smile.Another predictable comedy with few laughs due to cheesy lines and little relation to the characters is not what we need and thankfully not what you should expect. One of the main aspects that makes this film so watchable is the acting. All the actors play their parts convincingly and with the right comic uniqueness their character requires. Julianne Moore, not exactly queen of comedy, delivers her lines with perfect comic timing as do those more familiar to comedy such as Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell. Jonah Bobo playing Robbie and model Analeigh Tipton as Jessica also play their parts so hilariously together as young teen crushing on the innocent babysitter. It is clear characters have been perfectly sketched to make them so diverse in contrast to each other for not just successful comic effect, but also for the audience to relate to the characters which is done with great ease. Another thing that makes this film so much better than most typical comedies is how unpredictable it was. Throughout the film realistic surprises you would never of expected pop up which is both shocking and comical- its comically shocking. Those who have not seen the film, I would recommend not to watch any clips that have been released, but should wait for the film to grasp the full comedy the film offers there and then. Overall, without giving any of the plot away this slick smart comedy is a must see, not just for the all star cast but for the perfect contrasting characters, comic timing, hilarious script and crucially, the different and unpredictable plot that makes this film so hilarious. Without a doubt, a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of my all time favourites,"There are many good romantic films, but this one just feels different.It starts with a broken relationship and Cal (Steve Carell) is the broken man. He finds comfort in a local bar and alcohol, telling all who listen how his wife had cheated on him. The same bar is the playground for Jacob (Ryan Gosling) and seeing the pitiful Cal takes him under his wing.It is an interesting look at how how middle age love is different from young love, how in time we can lose our ways and sometimes we need to look at ourselves and fight for the one we love.

"""Unification of Love: Awkwardly Realistic Circumstances""","Unification of Love: Awkwardly Realistic CircumstancesThree love stories nay, situations, are explored in Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") ""Crazy, Stupid Love"". It is a drama masked as a comedy fueled by awkwardly realistic circumstances and a handful of highflying actors and actresses that know how to own it. The first story concerns a couple of high school sweethearts, Cal (Steve Carell, ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore, ""The Kids Are All Right""),that have been married for twenty-five years. However, when Emily tells Cal that slept with a man she works with named David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon, ""X-Men: First Class""), divorce is on the horizon. Inevitably sending Cal to the bar, Cal meets the player in the second love story, Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling, ""Blue Valentince""), who is infamous for his lady-wooing swagger. Jacob sees and hears Cal ranting about his failing marriage and takes him under his wing to help him move on with other women. Even so, Cal may not be the only one changed by their abnormal friendship because of Jacob's hang up on a girl named Hannah (Emma Stone, ""Easy A"") he was rejected by the previous night. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily's thirteen-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo, ""Zathura""), is in love with his babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton, ""The Green Hornet"") who in turn is in love with Cal. Everything is more connected than you may think and with a flamboyantly annoying performance by Marisa Tomei (""The Wrestler"") things get crazy and stupid in this multigenerational love story.The Good: Steve Carell's Post-""Office"" years could not of had a stronger start as he conjures the second best performance of his career. However, it would be unfair to say that he is the only reason the film succeeds because of the superb performances of his costars Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore and Emma Stone. Together the cast will keep you on edge as the story unravels in an obstinately realistic manner. And while Scriptwriter Dan Fogelman's (""Bolt"") plan was not visible at first by the end his twisty-turny storytelling culminates in grade A fashion with the unification of the three love stories into one full of smart comedyAfter the aforementioned culmination of plot unification, the film loses its momentum. dragging on for twenty minutes. The film could have ended anytime during its climatic scene and it would have been perfect (I guess you can't always get what you want). It takes twenty extra minutes to get to the actual sloppy and impractical conclusion. Even though everything seemed to be previously settled, this second fallout to set up a preachy ending creates unnecessary forced conflict. Lastly, the inability to avoid predictivity may irk some viewers and makes characters like Josh Groban's as pointless as their casting.The first act of ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" creates a series of situations that setup a remarkable amalgamation at the peak of its second act, making the stars in the film (most notably Steve Carell) into even bigger stars with the power of sharp comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The feel-good romance and family movie that just perfectly works,"A very refreshing movie. There are no cartoonish villains, no overly dramatic scenes, no artificial suffering created by unnecessary misunderstandings. There is a group of people who are just humans. There are children, adolescents, adults and middle-aged people who are trying to cope with themselves, their situations and their relationships. They want to be happy, they chase what they want. When you say it like that, it sounds very serious or deep. That's not it, it deals with a wide variety of relationships with very good humor. I think it's impressive that it managed to handle such a wide range of relationships, from the ex-wife to the platonic older girl in the next door, by doing justice to all of them and making the audience laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Oh, what a tangled web we weave...","In real life, love can be messy and irrational, but in the end it's still worth fighting for. At its heart, I believe that is the message that this film tries, and mostly succeeds, at conveying. Romantic comedies have never really been my cup of tea, but few have managed to keep me rapt like this one managed to do. This film was filled with lifelike characters told a compelling, relatable story that, while messy and overstuffed at times, still wrangled the many threads and brought them together in an interesting and completely unexpected way.The story is centered around Cal Weaver (Steve Carell, playing his usual schlubb character), whose wife just asked him for a divorce. Completely blindsided by this development, he descends into self-pity, starts frequenting bars and venting out loud to anyone within earshot. This desperation eventually attracts the attention of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a suave ladies' man who helps Cal recapture his manhood and sense of self. This leads to all sorts of misadventures and awkward situations, but where the story ends up is both expected and unexpected at the same time. Rounding out the cast is Julianne Moore as Cal's wife Emily, Kevin Bacon as the man who Emily cheats on her husband with, John Carroll Lynch as a family friend and Emma Stone as Hannah, an up-and-coming lawyer who gets involved with Jacob. Despite having such a large cast, they do end up spending enough time with each character, although the movie's pacing suffers at times and ends up feeling a little disjointed. They all give great, naturalistic performances, even the younger actors. On a more technical note, the film was well-shot, even though comedies tend not to have distinctive filming styles or cinematography. The eclectic soundtrack is also worth mentioning, even though a few cuts were a little too ""on-the-nose.""Stepping back a little bit, at first the movie felt like it was trying to accomplish too much. It starts off where a lot of movies start to end, so I thought to myself where it could possibly go from there. The answer is pretty far. It took a rather labored premise and did something fresh with it, and the chemistry and likability of the cast only made things that much better. My feelings might have been mixed towards the beginning, but as the film progressed I only grew to appreciate it more. Sure, it might not quite live up to its title, but it put forth such a great effort that I have to applaud it for that. It's proof that there is some life in the romantic comedy genre yet. I highly encourage you to see this, if only for the pleasure of seeing its incredible cast at work, but hopefully also for the intimate and honest exploration of love and the human condition.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Crazy Stupid Movie About Love,"Well, this is a romantic comedy, so with that expectations I watched it. The story felt for me pretty original in this kind of movies. Cal (Steve Carell) gets very upset because his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) asks for the divorce and he is later helped by Jacob (Ryan Gosling) to rediscover his manhood so he can feel well again. Jacob also meets a girl called Hannah and falls in love with her. There is also another thread on the story with the babysitter of the sons of Cal and Emily, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) who is taking care of Molly and Robbie who falls in love with her, but she loves another person.Well the story might look a bit full of characters but all of them get a proper screen time, enough for their stories to develop well. Steve Carell has a good chemistry with Julianne Moore and you can care about their marriage and so, and also Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling have very a good brother-friend relationship, but for me the highlights of this movie are all the moments Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone share together on screen, which are worth watching this movie. They have such a great chemistry that they feel like a real-life couple. They are so lovely together that I wish this movie had been only the story of them, because, for me it would have been perfect. The story of Steve Carell helped by Ryan Gosling is also great and funny, but what for me ruins this movie a bit is the part of Jessica and Robbie, not also because it's very unrealistic (a thirteen age boy falls in love with his seventeen year old babysitter, but she is in love with his father and takes herself nude pictures for him? C'mon screenwriters, who had this idea?). This part of the story is not also unrealistic but very odd and a bit useless. And as their plot line, also the characters of this part felt a bit flat and without any charisma. But also, it's a romantic comedy you cannot ask that much for it.This movie is a very funny romantic comedy with many hilarious moments but also other moments full of emotion and romance.

Stupid It Is,"It's almost too easy to mock the title of Crazy, Stupid, Love - a film that delivers the first two adjectives with alarming accuracy. This allegedly heartwarming comedy follows high school sweethearts Cal and Emily (Steve Carell and Julianne Moore) as they divorce after 25 years of marriage. Unfortunately, Moore's Emily is far too radiant to be believable as someone who's only ever had one relationship, and Carell's Cal is just a rehash of his 40-Year-Old Virgin persona, only with less charm and more whining.Banished from his home, Cal starts haunting a singles bar, where self-proclaimed lothario Jacob (Ryan Gosling) decides to turn him into a bargain-bin Don Juan. Meanwhile, Emily dithers over a supposed affair with David Lindhagen (a thoroughly wasted Kevin Bacon), a subplot so underdeveloped it feels like a flimsy excuse to kick-start the story rather than an actual plot point.Then there's Robbie, Cal and Emily's 13-year-old son, who has an obsessive crush on Jessica, his 17-year-old babysitter. She's not interested - because, well, she's sane - but that doesn't stop Robbie from bombarding her with relentless declarations of love. The film treats this as sweet and persistent rather than what it actually is: creepy and borderline harassing. Cal, instead of parenting, cheers him on, apparently confusing a teenage boy's delusions with the struggles of a middle-aged man in crisis.To make things even messier, Cal and Emily's grown-up daughter enters the picture as Jacob's latest romantic fixation. This, of course, horrifies Cal, even though he himself spent his separation indulging in the very same behavior he now finds so appalling in Jacob. Self-awareness? Not on the menu.With a muddled message, a complete lack of laughs, and a disturbingly casual attitude toward harassment, Crazy, Stupid, Love is a rom-com with neither romance nor comedy.

love cannot breath without pain.,"This movie is more like an ensemble piece, in which every couple has to deal with a certain pain to become ready for love. Usually it is sugar-coated, these movies.

Too many issues can not be judged by ethic,"Is that right if 99 out of 100 people said it is right? Not really. Does having sex without your partner means you are not commit to your marriage? Absolutely. But does this mean you do not love your partner anymore? Obviously no. Is that possible a man sleeping with 100 women cannot find his true love? Ignorance. Believe or not, these are what this movie tells us. Please don't watch it with bias. It is a lovely film, just relax and laugh during the projecting if you don't take it seriously.I believe 90% of individuals in our communities are like Cal, going through their own small life, only struggling within office and home, never having sex with other women but the partner, still dreaming to try something beyond the red line especially when feeling unfair in daily life. However I don't believe there are many people like Jacob who can successfully sleep with different girls every couple of days. At least if these people were exist they are the very minority, I mean maybe 1 out of 10000 or less than that.After trying to think over the real life again I found actually Jacobs are not definite minority as the lost individuals are not minority. The reasons why they are lost are diversity, such as a failure of marriage like our Cal, bankrupt, getting hurt in love like Hannah and so on. Anyway they find an excuse to abuse their life, trying something new, something dreamed but never got a chance to go and something makes feel cool or can release themselves.After experiencing the fantastic new life, someone maybe turn back and plug into their life with a new and mature attitude, others maybe keep enjoying their new life without ending.

Very entertaining ... eventually,"This film is a little offbeat as comedies go. It starts on a somber tone and then tries to build something humorous as it meanders along. There are some places where the pace slows to a slow walk and it can almost lose it's interest for fans of the faster pace of a lot of modern film. But I found that I liked that quirkiness and it added some depth that may have otherwise been lacking in the typical comedy. However, I feel it may be too much of a pendulum for some as it swings from serious to comedic. I've noticed that a lot of time, people looking for a comedy can do without the seriousness. But given those mood swings, the directors do manage to make it a comedy, after all.When it comes to comedy the cast here is very entertaining. The central characters are Steve Carell as Cal and Julianne Moore as his dissatisfied wife Emily. She announces that she wants a divorce after a tumble in bed with Kevin Bacon as her boss David. Bacon's character clearly has a solid thing for Moore's character and commences to pursue her, but this angle is just a diversion. The film makers missed chances for funny things that might have supplanted the more serious ones by neglecting to capitalize on this pairing more.A good deal of the movie revolves around a friendship that builds between Carell's character and Ryan Gosling as the smarmy, girl-crazy Jacob. That term is often followed by the descriptor ""hound"". After meeting in a bar, Gosling takes on Carell to fashion him over into his own image. That's when the more fun aspects of the film start as we watch Carell try to crawl out of his shy, suburbanite shell to become more appealing to the opposite sex.One encounter Carell makes is with the stunningly talented Marisa Tomei as Kate; a school teacher. When she's on screen she's a huge lot of fun to watch. I don't think I've ever seen her give as much as a mediocre performance and she won't disappoint here.Another pairing that may surprise some people, but not me, are the encounters between Gosling's character and Emma Stone playing Hannah. Gosling has turned into one of moviedom's more superior actors; who can be expected to always deliver a stellar performance. But the real treat here is Stone. She has become a superb comedienne with a timing and delivery that is as close to perfect as you can get. In fact, Gosling is really playing a straight man here to Stone, ala Abbott and Costello; it's that good.But the one who really illuminates the screen is Emma Stone. Each time I see Stone in a film she is better than the last time and she is nothing less than enchanting. She always comes across as smart and funny. I am especially drawn to the smartness. It is amazingly refreshing to see a female character who actually has brains, beauty and a lot of good old fashioned humor. It's not that ""brainy"" parts aren't written for other actresses; it's just that the others almost never quite pull it off (with a few notable exceptions such as Gwyneth Paltrow in Proof, but that was decidedly unfunny). Emma Stone is a real treat to watch and I find I can't take my eyes off of her every time that she's on screen. Her very large, luminous eyes run a thousand expressions a second over an even more expressive face, all of them unerringly faithful to the character while, at the same time, feeling very fresh and original. To top it off, she's a stunning beauty herself in that slightly unusual way that normally makes girls off of the street into supermodels. Stone and Gosling are so good, so entertaining, that I could effortlessly watch an entire film, perhaps several entire films, of just them bouncing one-liners and smoking sexuality off of each other. I found myself actually disappointed when the spotlight left them.But the film doesn't end with just those fine actors, either. There are some surprising, disarming skirmishes between Jonah Bobo as Carell's thirteen-year-old son Robbie Weaver and Analeigh Tipton as his seventeen-year-old babysitter Jessica who, herself, has a thing for Carell. Young Bobo gives a surprisingly good performance as a love-and-thunder-struck young man struggling with some very real, grownup emotions. The height disparity between them made it more enjoyable as we watched and even rooted for Bobo to succeed. I also enjoyed Tipton (could lips be any more sensual), who's face I last saw as a model; but she's a model who can apparently act. She had a hard part to play, straddling a fine line between funny and what could have easily been seen as tragic or even perverse. I hope she feels good about the job she did here and I hope to see more of her in the future.Finally, the very fine actor John Carroll Lynch as Tipton's father Bernie did a fine job with a small part and certainly injected comedy when he was given the chance.The rest of the film was expertly staged and photographed so it's top quality there. I also enjoyed the musical score, skillfully blending old favorites into the story in a way more noticeable than usual.All-in-all, Crazy, Stupid, Love teeters on the brink of sappiness without quite going too far that way and does a good job of appealing to the usual sentimental themes of love stories throughout the ages with some unexpected, modern twists. If you've ever been in love, see it. If you ever want to be in love, see it. Or, if you just like love stories, see it. It makes for a very good night at the movies. Thank you one and all.By Bruce L.

The story had some twists that I didn't see coming, which was a nice surprise. I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did, but it turned out to be really, really good!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Never gets old,"8.5 stars.This is a story about several people with crushes on other people and how they navigate the tempestuous storm we refer to as marriage, dating, flirting, attraction and rejection.I really enjoy the way this film portrays the dating and marriage scene. There are several little stories that all are interconnected. A father and mother are getting divorced, a woman who is soon to be a lawyer, is fighting off her urge to get involved with a professional dater (player). The player is dealing with his own insecurities, even though we can see he is extremely adept at dating and love, he's not confident about his future and whether he is worthy of a good woman. Sprinkle a few other people into the mix, simply trying to fit in, trying to find a soulmate...Julianne Moore, Ryan, Gosling, Emma Stone, Steve Carrell, all sharing the stage in a rom com? This has the signature of high class romance, not so much the crude comedic styles of Adam Sandler, and most sitcom or SNL alums. This is a bona fide, upper class comedy about dating and heartbreak. Think of the film 'Hitch', which is very similar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"After getting a divorce, one man must navigate the single scene with the unexpected help from a bachelor.","Love is many things; it's encompassing, beautiful, painful, and ever changing. When it first begins to build inside us, we tend to stand on the shoulders of giants, embracing the world as this wonderful and tiny organism. After a while that love changes; sometimes for the better, other times for the worse. When it does take a nosedive, we often shun it all together. Crazy, Stupid, Love shows us that no matter how unexplainable or heart wrenching love can be, it will always be within our reach to hold and cherish when we need it the most. Love can come from many angles, and that's where the sincerity in not only the pieced together title comes from, but where the plethora of characters really shine. Showing the relationships between unlikely friends, a boy and his babysitter, a womanizer and a romantic, Crazy, Stupid, Love paints a ray of colors over a simple palette, providing that sophisticated touch to a well-worn genre.Telling the story of multiple characters that interweave throughout the film, Crazy, Stupid, Love focuses on Cal Weaver (Steve Carrell), a married man that suddenly finds himself cast out into the single- peoples social sphere, ultimately out-dressed and out-numbered by the young and the restless. Holding up in a bar catering to those twenty years younger, Cal finds himself taken under the tailored wing of Jacob (Ryan Gosling), an inheritance rich womanizer that has just about every woman stumbling under his well-crafted and meticulous spell. As Cal begins straying away from but never forgetting his soul-mate Emily (Julianne Moore), we are shown loves game from the eyes of Cal's optimistic son Robbie (Jonah Bobo), and confused romantic Hannah (Emma Stone). As Cal tries to hold onto what he refused to fight for, Jacob begins to realize that there is something worth fighting for, something that will prove just how crazy love can be.Coming off the heels of 2009's quirky prison-love tale I Love You, Philip Morris, screen writing/directing duo Glenn Ficarra and John Requa know how to handle the multiple facets that come from budding romances. The way they handle love is akin to lighting a bunch of sleazy romance novels on fire atop the roof of a fine adult book store, sending smoke signals to those worn and withered romantics out there. Just like Francois Truffaut's epic love-triangle Jules and Jim, Crazy, Stupid, Love works best as a meditation on the hetero-fueled relationship between its male focal points Cal and Jacob. As we see each one in their individual state, it only adds to the bond they develop later on, providing that true essence of masculine friendship. Though not quite capturing the crazy side of love, Ficarra and Requa manage to add just enough charm and wit to their characters for us to feel attached to, showing just how powerful any relationship can be.Bringing all of these characters to life is an ensemble cast that feels surprisingly fresh considering they have all been in these roles before. It doesn't feel too long ago that we saw Steve Carrell as the down on his luck forty-year old, Julianne Moore as the confused and cheating wife, Emma Stone as the desirable take-charge woman, or Kevin Bacon as well, the villain. These are all actors that have been through the motions their characters go through multiple times, though it all feels so pure like a new love. Taking a prominent position amongst the A-listers is Jonah Bobo as Cal's son Robbie, and Analeigh Tipton as Jessica the babysitter who both bring a raw emotion to the screen that feels as if we're watching our self fall in love all over again for the first time.Crazy, Stupid, Love is one of those films that shouldn't work as well as it does, but succeeds in almost every regard. While the title falls a bit short in showing us just how crazy and stupid love can truly be, it does provide a beautiful take on love gone bad and love that has yet to even start. Dan Fogelman's script injects the romantic comedy genre with a vibrancy that hasn't been seen for years, causing us to embrace our youthful woe with nostalgic fondness all the while embracing what we have. Rarely do we get to revel in the marital misfortune of others with such gleeful wit than with this rare treat, ranking high amongst modern romances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Rom-com with a few surprises,"As the movie opens Cal Weaver's humdrum but comfortable life as an accountant in Beverly Hills is rudely shattered by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore announcing in a crowded restaurant that she's being having an affair with a workmate and wants a divorce after 25 years marriage. Cal (Steve Carell) moves out and drops in to the single bars scene where for reasons not entirely clear (""you remind me of someone"") lounge room Lothario Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who beds a different gorgeous woman each night takes Cal in hand and trains him to be just as successful. Meanwhile Cal's 13 old son Robby (Johna Bobo) has fallen in love with the family's babysitter, High School student Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) who in turn has a crush on Cal. Then Jacob actually falls in love, with young lawyer Hanna (Emma Stone) and Emily starts to yearn for her discarded husband.This all sounds like a conventional romantic comedy of the feel-good variety, but directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and writer Dan Fogelman have a few surprises up their sleeves. The performances are first-rate and the dialogue crackling. There is some reliance on slapstick but also some real emotion conveyed. Ryan Gosling's Jacob might perhaps be too shallow to be true (""you look like you've been photoshopped"" says Emily, on seeing his torso), but it turns out that even he has a credible backstory. As the principal lovers, Steve Carell and Julianne Moore exhibit a realism seldom seen in romantic comedy and there is some fine comic work from Maresa Tomei as one of Cal's lounge bar conquests who pops up a bit closer to home. At 120 minutes the film is slow in places – I would describe the direction as quirky rather than slick (how else can one explain the cinematographer's penchant for shoe-level shots) but more rewarding than the average rom-com, and although the ending is contrived it's still satisfying.The directors, whose best known previous works, ""Bad Santa"" and ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" were decidedly quirky, have toned things down a bit here, but the characters are credible and sympathetic. I also liked the way the deep seated prudery and overdeveloped sense of decorum that afflicts middle class Americans are sent up. After an unseemly though perfectly understandable brawl in the Weaver's picture perfect back yard it falls to Vietnamese-American Officer Huang to tell the warring parties to do their fighting inside where the neighbours can't hear. I also liked Cal's line as he is rejected again by Emily outside Robbies' high school after a disastrous parent teacher interview and it starts to rain: ""This is such a cliché"". Well I suppose anyone going to see a rom-com ought to be prepared for clichés, but here they are cleverly handled, if a little sugar-coated.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Absolutely Amazing!,"I was very impressed! I have always loved romantic comedies, and was very excited to see Crazy Stupid Love when I saw the preview. Honestly, it blew away my expectations! It was full of love, humor, tears, and so much more! Unlike many romantic comedies, this movie had many surprises which, many times, had the audience in the theater laughing out loud and thinking things over in their heads! The only thing - which is not necessarily a bad thing - is that some parts have the characteristics of an R rated film instead of pg13. So just think it over before bringing the little ones!

Valium for men who are struggling in the dating arena,"Have you ever wondered what makes someone rate a good movie? Maybe it is the action scenes that appeals to them? Or maybe it is because the movie speaks to them deeply in some way? I realize now that rating movies is subjective based on whether a movie speaks to you or not.The movie Crazy, Stupid, Love is about a man, Cal, played by Steve Carell who finds out his wife, played by Julianne Moore, cheated on him. She does not want him anymore. Distraught and confused, he finds himself back in the dating arena once again. This time having to re-learn the various mating steps and rituals he once trod many eons ago. Struggling and flailing, a kind young amorous seducer played by Ryan Gosling takes pity on him and shows him the ropes. All the while Cal keeps thinking of his wife.We the audience get to learn vicariously through Cal the basic steps on how men can pick up women. We are taught by our very own Masterclass host Ryan Gostling through the big screen. This movie appeals to men everywhere who may be struggling in their romantic lives and who want to be taught the ABCs on how to meet women. Sometimes men just need to be shown the basics. This movie is both educational as well as entertaining.Having said this, there are other aspects that the movie explores as well mostly between the relationships of the various characters within Cal's life. Sometimes this can lead to situations that are both humorous and silly.Funny, entertaining, insightful, and informative, the movie Crazy, Stupid, Love offers hope and a lovely message to men about romantic love.

Rewarding,"Finally a rom-com for everyone. Additionally, midsummer comedy Crazy, Stupid Love is at times as much a drama as it is laugh generating. In fact, is as serious a deconstruction of modern love as it is a humorous exposition of how stupid and crazy it can be for teens through adults.And rewarding and mystifying and . . . Well, you get the idea: this film sweetly shows the fortitude needed to play the game, right to the end.Cal (Steve Carell) is being divorced by Emily (Julianne Moore) after 25 years of soul mating. Jacob (Ryan Gosling) helps him get over his despair by teaching him to be cool with women. But Cal's heart belongs to Emily to the end. That part of the action is easy to predict; it's the other characters that lend color and unity to the pursuit of love by every healthy girl and boy, man and women.Son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) loves babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who loves Cal, whose wife has had an affair with David (Kevin Bacon), who loves Emily. Throw in a horny teacher Kate (Marisa Tomei), whom Cal loves ever so briefly, and you have a zoo of unfulfilled love that only an American farce can untangle at only the right time. And it does, with a light heart that teaches the virtue of pursuing your love relentlessly.Crazy, Stupid Love does better in the earlier parts of the film as Cal tries out his new clothes and line; in the latter part it becomes serious about it homiletic goal.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Brain Damage Required,"As I was watching this I kept thinking to myself that this might be pretty good if I had brain damage. Mindless and idiotic. Stay away unless you want to punish yourself. Since I have to write 10 lines in order for a review to be posted on this site I guess I need to say more. The target audience for this movie appears to be 12 year old girls or any males who are very feminine. The whole movie is just a repeat of other boy/girl love stories with a faint attempt at, what the writer must have thought, was humor. The quality of the acting is right up there with middle school thespian attempts. The music and cinematography is also at a level that would appeal to young teenage girls. Honestly I don't know how any of the adults in this film can stand to look at themselves in the mirror without being embarrassed after performing in this film. I guess the nice pay checks help to ease their pain. Truly awful.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Ryan Goslings character Jacob sees that Cal is distraught And offers to help him become a better man and a womanizer with Some funny results. The film also looks at his 13 yr old sons crush on his 17 yr old baby sitter that is also very entertaining. It's just a brilliant heart warming film with brilliant acting.

"I give it a 4/10 for the first 30 minutes (sorry, I just can't go on)","Couldn't watch past 30 minutes of this movie. I found it very offensive (to men but especially to women) from a woman's perspective. It sells the idea that every woman will go to bed with any guy that is suited up and has nice shoes and slick hair. It becomes pretty predictable that Cal will deal with his failing marriage by becoming a womanizer and going to bed with random women he will 'learn' to pick up thanks to a stranger.The little backstory we get as to why his marriage falls apart is incredibly shallow. He actually refuses to even talk about it. Very empty, unlikable characters.

A Hilarious and Heartfelt Rom-Com Gem,"""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is a delightful blend of comedy, romance, and heartfelt drama that captures the complexities of modern relationships with wit and charm. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the film boasts a star-studded cast, including Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, and Emma Stone, who deliver remarkable performances across the board.What sets ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" apart is its ability to balance humor with genuine emotion. The screenplay cleverly weaves multiple storylines, exploring themes of love, heartbreak, and redemption without feeling convoluted. The unexpected twists keep the narrative engaging, especially the brilliant climactic reveal that ties all the characters together in an unforgettable way.Steve Carell shines as the everyman caught in a midlife crisis, delivering a nuanced performance that balances comedic timing with vulnerability. Ryan Gosling's turn as the smooth-talking ladies' man is a scene-stealer, and his chemistry with Emma Stone is electric. Julianne Moore brings depth to her role, and the supporting cast, including Marisa Tomei and Analeigh Tipton, add to the film's charm.The humor is sharp and refreshing, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, but it's the heartfelt exploration of relationships that elevates the film. It reminds us that love, in all its forms, can be messy, complicated, and, yes, stupid-but it's also what makes life worth living.While the movie occasionally leans on rom-com clichés, its clever writing and strong performances make it stand out as one of the better entries in the genre.

Acting out feelings,"This had potential, after the best of the Apatow cycle. It has wide appeal, charting relationships and sexual conundrums from the ages of 13 and being caught giving yourself a handjob under the covers to being 50 and getting a divorce. Each level is anchored by a charismatic performer who stops somewhat in advance of being a parody of their age, and has some chemistry with the others. The whole thing is nicely packaged as mature humor.Now Apatow's solution to comedy of the previous generation, is that as soon as we had settled down and been prepared to laugh with a predicament, hues were quickly sketched that revealed human beings in actual pain; the rest of it was drama that was resolved in as much organic ways as the specific world allowed. So far as structure goes, it was usually a light scaffold in the back, say routines of a stand-up comedian dying from cancer or writing a puppet musical about Dracula while heartbroken in Hawaii. It was not original but provided a chart for emotional growth.So this has chemistry. It has a more clever structure than usual from Apatow; several situations that riff on scripted seduction and acting out feelings instead of being yourself, all of them more or less disastrous in the end.There is a teacher who rewards honesty with sex, she is the only blatant caricature here, the only one out-of-place, as though being frank in a world of manipulative lovers is enough to drive one to hysterics.In the amusing climax, all the different performers and stories they have woven are brought together with explosive results.What it lacks and is really sunk by, is organic drama. Every moment of some emotional resonance is stressed a little too heavily, analogies are forced, the result suddenly feels a little mawkish and contrived instead of a real world. There is much talk about soul mates and true love.This needed a European touch, preferably Spanish; visual imagination, plus a more gentle drift of dreams into fate. A simple gesture would do, say the son buying the girl of his dreams an ice-cream, like his father did 30 years before.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I am really starting like the Ryan Gossling Emma Stone Pairing,"First I want to say I do not know how I barely even heard of this movie when it came out. It has a who's who list of A-list actors/actresses and yet I don't remember it getting much press. Well onto how great this movie was. This is a Steve Carell vehicle but all the actors give really wonderful performances, really small parts for some big actors Marissa Tomei, and Kevin Bacon, but they do well with a little screen time. Julianne Moore is as wonderful as ever. And as my title indicates Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone really sizzle together. I watched the their movies in reverse but they were very good in this movie and Gangster Squad earlier this year. and kudos to the youngsters in the movie they were well played and very believable.This movie was equally well written and directed. It moves along at a nice pace, there is almost no moment in the movie that left me a little bored or thinking of what I was going to have for dinner. There are moments that will tug at your heart strings, and there are outright laugh out loud moments, plenty of both actually.Even if you don't like romantic comedies, watch this movie, it's probably the best of it's genre in years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011) - This is Crazy! This is Stupid! This is Why I Love this Movie!","Taking a new twist on the classic romantic comedy, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" features an all-star cast including Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, and 13-year-old Jonah Bobo. The film starts with Carell portraying Cal who is getting a divorce after his wife Emliy, portrayed by Julianne Moore, cheats on him with Kevin Bacon. Now single and hopeless, Cal gets advice from professional bachelor Jacob Palmer, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, to become a ladies bachelor. Then the story leads into unexpected moments, hilarious clichés, and some heartwarming messages. Now, I have to say that ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is easily one of the best movies of the year. The script is beautifully well-written, and Dan Fogelman does an excellent job of visioning his script to the screen. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa do magnificent work by creating a unique romance with lots of great camera work and writing. Now speaking about the cast, Steve Carell does a brilliant job in this movie, and he's one of those characters where you want them to succeed. Ryan Gosling brings a sexy, golden attitude to his performance, and he delivers in every scene he is in. Wonderful as always, Julianne Moore delivers yet another satisfying performance. Emma Stone was completely awesome in this movie, and she really stands out. Marisa Tomei was pretty funny as the psycho-insane teacher. But, Kevin Bacon was okay as Julianne Moore's affair lover, but they neither share any great chemistry together. It's the scenes between Carell and Moore that make the movie stand out. But, out of all the cast, Jonah Bobo made me laugh the most as Carell's love-struck son, and he's my absolute favorite role in the movie. Aside from a cleverly written script, beautiful directing, and great acting, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" takes all the clichés that are frequently used in romantic comedies nowadays, and is presented in a different and more unique perspective, while making fun of the fact that the movie itself is a romantic comedy. In a year filled with rated-R raunchy comedies, 3-D animated features, and box-office fantasies, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is neither of that, but instead, a fresh and unique comedy that delivers heart warmth, cliché moments that really work, and laugh-out-loud humor, since all the laughs in the movie are deserving. Let's also not forget that the final twist in the movie, without revealing any spoilers, is both funny and unexpected. With a charming script and wonderful cast, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" is not just one of the best comedies of the year, but it's also one of the best movies of the year.

It has a sharp and genuinely funny script, lots of heart, and a cast that elevate the material to a whole other level.Steve Carrell shines in his role as Cal, the man whose world is shaken up as he suddenly finds himself back on the dating scene. Carrell brings humour to the role in the most subtle of ways as well as the obvious, making it all seem so effortless. He has so much charisma and expression and really is just a joy to watch.Ryan Gosling is equally brilliant as the ladies man who takes him under his wing. It is a role that gives him a lot of space to have fun and really flex his comedic acting skills.The chemistry between the two of them is terrific, whoever cast the pair of them deserves some sort of award that's for sure.We are also treated to Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon.

Why Should We Bother to Be Adults When We Have Kids to Do It for Us?,"""Crazy Stupid Love"" is about 20 minutes of a terrific little romantic comedy starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone surrounded by another 100 minutes of borderline dreadful romantic comedy starring everybody else. Gosling and Stone just ooze charm and screen presence, and their chemistry together is so natural and infectious that I simply could not tolerate any part of the movie that shifted away from them to deal with Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore, two actors I usually like but who are stuck in a cliché, middle-aged-couple-in-midlife-crisis storyline. Add this film to the alarmingly growing list of Hollywood films in which adults have forgotten how to be adults and only remember how to be from watching and listening to their kids.""Crazy Stupid Love"" is tolerable up to a point, but by the end it's simply too long and too stupid to leave any impression other than that it was a big fat dud.Grade: C",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"From Michael Scott to Ladies Man, From Blue Valentine to Crazy Stupid Love","When Steve Carrell left The Office, I was about as sad as I have ever been about a TV show. When Ryan Gosling struggled in both Half Nelson and Blue Valentine, I was about as sad as I have ever been about a movie. With those two statements being said, I really wanted a light romantic comedy, I was tired of all the sadness. I am glad to report I actually did not get that, at least not out of Steve Carrell's plot. I could have never imagined this film working as a drama..but now I could never imagine it working as a comedy. While Gosling is charming and does create a good amount of laughs in the film, the main focus is on Carrell's character, who's just a sad sack character. That being said, I loved not only Cal (Carrell's character), but I also loved Carrell himself in the film. Now that James Spader is joining The Office, and now that Carrell is throwing himself into a dramatic role, and doing a very good job at it, I could see myself really not missing Michael Scott much at all. Also, there are a lot of attractive women in this film, such as Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, and Marisa Tomei. They all have really good plots as well, especially Marisa Tomei. Kevin Bacon is also quite funny as Moore's co-worker/new boyfriend. To end my review, I must mention Robbie (Jonah Bobo) falling in love with Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), which I may have even liked more than Gosling or Carrell's plot. It's such a sweet plot, and Tipton and Bobo are rising young stars. Overall, don't go into Crazy Stupid Love expecting Carrell's next Date Night or Gosling's next Blue Valentine, go in expecting something in between those two. If you wish for either of those two and not the other, you're going to be disappointed, otherwise, just like me, you'll love it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Way to go...,"This is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long time, it has the story, the characters, the jokes and a lot more.It is not just funny, it actually deals with a serious subject and deals with it in a very good and mature way, and it delivers very well, I was very entertained all the way.The two main characters are acted out by Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling and they can really act, they both seem very into their character and are very convincing. They are really good together and there is a good vibe in their acting, but also between the two characters.You should watch this, it should be on the 100 comedies to watch before you die list :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The perfect blend of funny and serious,"The major achievement of Crazy, Stupid, Love is to bundle so much fun and emotion, without a dull moment, in a basically routine suburban family crisis setup. You can't say this for a whole lot of movies each year, unfortunately.It doesn't start fast, it's rather low key until you get your run through the whole exposition. But it gathers momentum, scene after scene situations become crazier while never spinning out of hand, and characters are consistent and likable all along.With such a nice movie, delivering on all counts, you should be plenty happy. Yet, if you really insist, typecast is Julianne Moore as the neurotic suburban wife (but she does it very good and with some nuance from previous assignments) and typecast is Marisa Tomei as the crazy funny spicy litmus gal. These great actresses are really underused here. For it's more a movie about the guys, understanding them and have some fun with them, but who cares about this bias as long as it works?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"It's Crazy, Stupid and it's LOVE","After years of Marriage Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) suddenly break up and a heart-broken Cal ends up hanging at a local bar where he ends up meeting the smooth ladies man Jacob (Ryan Gosling) Jacob takes pity on Cal and decides to transform his life and 'teach' him how to pick up women, this right there would have been a fun movie all on it's own but this one goes a bit further with each character dealing with their own ""love"" issues in a hilarious way.The cast is fantastic and have great Chemistry together Specially Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling but also the pairings of Steve Carell/Julianne More and Gosling with the lovely Emma Stone are a joy to watch. And there's also Marisa Tomei in a smaller but Hilarious roll.Verdict: A very fun Rom Com and a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Shallow rubbish.,"Four for this is generous. I was crazy enough to stay with it for over an hour before giving up, which makes me stupid (at least for 70 minutes).It's not funny at all, and why is Steve Carell so over-rated? This banal crap was obviously loosely based on ""School for Scoundrels"", but Carell is no Ian Carmichael and Gosling (although a good actor) is out of his depth - and miscast - in the Terry Thomas role. Mind you, very few actors could match Thomas as a cad.Most modern rom-coms are awful and this one is only slightly above that adjective. Seeing a bar full of beautiful women is typically Hollywood: nowhere is there a bar like that, certainly not where I live in northeast England. I only wish.Come back Frank Capra, or any other director who could get this right.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Chix Chat on Film review: A man attempts to reconcile his life after his wife asks for a divorce.,"I am always in favor of a good comedic family drama and thought that this one looked as good as any. I was also interested in this story because it struck an accord with someone such as I, who has been married for more than two decades, and begs the question where can it go wrong? Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) has reached a comfortable complacent point in his life when he is then blindsided by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore), as seen in the trailer, with her declaration of wanting a divorce and her confession of a transgression. I have seen Despicable Me so many times now with my grandson Three, that when I see Steve Carell all I can think about is Gru, yes sad but true. I digress. The situation with Cal and Emily leads to Cal spending a lot of time in a bar where he then meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gossling) a slick womanizing pretty boy. I was not convinced by the whole premise that led to Jacob and Cal bonding, but decided not to give it too much thought. But the fact of the matter is that if Jacob were as self absorbed as he was shown to be he would not have given Cal two minutes of thought, let alone try to help him deal with his circumstances. The most endearing character throughout this whole movie was Robbie (Jonah Bobo). I loved his determination and his honesty regarding how he felt about Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), it was so adorable. And he was right about the four year age difference in a few years it would make no difference at all. I found myself after sitting through approximately forty minutes of this film, slumped down in my seat, yawning while I wondered where it was headed and then started to think about the Whodini song, When We Gonna Get To The Good Part, Get Down To The Good Part. And finally we did get to the good part, when all the outlandishness and asinine behavior brought everything together. And to be perfectly honest I did not see it coming. I sat up took interest once more and thought that the film had taken a very clever turn. I liked the bottom half of the film, but I felt as if the top half was overindulged. I give this film an amber light for taking so long to get to the good part.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fun movie,To be honest I am not a big fan of comedies mainly due to the many very cheesey American comedies that are churned out on a regular basis that to me are neither funny or entertaining most are just simply cringey . So Iwas very pleasantly surprised by this movie as it is not cheesey and it is funny! Great cast and acting that makes the story so entertaining Ryan Gosling as the Slick smooth talking batchelor is so well cast as is the other male lead! The story is simple but effective in its script writing A great movie to relax and have fun watching and even identify with at times I would recommend.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The movie can be at times a little messy, a little mopey, a little silly, a little sexy, but the overarching story is irresistibly charming.

"Humorous, exciting, and deep","I am always a fan of Steve Carell since the movie Forty Year Old Virgin which was released in 2005. In this movie, he is played as Cal Weaver who is going through a divorce and trying to get back with his wife. I like this movie because it is quite unpredictable. Usually a comedy romantic movie is very predictable, you can just guess what will happen next. However for this one, it is quite interesting. Not until the very last part of the movie that you know what will happen. The movie gives you a picture of the American society where teenagers are going through the teen phase and how they want to express themselves as adults and want to be treated equally to an adult. A woman (by Jullianne Moore) who has been in marriage for 25 years with three children is going through a mid-life crisis and struggling through it to find herself and want to find the same voice with her husband again. She and her husband were each other's sweet hearts since the first time they met in high school. Through the years, I guess work and children have come between them. The husband (Steve Carell) lost his self-esteem and somehow became alienated to his wife. They could not share their feelings and laughters became less in their house. It was interesting and exciting to watch this movie because you don't know if they are going to get back together or not. I also like how Ryan Gosling (as Jacob Palmer) is being portraited as a play boy, good looking, so skillful in knowing how to charms girls at the bars that he meets to get them into bed. The scenes keep switching between Jacob Palmer trying to hit on Hannah and about Hannal and then to Julliannae Moore and Steve Carell. It makes you wonder what are the relationships between these characters. I am not going to tell you to spoil the movie, you have to find out for yourself. But that is something that makes the movie interesting.I love every single character in this movie, especially the little boy and the baby sitter. The only thing I thought a little bit cheesy is the end of the movie, the graduation ceremony. It is such a motif, so typical of American movie. I don't want to say much because it might spoil you if you have not seen the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Trash.,"Why is it trash? Let me tell
You:
1) a wife's infidelity is blamed solely on her husband (he's a unfashionable dad so therefore he caused her to cheat).2) the wife never apologizes for her affair, she kicks her husband out of the house (and like a emasculated wuss he complies).3) what bar in any city would a father and adult daughter both hang out in? Seriously?4) a teenager taking nudes of herself for a adult man.... this was gross and clearly pedo -centric.5) Her parents call her an adult in one scene then freak out that she's a child when they find the nudes - and her mother gives the nudes to her father (what mother would that?!?) and he slowly sorts through each photo (creepy) until he unleashes rage against the man she took the photos for, who has no idea the teen has a crush on him much less has taken the pornographic photos?6) the teen gives her nudes to a younger boy she babysits for to ""get him through high school"". Wtf?!7) the boy is found by the babysitter pleasuring himself. He then runs after her and says he doesn't while thinking of her ""with no shame"".8) even if the entire film had not been cringy the ending was epically horrendous. The teen boy gives his 8th grade graduation speech about how love doesn't exist (how incredibly stupid), his father interrupts him to give his own speech about love and use the inappropriate platform to profess his love and desire to earn his wife's love again. Just dumb.The child porn is enough to make this grade A Hollywood pedo material. How does anyone like this movie?I'll tell you: the dirty dancing scene and the relationship between Emma stone and Ryan Gosling is perhaps the one and only positive thing in this movie. This movie could have been all about their relationship and it would have been perfect. But nooooo instead we have to have masterbating teens, child porn produced by a child, and all the disturbing ways infidelity is portrayed (and how the Cheater holds no responsibility whatsoever).Burn this film

NOT a Generic Romantic-Comedy,"Once I read a review where Roger Ebert mentioned how for the entire movie he sat there with a stupid grin on his face. That is similar to how I felt about Crazy, Stupid, Love. Only this had moments of outbursts of laughter, a few tears at the end, followed by an ear to ear smile.This movie is magical in the sense it is a true over achiever, a warrior in the time of 'sloth-ness' in the world of film. It seems as though the directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa were given a script that could have been your generic Hollywood romantic-comedy and through great understanding of love and pain as well as adept skill they transformed it into something far more grandeur.All of the performances were outstandingSteve Carell and Ryan Gosling were knockouts. Steve Carell is able to shift between his usual comedic prowess to earnest empathetic drama. Meanwhile Ryan Gosling continues to prove himself as one of the most talented actors of the neoteric age. All of the side performances were great as well. I was quite impressed with young Jonah Bobo, Emma Stone shines through with her charismatic charm that I am growing fond of, and Marisa Tomei is absolutely hilarious in this.I went into this movie expecting another generic cliché love story, but there is so much care put into the characters here, and the concepts are fleshed out so skillfully that it is so much more than that. This movie is a contender for best movie of the year and might just be a new personal favorite of mine. Unless your heart is literally made of stone, this is a must see movie. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A funny, yet heartfelt and bittersweet movie","Just yesterday, for the first time, I watched the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love., because I happen to really like Steve Carrell. And I've gotta say, it's bittersweet and emotionally heartfelt, and yet really funny!Steve Carrell plays Cal Weaver, a middle-aged man who has everything an American man could ask for; a good job, some incredible children, a lovely house and a gorgeous wife he loves, Emily (Julianne Moore). However, Cal's supposedly perfect life falls apart when Emily reveals that she wants a divorce, having cheated on him with co-worker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). This leaves Cal, over 40, abruptly single, and adrift in the strange world of dating. He soon draws the attention of self-styled womanizer Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), who offers his hand in helping Cal rediscover manhood.The acting in this movie is really good. Steve Carell is entertaining as Cal. Julianne Moore is terrific as Emily. Ryan Gosling is charmingly cocky as Jacob. Kevin Bacon is charismatic as David, even though he doesn't get much screentime. Everybody else does great with their roles.In addition, the writing is really great. Within the first eight minutes, the movie wastes no time in setting up all of its characters, and as a result, I completely understand all of them. The movie also has a very bittersweet tone to its story, that helps make it all the more believable, especially in the more heartfelt scenes. In addition, the movie is packed from start to finish with smart and funny humor, especially with Jacob teaching Cal how to womanize. There's also some pretty great scenes involving Cal's son Robbie (Jonah Bobo), from his ""a**-hole""-infused speech to his teacher, to the scenes of him trying to win over his babysitter Jessica Riley (Lio Tipton), despite her being 4 years older than him. The only real issue is that the movie is dated by some clear product placement; at one point, you can see Borders Bookstore, and before it went out of business, that was the bookstore of my childhood, aside from Barnes & Noble.And then the music. Christophe Beck and DeVotchKa's Nick Urata co-composed a pretty cool score for this movie. It's subtle and unobtrusive, yet it helps to underline the emotional uplift, and even enhance the comedy. The movie also makes some pretty good use of pop songs about love.All things considered, Crazy, Stupid, Love is a really good movie. It's a charming, hilarious, uplifting and smart movie about people with good hearts, and offers simple messages about love. If you like romantic comedies, or are a fan of Steve Carrell in general, Crazy, Stupid, Love is worth your time!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Cal's Midlife Crisis: A Surprisingly Sweet Ride,"So I went into this and I wasn't expecting much. But this movie, man, it's got heart. Steve Carell, bless his soul, plays Cal, a guy whose world gets flipped upside down when his wife drops a bombshell. Enter Ryan Gosling, all slicked back hair and smooth moves, who basically becomes Cal's wingman on a mission to get him back in the game.The whole thing is a bit predictable, sure, but the witty banter and those awkward teenage moments? Pure gold. Julianne Moore as Cal's wife, Emily, is fantastic, and young Emma Stone is just so adorable.What I really liked is how it doesn't sugarcoat anything. It shows the messy side of relationships, the hurt, the awkwardness, and even the occasional rebound fling. But it also reminds you that life throws curveballs, and sometimes, you gotta dust yourself off and start again.If you're looking for a feel-good movie with some real moments, Crazy, Stupid, Love. Is worth a watch. Just be prepared for some cringeworthy dad jokes. 😉",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"awful, awful, awful","A hugely talented cast wasted in a movie that wanders like a drunken cow on a highway. One can buy the initial premise, of a boring and predictable office worker (Carell), taken in hand by a predatory Romeo (Gosling) and turned into a a playboy after Carell's wife (Moore) asks for a divorce. Alas, alas, this movie has so many subplots and unnecessary complications one gets the feeling that a bunch of scenes from other movies were simply dropped into a Cuisinart and taken for a spin. Nothing seems to hang together. The eminently watchable Emma Stone appears to be performing in another movie for all the relatability her character has to the main plot. One sits there baffled as to why she is in this movie (although having said that, she is an absolute delight to watch -- and the reason this viewer went to see this flick!) Admitted, there is a final payoff for her character -- totally unbelievable -- but the interminable journey to get there is exasperating. As is another subplot between Carrell's underage son and his baby sitter that leaves one longing to fast forward every time either character shows up. The acting talent on display here is wonderful but oh, what a waste in a godawful script. (And did I mention Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei? Both woefully underused, drowned out by the surplus of subplots.) This is a stinker of a movie kept afloat by the sheer talent of the actors involved.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Oh dear.,"Emotional uplift? Not at all. Cringe after cringe. From vile women who hang out at bars every night talking about random guys on headboards, to the constant stereotyping of men. The entire dialogue shows desperation of this spoilt generation today to crave attention, have all eyes on them etc. I just can't stand this movie. I get you want a laugh but this never drew one. Sure women would spread Ryan on a cracker and feed him grapes and people would finish the movie and go and self-serve from all the mini dresses and excess make-up on display, but that doesn't make it a good movie. The lead actors work hard to convince but the actresses don't quite execute well enough. The little boy is entertaining though. Also, smiling and laughing every time each character spoke doesn't make the lines any more convincing or interesting. The movie makers of this film need to improve their overall game, and the women that idolise this need to come off their cringy horses and learn what good movies are.

Enthralling dramatic comedy that deals with love,"When I first saw the trailer to this movie I wasn't excited to see it or anything like that since romantic comedies seemed to be just heading towards just toilet humor a lot of times now a days. And just by seeing the trailer I could sort of tell what the story was about and it turns out I was wrong...And that is a good thing this time. Since the premise isn't entirely original but it's much better than the direction it could of went. A lot of the scenarios had a bit of the Asian drama vibe to it with everything that is going on, well a very condensed version of it and with more of a American flare to it. The main positive thing about this movie is that just about everything from the premise, the direction, the characters and the jokes...It just works for the most part. I couldn't help but be entertained by whats going to happen next, I mean it's sort of predictable but it's how it's delivered that makes this movie fun and enthralling to watch. The humor in this is actually witty, it's more of the serious but funny humor and doesn't rely on toilet humor. It has a bit of sex humor than and there but it wasn't annoying and for the most part it was sort of clever how it's delivered. Another thing that makes this movie work is the cast, almost all the cast fit right in with this movie and premise. Steve Carrell did the whole mixture of comedic/serious thing almost perfectly and Ryan Gosling played the ladies man really well, although sometimes it seemed like he was playing himself. All the rest of the cast put on a great performance and I guess it's because of the performance but the chemistry although short at times was believable for the most part. Overall this is a dramatic romantic comedy that just about anyone would enjoy. Unless your one of those annoying teens with a single digit IQ that just makes stupid noises, take random pictures and hide behind chairs constantly while other audiences are trying to watch a movie. Which happened when I was watching this movie, to sum it up this isn't a stupid comedy and isn't meant for stupid people that doesn't have the courtesy to just enjoy a movie while not bothering other people. Anyways it may not be the funniest comedy but the direction of it all is what makes this movie great.8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Towards the end of the movie when everything ties together it works, but is a little predictable as these films often are.

Right! Stupid Love!,"Let me start off my audit of this film by saying that I detest Steve Carrell. Watching him on ""The Office"" for every one of those years was excruciating, in light of the fact that his character, and it appeared his acting style was extraordinarily moronic and flat. While he has periodically been a better than average funnyman, I hadn't seen him in a job where he was remotely intriguing and conceivable.Recently, I was at the motion pictures, practically the entire day, and chose to look at ""Insane Stupid Love"", since it had tolerable basic and crowd responses, better than I expected for a lighthearted comedy, and it had a portion of my preferred individuals in it, including Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. What's more, without a doubt, I was gotten off guard.One reason for this, is on the grounds that ""Insane Stupid Love"" fills in as a lighthearted comedy and a dramatization. Most lighthearted comedies, I find, are unsurprising, stale, and basically one duplicate after another, of the equivalent careful story, happened in a somewhat changed way. You presumably won't think about where ""Insane Stupid Love"" is going. While the consummation itself is a ton like I anticipated it, there's a major unexpected development that introduces itself in the peak that I truly didn't see coming. Also, that is reason enough to see this film.In any case, there are some (better) reasons. One of the main reasons is that it abstains from making any of its characters exaggerations. Each character is genuine, and imperfect, messed up and manages their issues in a very grounded and adult way.It spins around Cal (Carell), a man who has been hitched to Emily (Moore) for a long time, and is shaken by the disclosure that she needs a separation, in the wake of laying down with an associate (Kevin Bacon). Cal starts hanging out at a chic pickup bar, where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a lothario who takes an alternate lady home each night. He gets on Cal's downturn, and causes him transform into something of a womanizer. In the interim, Cal's floppy-haired thirteen-year-old child Robbie really likes his more established sitter, who has her very own little pulverize. Additionally, Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone), a youthful legal advisor who has heard each pickup line, and along these lines, has a very fatigued attitude toward affection.Also, it is the principal film or TV show to depict Steve Carrell as a person. He can act! Who knew? I really enjoyed him in this job, since I felt that he wasn't Michael Scott, or that person from ""Get Smart"", or ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", however a normal person whose life didn't turn out as he had trusted. I got him in this job. He more than stays aware of the remainder of the film's heavenly cast.Another disclosure here is Ryan Gosling. I've for the most part observed him in discouraging emotional jobs (""Blue Valentine"", ""The Notebook""), while here, he demonstrates himself to be a finesse comic. He has fantastic comedic timing, and unmistakably has a ton of fun here with different entertainers. He is by all accounts the shallow funnyman from the start, and, similar to the remainder of the cast in this staggering film, opens up, and astounds the crowd.While Julianne Moore is constantly extraordinary, her character and Carrell's character work such that causes you to accept that their marriage endured 20+ years. Emma Stone is ablaze at this moment, doing an extraordinary job in ""The Help"", she sparkles the same amount of here, if not more. Her character is in a flash adorable, and I can hardly wait to perceive what she does straightaway.This film additionally includes Marisa Tomei, who gives a furious, and interesting execution as a recouping alcoholic teacher who dates Cal for a little while after his separation. Kevin Bacon additionally made me snicker, as Emily's associate, who was her post-separate from bounce back. While these two have brief jobs, they are extremely entertaining and capitalize on what they are given.What makes this film noteworthy for me, is that it is reasonable. It doesn't paint love out to be this enchanted thing that will naturally fulfill anybody. It realizes that adoration doesn't generally work out, and every so often finishes in deplorability as well as savagery. And keeping in mind that it's to some degree wake up call, it closes ideally and generally speaking, sort of cheerfully. It made me cry a bit, and it made me giggle a great deal. And keeping in mind that it could have been somewhat more, and given its characters some more space to develop, it was a delightful by and large bundle that I would prescribe to somebody who's attempting to get away from the late spring of superhuman flicks and continuations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You'd be Crazy and Stupid to miss it!,"Crazy Stupid LoveYes it's a rom- com, and I can hear the sound of guys being dragged to go see yet another one just to please their partners. Well guys, you're in for a shock and a good one too! As finally after a long time, Hollywood provides a romantic comedy that is actually funny, smart, charming and one that men will actually enjoy rather than just pretending!The plot is as follows; mid-fortys, straight-laced Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is living a dream-good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high school sweetheart. But when Cal blinded by love learns that his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his happy life quickly unravels. Worse, in today's single world, Cal, who hasn't dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of un-smooth. Now spending his free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal is taken on as wingman and protégé to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).The humour is family suited; running gags with no toilet humour in sight. Its refreshing that its predominately dialogue that is funny and peoples reactions rather than slapstick falling over etc.A stand out feature is undoubtedly the cast as each actor provides laughs in their own characterised way. Even the additional cast never falter as Liza Lapira aka Liz is the no nonsense quick witted bff of Emma Stone and not forgetting scene stealer Marisa Tomei adding the 'crazy' to the title whilst Emma Stone- who may not be utilised a much as she is cable of – is still beautiful and solid as ever. Young guns Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo also provide positive acting abilities but it's the two leads the movie hangs on. Steve Carrell brings his perfected dry wit to the proceedings but also a range of emotions which we don't normally get to see from him. Playing the socially awkward character is second nature to him now and he does it so well that throughout crazy stupid love you may miss the glimpses of his ability to be serious when we see him in this adult 'dad' role. There are strong indications there that he can gain stronger roles in different genres if given the chance.Ryan Gosling is the 'player', who takes it upon him self to transform the luck of Cal, inject some mojo and bring back his ""lost manhood"". To describe his character it would be that girls want him and guys want to be him. The personality he shows us is on a perfect line of confidence without the arrogance and makes his uber cool persona seem achievable to the everyday man.Another element for the audience is the films nicely balanced soundtrack, one for those interested in finding some unheard of bands, jazzy pieces and songs of soft delight. The screen play is clever in that it shows the picture as if to be admired from afar and not to be subjected up-close. The individual stories are to be taken on the surface, lightly and not questioned because its not a deep movie, the strength lies in the believing in good hearted people overcoming life's obstacles.In summary, Crazy, Stupid Love is all about the love, laughs and life. While it may not be magical, it's fully worthwhile and produces a golden 'OMG' moment! The length is near the two hour mark which admittedly the pace / tone dips in the middle but it does pick up again and leaves the audience with hope that even though love make us crazy and stupid, we wouldn't want it any other way!(my ratings are based on 6 average 7 good 8 very good 9 superb 10 epic)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A snarky charmer,"If you don't mind the use of cutesy coincidences to drive a plot, this entertaining film just might charm your socks off. True to its title, this movie examines the various crazy, stupid, and downright inexplicable aspects of love—and the love in this film flows freely: love lost between an endearing shlub (Steve Carrell) and his wife of 25 years (the always amazing Julianne Moore); love-as-lust as practiced by a hot young lothario (Ryan Gosling, perfectly cast); love avoided by an idealistic young lawyer-to-be (Emma Stone, in another role as the thinking man's hot chick); and unrequited love as only teenagers can experience it (Carrell's 13 year-old son, who just knows that his 17 year-old babysitter is his ""soulmate"" and said babysitter, who has a mad crush on Carrell). The plot here isn't the point anyway—except for one pitch-perfect scene in which Gosling and Stone lie in bed together and experience the true intimacy of really getting to know—and ""click"" with—another person. The plot twists might be a bit contrived, but this film has its heart in the right place. If this film doesn't make you smile, then you've probably never felt your pulse quicken or experienced butterflies in your stomach when you lay eyes on the object of your affection.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Feel Good Movie that gives an Ephemeral feeling of ecstasy!!,"Crazy, Stupid, Love is an above average romantic comedy that surprisingly manages to add something new to this perennially clichéd genre. The film features an ensemble cast comprising of immensely talented actors like Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling and a few others.The insane plot gets a jolt when Emily (Julianne Moore) decides to get a divorce with Cal (Steve Carell) due to suffering a mid-life crisis. As Cal is heartbroken from the sudden development, he decides to rediscover his manhood by learning how to pick up girls from Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who he meets at a bar.Now, there is a crazy scene near the end of the movie when all the characters get in a heated altercation after learning about the crushes that have been developed by certain characters for each other. I believe the final 15 minutes kind of ruin the movie as it involves a cheesy scene in which Cal hints that he still loves his wife and would love to have her back. After the sequence of events leading up to this scene, it feels like the filmmakers could have given us a more offbeat ending that would do justice to the overall tone of the movie.Apart from a few blemishes, most of the movie is hilarious due to some good acting and intelligent dialog. A heart-warming tale epitomizes the main plot of Crazy, Stupid, Love. It is definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Adds nothing new to the genre,"Major let down. I watched this movie enticed by the stellar cast. I thought ""how bad can it be?"". Turns out it can be pretty bad. The only bright point is some funny moments close to the end of the movie. I find it annoying that it tries to be profound, but actually doesn't say anything that hasn't be said before about love, relationships, divorce.Ryan Gosling is very convincing in the beginning of the movie and the photoshop line that Emma Stone utters is one of the best I have ever heard.

A Breath of Fresh Air,"Don't let the title of the movie put you off like it did to me initially!! I'd have to say that Crazy, Stupid, Love., is one of the Cartell's best performances.

If you have considered the idea of the existence that a soul mate exist, then you will enjoy this film as it provides a breath of fresh air with regards to the idea that ""there's just one person you want to be with forever"".Judging by the star ratings for this movie, I'm glad to know that many people still value the idea of soul mates. WAY TO GO YOU ROMANTIC PEOPLE!!This movie encourages the emotions of the heart to be stronger than logic of the brain.

Watchable,"First feeling after watching a movie was that it was overrated. Then I've realized: ""Hey, what could one expect from a romantic comedy?"" Considering that I'm not into this genre, this was pretty watchable and quality movie. Those who like the genre will certainly love it.The acting is great and they really got into characters well, especially Steve. The story is somewhat fresh, although occasionally unbelievable and even slightly inappropriate. It isn't quite hilarious, but contains certain amount of subtle and ""smart"" (or ""mute"") humor that I particularly appreciate. On the other hand, some scenes are too slow for what they offer, while some others could use more emphasizing.All in all, I'm giving this move a 7, which is pretty good from me. :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A comedy with and about real people,"American comedies have been on the up in recent years, and Steve Carell is one of the reasons for it. His character in Crazy, Stupid, Love is a more successful and sociable version of his 40 Year Old Virgin. If you believe Carell's name on the poster makes the protagonist simple and one-dimensional, you'll have to watch any of these two movies - again if necessary. Because Carell is one of very few comedians who is able to make the traditional leading rom-com-persona both authentic, funny and fresh.But enough about Steve Carell. He is only one actor of many in Crazy, Stupid, Love, and, in all respect, not the main reason why this film works so well. That reason is simply a combination of a crisp, clever script (by animated film screenwriter Dan Fogelman) and a couple of directors (Glenn Ficarra and John Requa) who understand and nail the balance between lightweight comedy and closeness to reality. Most other things in Crazy, Stupid, Love - including the form, the genre conventionality, the dramatic structure and the thematic core - is as standardized as can be. This is a typical American romantic comedy, right down to the mandatory moralizing in the end, telling us that love is the answer and that selfishness and fooling around may be fun, but it doesn't make you happy.Although the latter may be right, this Hollywoodized need for moral is my only real objection towards Crazy, Stupid, Love. And if you start wondering how this film can deserve my rating, considering my rattling off of what makes it so ordinary, I should add that my point in doing that is just to emphasize the quality of the script and the sympathetic, intelligent characters and performances. Crazy, Stupid, Love delivers despite seemingly being just one in the crowd - not because it has its heart in the right place (which every rom-com has) or because it's so sweet (which every rom-com is), but because it understands people and is able to discuss some very human issues a little deeper and less biased than most films - both in this and other genres. There are many films which deal with subjects like controversial age differences and the value of style versus substance, but few which acknowledge arguments from both sides and don't pass judgment.My next exhibit in singing this film's praise is that Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore agreed to take part in supporting roles. And what great performances they deliver. In many ways, those two constitute the thematic core of the film, from two opposite angles. And Steve Carell must learn to understand them both in order to ""recapture his manhood"" as Gosling puts it. Crazy, Stupid, Love offers great fun coupled with some real insight. And, just to quote every other critic, it has its heart in the right place. Well, that last bit is true, but it's not what makes the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

More of a man-flick than a chick-flick.,"A formidable cast have come together and provided us with what can only be described as a man's chick flick. It doesn't follow the formula seen so many times before. The main couple's relationship has already hit its peak. It comes crashing down within seconds when Emily (Moore) says to her husband Cal (Carell) that she's slept with someone else and wants a divorce. This is a punch in the gut for every loving couple out there. Crazy, Stupid, Love follows Cal dealing with what's hit him and the relationships that surround him, including his son's love for his babysitter (he's 13, she's 17) and Ryan Gosling, the womaniser he meets at a bar he drowns his sorrows in. Gosling's steers Cal into the world of the single man. Gosling is at the forefront of every scene he's in, up until the point he falls in love. It's lighthearted and fun up until it ups the severity. Smaller parts from Tomei and Bacon add flare to this heartwarming film. Apart from a little straying off, CSL is strong enough to be the best romantic-comedy out there because of its differences and loving characters.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Nothing earth-shattering, but cute","""Crazy Stupid Love"" is nice. Possibly the perfect date movie, since it explores relationship pitfalls without getting lost in them.Nice performances. Ryan Gosling plays a great ""player"" who decides to take Steve Carrell's character Cal under his wing and help him learn to talk to women about something other than his failed marriage. And Emma Stone is her usual delightful self.Entertaining, funny, and occasionally poignant. Frankly, the level of insight isn't much greater than some sitcoms, but it's still sweet.Dating? Or, married and on a ""date night""? Worth a trip to the theater. Otherwise, perfectly worthwhile as a rental later on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Crazy? No. Stupid? Kind of.,"The love in Crazy, Stupid, Love is not that crazy. But the movie is kinda stupid indeed. After watching the trailer, I thought I was gonna see a romantic comedy that can actually tell me something about love. However, it didn't touch me or tell me anything at all. Especially the directors completely loses control of the movie when Emma Stone brings Ryan Gosling to parents. I'm giving 4 points. For the first one, it's the minimum for a movie. The second one for the director telling a story. Nowadays a lot of filmmakers even fail at this part. The third point goes to Steve Carell and Julianne Moore for their chemistry while they totally don't look like a couple in person. The last one is given to Ryan Gosling for being so hot. As for Emma Stone, I had a lot of expectations for her. But she still looks like the high school girl from Easy A and not attractive at all. Ryan is just too sexy for her.

Thank you for showing there is a middle term,"I just ended up writing a review on Silver Linings Playbook and I know this review on Crazy, Stupid Love comes a little late, but guess what? There's no problem, it's probably new for many people and just made sense for me to review this two movies right now (probably because I wasn't very nice with SLP and I felt like showing that I'm not a Romance/Comedy/Dramas hater) . This movie really worked for me! It has the funny parts, the more sad ones that make you wonder and the regular ones that just brings you into the characters world. In CSL you get why they're doing what they're doing, you get compassion with them and you route for some situations. The best is that the movie occurs in a natural way and yes, in the end sort of goes the happy ending stuff to everyone but not so much in the obvious way that we're used to and in a way that you realize that is not the end. It is like it was you're life and you know life doesn't just end when you get want you want: there's more to it and CSL shows there's more to it after marriage, after kids, after our first love, after things going really bad.

Almost good,"It would be a good movie if it weren't for its indecision between being a funny movie and a serious sentimental one. But anyway it has enough of both features to make it agreeable to watch though on the whole it has too many funny scenes to be considered serious and too many serious scenes to be considered funny. But it has some witty dialogues and a few powerful sentimental scenes along with funny ones. The story tells us about a few crossed love situations: a 13 year old boy in love with his 17 year old babysitter who is herself in love with the boy's father, a husband and a wife who seem to be on the verge of a divorce which appears not to be wished by the husband and maybe also not fully for the wife despite of her confessed adultery, a husband who tries to take lessons of seduction from a professional philanderer and a few confusing situations that finish with a great surprise in the end.

Sweet and Enjoyable!,"I am starting to become a bigger fan of rom coms precisely because of movies such as Crazy, Stupid, Love. This movie despite some normal clichés we see in rom coms has a heart and is just too sweet to pass on. After you get to know all the characters in the film, you really root for them. They all have good intentions even if they don't make the right choices.Glenn Requa and John Ficarra's film is about a guy, who after being married for 25 years, is asked for a divorce by his wife. Suddenly being free, he tries to move on but is unsuccessful. Suddenly he meets a younger guy who is about to teach him all he needs to know about women. But will that get him over his wife? The cast is a really good one. Steve Carell plays another sweet, likable guy. He is starting to grow on me as an actor instead of just a comedian. Julianne Moore as always delivers a strong performance as well as Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. I also liked the subplot that involved the two teenagers.Overall, this is a very good film that rises above the other romantic comedies made recently just because it's so memorable and has strong, good-hearted characters. I also liked the fact that the funny moments and there were many, didn't come from any raucousness. If romantic comedies are getting made like this, they may have a brighter future. But, unfortunately these kind of above-average rom-coms are very rare. I'm glad I got to check out this gem. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The chemistry between Carell and Marisa Tomei is stellar, sadly it does not last long on screen.The cast are all fantastic and portray both the light and more intense moments terrifically, the best part has to be when all the different love connections come together, it is interesting to see how much they have all messed up, and it is perfectly executed. Funny, sweet, emotional and somewhat depressing, Crazy Stupid Love goes by its title, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy.After separating from his wife of more than twenty years, Cal seeks help from Jacob on how to pick up women.

This is a good-natured film filled with likable characters trying to cope with the difference between love's dreams and love's disillusionments.The cast is perfect for a comedy: Steve Carell, Marisa Tomei, Emma Stone, and Ryan Gosling, for starters. There is not a lot of mugging for the camera, like you might find in other comedies. And there is a marked absence of humor about bodily functions (which has brought many recent comedies down to the seventh grade level).The film is punctuated by laughs, touching scenes, and even a few moments that elicit a pleasant mistiness. This can be credited to both the script and the actors. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa deserve credit as well.Carell plays the disappointed husband who is forced to re-examine his life after many years of marriage. Gosling is a ladies' man who exudes confidence and savoir faire. Stone plays a young woman whose future revolves around her predictable and bland fiancé. In a smaller role, Tomei is a school teacher who frequents bars, desperate for any semblance of authenticity from the men she meets there.I really enjoyed this film.

The same thing happening with Jacob and Hanna. And on the other side you have Jessica crushing on Cal, who doesn't acknowledge her advances as inappropriate at all. Then you have Jacob who is just a copy of Barney Stinson and Charly Sheen, culminating in teaching Cal sexist ways of thinking of women.

Why is Cal just accepting to leave his wife from one day to the next without barely acknowledging it?I tried to go through with the movie by thinking about those highly incoherent decisions as plot-tools to arrive at the improbable situations that make up interesting stories, but scene after scene the movie wasn't improving. I also tried getting in the mindset of each character, but no matter what, the scenes with cringy unrealistic reactions and sexism were one too many and unbearable, and neither the story nor the acting were enough to get me to continue watching.It looked like the movie was made to fulfill male pipe dreams and no one checked in to make sure it could get in touch with how relationships actually work or how women think and act.

I know there is no American comedy which is actually funny save for Woody Allen and should have steered clear but it's Ms Moore's casting which threw me off.

Average comedy,"A man's wife leaves him and he has to start over in the dating world in middle age. So far, so 'Two and a Half Men'. This actually is a comedy starring Steve Carell, that people are rediscovering now, based on the fact that it stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, who have danced their way into the public's hearts via 'La La Land'.It's a decent enough film. Quite why the review on the DVD box claims it's better than 'Love Actually' I don't know, but it's amiable enough.My main problem with it is that it doesn't seem to know whether it's going for heart-warming or lewd in terms of its humour. It flits between the two and ends up being neither properly.A talented cast do their best with a so-so film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Watch it for Gosling, Stone and Tomei","First of all - amazing cast. I knew nothing about this movie, so I was surprised by more great actors popping out every time: Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, Emma Stone (who easily becomes a favorite of mine), John Carroll Lynch and Julianne Moore. I have nothing against Steve Carell, but he's really the weakest link here. Then again, I have nothing for him, he's just... Steve Carell, the same character in every movie.Gosling, Stone and Tomei (whose screen time is criminally short) are really the highlight of the movie. The three of them are fantastic. Gosling, a favorite of mine, proves time after time that he's a wonderful actor and continues to give excellent performance in every movie.The movie itself is really uneven. There are some wonderful scenes and dialogs, but other scenes are not that great and the plot... hm... I can't put my hands on it, but it's not constructed well enough.Still, some good laughs and the cast is excellent.5/10 Recommended",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A movie of two halves,"Usually, when I so dislike a movie, I won't get past the first half hour but it was getting late, too late to start watching another movie, too early to go to bed, so I stuck with it. Glad I did.The first half was dreary, puerile, unfunny stuff. I couldn't understand why Crazy Stupid Love had a reasonably high rating or why such a top rate cast would want to star in it. It was drivel.However, the second half of this two hour movie was hilarious. I laughed and I laughed and when I stopped laughing, when it ended, I thought about the movie and how different the first half was from the second.Crazy, Stupid, Love has two directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who frequently work together apparently and whose work I cannot recall ever watching until now. Did they each direct a separate half? Is that what happened?Anyway, can I recommend it? I honestly do know if I can. It is SO confusing. After the literally hundreds, maybe thousands, of movies I have watched over more than half a century (yeah, I know, I started when TVs were all black and white with a tiny screen), I cannot recall any movie that is so clearly divided in quality.Of course, others will think differently, and have judging by the rating.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Painful clichés overwhelm a charming cast,"Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy in every way. It has a lovable cast and is packed full of clichés. When I say the cast is lovable, I mean it - Carell, Gosling, Stone, Tomei and Moore all bounce off the screen and into our hearts. They're a talented bunch. Jonah Bobo drove me crazy, but I feel that his lines and story had more to do with that.But the cliché's are off the charts, and let me count the ways. -Zero-to-pick-up-artist romantic lead (40 Year Old Virgin - same actor and everything!)Rich-but-doesn't-work-super-sexy-womaniser (think Barney Stinson without a shade of originality by the filmmakers)Reformed playaa (Wedding Crashers)Super attractive female lead who we know won't end up with current boyfriend because he's played by a no-name actor and the male lead has already appeared in the same scene as her (there's too many to list, but lets just use Spider-Man)Crazy one-night stand personality and the awkwardness that ensues (Wedding Crashers)Boorish and cringeworthy kid love story (ripped straight out of Love Actually, but a lot less cute)Teenage girl obsessed with older man (think American Beauty)Everyone gets closure and lives happily ever after (Love Actually)OK maybe my list of examples is limited, but I'm sure once you've seen one you've seen them all (certainly true of McConaughey and I'm starting to suspect of Gosling too) By the end I was wincing in pain.

Definitely lives up to the middle part of it's title,"I must admit, I am not the biggest fan nor am I a huge viewer of romantic comedies but I must say this movie fell below my expectations as I wanted more but ultimately got less than what I really wanted and that was a bit of a laugh. I didn't really laugh, only a light giggle once or twice. It says that this movie is a comedy/romance and drama and it fails in at least two of the genre's as a minimum, I'll let you guess which ones. Steve Carell stars as a middle aged man whose wife, Emily (Julianne Moore) asks him for a divorce. He then goes to a bar and complains about his problems, enter Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a ladies man who acts as a fixer of sorts. The three main actors try their best not to overact but end up just doing it a little bit and I would normally say if an actor is underused, Emma Stone is as the film would have benefited from just a little bit more of her but in this case, Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei were a waste of space as the film could have done without them, Bacon looked way out of place and Tomei hammed it up just a bit too much for my liking. And let's not even get started on the plot which seemed so contrived. In short, it was another movie to join the list of many overrated films over the years that were talked about because of their so called ""big name stars"".",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Ups the ante of idiocy,"I had higher expectations of this movie based on the actors involved. The first part is not that bad, but it goes downhill after Steve Carell's character stops playing the miserable and cheated on husband and becomes a womanizer. This movie offers an extremely moronic view of human relationships, since Gosling's character eventually decides to stop chasing skirts after he meets Mrs. right of course and Julianne Moore's character all of a sudden wants her husband back after cheating on him (the reason for this is never spelled out, the same with why she felt the need to have sex with another guy in the first place). The icing on the cake of stupidity is the relationship between the son of the family and the nanny, that concludes with the latter offering some photos of her posing naked to the former as a means of compensating (???) for the fact that he is still very young and she is not into him. In a nutshell this movie manages to offer some of the silliest romantic clichés about adult relationships, while it piles up on the creepy factor about the teenage ones. Not a mean feat by any means!!",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Pretty Bad Movie,"Rating: 5.9
Overall, a decent watch that has some memorable moments from the interactions between Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell, but overall is a pretty formulaic Rom-Com that does not have a strong ending considering how predictable the movie gets.Decent Direction (Uses the 2000s/early-2010s Rom-Com template to help drive the story forward, allows the ensemble to use their talents as it seems like they are taking a step back), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Steve Carell (Plays a very typical Steve Carell character, so pulls a lot from experience to play the role), Pretty Good from Ryan Gosling (Really uses his charm and charisma to guide his performance), Decent from Julianne Moore (Is not really given too much material to work with), Decent from Emma Stone, Decent from John Carroll Lynch, Decent from Marisa Tomei, Decent from Kevin Bacon, Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad to Decent Story (Entertaining story overall as it is a retelling of the makeover story similar Pretty Woman and She's All That, but it does share a lot of the same cliches as well has many of the same faults that Rom-Coms of the time period have (making the movie incredibly predictable); The story does fall apart in the final 30-40 minutes as it becomes incredibly predictable and borderline cringy), Decent Screenplay (Pretty Funny/light-hearted Rom-Com overall with safe dialogue, symbolism is pretty shallow as it follows the same message as many of the Rom-Coms of the era; the foreshadowing was more cliche than anything (which made the movie incredibly predictable)), Decent Score, Bad Cinematography (I'm not sure if it was just the way I was viewing it but the filter they were using made the movie feel incredibly blurry as it gave this movie a dream-like feel), Decent Sound, Decent Editing, Plot Structure was pretty boilerplate for a Rom-Com but the final arc (last 30-49) becomes very cliche as it tries to show the 'meaning' of the movie, Pacing was decent for the most part but is incredibly rushed in the final 30-40 minutes of the movie (which is kinda sad considering this was where the message of the movie was supposed to be brought out); Runtime was fine (maybe an extra 10 minutes could've helped with the ending), Climax was not executed well as it was very cringy and was incredibly formulaic for a Rom-Com, Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms of the era.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Works as a movie trailer,"Condense this to two minutes and it's great. You'll laugh, you'll cry, then you'll blink. As a movie, it's mediocre and lacking the humour promised. Despite great casting, the leads languish.There is a twist that adds a lot to the movie but comes in the final act. Move that forward in the film and the potential for more conflict, humour and ""life-lessons"" grows substantially. But it was not to be. They played it safe. It feeds but does not nourish.In fact, much of this feels safe. Even Ryan Gosling's role as a Lothario is rather boring. Instead of being over the top to the point of goofiness, it's played straight and serious. That would be fine if character flaws had been introduced, perhaps some that Steve Carrell's character could help fix (the saviour gets saved).

"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","A huge cast (Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei) struggles mightily with a glib, pre-fab screenplay by Dan Fogelman, packed with awkward situations that go nowhere.

With the exceptions of the agreeably smooth Gosling and the warm and witty Stone, everyone has done better work: they seem lost in all the talk; Carell, in particular, alters between cowering and manic but always just happens to be articulate enough to hammer home the literal points Fogelman is intent on making.

Several commendable supporting role performances, most notably by: Ryan Gosling; Analeigh Tipton; and Jonah Bobo.Cons: Most of the plot was boring, with the entire first half of the movie being painful to sit through.

"Love is strong, but money also talks","ON a literal level, the flick is about forgiveness and everlasting love in the journey of life. On an allegorical level, it's about the power of money, that is, money talks.So the wife admits to sleeping with her colleague and now wants a divorce after 22 years of marriage. The husband admits that he may have taken his foot of the gas pedal and let things slide. He goes to a high-end bar to drown his sorrows.The rich playboy, who surprisingly does not have AIDS or STDs despite his innumerable conquests, takes the loser husband under his wings and transforms him into a suave, Bond-type guy, with the help of the loser's credit card.I must now admit to readers that the main reason I got this DVD is because of Emma Stone, who is delectable, ravishing and downright fun in 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. Stone's laughter and cheery personality can melt hearts made of stone, and she gets to display her vivaciousness in a few scenes with the playboy.The two fall for each other, and not just because of their sexual attraction to each other. The playboy's pad is impressive, and he says it was bequeathed to him by his rich dad. Tell me, dear readers, would the two of them have stuck together if the guy was not filthy rich????I like Carell's easygoing, loser demeanor. Viewers will feel sympathy and tenderness towards his character.The climax is surprising, and I first thought it was smart, but I then realized that the filmmakers had deceived us by not revealing beforehand that the bubbly Stone is the daughter of the divorcing couple. The movie focuses on the couple's two other children and conveniently forgets to mention about Stone.Also, the part about the female teen who takes nude pictures of herself is unnecessary and silly.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great in parts but horribly flawed in others.,"Crazy, Stupid, Love is almost a brilliant film, but it misses the mark so heavily on one of its main elements that is is dragged down into the mud. To it credit it does the 'Com' bit fantastically, Steve Carell plays the awkward 40-something part brilliantly, as he does whenever he is cast in this role. He is a pleasure to watch and this movie would be lost without him. Gosling is even pretty watchable, and at times funny, his character has little depth however, and the parts of the film that are emotional or romantic he fails to put any real feeling into his character.The films biggest flaw is its women, I am not one to shout the feminist agenda from the rooftops but you get the feeling the Writers had a complete contempt for the female sex. Moore sometimes emerges from these shackles and you start to emphasise with her character but mostly she is the cause of the breakup and has little on screen time with her family. Emma Stones character is simply awful, and her friend in the film played by Liza Lapira is downright sickening. If we take one thing away from this film it is that if a woman is better looking than her partner he better know it, and he better know that he is lucky to have her. It is such a pathetic and shallow view of love an relationships and it jibes so sharply with the message this film thinks its trying to communicate that it not only taints the film but destroys it. As if this wasn't bas enough Stones character for the rest of the film goes from mish-mash-crazy to completely uninvolved, its a real shame.The film still has its laugh-out-loud moments, and some great writing, but it cant recover from its fatal flaws.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Boring stupid movie,"I was disappointed, maybe expectations was too high because of high ratings. Almost nothing was funny. I find there are very few good comedies from Hollywood during last years, probably there are some problems in this genre. To make a good comedy must be way harder than chunks full of special effects. Another one dumb... I can't call it comedy, a romantic film neither. Waste of your time. Nothing in this movie was plausible. A middle aged man, who's wife is vice president in some company, wears dirty running NB shoes matched with too big suit at his office (and restaurant) and when he finds out his wife wants divorce throws himself out of running car. Then comes the Saver and helps to get appropriate dress and the whole trite story begins. Really boring.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Steve Carell needed to be more....,"sympathetic for this to be a really good movie. The main problem I had with this film is that the main character, Cal, played by Carell isn't likable enough.

She kicks Cal out and he drowns his sorrows in a bar. At the bar, he meets ladies man, Jacob. Jacob wants to help Cal out and help him pick up woman, which he does.Then there are the side plots with Cal's son liking his baby sitter and the baby sitter liking Cal. Plus, Cal's daughter Nanna has a new guy and he's shocked when he finds out who it is.So, the whole movie is about relationships and crushes. It's not really funny, but is amusing at times. It's just that I didn't care who ended up with who.FINAL VERDICT: More of a chick flick, don't expect lots of laughs.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nice movie to go watch with your girl,"We are familiar in seeing Steve Carell in all round crazy comedies like, Get Smart, Date Night and others. This movie drops in a different category all together as we see him play a comic role but had to put some serious dramatic energy in it, to make the character not look phony. If you are not a huge fan of the whole, romantic comedy flicks, this movie is a set aside for all. Starting all cliché-ish, Steve Carell plays Cal Weaver a Mr. Nice guy who's wife cheated on him and to add insult to injury, she tells him this to his face on their way home from dinner which ended abruptly when she dropped the divorce bomb. Cal all bumped out starts to hang in a bar gets drunk and talks on and on about his wife (Julianne Moore) cheating on him. He meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who takes him under his wing and turns him to a lady magnet. From here the movie goes through the same tunnel as others, the hunk mentor falls in love and protégé ends up not wanting to quit the game, the movie then adds twists and turns with an enlighten ending. The scripts from Dan Fogelman and direction from ""Bad Santa"" writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, we are presented with a perfect ensemble cast, which delivers in both comedy and drama to keep you watching to the very end.The only problem with the movie is just the fact that it is predictable, as we have been dealt in various dosages of romantic movies going in this trend, but known has a 13 year old boy who was insanely in love with a 17 year old, I will give the writers that. Also to add the 17 year old was in love with Cal.Marisa Tomei, joins the cast as the first girl Cal, lands in the sack.The thing about reviewing a romantic comedy is trying not to reveal all the plot and at the end , killing the fun, so you want to go to the cinemas with your girl?

For those who are still dreaming about an eternal love,"It's been a while since I last came across such a good romance-comedy. The movie has interconnected stories, A loves B, B loves C, C loves D, and it goes around and around. The relationships between characters were portrayed very subtle, so that whenever realizing something new, I'd go ""Oh, so that's it!"". Despite being a romance-comedy, there are some touching moments, one of such was when Emily was calling Cal.The movie features a strong cast, albeit not your current hot stars.

Please tell me Ryan Gosling didn't consider it on a par with LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. Believe me, this movie, so formulaic it's almost geometric, is not in the same class as those three. The only comparable idiocy I've seen in the past decade that sinks to this level is the Jennifer Aniston/Vince Vaughn vehicle THE BREAK-UP.OK, OK, enough venom.

Cal then goes on to bed 9 women and turns into a slick dude himself.If this were any ordinary movie, the rest of the plot would be obvious. It doesn't give away too much to say that one of the women Cal conquers turns out to be his son's teacher (Marisa Tomei). In fact, the movie plays very much along Hollywood formula lines that the non-Hollywood ending is a complete surprise.I wish I could tell you more. But to do so would spoil the film for you. Steve Carell is a master of the underplayed comedian. Julianne Moore is lovely at age 50 (although she claims to be 44 in the film – it is a comedy after all). Emma Stone is smart-sexy.

"Finally, a smart feel-good movie. (even if you're not a fan of Steve Carell)","I originally didn't want to see this movie because all I knew about it was that Steve Carell was starring. But my friends (two guys, mind you) insisted that it was the only worthy-looking film in theaters. Probably because they think Steve Carell is hilarious, and not because they're die-hard ""rom-com"" fans. When they told me Emma Stone (the coolest person ever) was in it, I agreed to go.This movie starts out a bit depressing, while staying in-tact with the humor that's found in our every day tragedies; divorce, unrequited love, etc. The story starts from hitting rock-bottom and going forward with life. Things are getting better and worse at the same time for Cal (Steve Carell) when he deals with his high-school-sweetheart-wife (Julianne Moore)'s infidelity and her decision to divorce him. At the bar where he goes to look pathetic every night, he befriends an over-confident, over-stylish pick-up artist (Ryan Gosling) who oddly feels responsible to give Cal a make-over. The objective is to make his wife jealous by building his confidence and ""game"" with other women.Ryan Gosling gives a great performance, even though he's semi-ripping off Robert DeNiro's trademark persona. And Emma Stone is as cool as ever, winning his heart by being curiously honest and poking fun at what she sees. She effortlessly makes the inner pain of Gosling a little lighter.This movie is filled with fun scenarios. Did I mention that their 17-year-old babysitter is in love with Cal? And that their over-romantic younger son is in love with the babysitter? I know this movie sounds cliché, but it's the good kind of cliché. The kind that has built on romcoms before it, and made the genre better and more appealing to both sexes. After all, it wasn't me who pushed us to see it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy about a variety of individuals as they embark on their own struggles with relationships and mostly love.","There is some great acting, hilarious one liners, and a few hopeless romantics. It is very idealistic, a little over the top at the end, but I really enjoyed it!This was definitely a comedy. It was really funny with lots of one liners to keep you laughing! It is also very romantic, you are striving for these couples to make it through. But it was very different from other romantic comedies. This is mainly because the story is told from the men's perspective. The men are the ones cheated on and damaged trying to pick up the pieces. This made the whole dynamic of the movie very different. It also was not happy-go-lucky through most of the movie. There was a lot of down-in-the-dumps moments, but yet again, somehow misery is hilarious!My favorite part was the acting! Steve Carell perfectly portrays a 40- something man who's let himself go a bit. He hilariously shows this character that is downtrodden and the opposite of hip trying to turn his life around. His chemistry with Julianne Moore is questionable at times, but I think you are still fighting for these two throughout the movie. Ryan Gosling was also perfect as the confident, studly, womanizer who takes Carell's character under his wing. These two have great chemistry perfectly showing a man's perspective of relationship struggles. The casting of these two is great for a movie centered on the men! Emma Stone did a great job also. Her chemistry with Gosling was believable and romantic. This is a more mature role for her. She plays a mature woman about to begin her law career, much different than a high school hottie.This movie, like many romantic comedies, was very idealistic! Everything is grand gestures and ends conveniently. But we have our own lives for depressing story lines, a little idealism won't hurt while we are at the movies. The ending is over the top. I do think it could have been wrapped up in a way that was a little more believable. I don't like to reveal too much, so that's about all I can say about that.Overall, I had fun watching this movie. It was funny! It had some great acting and hilarious lines and moments. It is idealistic and doesn't have the best ending, but all this is forgivable. It claims to be the best comedy of the summer, which I don't think it quite achieves. There have been a lot of comedies this summer, and a couple really good ones.
