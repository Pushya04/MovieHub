"Look, I love it!","I totally understand that this film and all of the scary movie films are pretty terrible films but I just can't help but love them! The comedy in this film is right up my street, it's ridiculous and it makes fun of all the classic horror films that I love. The comedy is just pure crude and I find it absolutely hilarious and will always film it funny. This is a great film to watch with friends and have a good laugh with, it's just contagious once one person if laughing. I will forever think that this movie is the best of the series and I think that is hands down because of the cast, how did they get Tim Curry in this thing? I will never know! Overall though I just love this movie and I don't care what anyone says as this will always be up there for movies to have a laugh to. I love it!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mindless fun,Is there a plot?  Not really.  Do we care?  Not really.  Scary Movie 2 strings the audience along from one gag after another.  There are some big laughs in this film but sometimes it's tedious getting to them.  See this late at night with a full theatre and you're going to have a good time. It's just as raunchy as the first one and just as tasteless.  That's why the first one was so popular.  It's a mouth full of laughs (just ask Tori Spelling).,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stupid but a lot of fun.,"Scary Movie 2 (2001) follows four teens who are tricked into staying at a haunted mansion for a school research project. This film isn't good per say, but it is a lot of fun and definitely one to watch with friends.The humour was ridiculous yet charming, very stereotypically 2000s. It had me laughing out loud from the very start but, there again, I have a broken sense of humour! The references to pop culture really added to the humour and made it funnier in my opinion. However, I wasn't a fan of the gross visual jokes and I found myself unable to watch them.The film didn't have much interesting cinematography and visuals but I don't think it needed it. Plus the set designs were quite good, and there genuinely were some decent colour palettes throughout.The acting was poor but this was definitely intentional, and the characters were strangely loveable in a way. All the acting was over exaggerated and the characters followed stereotypes that mock other horror films. There were some fun and unexpected cameos too, for example I didn't expect Tim Curry to be in it, and found his character very funny.Lastly, the pacing worked well for this type of film as it was fast and witty, never dwelling on one moment for too long. Also, something I really didn't expect was that the story was actually pretty engaging.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clever and Witty but Mixed Emotions.,"I have various mixed emotions about this sequel to the hit SCARY MOVIE. It wasn't as good but it delivered many laughs and slap-on-knees. I was a little surprised at this one on how they could spoof any movie right after the other. If you really liked the first one, you could be disappointed or satisfied with this one. I was satisfied. 7/10My MPAA rating: R for strong crude sexual content and humor, drug use and language.",,Anonymous,Horror
The entire movie was rushed except the editing.,Scary Movie 2 was slow and boring. The opening scene in the house that spoofs The Exorcist was desperate and painful already. Many scenes don't go anywhere and neither do the actors who stand around sometimes. They even spoof the brain removal scene in Hannibal which is impossible because Hannibal was released in theaters in February 2001 and this sequel was released Independence Day weekend the same year. How desperate. I don't even understand the basketball scene referenced when the basketball bounces down the stairs leading to some break dance sequence. How many today would know that reference?,2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Oh, come on! Let go! Trust me, it's not that bad!","OK, not Oscar material and this was pretty badly made. But again like most brainless comedies, I walked in the theater with a good mood and expecting a laugh and I got that with ""Scary Movie 2"". I mean people are being so harsh on this film, I understand, I know this isn't the greatest movie or comedy. But if you aren't expecting fun and laughter, I think normally you just feel like bashing the movie then.We have some of the old cast members from the original Scary Movie: Anna Farris, a surprising return of Regina Hall, and Marlon and Shawn Wayne. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcist(hilarious scene by the way), Poltergeist, The Haunting, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, and What lies beneath. With some great add ons like Tim Curry, I just had a great time. Tori Spelling, yeah, she's a bit scary, but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs.The Butler just killed me with the hand. Yes, it was gross, but I think you just have to let go and just go with the joke. Scary Movie 2 isn't the best comedy ever, but it's a decent one with your brain turned off. Sick jokes, yes, and very crude one's, this movie isn't for everyone. But I think if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie, you'll enjoy this one too!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scary Movie 2 is undoubtedly a continuation at the level that the previous film deserves, but it doesn't get to be funny all the time this time","Right after the release of Scary Movie, the production already indicated that there would be no sequel, and this is stamped in the subtitle of the original poster, ""No Continuation!"". The group, realizing the good reception of the work among the popular public, seeks to build a stylistic unit for future continuity. Thus, in the rhythm of the comedy, the production tries to play a prank on the audience that had become a fan since the success of the first film, using the slogan ""We Lied"", In the subtitle of the second film in the franchise, as a reference to the first feature, which in the subtitle said that there would be no continuation.At this point, the idea of a franchise was already a reality to be worked on in the coming years - considering that definitely Scary Movie, in less than a year after its first public appearance, had already fallen into popular prestige, today, canonized in its genre. The fact is that the continuation of Scary Movie was released in theaters in 2001, bringing a humor that had not saturated and being a box office success, generating a split between specialized critics and audiences, who, until today, differ in the quality of the film. This second part again brings director Keenen Ivory Wayans in charge and even a short time after the previous film he managed several other recent and old cinema successes to satirize.The management takes advantage and continues the narrative thread of the first part: the group that survived last summer enters college and friends meet again. Cindy (Anna Faris) is still a character who tries to be saintly and stars in sexual scenes as if she doesn't know what she is doing; Ray (Shawn Wayans) increases his range and throws himself at new guys, producing memorable scenes; Brenda (Regina Hall) still dates Ray, and Shorty (Marlon Wayans), the group's stoner, stars in one of the great scenes in the film when he is curled up by a tree and smoked by her. In a new adventure, the friends are invited by the university professor, Oldman (Tim Curry), and his assistant, Dwight (David Cross), to stay, in a field subject, at the house on the hill. There, the professor intends to study the phenomenon of insomnia, however, everything goes wrong, as is known.The film begins with an interesting scene by first parodying the classic The Exorcist. Interesting for the great art direction, photography and costumes that purposely ended up simulating the 70s, where the events of the honored film took place. Thinking the prologue with a satirization of The Exorcist is already the best entry in the series of films, even better than the great start of its predecessor, which begins with the parody of the initial scene of Panic. The opening scene makes a point of naming the possessed family's home ""Casa do Inferno"", without regard or pity for the young woman's family. The party on the ground floor of the house, while the possessed dies in the bedroom, is of unbelievable nonsense and the eschatological minutes of the character of James Woods, together with his unwillingness to exorcise her, makes the scene complete. In this film, the direction introduces hints of eschatological humor in some scenes, which it did not do in the previous one. The eschatological is well placed, it causes discomfort by nonsense and brings laughter for dealing with situations so distant, but also so close. The curious thing here is that Marlon Brando was originally chosen as Father McFeely and completed a day of filming before leaving production due to illness. Charlton Heston was even asked to take Brando's place, but he declined the proposal; Bill Clinton, who at the time had just stepped out of the position of President of the United States, was also considered to play the role. Finally, it was up to James Woods, who received $ 1 million for four days of filming, to play the priest.The change of focus in the story is not free. The writers wanted to make fun of other types of films and explore new ways to disrupt some classic horror movie scenes. And since they manage to do so well in a story involving a serial killer, there is nothing more fair than trying to explore the supernatural, after all, clich√© productions involving haunted houses exist in droves and several of them are practically begging to be satirized. Although obviously not being able to be as smart as the original, this sequence manages to remain dignified, especially with its numerous connections with the previous film.In the first episode, the central theme was to play with Wes Craven's Panic series (started in 1996) and quote other similar films with a lot of humor. This time, the story was centered on the movie ""The Haunting (1999)"" and several scenes resembled satires to the films The Exorcist (whose director's version was released at the time), The Man Without a Shadow, Hannibal (in the famous brain sequence), Premonition, Revelation, and even films outside the fantastic genre such as the new version of the police adventure of Charlie's Angels, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drago with their choreographed fights, and the catastrophe of the Twister hurricanes (in a scene where a ghost cow flies into a tornado), among other references. Titanic is also quoted, as in the original, with a direct allusion to the scene of the iceberg. It also shows a great scene of prominence closer to the end that makes reference to the movie Charlie's Angels and even Mission Impossible 2 (in a scene of action in a wheelchair, entitled to the famous doves of John Woo) ... There is still space, even, for a quick and hilarious joke with Harry Potter.For these scenes, some visual effects were very good, such as the clown scene. Others, on the other hand, were very artificial like those of the cat, but they worked very well at the time of its release, managing to amplify the laughter. Just like the previous film, the cast repeats their characters once again and continues without developing them in any way. For those looking for fun, the film manages to get a good laugh despite the short duration, the shortest of all. It continues with some creative scenes and is especially worthy of paying homage to other films recently seen. Once again the sexual jokes are very present in practically every scene and will certainly please your target audience again. The eschatology show is immense, with a urine bath, spurt of sperm, vomiting, flatulence, bad jokes with disabled people, etc. A film that is a waste of time, but that still serves to laugh without compromise.If in the first feature the grace is due to the novelty - for example, the novelty that is to discover, through Ray's hilarious holes, scene after scene, that he is homosexual, or also the novelty that the humorous style of Scary Movie brought to the genre, that is why it was so well received in public -, in the second film, the grace is due to the reused reasons of the first feature, which are renewed as new situations are proposed. It is a big mistake to think that the second film in the franchise has made a mistake, since everything that made Scary Movie funny, such as Cindy's stance, Ray's sexuality and Shorty's high, had already been shown and explored in the first feature. Quite the opposite.The continuation delivers a mood with similar vigor when applying the same script in a new environment, renewing the possibility of finding and taking the laughter out of other situations, expanding and multiplying your universe. However, even though it kept exactly its essence, this continuation presents good isolated moments, but it loses a lot even by the characteristics of the films honored this time. With House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, The Exorcist, Poltergeist as a basis, that is, all films whose main action takes place inside a house, this parody follows the same steps, which ends up , in a way, limiting the situations to be explored. The choice of the honored films certainly obeyed this logic to what was proposed here, providing several new situations without necessarily leaving the environment of the haunted mansion. The problem is that this is a limiting factor for the plot.Now, however - in tune with the current taste of the average American teenager - this type of satire is only commercially successful if it is filled with eschatology. In this field, Scary Movie 2 is more than fertile. The film already opens with a urine bath. Sperm squirts, flatulence, vomiting in buckets and - worse - the most infamous and embarrassing evils against disabled people follow. Intelligence and subtlety don't stand a chance. Scary Movie 2 is undoubtedly a continuation at the level that the previous film deserves, but it doesn't get to be funny all the time this time. In this one, the direction leaves aside some acidic criticisms that it brought in the first film and introduces a more organic and ridiculous humor. Without taking away the strategy and expanding the humorous experiments to other groups to be parodied, some even a little more delicate, the film by Keenen Ivory Wayans plays with cinema and the daily life in an authorial, familiar and precise way, reaching, many times, the nerve point of laughter.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A very poor and lackluster effort.,"The unexpected success of ""Scary Movie"" demanded an immediate sequel and all the Wayans' brothers could come up with was this uninspired, irritating story that (attempts to) spoof Haunted House horror films such as the ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""the Haunting"". Part two was released only a good 10 months after the original and this clearly resulted in a hack job that never should have come out. Apart from a bearable intro, in which a deranged James Woods performs a wacky exorcism, ""Scary Movie 2"" is nothing but a dreadful series of unfunny jokes, exaggerated graphics and gags that show no insight in the wonderful genre of horror. The complete cast returns and a few fresh ones are introduced (like the sexy Kathleen Robertson and the tasteless Tori Spelling) for spending a couple of nights in an ancient mansion where spirits dwell, cats become kick-boxers and the indoor plants smoke pot. Tim Curry, once the star of cult-classics, lowers himself to playing the horny college professor. This film is vulgar, tasteless and very offensive¬Öyet, I couldn't care less about that!

Better than the first.,"The production of this film was fast due to the success of the first part. And although this may mean compromising the final quality, I was satisfied with the film. The reason is simple; He goes to well-known sources to present hilarious situations based on the grotesque. That's the main feature of the movie and it's where it gets its best laughs. There is a well-chosen cast and the characters are hardly similar to an ordinary human being and therein lies the freedom to generate unusual and exaggerated situations. The film works and is even better than the first by being simpler and simply aiming to make you laugh. The objective of the film is fulfilled and more than achieved.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A jumbled mess with few laughs,"Scary movie 2 is of course the sequel to the movie I wish I could forgot, Scary Movie (2000). This sequel is basically just more of the same, but maybe with a couple more laughs than the first film. The acting is alright I suppose, for this type of movie it is. Many of the jokes just fall flat and fail, but there are a couple that squeeze bye and actually did make me laugh. There are a couple of scenes where the gross out ""humor"" was just too over the top for my taste. Tim Curry is in this movie, and I didn't really hate his character, but I certainly didn't love his character either, I didn't really care whether he was in it or not. If you liked first scary movie then you will probably like this one. But I just didn't care for it, the jokes were lame and dull, nothing to brag about. Yeah I guess that's about it there's not much more to say, this is a dull movie with too much gross out humor that really I would just like to forget about, basically the same as the first film. So both movies receive the same rating from me, a 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bottom of the Barrel,"I might have to do some checking up on this, but I'm pretty sure that seven writers is a record high for a non-anthology film. And just what is this cinematic treat scripted with so many pens? It's probably really good, right? I mean, with seven writers, it would have to be extremely good¬Öor very, very bad. Unfortunately, it is the latter, and the movie is `Scary Movie 2.' This sequel of the funny teen-horror spoof `Scary Movie' has none of the subtleties, parodies, or even big laughs the original film did. Instead, it digresses to overtly sexual and gross-out humor which doesn't even work on a gut level. I feel sorry for every person associated with this project.The story line is actually a little more involved for `Scary Movie 2,' as if you needed a plot to set up the horrendous `laugh scenes,' which are fewer and far between this time. Classic camp actor Tim Curry is Professor Oldman, a college teacher who recruits a group of students to spend the night in a haunted house so he can conduct some sort of experiment (though we never really understand what that experiment is all about). Of course, this group contains most of the kids from the first `Scary Movie,' including innocent Cindy (Anna Faris), loud-mouthed Brenda (Regina Hall), marijuana-obsessed Shorty (Marlon Wayans), and sexually questionable Ray (Shawn Wayans). New this time is straight-arrow Clark (Christopher Masterson).  The house is inhabited by the twisted butler Hanson (Chris Elliot) and even a ghost (`Night Court's' Richard Moll). The kids slowly discover the mysteries and secrets of the house, and make every bodily function, sexually oriented, inappropriate joke along the way.There are those who complain about this style of humor in general, and therefor will not see this movie. However, sometimes it works, such as in the original `Scary Movie,' `American Pie,' and even at the far end of the scale, `There's Something About Mary.' There, the gross out is permissible because there are characters we mildly care about, or there are other types of humor going on as well.However, `Scary Movie 2' is the prime example of where gross out humor can go wrong. Instead of playing up some of the humorous character stereotypes, or mixing in some creative horror movie parodies with the gross-out humor, `Scary Movie 2' relies solely on it. It seems to me that many scenes in the film were robbed of their comic potential so our seven scriptwriters could fit more vomit, feces, and other unmentionable bodily concoctions into the film.There are a few laughs that harked back to `Scary Movie,' and those scenes always feature one of the two Wayans brother's characters. Even though they had five other folks working with them, its clear that this is their project. Maybe those other five scriptwriters fought back and added in the gross-out stuff.As for performances, the same can be said. Both Wayans seem to have more comedic experience than their fellow teen-age counterparts. Faris is better than she was in the first `Scary Movie,' but nowhere near as funny. Plus, she still looks and sounds just a little too odd for me. Curry hasn't had a good role since the mid 80's, and its sad that this is the caliber of film he works in. There are other famous cameos including James Woods as a priest and former Conan O'Brien sidekick Andy Richter as his assistant, but one must wonder what they are doing slumming around in this film. After watching Woods in his worst performance to date, it frightened me to realize that Marlon Brando was originally cast in the role. There would be no saving his career had he gone through with this.If you have any desire to be thoroughly disgusted, or like your humor from the bottom of the barrel (and I mean bottom!) then check out `Scary Movie 2.' Otherwise, go on living your life with the knowledge than unlike myself, you managed to escape this waste of a sequel.",,Anonymous,Horror
Oh dear.,"About as funny as having ones testes chewed by a mutant army of rabid goats. Not even so bad it's funny. Gone so far past not funny that it overshot so bad it's funny and instead emerged in the murky and not oft explored world of absolute, unmitigated, unwatchable tripe. Run for your Lives! I was once involved in a minor car accident. It was much more fun than Scary Movie II. Please don't watch this. This plot is non-existent, not really a problem for a well scripted entertaining comedy, but this isn't one. From beginning to thankless end this monstrosity does not contain a single even mildly amusing moment. I laughed more in Brief Encounter. The acting is so bad it hurts, the script was written by diabetic gibbons with Tourettes and the general tone of this crime against humanity is so painfully patronising i was forced to jump up and down on my DVD until it was rendered conclusively unwatchable, avoiding any possible future chance that i might one day trip on a children's toy and accidentally drop the DVD into the player again, forcing me, God forbid, to sit before some of its cringeingly, achingly dull content again. Do anything to avoid ever seeing this abhorration. Take any necessary steps. Murder? Worth it. The only aspect of this movie that has any merit whatsoever is the title, which is fittingly apt.

It was great fun and total entertainment to watch, and I have watched it quite a few times.The comedy might have been a little too over-the-top and repitive at times, as it seemed like this one tried really hard to please the audience when the first one just went with the flow, but that is really how a lot of comedies are like, even more so now than then, so I do not see how this one is any different. Anna Faris pulls off Cindy Campbell's character wonderfully, again, and nobody could have done it better than her. All the other familiar characters, as well as the new ones, are excellently portrayed and likable, in a sense, and the movie has a high replay value, for me at least. This movie was not a disappoint to me either, because I thought it lived up to Scary Movie perfectly.There were a lot of funny parts in this film, such as the opening song, the Charlie's Angels spoof scene, the scene were buddy gives back Cindy's book, and the Cindy singing in the car scene. If you have seen the film, you know what I am talking about and hopefully enjoyed those scenes as well. If you hated this film, please try to watch it again, and you'll see just how good it really was, hopefully.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary Movie 2,"This movie has some funny parts, but not as many as the original just being perfectly honest. It has some parts here and there but just wasn't the same. The story centers around many characters from the original film, some that actually died in the original, but hey who is asking lol. The characters are now in college and get invited to a mansion which turns out to be haunted. That is pretty much it with the story. Just horny ghosts from there and silly fart and seman jokes after that. The Wayans Brothers are very talented but this one os just ok. I would recommend seeing it just to watch because it is still the original characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst sequels I've EVER seen!,"1/2* out of ****What on earth happened? I don't think I have ever in my entire life seen a film so funny and original have such a TERRIBLE sequel. The things they spoofed weren't really well done, some of the gags weren't even spoofs but rather replicas of what the film was TRYING to spoof, some gags were reused, horribly, and frankly, the comedy tried too hard.I have a feeling the only reason people are saying this one was funnier than the first (which I've heard a lot of) is because of one of the following:1: They are saying what they think their friends will say, and their friends are saying what they think THEIR friends will say, merely for popularity reasons, however untrue.2: They are overly optimistic. I personally know very few people who didn't enjoy the first film, so the fact that the sequel was garbage just can't be!3: They saw the film on the worst day of their life, which had subsequently demolished their taste and humor to horrific lows,thus ANY comedic movie, good or bad, funny or unfunny, was just what the doctor ordered.4: They were really, REALLY toasted when they saw this movie, thus EVERYTHING, including the projector rays penetrating through the dust of the theatre, was funny.Admittedly I am somewhat grading this film compared to the first installment, which isn't really fair, but I doubt even without that bit of criteria that this movie would have been enjoyable. Besides, that's the price you pay when you make a sequel, especially when you promised that there wasn't going to BE a sequel! (see tagline of ""Scary Movie (2000)"" The first film was VERY good, I can't stress that enough, frankly I haven't laughed that hard in a movie theatre since. With the sequel, I giggled a few times, but that hardly makes it a genuinely funny movie. Am I being overly harsh? Nope. I myself was in the midst of an average, take it or leave it day, am only slyly optimistic, care not what my friends think about my tastes, and had not taken part in any mind altering benders that day, and hence saw the movie for what it was:  A WASTE OF TIME.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a waste of time & money!,"Well, the first movie was OK at least due to the ""originality"".But the second only reinforced the failures of the first film.The moments I got a laugh were so few that I can count them withthe fingers of one hand.The parodies of some movies were great. but they were spoiledfor so many gross jokes about sex and bodily functions, that theWayans ruined the intended effect.I don't know, but the people who likes this bad film, must bepeople either very young or very inexperienced moviegoers,because I can tell you, with my 38 years of moviegoing, that thisopus from the Wayans Bros., is a total waste of time & money.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Decent Sequel,"A group of teens are tricked by their professor into visiting a haunted house for a school project. Now, the house is filled with secrets and ghosts.This film pokes fun of many horror films, including The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Haunting, and What Lies Beneath. The prologue, like any other Scary Movie films, spoofs The Exorcist. It was funny and gross.The acting is some-what good but a film like this only focuses on the jokes, which is a good thing. This film made me laugh so hard at some scenes and others were tend to be too gross and not funny at all.Unlike David Zucker's Scary movie films, the Wayans push their Scary Movie films to be rated R. Their jokes can go far as they want it. It can be as crude, gross, or sexual as they want it. Some may like their style better than David Zucker's so it just depends on which team you like.This is the worst, not meaning bad, film of the series. Yeah, it gives out some big laughs but it wasn't as funny as the other three films in the franchise. The team are trying too hard to pull for the joke.

James Woods is always entertaining to watch in any genre and his performance here didn't disappoint.But what the hell happened after that? Director Keenen Ivory Wayans sense of whats funny from the 1st film seemed to elude him here. The jokes just fell flat and flat after that, the acting was terrible and often stupefying to watch.

Very disappointing,"I actually enjoyed the first Scary Movie, I gave it 7 out of 10. But Scary Movie 2 is absolutely horrible. I don't mind gross out humor if it's funny, but here, it's not, it's just plain stupid. I do have some respect for the Wayans Brothers (and the endless list of other writers involved) for at least trying to parody different movies this time around, instead of sticking to the same ones as the first (although a few of the same jokes do show up again here). Unfortunately, they just couldn't pull it off. The teen slasher movies from the original were easier to parody, I think, because they're just really horrible to begin with and very easy to make fun of. People would have laughed no matter what. It seems like they were expecting the same thing with the second movie. However, most of the movies they choose to parody are a little more on the serious side, and therefore, are more difficult to make fun of. Not that it couldn't be done, but the writers would have to put more work into it. They didn't. All but a few of the jokes fall flat, and are more likely to inspire blank stares, not laughter. There are a few really funny jokes, but not nearly as many as the original Scary Movie, and not nearly enough to fill an entire movie.Rating: 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Weak Storyline Filled With Constant Hilarity,"Since the first Scary Movie completely ripped off Scream, at some points scene for scene, the film had a very developed, rich storyline which was filled with tons of hilarious gags.Half of that works in the sequel.  The storyline is weak, mainly copying the plot of the lackluster ""The Haunting"" which leads the main characters to spend a weekend in a haunted house.  This is a great idea, but the story is not developed enough and after watching the film, I couldn't even remember why the characters ended up in the house in the first place.Yet, the film's cast and writers give constant hilarious moments to add to the weak storyline and make a great film. Anna Farris returns as Cindy Campbell and is just as hilarious as she was in the first film.  Other returning members are Shawn Wayans as Shorty, Regina Hall as Brenda, and Marlon Wayans as Ray.There are several other new cast members, such as Tori Spelling, who does a tolorable job as a fellow college student, Alex.  Several other cast members make the film enjoyable and the gags are hilarious.  This is a great movie to see, because it's short and just something to laugh about, so fork over the nine bucks and laugh your ass off.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Uneven but entertaining,"This is not as fun or as good as the first film, but while it is a very uneven film I do not think it is the worst of the series. That's the fourth. The film's weakness are mostly to do with the story and the pace. The story is very weak and thin a vast majority of the time, and the film feels rushed sometimes. While most of the references/spoofs are fun, some don't work, especially the forced and messy Titanic one. And there is some uneven performances, Marlon Wayans, David Cross and especially Chris Elliot come off best, but Anna Faris while better than she was in the first overdoes it and while Tim Curry was a welcome presence he doesn't have anything worthwhile to work with. However, the film thankfully doesn't look sloppy or straight to video quality and the music was quite good as well. Of course the film is silly and mindless, but most of it is very funny, the dinner scene with the running joke about the hand, the talking parrot and the Charlie's Angels spoof work especially well, and a lot of the script if bizarre and silly is hilarious. The highlight though is the Excorcist-beginning, with a very amusing cameo from James Woods. That scene alone made me think it would be a good movie, but while the rest of the film wasn't quite as good, it is entertaining enough and not as bad as some say. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"not scary, not funny, not even so bad its funny - but worse!","most of the reviews I've written so far have been glowing or at least grudgingly good with a few criticisms. This is the first I've written where I can find no redeeming qualities about it. So why 2 stars? Well, it is only 79 minutes long, and Anna Faris is reasonably pretty. Thats about it though, and really the only reason it didn't get lower is because i simply don't like giving 1 out of 10 simply because of the work that goes into making any film - but this film comes closer than almost any other I've seen.Whereas the first Scary Movie, whilst not exactly brilliant, was a relatively original spoof of Scream and I know what you did last summer, with some genuinely funny moments, Scary Movie 2 has none of these. Furthermore, the first film stuck to poking fun at horror films, whereas this abomination of a sequel frequently meandered off aimlessly into other films, most notably a Charlie's Angels sequence. With the exception of the Wayans Brothers and Faris, the majority of the 'names' from the first film are absent - not that their presence could have salvaged this road accident of a film. What on earth were Tim Curry and James Woods thinking? The jokes are purile and immature, and their crude nature make the humour from the first film look like an Oscar Wilde play. Surely there are only so many times projectile vomiting and bodily functions can be amusing? and surely they are before the age of 15? (incidentally, this film is an 18, but it surely cannot have been aimed at over-18s).The film starts only reasonably bad with a spoof of the exorcist, and, whilst never approaching the comedy of the first (that in itself not a great challenge to meet), it is watchable. Its all downhill from there though. As spoofs go, Spaceballs it ain't. By the end you are simply crying out for whatever serial killer they are spoofing at present to slash up them or, failing that, you. The tag-line read more laughs, more screams, less clothes - inaccurate on all three counts.I've never given a film such a slating before, so this is a novel experience for me, and oddly a rather calming one too. The only scare to come out of this film is the prospect of a third film, and even a rumoured fourth in the franchise in the works. A truly terrifying prospect indeed.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

And that is that the only scene in the movie even remotely funny is right in the beginning, even before the credits!

"Horrible, just horrible; even worse than the first","How would you define 'film'? If you define it as something that's filmed and put together, I suppose that you could claim that this falls under that definition, but if you define it as something that has structure, continuity and meaning, then this isn't a film. It's just a bunch of gags and scenes(badly) cut together. Every single character that you hated in the first, and was glad to see die, has returned, including a few new clich√© characters to hate. The film is entirely carried by stereotypes, and tries continually to make you laugh at stuff that anyone with just a tiny amount of moral wouldn't laugh at if his or her life depended on it. Stuff like homosexuality, the physically and/or mentally disabled, junkies, etc. The list goes on, but I really don't feel like typing it all here. The gags and jokes are powerfully unfunny. I think I smirked once during the film, and that's it. The humor obviously tries to offend, and it certainly succeeds; they just forgot to make it funny, in the process of thinking up stuff that will make plenty of people find the film disgusting(what's wrong with the Wayans', anyway?). The humor consists entirely of tired clich√©s, worn-out stereotypes, gross-out comedy, and bad spoof sequences. Throughout the entire run-time(which is less than 90 minutes, what's wrong Wayans', did you run out of material?), there was only one single gag that was mildly amusing; a spoof of the Nike commercial that was on TV back in '01, which of course doesn't seem funny now, when they're not sending that commercial. Pretty much all of the movie spoofs in the film don't work, they mostly seem forced, and very weak. I guess you could basically sum up my opinion of this ""film"" by quoting the very words my father said when he saw the first few minutes of the first Scary Movie; ""All that sex and violence... what's the point? Really, it's not even funny, it's just offensive and disgusting.""

"This is not a movie, this is an uninspiring, disgraceful, pointless crappy spiel of wasted film. Trust me, there are better ways to spend your time then watching this garbage.","I have to say that writing about Scary Movie 2 is a painful experience, but not as painful as actually watching the ridiculous film that we are given by Keenan Ivory Wayan and his crew. To put this movie in perspective, it was supposed to make me laugh, right? I did not laugh once, which shows where it fails for me.So I am not going to deeply analyse this film, just tell you that it is not funny, has virtually no moments of greatness, the performances are pretty poor from all involved (including the Wayan brothers, Anne Faris, Malcolm in the middle star James DeBello, Tori Spelling, in a career destroying role, James Wood and Natasha Lyonne). While the direction of the film lacks any sense and is just one contrived mess in my view.To learn that acting legend Marlon Brando was going to accept a role on this film almost made me faint from shock. Thankfully the great man was not well enough to do so, because if he had have been a part of this terrible conglomeration, I believe it could have cost him more than his health. Scary movie (2000), the very original movie spoof, was a surprise in the cinemas, taking off some of the great horror movies of our time much better and was more to my liking. Yet with that film, I could only enjoy it once as it ran thin on me after that. This is the sort of comedy where you are either going to love it or hate it. I hate it with an absolute vengeance.So my rating? CMRS gives 'Scary Movie 2': 0Reason?Sorry there is nothing here to really get your hopes up about this film. After turning this film off four times in disgust, the best part about this movie was seeing the closing credits, knowing that it was finally over and I was out my misery.P.S.

If I had one request as a movie-watcher, it would be that I could have those 100 minutes of my life back. I am disappointed that will not be happening. A friend warned me that this would happen.

Could it get any worse than this?,"I liked the first Scary Movie. Yes, it had silly and gross jokes at times and the parodies weren't as sharp as they could have been. But it WAS funny and it had parodies. This sequel started out about the same, but soon the parodies were dropped to make way for the Wayans brothers' running gags, the same as in the first movie. These are:1. Gays. Gay guys are all nymphomaniacs, so watch out straight guys! Don't befriend a gay guy, he's sure to fall in love with you and/or molest you. And the doll rape scene? Not funny, just gross.2. Handicapped people. In the first movie there was Dewey, the mentally retarded guy, whose only redeeming moment was when he turned out to be the killer who had only been faking retarded the whole time. In this movie there's Dwight, a wheelchair-bound guy who's obsessed with never asking for help. I don't think I get the joke there. We're also introduced to Hanson (played disgustingly by Chris Elliott), who has a withered hand and - well, that's it. He's gross! I mean, a withered hand, no need for a personality or anything. Just like Goldmember on Austin Powers, he's just gross for the sake of gross, and therefore not funny.3. Bodily fluids. We got to see them all in this one, and when there's a pee scene, a fart scene and a vomit scene within the first minutes, you're in trouble. The sperm explosion joke from the first movie was repeated. These are surely funny moments to some viewers, but to others like me it's just cringeworthy and disturbing.4. Sex. This can't be avoided in a teen comedy, but it was supposed to be a parody of scary movies and not all about sex. I agree with the poster who said the Wayans brothers should just make a porn movie. They seem obsessed with sex.5. Drugs. Shorty's back and still not doing anything but smoking pot. It gets really tired after a while. I did laugh when the plant rolls a joint with him inside, but other than that, it wasn't funny at all.The only part that works is the Exorcist spoof in the beginning, but even that is ruined with crap, pee and vomit jokes. Notably, this part is the only one without the main characters present. As for the roles, Anna Faris does her best, but her role is pretty much being a stupid pretty girl. Kathleen Robertson gets to play the sex bomb and Tori Spelling is the ""athletic"" girl who has sex with the ghost, and who dies pretty soon. Both are pretty underutilized and aren't even present in most scenes. The new addition, besides Hanson and Dwight, is a parrot saying dirty/rude things, which is pretty predictable and boring.All in all, a very disappointing sequel. Not worth watching. 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Funny stuff, but PLEEEEASSSE get your minds out of the gutter!!!!","I'm not going to totally badmouth ""Scary Movie 2,"" because I admittedly laughed a lot.  Of course, most of those laughs came in the first half.  I felt the second half was hit-or-miss.  My issue is ever since ""There's Something About Mary"" was released, we've been bombarded by these gross-out comedies!  Every time another comedy is released, it tries to outdo the previous one in grossness.  The writers and directors assume they're pioneers, because they just disgusted audiences to the fullest.  Well, what they don't realize is what made ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""American Pie"" work was their sense of wit and structure.  There was a certain sense of intelligence behind the grossness.  Now, filmmakers just assume you can have a young man shoot a wad of...manly juice...in a female's face and that's going to get a laugh.  That's mostly because these comedies appeal mainly to young people.  And young people, in general (not including me, of course), will laugh at ANYTHING scatological!  It's unfortunate, but true! I admit, I've enjoyed tasteless comedies like this, the first ""Scary Movie"" and ""Road Trip,"" but I've never seen a tasteless comedy that I can actually regard as great.  Some of my favorite comedies of all time are films by Woody Allen and Albert Brooks.  Those are comedy writers/directors who know how to get laughs without even uttering the word ""penis.""  Now, though I did enjoy the aforementioned comedies, there comes a point where enough is enough.  Sure, the young ones are eating this stuff up with a spoon and they'll probably tell ya ""Hey, get off our backs!  Go watch a historical documentary, if you can't handle it!""  Normally, I would say something identical to that, but there always comes a point where it's just too much. And ""Scary Movie 2"" displays every indication that we have.  At least, release some ADULT comedies.  In case the filmmakers forgot, there ARE IN FACT grown-ups/mature human beings who go to the movies.  But how often do we see adult comedies?  Almost never!  I guess they feel that's not where the profit is, so screw it!On a positive note, I think there are a few sequences in this sequel that were very well done.  The James Woods/bowel movement scene is purely tasteless, but let's face it.  There's a certain thrill in watching a serious actor humiliate himself like that, so this is your only chance to encounter Jimmy Woods taking an on-screen dump.  I liked the parody of the Nike/b-ball commercial, in which everybody bounces the basketball to a certain rhythm.  In this case, even the guy in the wheelchair joins in. The Wayans were pretty sharp in writing the satirical moments.  Some other good ones are a ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" parody and one of ""Charlie's Angels."" Don't ya love it when they crack on movies that you absolutely loathe?  Another scene I have to note is the Wayans' take on ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" in which Tori Spelling gives a b**w job to a ghost.  That's an example of humor (as I mentioned earlier) with a degree of wit and structure.  It's a very original idea (I can be wrong, email me if you can name another movie where a woman gives h**d to a ghost) and I felt it was used wisely.One actress they should've deleted from the cast all the way from the get-go is Anna Faris.  Though the film's comic timing, in general, is nothing priceless I felt she was totally off-key and her gags come off less as funny and more as...bad acting.  She's a beautiful actress, indeed, but looks ain't everything babe!  Chris Elliot is another one of those comedians who has good comic potential, but can come off as extremely obnoxious in a badly written role.  This is an example of the latter.  He plays an annoying butler with a deformed hand (was that supposed to be funny?).  He made me groan a lot (especially in the dinner sequence), but I got no laughs. Shawn and Marlon--what were you thinking???The crude humor begins to fade out in the second half, to the point where you just say ""Enough already!""  There's hardly a single joke that doesn't wander into scatological territory.  We are also forced to sit through a recycled gag from the original, in a parody of ""Hollow Man.""  Though many in the audience laughed at the outcome of that scene, I saw it coming (no pun intended).  Most of the humor is pretty cheap, predictable and forced, so there are few gags that I can regard as priceless.  I still have to say, the funniest sequence is the opening in which we're treated to an interesting rendition of ""Shake That A**.""  The scene contains my main man Andy Richter (as you can probably tell, I was and still am a huge ""Conan O'Brien"" fan).If you're seeking a bundle of dirty laughs, I can't object to purchasing a ticket for ""SM2.""  As I said, my main dispute is the lack of variety among comedies today.  I urge you comedy writers:  Get your mind OUT OF THE GUTTER!!!  JUST FOR ONE DAMN SECOND!!!  Try it, it works.  You can still be funny!My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I suppose drama, could be judged by how much it ""gets"" to you, a horror on how much it scares you etc. Most of you will know what this film is about and what to expect, parodies of recent films and some very low brow humour, so I won't go into detail giving it a proper review, but I'll just say if that sounds up your street, and it's on the TV one night, check it out. If you aren't likely to find a string of gay, sex, toilet and the like jokes entertaining, then you should avoid. I fell into the latter category and still decided to watch it, and it got a couple of laughs out of me and a few smiles, mainly from the exchanges between the guy in the wheelchair and the guy with the withered hand, the guy with the withered hand in general, the Big Daddy Kane nod, and the high tech devices they used for communicating near the end of the film. There is a nice bit of comic acting in here too, and as with most parody movies, you will also get more out of it if you've seen the films it spoofs.Unless you're a fan of general toilet humour, be aware of what you're getting into.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spoof for one more,"Another gross movie by the Wayans, spoofing a lot of blockbuster horror movies, from Hannibal, to the Exorcist, with The Haunting has the setting of choice for a plethora of gags, most of them too disgusting to be really fun, a few repetitions from the previous movie, but all in all fun at times. The spoof of the Nike basketball commercial is a nice shot, while most of the other gags are for the trivia seeker, like myself, who watches a movie of this kind to see how they can parody a serious horror movie. Could be better, but it's more than watchable",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It has moments of classic toilet humor.,Scary Movie 2 has some very funny moments but overall the film is a generic mock film.Chris Elliot's portrayal of the butler in this trivial sequel is gut splitting. Saturday Night Live would benefit with a skit using Elliot's Character. Anna Farris somehow keeps a comical sisterly approach throughout the movie. Marlon Waylan's homosexual tendencies are amusing. The cat fight has one holding back tears.There's not much going on here except mocking popular horror films. It's a light amusing film that somehow leaves you feeling good. A mindless romp through a popular formula. It works. It's stupid but good stupid.,5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best comedy of all time,This film is hilarious all the way through it was crude at bits but nothing a 13/12 year old hasn't seen it heard overall a brilliant comedy,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not everything is bad, but still...","While ""Scary Movie"" was a parody on all those teenage slasher/horror movies that we got in the nineties, like for instance ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Scary Movie 2"" is a parody on famous horror movies like ""The Exorcist"" and ""Poltergeist"". Knowing this in advance, I certainly had a few expectations about this movie. Not that I thought this would be an intelligent movie, because when you are about to see a comedy with the Wayans brothers, you know what you can expect: a lot of vulgar and pre-teen humor. Still, that doesn't mean that they can't be good fun from time to time and seeing a parody on about every famous movie is a nice pass-time, like the first ""Scary Movie"" already proved a year earlier.In ""Scary Movie 2"" four teens are tricked by their professor and his paralyzed assistant into visiting the haunted Hell House for a school project about sleep disorders. In this house a bad exorcism took place and the ghost still lives there. Chaos starts as soon as they arrive. They meet the creepy caretaker of the house, have to face the evil spirit and will have to solve some dark secrets, no matter how disgusting they are...I admit that I liked ""Scary Movie"" and normally I'm also a fan of other spoof movies like for instance ""Hot Shots"" or ""The Naked Gun"", but this movie certainly didn't do it for me. This wasn't just vulgar, it just wasn't very good. The beginning with the exorcism was quite funny and the movie certainly had its better moments, but the overall quality of the story and the acting were so low that it really started to annoy me. Take for instance the fact that all the characters from the first movie are back, even when they died in that one. That can only mean that the story and the sense of reality (although that is perhaps not the exact word for this kind of movies, but you know what I mean), weren't of any importance. The only thing that mattered was the extra profit this movie would be worth. They didn't even have the time to come up with something new or original, making this movie feel like it was written in a couple of weeks time with a crate of whiskey and 10 joints per man...The jokes and gags that the Wayans brothers and their enormous team of writers, producers,... came up with were clearly inspired on the first movie. Never change a winning team they say, but sometimes the audience wants to see an underdog win. They don't want to see the same thing over and over again, they want something new and that's where this movie failed completely. I give it a 6/10, because not everything was awful, but it could have been a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haven't you got hair to wash instead?,"Not worth my time to give more than the 4 lines required by IMDB to have my comments registered!

Four point two is way too high,"Honnestly, I don't get how people could like this movie. So you make a parody, okay. That's cool, that's even fun. People buy it, people like it and you earn money.But you don't write a sequel to a parody! This whole idea is wrong on its own, but then they just had to add lame jokes about sex and other vulgarities. You can be funny without that! By example, the Charlie's Angels parody was good. If you saw the real movie afterward, you truly realized how ridiculous it was. But all the other humor was just way over the line. Those are jokes ten year old kids giggle at. By the looks of it, it was some guy with the brains of a ten year old who wrote the script... So, I beg you, next time, think twice before you write a sequel.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not the best movie, but funny as hell","I have seen alot of reviews for this movie saying how bad it is. It is supposed to be a bad movie,its a spoof. You don't go see this kind of movie for its good story line and acting. I thought this was funnier than the first. I was laughing my butt off for the first 15 minutes of the movie. So I would say if you are looking for a few good laughs go see it. If you are looking for a artistic movie, don't bother.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Humorless Waste,"Incredibly lousy offering ostensibly of the movie-genre-satire style. The Wayans brothers prove once again they lack the talent of greats like Mel Brooks (Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles) and the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team (Naked Gun, Airplane). These classics were funny. This pathetic wanna-be imitator is not.Speaking of airplanes, if they ran this rubbish on one, people would probably walk out on it, even at 25,000 feet.""Teens-in-peril"" horror movies are like sitting ducks in a shooting gallery waiting for somebody to insert a quarter, pick up the rifle, and blast them at will. There are so many corny, absurd, overworked clich√©s in these types of movies, a writer with any sense of humor at all should have a field day lampooning them; yet this is the result: an hour and change of meandering, mindless, humorless dreck, appearing to be no more than skits strung together in random order. None of them evoke a single laugh. It takes more than reenacting a scene from a movie, adding a few swear words and tossing in some toilet jokes to be funny.This dog is not worth your time or money. You would be better off watching a late-night infomercial than this rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Lots of laughs, but pleeeeeease get your minds out of the gutter!!!","After watching ""Scary Movie"" I never thought there would be a filthier R-rated movie ever!!  But then the sequel came along and...for all those parents who covered their kids eyes during the original, make sure you keep a thick blindfold in handy if you're planning to take the young ones to this filth-fest!I'm gonna give this movie a mild recommendation, because I did laugh a lot. The first half is hilarious!  The opening, I think, is the funniest moment. I don't want to give it away, so I'll just say it's an interesting rendition of the song ""Shake That A**.""  Of course, this is your only chance to see veteran actor James Woods taking an on-screen dump.  Who can resist that? Can you believe Marlon Brando actually considered that role initially? It's just refreshing to see a big-time, serious actor humiliate himself like that!  So for that:  Thank you Keenan, Shawn and Marlon.  The film's second half is not as successful, and pretty much sinks to a hit-or-miss level. As I said, Shawn and Marlon (and the many co-writers of the script) didn't once get their minds out of the gutter.  So the dirty jokes do get tiresome after a while.  Chris Elliot has an obnoxious role as a creepy butler with an underdeveloped hand.  He has a few disgusting (not funny) scenes, especially one at the dinner table, that simply made me groan.  I don't know what the hell the Wayans found funny about the character when thinking him up. There are some sharp, smartly written scenes that spoof pop culture, just like the original's attempt at spoofing the ""Whazzzzuppp!"" guys.  There's an interesting and wildly funny scene where they spoof a sneaker commercial (I think that's what it is, I can't remember exactly what the commercial was for) where the characters bounce a basketball to a certain rythm, including the guy in the wheelchair.  There's also a fine tribute to ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and another one to ""Charlie's Angels"" (Don't you love it when they spoof movies you totally hate?).I think the main actress (Anna Faris), who was also in the original, has totally awful timing and most of her comedic scenes just come off as bad acting.  Then again, the timing in this movie isn't exactly priceless.  You can usually tell when the next punchline is coming.  You don't always know exactly what the joke is, but you sometimes have a good idea (any opportunity to journey into the scatological).My beef with this movie is pretty much the beef I have with a lot of the recent comedies.  First of all, most of our recent comedies are aimed towards young people.  And comedy writers assume young people will laugh at ANYTHING that deals with sex or bodily functions.  The problem is:  they're usually right!  There are many young audiences (with the exception of me) who crave anything tasteless and crude, no matter how cheap and mindless the joke happens to be.  Even dirty jokes should require a certain degree of intelligence.  One good example is the Tori Spelling ghost/b**w-job scene. I can't go into detail about the gag without the IMDB staff kicking me out, but the joke was hilarious and original.  There was a certain amount of brains behind the comedy, in that instance.  ""American Pie"" is another good example.  There are some great, though crude and scatological, gags in that movie.  The reason why they worked was because there was intelligence behind the comedy.  Let's not forget, even comedy is an art.  With ""Scary Movie 2"" and other past movies like ""The Animal"" and ""The Ladies Man"" the writers tend to write things that are dirty, just because they're...dirty.  I know there are tons of young people without a brain, who can't handle humor that doesn't journey into that territory, but does that mean you should cater to them and lower all comic standards?  You'd think in 2001 writers and directors would've advanced, and learned to write things that are MORE effective comically, rather than slack off and write a comedy/softcore porno flick.  But it's the exact opposite.  And some of the best comics are still people like Abbott and Costello, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy. They're timeless classics.  No matter what age you are, you can crack up watching those old-time comics.  There are some great contemporary greats at comedy, but as a general comedians and comedy writers are becoming more and more lazy by the minute.Sorry to be preachy, but it's true.  I'm not totally badmouthing ""Scary Movie 2"" and still feel it's a very funny comedy.  I just wish there was more variety in the movie biz.  Give us more adult comedies!  And if you can't do that, write a teen comedy with SOME sense of maturity and intelligence!  If the teens boo and complain you're not giving them what they want--screw them!  It IS possible to be funny without being disgusting. I can just hear the comedy writers going, ""Really?""  Yes, it's true.  Get to work!My score:  7 (out of 10), but for the Wayans--try to be a bit more tasteful next time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Sequel,"Scary Movie 2 is a pretty damn funny sequel for anyone looking for an entertaining no brainer movie to spend a summer night at. The movie is in some places more better then the original, and thrives on the knowledge that most movies don't pay attention to continuality. Thus Cindy, Brenda, Ray, and Shorty all return, even though they all died in the first. NO mention of how this is possible is explained, but who cares, they make this movie, Espcially Brenda, whose facial expressions and dialogues are just laugh out loud funny. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cinematic vomit!,"This is easily the worst film I have ever seen. When I saw the first I was 15 and like most low to mid teen males I found it funny although looking back it really was a stupid waste of time. This sequel, however, is absolute tosh. The production values are unbelievably atrocious and not in a funny or camp way. Everything looks as though it was strapped together with duct-tape. The jokes are not funny in the slightest. The spoofs are unjustified and every single gag is just plain gross, opting for the lowest common denominator every time. Toilet humour is the name of the game and toilet humour is practically all you are going to get. I actually felt sorry for the actors in this film as I can not imagine how degrading and career destroying it must have been to appear on such unbridled trash. It is a sad tragedy that such films can make it to cinemas. Do not see this film, it physically hurts your eyes and brain to do so.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Even funnier than Scary Movie! (some spoilers),"I just got back from ""Scary Movie 2"" just about an hour ago and I'm still laughing from thinking about it.The cameos by James Woods, Veronica Cartwright, and Natasha Lyonne are funny enough just to pay for admission. But that's before the film starts to get funnier as the Wayans spoof ""The Haunting,"" ""Hannibal,"" ""Save the Last Dance,"" and ""Charlie's Angels."" The only (semi) downside to the movie was that the sex jokes in this were racier than the ones in the original film, especially the spoof of ""Titanic"" that ends very messily.But besides that, ""Scary Movie 2"" may probably be the most fun you will probably have at the movies this summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The weakest parody I've ever seen,"This movie is terrible.I struggle to understand how this got commissioned at all. The 'movie parody' parts are hardly parodies at all, and the scenes outside of this are weak, weak, weak on comedy.The very first movie parody is of The Exorcist and I'd love the writers to explain to me how they have expanded the original to make it funny.Whereas movies like Airplane or Naked Gun used killer humour, this goes for a simple 'pie in the face' or 'fart' scenes, some of which are unintelligible to anyone outside of American sub culture.The Wayan brothers certainly have a charmed life in Hollywood.'Airplane' started all of this - but at least that was funny, witty and had some sort of plot.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Monstrously Poor.,"A haunted house where a girl was once possessed by the devil is the locale in this unwanted sequel to the box office monster of 2000. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are the most notable teens in a parody-riddled bore that falls all to pieces after ""The Exorcist"" becomes the early headliner with James Woods (no idea why he is in this, but is admittedly the film's strongest asset) doing battle with the prince of darkness ala Max Von Sydow nearly 30 years earlier. Tiring and down-right sleep-inducing chapter in the highly successful series goes for gross-out and adult-oriented humor and falls flat on its smug face over and over again. Do not waste your time.

"Not scary at all, except perhaps Hanson.","Scary Movie 2 (2001) -Chris Elliot will never not be gross in my opinion and he's actually a bit much in this film playing a deformed and demented housekeeper/butler called Hanson.I nearly couldn't bring myself to watch 'Schitt's Creek' (2015-20) when I first started to watch it, because I was worried that he was going to be in it too much. Fortunately I stuck with it and it was brilliant. I was glad that I stuck with this film too, because it was almost as good as the first and like that one it parodied many great films, not just limiting itself to the exploitation of the Horror or Thriller genres either.In fact some of the most disgusting bits were not the horror references, like the mash potato scene.It wasn't quite as clever as the first instalment and it didn't have the more serious element that the mimicry of the 'Scream' (1996-) films had provided throughout the previous one.For me that was what had made that one so much fun, especially because I could easily recognise them, as a fan of that other franchise.Unlike 'Scary Movie' (2000), I didn't understand ALL of the references this time, because I don't watch a lot of horror films, but I didn't really need to that much, because the jokes were fairly obvious about their set up.There was a complete wipe of events with this film, so don't expect Shawn Wayans to have been in prison for his previous crimes or dead as he had been at the end of the last film in his reprised role of Ray or any other real references to that episode.Some of it was quite Scooby-Doo like and that added greatly to its charm.At the end of the day, it was all meant to tickle my laughing bone and it did just that.559.33/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Why is this constantly on Comedy Central?,"I keep tuning in at about the scene where the girls all tear their clothes off and change into different outfits. I think it was based on Charlies Angels or something.. Anyway, the end part that I have seen takes place in a generic dungeon, and there's a mad scientist doing something bad. People get electrocuted in that cartoony way where their hair gets blown black, and their faces and covered in soot. In one version (it is censored in a few different ways), there is a scene that shows the inside of one character's head, and there's a little dude getting stoned inside. I liked that moment, only because it was different than every other time I had seen the movie. This is something you tune into & keep watching because you have already seen every movie in HBO's current lineup. While the other Scary Movies parody contemporary horror films, this one seems aimed more at the ""Young Frankenstein""s of the movie world: Mel Brook's vision of horror. Perhaps because I am in no way a Mel Brooks fan (I've tried....hated them all...), this movie is not something I have ever enjoyed.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just not often enough.For a spoof to work, you need a target. Unfortunately, the Wayans brothers don't seem to know what they're aiming at here, other than everyone's crotch and their own feet.

funny but...,"As much as I appreciate comedies, this movie was a little too much in the sex department.  I was hoping for some more parodies rather than even more sex.  Any more and it should have been rated NC-17 or X.  As for the movie it had its moments, but it just wasn't all that great either.  I may have to watch it again to really say any more.  I did appreciate the cast, especially Chris Elliott, who is always funny, and Tori Spelling from Beverly Hills 90210 was great also, Kathleen Robertson also from 90210 was wonderfully cast as a temptress, and Tim Curry played a great part also. Overall this movie is worth watching but don't pay full price for it.  It's a much better movie at $5 NOT $7.  Also, don't go if you think there are too many people in the theater because all they will do is talk through it - a personal pet peeve of mine whether or not I like the movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Honest appraisal,"Do you appreciate a funny film but your not too bothered about plot or story line? Then don't fail to give this film a try. Ok, so it's not going to win any awards for script or acting, but how many comedies do? The acting is first rate from Chris Elliot as the family butler with a strange looking hand. Other performances are second rate, but that doesn't matter as the movie takes you on a rollercoaster ride of laughs. The down side to the movie is that it can't make up its mind if it wants to be a spoof (of the Excorcist movie) or a collection of comic skits. Maybe that has something to do with the non-exsistant script. All in all, its worth renting out, honest!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Easily a better party movie than the first one,"The first part of the series was very superficial, dumb and boring and only turned around movies such as ""Scream"" or ""I know what you did last summer"". The second movie is easily an improvement as the number of referenced movies is much bigger and even some of the cinema's classics are ridiculously honoured in this follow up. You may really laugh about some scenes if you have seen movies such as ""The Amityville Horror"", ""The exorcism of Emily Rose"", ""Rose Red"" and so on. There are not only childish teen horror movies but some really solid flicks that inspired this movie. Even some movies that have nothing to do with the horror genre such as ""Charlie's Angels"" are referenced in here. One can say that this movie is more diversified and surprising than the first one.The sexual jokes are still the majority of puns in this movie but they are not as present and childish as they were in the first one. Some of the highlights in here are for example the vomiting scenes during the exorcism, the insulting and weird parrot or the wheelchair rat race between a scientist and a ghost. The puns are still predictable and childish but more diversified and far more entertaining than the jokes of the first movie.On the negative side, there is only the fact that some chase scenes in the haunted castle are way too long and get quite boring after a while as well as the bad ending that indicates a lack of ideas and seems somewhat suddenly.Nevertheless, this movie should not be criticized too hard as it is once again a good party movie with some absurd jokes that is mostly well entertaining if you have some good friends and some good beer around.

One Thousand and One Razzies !,"Since the 1970s end, dirt-exploitation became in fashion through Hollywood's mainstream comedies, with a lot of producers enjoying manipulating the lowest human desires, with heavier and filthier load as time goes by. Till I came to a point where I believed that they deal with animals, not humans anymore. Naturally, (Scary Movie 2) isn't far from that point; it's nearly it!In 2000, the Wayans brother's (Scary Movie) was a hit. For good parody out of the 1990s horror / teen movies?, for the dirty comedy? For both? Anyway, in the sequel, their target was making a parody of many horror movies, TV shows, and TV ads, while immersing all of that in an ocean of filth!Filth, in this movie's makes' conscience, is comic. In my conscience, it isn't. It's only filth; purely, powerfully and torrentially made this time too. They sure thought ""Hey, if 50 filthy joke made millions, so how about 500!"". Not obligatorily a good move, but the producers must have LOVED it, giving the Wayans a mighty freehand to be as filthy as they could, to bring double the money that the original brought!But profitable or not, the movie is ultra awful. Watching it is like swimming in a dreadful sewer. And completing it assures nothing but the masochist side in every human. The real comic moments are rare coincidences; it's like running into sane persons in a nut house. Here, filth comes with many shapes. Chris Elliott's character does the biggest job of it. I guess the Wayans peed themselves out of laughing while making this, and we just were left to smell the conclusion.. of their peeing!Action movies are all about many action sequences. Toilet humor movies are all about (Scary movie 2). However, this movie is cheaper than porn, because it could have been more but ended up being a nightclub designed as a real, so busy and so dirty public toilet. I won't say comedy was never more loathsome; it's loathsomeness was never more loathsome. The problem is that not nominating it for even one Razzie Award as if refers to its being as a good comedy anyway. Well, a 1000 Razzies from my side then, and one Razzie for the Razzie foundation itself due to its shameful overlooking!(Scary Movie 2) reached a zenith concerning the dirt-exploitation. Being that extremely overfull produces 2 kinds of audiences; a die hard lovers, and a die hard haters. I'm with the second. My only consolation is that it has fewer farts than (Nutty Professor II: The Klumps - 2000)!Finally a note: 2001 witnessed a wave of comedies with various nastiness, like (Scary Movie 2), (American Pie 2), (Freddy Got Fingered), (Not Another Teen Movie), (Say It Isn't So), and (Shallow Hal), being not what 2001 is distinguished by, rather ashamed of! Though, after 10 years, I have to thank God. Because having in 2011 only (The Hangover 2), and (Bridesmaids), refers to how this sort of comedies has reduced through the years.

"All right movie, but NOWHERE near as funny as the first one","Scary Movie 2 basically takes the formula that worked for Scary Movie and exploits the hell out of it. The dialogue and story, although funny at times, does nothing except try to recreate the original. This movie is more of a raunchfest than a spoof. All the situations that made the first movie click with audiences (i.e. sex, drug use, handicapped people, racial issues) are reproduced here, but just not nearly as funny. Anna Faris plays well in this movie, but it would be nice to see her branch out into a project that doesn't involve the Wayans', and give her a chance to showcase her talent away from the genre of gross-out comedy. I give the Wayans' credit for making the attempt, but I can't help but feel that this movie was rushed in production to ride the coattails of the original film's success. Unfortunately, that production rush left little place for funny jokes and laughable situations, and only made room for mediocre screenwriting that was pounded out without thinking about whether it would be funny or not. A big fan of the first movie will somewhat enjoy themselves here, while a mild movie-goer will probably wonder what happened to their 8 bucks.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

What earns this movie a lower grade than the last is the fact that they're repeating all the same mistakes a second time.Let me put it this way. Glitter was better than this.

So embarrassed,Scary Movie 2 is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.  Scary Movie 1 was decent and at some points even funny. It also had good timing coming right after the barrage of teen horror flicks. The idea for the script of Scary Movie 2 probably came from installing hidden cameras in the living rooms of immature 12 year olds while their friends were over and seeing what they considered to be funny. (poop jokes are not funny) I was embarrassed at the thought that people may have actually seen me returning this to my video store.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror

No Sequels?,"Well, after 'Scary Movie' made so much money, it was inevitable that there would be a sequel. And it was inevitable that it wouldn't be as good.There were several problems with this movie, the largest of which is its lack of material. 'SM1' had five recent horror flicks (the three 'Scream' and the two 'I Know What...' films), the 'Sixth Sense', 'The Matrix', and I don't even know what else to draw on in its sharp, sly parody. Having used that for the first movie, the sequel is left with having to use things like 'The Exorcist' (can you say overdone?) and gross-out humour to make us ""laugh."" They even use their own gags (from 'SM1') but not as well.All in all, the movie isn't terrible. It just shows why Hollywood can, for lack of a better word, suck: rather than waiting a few years to make a sequel that could have been as good as the original, they rushed this one out to capitalise on the success of the first movie. In its own right, the movie would be O.K. As 'Scary Movie 2', the follow-up to one of the most hilarious and on-target parodies of all time, it sucks.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The joke is that it's not scary, the sad part is it's just barely a movie.","Much like Scream 2, the original was a huge success (if only financial) and everyone knew the inevitable sequel had to be bigger, bolder, and even better. In both cases they failed though Scream 2 is a decent follow-up and Scary Movie 2 is not decent. At all, really.Parody and satire are two forms of comedy that overlap well. Parody to be making fun of a particular film while satire targets an institution or ideal. The first Scream satirized the horror genre and the audience's awareness of formulaic conventions of cinema. Scream 2 to a lesser extent satirized the necessity of sequels while Scream 3 became a parody of itself. Scary Movie 2 attempts neither and, as Scary Movie 1 did with Scream, popularized the trend of referential humour. Do you remember this scene from that movie? Well here it is but dumber, no real punchline or set-up, just try and find the laughter yourself.The film is slower, looser, and plain meanders through what coherent plot there is. Whereas the adopted structure of Scream gave a natural flowing pace, the new targeted genre of the Old Dark House is so poorly accomplished. The two biggest strengths of films such as The Haunting and the House on Haunted Hill being suspense and atmosphere. Unless a complete absence of those two counts for parody then the writers are left with resorting to arbitrary current pop culture nods from Charlie's Angels to Nike commercials with little to no connective tissue between scenes.That Nike reference becomes a perfect summary of the Movie franchise from here onward. The riff of The Changeling into the basketball commercial is an almost clever subversion and yet they expect audiences to laugh continuously through every single character performing dribbling and passing until you forget what movie you're even watching. Monotony leads to false expectations of a punchline but there is none bar a character getting hit in the nuts before just moving on with the next scene.I give the original Scary Movie some credit. It is lazy in just taking Scream's formula almost scene for scene but at least moves with a steady pace and some sense of purpose. These sequels are the equivalent of a YouTube playlist of fan-made parodies of completely unrelated films.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Concentrated,"Ok,To give you an idea of how bad this movie is, I registered on IMDB for the specific purpose of warning the masses about this film.Firstly I don't object to drugs, sex, swearing, teen jokes, filth, bad acting or toilet humour. In fact I watched this movie hoping and expecting to see that sort of thing.Secondly I like bad movies, I watch movies that are so bad they are good. Scary movie one was original and most of the jokes worked I liked it.But this... this 'movie' is absolute unspeakably bad excrement. The likes of which leaves you feeling dizzy, sick and wondering how on earth something like this could ever go beyond an idea is someone's mind. How could people spend hard earnt cash funding it? You will spend the next few hours in shock thinking about that time you will never get back that was wasted on watching this. How can something be so utterly terrible?Have I put fear into you yet?The opening 'exorcist' scene is remotely amusing. But from then... nothing. Just a mishmash of the same 'gags' about a wheelchair ridden character, a 'baby' hand and the EXACT same gags as the first movie. It will jar you with its stop start, stop start nature. The uneasy feeling you've done your money will set in by the 10-minute mark.I've seen funerals that were funnier. What is the most worrying thought is that at some point, the creators must have just decided that they didn't care. The same as the actors and everyone else. They had a box full of smelly excrement and a wall. They chucked a couple of pieces and hoped they stuck and made it into a movie.It gets to the point where, as yet another scene shudders to an unfunny jarring halt, for no reason whatsoever shortie is suddenly sitting with his brain exposed. You are crying in sympathy with the creators at how desperate they were to get one tiny incy-wincy laugh, pretty please?... You just sit back and with what little hope you have left you just softly whisper: why? why? why?What was the movie about again? What tiny bit of plot is holding these various scenes together? Is this actually a movie or some unrelated unfunny scenes with the same actors. Why doesn't any one care? How will these actors ever get another job?Please, your life is important, you work hard for your rental dollar. Take my advice and don't subject yourself to this.

Just not funny,"This sorry sequel to the original spoof might have been okay if it had not had the problem of being unfunny. The first movie was okay, mixing gross-out gags and parody of the Scream movies, but this movie is simply a stinker. The jokes are obvious, and can be seen a mile away. The dialogue isn't funny (arguably the worst thing in the film is a foul-mouthed parrot that repeats expletives at everybody within earshot). The movie spoofs are bad (why anyone would want to send up garbage like the Haunting and Charlie's Angels is beyond me). When the jokes were being doled out at a surprisingly clunky pace, I found myself staring blankly at the screen instead of laughing.The gross out gags in the film are not funny, just nauseating, and most can be sniffed out very quickly (unlike the bathroom scene in the original, which was a shocker to everybody). Gross out gags can definitely be very funny, as in There's Something About Mary or American Pie. But here the writers (for lack of a better term) want us to laugh at someone sitting on a toilet just because its gross. It doesn't work that way.The fact that this film makes the original look like a comedy classic just about sums it up. When I saw the original, I was surprised to hear audience members laughing at even the worst jokes. In Scary Movie 2, though, the audience didn't go for it. I heard lots of courtesy laughs and nervous laughter, like some felt they had to laugh because the film was billed as a comedy. Aside from one dinner scene featuring Chris Elliot there are no scenes that inspire raucous laughter, like a good comedy should. If you're looking for a good time, look elsewhere.

The exorcist opening with James Woods was outstanding. The entire cast is impressive. It's hard not to love Tim Curry and Tori Spelling was a fun addition as well.

Short and not really funny.,"Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness (81 minutes - including end credits, so roughly 76 minutes of actual film).  But what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed.The gags are quick and sometimes not even funny.  The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film.  Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie's Angels, which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it.Today's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s' Poltergeist, et. al.Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together, making the spoofs more enjoyable.One thing though, the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel).

The complete anti-thesis of what the first was all about,"Scary Movie was a brilliant, hilarious, and intelligent satire of scary movies.  It poked fun at Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Nightmare On Elm Street and so on, and it did it with compassion and care.  The writers really did their homework and thus we were presented with a film that not only was entertaining and funny, but it was smart and witty.  You could infinitely count the number of movie references in the film and and some of them were so subtle that it took you a moment or two to realize that they were making fun of whatever movie it was making fun of.  This cheap ersatz of a film, this charlatan, this sheep in wolves clothing is not only a terrible film, it does a terrible injustice to all that the first one stood for.  It angers me when films like this are made as irresponsibly as this one was because it suckered me into the theater based on memories of last year.  I actually put The Wayans and Kevin Williamson ( creator of the Scream franchise ) in the same category after Scary Movie.  Now, my perception of the Wayans is that they are all one hit wonders.Scary Movie 2 has one big problem, and that is they decided to make fun of movies that weren't as iconoclastic as the ones they made fun of in the first one.  When you are satirizing films like The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, you alienate perhaps your core audience that didn't really like those movies all that much in the first place.  There were some clever references to Amityville Horror and The Exorcist at the beginning and those were the best jabs in the whole film, but what about the rest of this debacle?  Why do I want to watch The Haunting and Hollow Man all over again when I didn't enjoy it in the first place?  There are many horror fans out there and this film is not commensurate with the abilities that the Wayans showed in the first one.  There are only so many times you can get by with fart, puke, pee, poo and sex jokes before you enervate your audience.  I was enervated after the first fifteen minutes.  I kept waiting for it to get better.  But it never did.  For every reference I could pick out and comprehend, there were long, painful stretches of film when I just didn't understand what they were trying to say or do.  What was the point of Chris Elliot's character?  Was he an amalgamation of every creepy character that has ever appeared in a haunted house film?  Was he a pastiche of butlers or chambermaids from haunted house Hammer films?  What was he?  I have seen a lot of horror films in my day but never have I been privy to a more repulsive and useless character than him.  He just wasn't needed, and if he was, then how about giving him more to go on than just a small and deformed appendage?To give a little credit, as I said, the beginning with James Woods and the Amityville/Exorcist scene was clever and there is one brilliant homage/satire that starts with the bouncing ball from The Changeling that turns into a wonderfully directed spinoff of the Nike basketball commercial. I was very impressed and entertained for those two minutes.  But then for that clever scene, there are dozens of others that go absolutely nowhere. There is another embarrassing scene with Tori Spelling spouting off sexual profanities to an invisible miscreant that has his way with her against a wall that is supposed to be a send up of A Nightmare On Elm Street when Tina is attacked by an invisible Freddy Krueger.  It is horribly done in here and there is no payoff.Back in the 10th century, the charlatan and the mounteback, two unsavory types, used to sell bogus panaceas, cure-alls, at bargain prices.  They called this their ""nostrum"", meaning literally, ""our remedy.""  Well my nostrum for this foul-stenched excuse for a film is for the Wayans to put a little more effort into the writing and maybe cut down from seven writers to two.  This way ideas don't mesh and egos don't get bruised.  As it stands this is one of the worst films I have seen this year and seeing how good the first one was, they should be ashamed of this deplorable, egregious, vapid and totally unnecessary film that they have given to us.  And that is a shame.1.5 out of 10- The 1.5 being for the clever beginning and the Nike/Changeling send off.  The rest of the movie receives a 0.  Instead of making fun of films that are here today and forgotten tomorrow, why not take on the greats like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Cujo, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre?  There is plenty of great material out there, so why go after films that people disliked?  It doesn't make much sense.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Actually, out of the 4 movies that came out as of now, it by far my favorite.It has a certain story that it follows through the movie. It has some organization, and you can see that some thought has been put into the script. The entire plot and characters are much more tied together.The others (I am primarily talking about part 4) just seem like a disorganized pile of spoofs and jokes. You could reedit and reorganize the movie and it would be the same. I have to say that part 4 is my least favorite part. 3/10 for part 4.7/10 for part 2",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Way too rushed,"Given that ""Scary Movie"" was a huge hit, I can understand the studio wanted to strike while the iron was hot. This sequel came out less than a year after the original, they really wanted to make sure the audience hadn't forgotten the first one yet. Sadly, the time pressure is very apparent. This whole movie just seems very unfinished, lots of scenes look like blueprints of something that could potentially be funny. Take the scenes with the handicapped character for instance, those had so much more potential than they actually showed. Other scenes however are just plain lazy and repetitive. Yeah, Shorty still smokes weed, the gay guy is still gay, Cindy is still ditzy and Brenda is still loud. Nothing new or creative is done with any of these characteristics, the actors just routinely reprise their stereotypes wondering when they're finally going to get a funny line. At 83 minutes, this movie is really quite short, but it's still packed with needless filler material and jokes that just appear to be rejected material from the first one. Very disappointing flick.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
agony....,"Have you ever seen a film so bad, so bland, so boring that you wish a hitman would creep into the theater and shoot you? SCARY MOVIE 2 is just such a film! It is hard to believe it took 7 writers to come up with this ""script"". It seems like they just wrote an outline, went to the set, and then tried to figure out what to pad out the running time with. The best scenes in this film would be the horrid outtake footage from any other comedy. From the dead silence in the theater, you'd think they were watching Platoon! Dirty jokes can be funny but they must be good natured with a wink to the crowd. Shame on everyone involved in this, especially Keenan Ivory Wayans!

A parody it is not.,"After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes.  Though i guess not. If the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch.  With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again.  Though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level.  Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it.  Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene.  Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around.  It doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs.  It's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"More ""Scary"" Bad Taste","They said no sequel.  They lied!  And so we have ""Scary Movie 2.""  Keenen Ivory Wayans and kin come back with another spoof of the horror genre.

But their performances indicate that the director was looking for clich√©s and slightly stilted delivery as part of the humor. Having said that, this movie may offer one of Tori Spelling's best career performances.These kinds of movies seem to be a hit with teenagers and college kids, and I always try to rekindle my youth by watching them.

The monster is gonna kill us...,"Possibly the best of the entire ""Scary Movie"" franchise, in my opinion of course. And the reason for this is that the laughs are more bountiful and sincere throughout the course of this movie, and the spoofs are more thoroughly executed.But a big portion of the credit should also go to the fabulous cast, both returning cast members but also new ones on the cast list. Because people were really doing good jobs with their given roles and characters throughout the course of ""Scary Movie 2"".True to the spirit of the first movie, and the rest of the movies essentially, this is a hilarious spoof movie which has no restraints and respects no boundaries. As such, then there are many really funny scenes throughout the movie, and if you enjoy a good spoof movie that pokes fun at a lot of other movies, then ""Scary Movie 2"" is definitely well worth watching.Compared to the first ""Scary Movie"" installment, then this 2001 sequel offers more of a storyline, better spoofs, better effects and and all-round better cast. All in all, a more enjoyable movie experience. And I guess I enjoy this sequel more because the spoofs are based on some more impressive horror movies, compared to what was seen in the first ""Scary Movie"".Even the introduction scene which spoofed ""The Exorcist"" is enough in itself to make it worthwhile to sit down and watch ""Scary Movie 2"". That really was a great way to start off the movie.I am rating ""Scary Movie 2"" six out of ten stars. If you enjoy comedies, then ""Scary Movie 2"" is well-worth sitting down to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"With the Exception of Elliot's Hilarious Performance, this Movie Is Drivel","I rarely walk out of a movie before it ends.  I feel that I owe something to the cast and crew to sit through the results of their hard work.  But I left Scary Movie 2 after the first hour.  Simply put, there was no reason to stay until the end.  I had guessed every scene up to the point that I left, so I just imagined a dull, uninspiring ending and got popcorn instead.  The movie was lazy, not scary and not funny.  Essentially, Scary Movie 2 exists to capitalize on it's predecessor's name and make a lot of money off of teenagers (and me).  I enjoyed the original Scary Movie.  While I admit that it was lowbrow movie fun, it was hilarious.  The performances were funny. The writing was clever and satirical.  It was worth my money.  I feel that the makers of Scary Movie 2 owe me money now.  To think that I actually gave up an hour of my life for this worthless chatter angers me.  I will, however, say this about one of the actors . . . Chris Elliot (previously in Cabin Boy, There's Something About Mary, and the Doritos commercial) is hilarious as the disgusting misfit butler Hanson.  If this movie is ever on HBO, try to watch Chris' scenes.  He really is a comic talent.  I suspect most of his dialog was improvised, since it contrasted so starkly to the rest of this depressed film.  Scary Movie 2 is drivel.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Is it odd to like this movie better than the first?,"Normally comedy sequels aren't exactly the better movies but in this case I feel that this is a much better movie than its predecessor ""Scary Movie"" from 2000.What makes this movie better is its comedy. ""Scary Movie"" was still in lots of parts a very lame movie. Of course ""Scary Movie 2"" also does has its lame moments in it but overall the humor seemed more structured and better written and executed this time. Not to call this movie very mature though.Its story also progressed better. This time there actually was somewhat a main plot-line and the many movies that it spoofs in this one are better fitted in into the story. The first movie was simply being a spoof for the sake of being one. It makes this sequel a bit more pleasant to follow. Strangely enough this is a movie that got made under pressure from the big studios that wanted to cash in quickly one year already after the success of the first movie. It's strange because this movie its end result seems far better, as does its story.The characters also work out better in this one. Most of the actors from the first movie reprise their roles in this one again, so the movie doesn't has to waste a lot of time of introducing them again to the viewers. This movie however also has some more big names in it this time, with some big actors appearing in some small roles, such as James Woods and Tim Curry, who both did a hilarious job.Better humor, better story, better characters.

"Uninspired, worthless ""comedy""","This original film was 88 minutes of the grossest, nastiest toilet humor with enough on-screen gags to warrant an NC-17 rating.  And yet, it was an enjoyable film for the same reason that South Park: Bigger Loner, and Uncut is an enjoyable film- they are both so shockingly vulgar and shamelessly stupid that they become something greater than toilet humor.  However, the thing about shocking people is you can't shock them with the same things twice.  The creators of South Park knew enough not to make a sequel.  After just seeing Scary Movie 2, I wish the Wayans's Brothers would take a cue from them.The movie does not make any attempt to be original; it does not make any attempt to shock us; in fact, we wonder if any effort as put into this at all.  I can clearly see the writers, pressed for time and ideas, piecing together a script out of the worst moments of Scary Movie 2.The original spoofed the tired and worn slasher film formula- particularly Scream.  This one spoofs the equally tired ad worn formula of haunted houses.  There are some smart pokes at Mission Impossible 2 and Charley's Angels; Chris Elliot and James Woods have funny cameos as a caretaker and an exorcist, respectively; and the film's most brilliant gag: a foul-mouthed parrot are the few examples of Scary Movie 2's originality.  Most of the film repeats the same jokes from the original, or includes new ones that make the audience groan when they should laugh.The jokes are painfully unfunny and dangerously overplayed.  And the movie as a familiar feeling- like we've seen the exact same movie before.  Without its shock value, this is mere toilet humor*1/2 out of ****",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Why was this movie made?,"I saw the first Scary Movie, and I thought it was a hilarious satire on those stupid Scream movies.  While it wasn't brilliant--it basically borrowed the plot from Scream--it was pretty entertaining.  This movie, however, was not.  The only tidbits that I found funny were carried over from the first movie. Most of the jokes were over-the-top bathroom humor or constant sex jokes.  The characters weren't developed at all which added a great deal of confusion to the movie.  I wasn't exactly sure why Chris Elliot's character was in the movie.  All I know is that he sounded a lot like a Southern Cartman.  I think he was supposed to be the villian, but the movie left out exactly why he was the villian.  There was also some major continuity problems that were so bad that they were insulting to the audience's intelligence.

"Funny, fun nonsense","Scary Movie 2 directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, is a satire comedy film parodying classic horror films from over the years. Starring Anna Faris as Cindy, our protagonist along with an ensemble of comedic actors.My main take in this film is to not take it seriously, and when you don't, it can actually be a pretty good ride. The thing about satire comedy is the sky's the limit with the options to make a good joke. Plus this was made at a time where comedy had more free will and was open to explore topics which today wouldn't be accepted or appropriate.Obviously, this film has numerous flaws. If you take a look at this film objectively, by parameters of good cinema, it lacks a basic structure along with other problems. Plot development has little to no value, yet this film is barely 80 minutes so not really a lot of time to really have a strong story. This would be better off as a series of sketches from a late show.Nevertheless, for what this film is meant to be, I really enjoyed it. I rewatched it many times over the years and am always left with a good laugh.

""Scary Movie 2"" was a silly sequel, just like the original movie. The plot of the movie was kinda interesting and it was kinda different than the original movie. The storyline wasn't very well written, it was very silly and not interesting, at all. The characters weren't very interesting, nor well-developed and they were all very annoying. The filming location of the movie was just a big old haunted mansion. Sadly, there weren't any death scenes on that movie and most chase scenes were really silly. Moreover, it wasn't as funny as the original movie and most jokes were really sexist and racist. The ending scene was definitely expected, but it was kinda boring.

A Worthy Sequel,"Usually when greeted with a sequel to a movie that was great, I cringe. This was the case with Scary Movie 2.  From what I saw of the previews I figured that it would be a ton of vulgar jokes aimed at spoofing more movies.  I was pleasantly suprised.  The jokes were great, although I was right about the vulgarity.  The movie was short, but it was one great moment after another.  I won't go into detail about the plot summary, because then anyone reading this would go into the movie and would not get the same effect as me.  Scary Movie 2 is definitely worth seeing, and the trailer for American Pie 2 was also hilarious, so it's like you'll get double your money's worth of laughs, something not happening too often in movies lately.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
How did James Woods end up in this mess?,"That was the only question I was asking myself after watching Scary Movie 2. This movie is bad, VERY BAD. It rarely has jokes that are funny and the shock value is overdone and comes off as desperate. James Woods is the only good actor in the movie and he's also bad in it, he does have the only really funny line in the movie though. He walks into the room with The Exorcist girl, she spins her head around and he takes one look and says ""F**k this!"" And walks out, I actually laughed at that part. The rest of the humor is just horribly crude and rarely funny. The movie is just one big spoof on many different movies done very poorly. Both of these traits can be very good if done correctly, crude humor is funny in the hands of the Farrelly brothers. Spoofs are funny in the hands of David Zucker. But unfortunatly neither is funny in the hands of the Wayans brothers.I can't recommend this movie to anyone except for the most immensely immature and perverted.

S**te...,"This was one awful movie. The problem I find with it is that it seems more like a series of comic sketches than a complete film. Whether you're making The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Hot Shots or Dude, where's my car?...the one crucial element you require is STRUCTURE, and this film had none. It's as if they came up with all the sketches; Titanic, that Basketball ad, etc. then just filled in the gaps.I will give it one plus - the Exorcist skit was great - I nearly sh*t myself laughing. To be honest, had I left the cinema after that scene, I wouldn't have cared so much about paying hard-earned cash to watch ten minutes of a movie, but sadly - I stayed - and forced myself to endure the rest of the crap in it.But then again when it takes 10 writers or so to write a script, you're asking for trouble...and also a sh*t script.",,Anonymous,Horror

Twice ain't so bad...,"Now if you were a fan of the first movie, as I actually was not... but rather a pawn to the hype, this might be just what you are looking for. Now, I say this thinking that the first time around, I did not know what to expect in a Wayans' brothers horror/comedy. But, in needing a good laugh today, I found that this was just the movie to see. Now all the jokes that they are trying to get laughs from won't, but what movies really hit with that kind of accuracy. It seems that yes, the toilet bowl mentality is used here, but to some effect and if you choose to see this movie... I am sure that if these kind of gags are your cup o' tea, then you will be rolling in the aisles. It was kind of fun to see a couple of the 90210 vets in this film, as the two ladies looked beautiful and apparently the Wayans brothers did find sexy outfits that they had not already worn on that show. On a business note, this movie I am sure will not succeed to the heights of its predecessor, but with the nickel and dime budget that I am sure that this production company has, this movie will make back it's money in spades. A funny, average written slapstick with a semblance of a plot with sight gags and vomit jokes for everyone to enjoy... once again, if this is your thing.

The end of civilization as we know it.,"If the first movie wasn't bad enough, the sequel only confirms that we are living in the declining years of a decadent society with a blinded sense of esthetics, an amoral soul and the intelligence of club moss. YES, I know this movie is parody, but parody can be funny, witty, and sophisticated without resorting to crass vulgarity and filth for its own sake. This film only proves that Hollywood continues to cater to the lowest common (very common!) denominator (or is it that Hollywood continues to define the lowest common denominator?) and that the vast majority of movie going audiences have the brains of a degenerate ferret. I am no prude. Vulgarity and shock value have their place. They should be the spices and seasonings on the entree, not the entree itself. This piece of work is a hollow mockery of what real parody should be and only moves us that much closer to the total collapse of social responsibility.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as fulfilling as the first one, but still good","Instead of playing off of the teen horror flicks, the Wayans brothers decided to base it on older horror/thriller movies, such as ""Psycho,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and ""Poltergeist,"" while throwing in things from movies like ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Mission Impossible 2."" Complete it by tying everything together with the Wayans Brand toilet humor (some of it recycled from ""Scary Movie"" and even ""Don't be a Menace in South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,"" some of it new), and you have Scary Movie 2.After the initial sequence, with James Woods and Andy Richter as the Priest and his Assistant, trying to exorcise Natasha Lyonne's character (the possessed Jasonia Voorhees), the movie seems to get lost for about a half hour.  All of the sudden it gets good again, when the action starts up (complete with the toilet humor).The only thing I am curious about is why we heard about Marlon Brando being in the sequel.  But surprisingly, he is nowhere to be found.I think this movie was rushed into the theatres, and if it wasn't, the movie might have lived up to its predecessor, as they would have had more time to hash out plot points that really didn't work in it.

Maybe they felt that with the first one they went to far, but just the jokes in this one felt like they were, restricted, and that they were holding back the punches.Then there is the fact that you can easily tell how this movie was rushed. The writing was bad, and at many points in the movie, should have been...funny.  Like there would be long stretches where nothing was funny, and that it was trying to move like a regular movie would.Also, this movie is called Scary Movie.  It is supposed to be a spoof of Horror movies.  That is what one would believe, correct.  Well, then why did it spoof ""Cats and Dogs"", ""Charlies Angels"", and other such movies more than horror movies.  Sure it had the basic story of The Haunting, which I was trying to remember that bad movie enough as it were, as well as having a little Exorcist and What Lies Beneath.

"NO SEQUEL, WE WERE PROMISED!  ALAS....","Okay, I was bored last saturday and wanted to see a movie.  I was in the mood for a cheap laugh, so I went and saw this one.  Whoah, is it bad. It's not as though I were expecting much, and indeed the first fifteen or so minutes were pretty funny, but after that it was one tiresome trip.  A few of the actors were good, especially the girl who got knifed to death in the movie theatre in the first one, but somebody in Hollywood needs to tell the Wayans clan that not EVERY member of their family has the talent to be in a film.  Painfully obvious. Speaking of acting, Tori Spelling was in this one.  Normally I give her more credit than the average moviegoing critic, but she was terrible.  She has an outrageous scene that could've been the film's funniest, if she'd displayed any of the comic timing she had in ""Trick"".  Also, the director didn't allow her much, so it's not entirely her fault.  I don't normally show compassion for one of Hollywood's privelidged children, but if there was ever an actress who had to PROVE herself worthy, Tori's the one.  Keep trying, Tori. I support you. To sum up this movie, potty humor (bowel movements, body abnormalities, maturbation, vomit, kinky sex), not to mention jibes at gays and human deformities (I know someone with a deformed hand, IT'S NOT AMUSING, JUST CRUEL!) does not a funny movie make.

As it turns out, not much.  (*no spoilers*)So these kids are put in a haunted house for a class.  Okay.  After that, the plot goes no where.  It is never explained WHY they are there--the beginning is simply followed by random puns and gross humor.  The jokes were good for a quick laugh, but they weren't much when you thought about it later.  And I found myself revisiting the same jokes that were used in the first Scary Movie far too frequently.  The fact that the cast is nearly the same didn't help.I'll give them one thing--the opening sequence was pretty funny.  There were new actors involved (James Woods, Natasha Lyonne, etc.), and some great spoofs on the Exorcist.  But when it came right down to it, the movie lacked a good plot, decent actors (Tori Spelling?  come on), and most of all, a healthy amount of humor for what was advertised.

What was once fresh is now old and tired,"* out of (****)It was inevitable. A sequel to a financial succession that jump-started the spoof genre back in 2000. However, with disappointing box office revenues and harsh criticism, it goes to show many people did not like ""Scary Movie 2"". I am not one of those people. I HATED it. The opening for ""Scary Movie 2"" starts with a bang and is just very loud and eccentric, but with reasonable intentions. From there, it gradually goes downhill and by the third act, you just want to be done with this movie. The fact that the IMDb average score is 4.8, Rotten Tomatoes has it a dead 15%, and Metacritic has it at a 29% should really tell you something.First off, the performers are just tried and annoying to say the least. In the original, they were fun, zany characters that just had something that clicked with the audience. Not in here. Furthermore, the story just goes nowhere. Going from scary movies to a random basketball showdown to a Charlie's Angels fight, it's all just sloppy and feels like the filmmakers just throw a bunch of random bologna and saw what could stick. The verdict is none. Hey, at least the first had a plot, albeit a shallow one, that you could easily follow and it would actually be a story.To top it off, when your comedy falls dead flat on its face when it comes to jokes, then you know you did something wrong. The jokes are gross, in-your-face, and top each other in terms of raunchiness, but they are tired, dead, and truly redundant. I'll use a quote from critic Michael Phillips. You won't hear crickets in the audience. You'll hear dead crickets.And lastly, this movie is just boring. While the original was not a good movie, it at least held my interest. This was just such a drag.All in all, ""Scary Movie 2"" just doesn't miss the mark, it misses the target completely. They can throw all the gross-out gags and random penises at the screen, but I could care less. I need a fresh, hot script and some good performers to make the movie. If you fail on those accounts, your movie fails. What was once fresh and hip, is now just old, tired, and begs the question, ""why?"". I think the filmmakers got the title right this time.

I'll say one positive thing for them though and that's that they give performances that a dire and crude comedy like this deserves , either that or they're just a fairly poor cast .

"Awesome opening, decent movie","The second movie in the ""Scary Movie"" series is, in my opinion, the weakest overall. That doesn't mean that it isn't without its merits, but the whole thing seems kind of like it was slapped together over a weekend. Many of the jokes just don't work, but there are enough side-splittingly funny bits to make it all worthwhile.This movie opens with an absolutely brilliant parody of ""The Exorcist"". It starts with the singalong scene with Andy Richter as Father Harris behind the piano. ""You guys know this one?"" he asks, and then proceeds to play the opening bars of -- get ready -- ""Shake Ya Ass"". Megan Voorhees (played by Natasha Lyonne) comes down the stairs and starts peeing on the floor, interrupting the singalong. Her mother treats her like a dog! This segues into the more obvious parody of the movie with Father McFeeley (James Woods) coming in to perform the exorcism with Father Harris (""F--- this!"" McFeeley says when he first encounters the possessed girl). It's classic.Then the movie kind of dries up. The basic story is a parody of ""The Haunting"", a movie that was so bad that parody seems kind of unnecessary. It centers around a bunch of college kids going on an overnight trip to Hill House, ostensibly to study their sleep disorders but actually so the professor (Tim Curry) can summon the ghosts in the house. The only real connection with the first is found here, as some of the kids were picked because of their prior traumatic experiences (which they encountered in the first movie).Honestly, I thought the whole thing kind of rambled when I first saw it, and there were some eye-rollingly dumb jokes. But there were also a lot of very funny jokes and the cast (including Anna Faris, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, and the incredible Regina Hall from the original, mixed with vets Chris Elliot, David Cross, and Curry, Woods, and Richter) was very good; it was the writing that suffered more than anything. That, and the sloppy production values, but I guess that's nitpicking with a movie like this. Also, I didn't think the ending was very satisfying. Still, Brenda (Hall) and Cindy (Faris) messing with the ""scary"" skeleton that tries to terrorize them (""This is a skeleton -- this is bones! Would you run from Calista Flockhart?"" Brenda chides Cindy when they run into each other); Hanson (Elliot) and Dwight (Cross) arguing; and Cindy fighting a cat ""Raging Bull""-style were just some of the few very funny moments found in this movie.This may not seem like a glowing review, but I actually did like this movie and recommend it if you're into the spoof genre. Just don't expect ""Airplane!"" or even the first ""Scary Movie"" when you see it. On the bright side, it ain't ""Spy Hard"" either.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Two down, two to go.","Once again, the Wayans brothers have trawled the murkiest depths of toilet humour and smut to put together another crude collection of puerile fart, tit, willy and sex gags, loosely tied together by a scrappy horror-based script that parodies everything from genre classics (The Exorcist) to modern clunkers (The Haunting remake), as well as unrelated big-budget blockbusters such as Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission Impossible 2.As with the first film, there has clearly been zero attempt at quality control in the gag department, with even the most utterly moronic and totally cringe-worthy of jokes making it into the final film (there were only two things about Scary Movie 2 that I would describe as genuinely laugh-out-loud funny: the opening scene featuring James Woods and Chris Elliott's inspired performance as Hanson, a crazy caretaker with a withered hand. Still, that's two more than the original, so I guess this silly sequel could actually be considered an improvement!).Thankfully, the charms of a pre-blonde, pre-surgery Anna Faris and the ample curves of busty babe Kathleen Robertson provide just about enough impetus for guys to persevere to the end (the girls stripping to their underwear is worth the wait); female viewers aren't catered for in the same manner (unless you count Shawn Wayans posing semi-naked with his todger tucked between his legs‚Äîeeek!).3.5 out of 10 (marginally more than I gave the first film), but not good enough for me to round it up to a 4.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

By seeing this movie, YOU make Hollywood make them.  I work there.  I know.You vote with your dollars, not your opinions.  Studios don't care what you think, they just care if you pay.  So, if the movie is bad, in the middle, ASK FOR YOUR MONEY BACK.  Many theaters will actually refund the money, or at least exchange your ticket for another movie.I have done this twice.  The Mod Squad was so boring I asked for my money back.  They agreed and gave it to me!  Another film I can't even recall was so bad, I asked to exchange my ticket for a film that was just about to start.  I didn't just theater hop, because then the wrong movie gets credit. I asked them to void my ticket and give me a new one for the new movie. They did it, gladly.Why would they do this you ask?  How much a theater pays to show the movie is determined AFTER the movie has been showing for a few weeks.  Sounds strange, I know, but theaters pay the bigger bucks only when they earn the bigger bucks.  If you ask for a refund, this gives them ammo against the studios, and the studios listen!But if you just complain here, well, the studios don't really care.  Word of mouth is not expected on these movies.  It's a big first weekend, a mediocre second weekend, one good foreign weekend, and then to video.

From there ""funny"" hyjinks ensure. The film is worth a watch for people who have absolutely nothing else to watch or just want to see an OK scary movie spoof.Overall, the film is bad but with a few exceptions which at times is quite clever (Many jokes were ruined by swearing though). I rate this film 49%.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I was disappointed, but more in the audience","Scary Movie 2 is not a good movie in the sense of being a film scholar an constantly analyzing everything. It is the type of movie where you just go to have fun. I had a good time during it, but it wasn't until I got home that realized it wasn't very good. I though the references to other films were really funny, but I was sitting in an audience predominantly filled with people who knew nothing about the films being spoofed and just laughed when Marlon Wayans said something in a high voice. It spoofed films like Hannibal, What Lies Beneath, Hollow Man, but I and a few friends of mine were the only ones who found them funny. It reminded me of the ending to the film's predecessor, Scary Movie, that ended with a spoof on Usual Suspects that was hilarious.  Scary Movie 1 is much better, but Scary Movie 2 is funny because of David Cross and Chris Elliot. I love the shriveled hand gag. If you are not looking to think for (It felt like the movie was about an hour long) however long the movie was, then go see it. It has a few laughs",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a waste,"I just got back from viewing what is arguably one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Don't get me wrong--I was a huge fan of the original installment. The parodies of pop culture movies and its ""we don't take ourselves seriously"" atmosphere were a welcome change and struck with great results. The sequel, although it admirably attempts to separate itself from the first one, would've been better off sticking with the old formula. First off, the new characters were incredibly mundane and unentertaining. Tori Spelling's role as a ditz was terrible. Getting it on with a ghost was absolutely pathetic. Some of the bathroom humor which is something I normally don't mind, was used to such extremes that the first 5 minutes of the movie ruined any chance of it getting off the ground. The rest feels so rushed, and it seems that no thought was put into the script. The writers tried to create some new material rather than making fun of current movies(I won't spoil the ""story"" for ya), but everything sounded insanely immature and insulting. Throwing ideas in a hat and randomly picking one was the name of the game here and it got ugly. Speaking of parodies, the few redeeming parts, such as the Nike basketball commercial rip-off and the scenes with the parrot were sufficient to prevent this film from making an all-time worst movie list, but that's hardly a compliment. Curiosity is going to get the best of many, but I'm giving it my highest recommendation to avoid at all costs.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well, don't expect too much of sequels.","The most glaring problem with Scary Movie 2 is that it attempts to satire material so awful as not to warrant discussion, let alone mockery. However, the cinematography in the Exorcist scenes is quite good, and there are several hilarious moments.  Close attention to the story line isn't the most important thing for this type of film, but this time it's completely ignored so often as to make the film incoherent.  Another major problem is that they try to reference every commercial and recent mediocre film they can think of.  Be more selective, guys, as in the first one.The first movie was much funnier than this one, but there are a few moments here.  However, many of the jokes are disgusting without the context to make them humorous, and others are just plain bizarre.  Perhaps the most appropriate thing to do is to appropriate Roger Ebert's response to Freddy Got Fingered.  The film may someday be seen as a masterpiece of surrealism. Nonetheless, it is not a very funny movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointing Follow Up to a Good Movie,"I was very disappointed by this movie.  I thought that ""Scary Movie"" although not a great movie was very good and funny.  ""Scary Movie 2"" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid.The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great.Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all.  But bad comedy is still bad comedy.Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes.  Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again.  For example, the talking bird.  Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying.  The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie.  For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in ""Scary Movie"" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her.  But this time around it was out of place and not funny.The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around.  The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film.  The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor.  That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
they just didn't care,"The first one was a disposable but funny comedy that you laughed hard at and then threw away when you were done. The second one should have been thrown away before it went into production. Why? They didn't care. The introduction parody of the Exorcist approaches the level of comedy of the original and shows how funny James Woods can be but after that it goes downhill real fast. Which leads me to wonder if they started out with as much enthusiasm as the first, but got lazy and decided just to slap something together. And why not, it seems slapped together from left over ideas they probably wrote over one weekend and contains zero of the care of attacking all the little details of horror movies. I mean,  they even reuse gimmicks from the first one that don't even work in the  context, they were so dry for ideas. Huge disappointment.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Liked the first, but this was excruciatingly bad.","I admit, I liked the first one. It had some clever jokes, and funny movie spoofs. But this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've haven't been this tempted to walk out of a theatre since I saw Batman & Robin. It was like the Wayans took all of the gross-out gags from the first one, and decided to make the sequel completely based around that. This time around, the cast is in a haunted house spoof, that consists of so many unfunny jokes, that you throw your arms up in the air saying ""what were they thinking?"". The humor in this movie is extremely desperate and contrived; even going as far as to spoof movies that aren't even horror movies. As my local newspaper said, Chris Elliot ""milked out every scene as much as he could without garnering a single laugh"". The only funny part of the movie was the Exorcist spoof (especially the party scene with Andy Richter playing the piano). After that, your waiting for the movie to be funny, until the halfway point when you just give up. For the remainder, your subjected to an annoying parrot that gets old really fast, Chris Elliots deformed hand, Anna Farris's very Jan Brady like disposition, recycled ejaculation jokes, and other very redundant examples of toilet humor. Don't get me wrong; I think toilet humor can be funny if it's done well. But this was just ridiculous. Worst movie this summer.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just a 90 minute series of gross out gags,"What makes movies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" work so well is that despite all the laughs, they're actually coherent. All this movie is is 90 straight minutes of just awful, rejected SNL skits all strung together with a minimal plot to create a movie for the late high school crowd to go see on a Friday night. It is also apparent that when they run out of dialogue (which is often) they just insert a bodily fluid gag of some sort. And the less material they have to work with, the more liters of fluid they weave into the plot. It's lazy, it's disgusting, and it isn't funny. It reminds me of that comedian open mic night who doesn't tell jokes but just curses the whole time and raises his voice. Volume isn't comedy. Vulgarity isn't ""jokes.""This is the movie that you see on one of the higher number HBO's and you pause on it for two minutes because you understand a joke is coming really fast so you might as well squeeze in one, and then it finally arrives, and you change the channel with an eye roll, disgusted with yourself over the fact that you allowed yourself to watch such a pathetic display of entertainment... And then you really start to question your choices in life that you can just choose to watch somethings so boring and lifeless.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not even funny unlike the original.,"Here we go again ladies and gentlemen.When ""Scary Movie"" came out in theaters in the late summer of 2000, audience members found themselves peeing in their pants as they laughed their butts off in some of the funniest scenes in a parody. The original movie was a parody of the film Scream along with every other popular horror movie both slasher/non-slasher. Some moments from the genitals to the pubic hair might have gagged some audience members, but no matter, the film itself was funny making Anna Faris a star before she would later appear in the entire Scary Movie series prior to making a serious cameo in Brokeback Mountain.Scary Movie 2 crossed out the ""No sequels"" slogan since more movies needed to come.Keenan Ivory Waynes, director of the first movie of the franchise, returns in the director's chair where instead of slasher films, it's all about haunted houses and things that bump in the night as Cindy (Anna Faris) starts a new life in college where other members of the surviving party from Brenda (Regina Hall), Shorty (Marlon Waynes) and Ray (Shawn Waynes) go with her as well. This time Cindy has a boyfriend (Chris Masterson) where the two of them along with Brenda, Shorty, Ray and other guests are going to a haunted mansion for a field experiment to see about a ghost. Some parts of the film made me laugh from certain pop culture (Raging Bull, Nike Shoes) while some of the sex jokes just didn't work for me. I felt that I was watching a movie where the laughter needed to be forced out of me than seeing something innovated.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death Defying Action!,"Scary Movie 2 was described by the Producers as being full of Death Defying Action. Oh really! Well I'll say this. The only ""Death Defying Action"" which you'll experience during watching Scary Movie 2 is managing not to die of boredom! As many people have already said on the comments page here, I was a big fan of the first Scary Movie. It was very funny. Unfortunetly, this sequel is neither funny, nor interesting. It has no real plot and although it starts brightly, it quickly runs out of steam. Personally, if I were a main actor in this movie, I think I would lose a lot of credibility. Of course, Scary Movie 2 is not supposed to be taken seriously, which is why it doesn't appeal to many people. To get the jokes, u have to have seen quite a few horror movies to 'get' the jokes. Jokes? Hmmmm. Indeed, I spent 2 hours laughing so much at Scary Movie 2's hilarious gags and zany knockabout comedy that I: a) Split my sides laughing and am now carrying 25 stitches in my midriff b) Dislocated my jaw during the riotous masterpiece that was the ""clown under the bed routine"" c) Was suffering from oxygen starvation due to protracted laughing.

I normally reserve my votes of 1 out of 10 for those extremely few films that are absolutely incomprehensible. I made an exception for this disaster.,"Doesn't it seem like just days ago that we were flogged with the FIRST Scary Movie? What a pile of crap this movie was. There's just no other way to describe it. I hated the original, for obvious reasons, so I was shocked that this ridiculous sequel managed to sneak beneath the abysmal level to which the original sank less than a year ago. The Wayans brothers have returned to the spotlight to remind the world of their immaturity, their sickening sense of humor, and their absolute lack of any type of film-making talent. This is drivel of the lowest order and is completely devoid of redeeming values of any kind.On the other hand, there is a place for a film like this, even among educated people. For example, if you are a professional film critic, or even an average movie-goer who writes reviews for the IMDb (a group of people with whom I proudly associate), then a movie like Scary Movie 2 is worth watching just because it is so much fun to shoot it down afterwards in a review. There's something morbidly satisfying about watching a dumbass movie like this and then tearing it up in a review, even if you already know that not too many people will bother to read it. I can't even begin to satisfactorily convey to you the absolute idiocy of this film, I can only say that there is a total absence of any kind of talent or thought behind it, and it results as nothing more than an hour and a half of blabbering nonsense.Did you ever wonder how many perfectly good careers are ended, some even before they've really began, by hideous movies like this? Tori Spelling's flailing and altogether unenviable career is officially over, Tim Curry is too good an actor to be completely destroyed by movie like this, but this was clearly his version of Travolta starring Battlefield Earth. There can be no doubt about Anna Faris's talent as an actress, and she's beautiful, too, but she'll never be able to overcome the awful reputation that she has established for herself in the Scary Movies. Marlon and Shawn Wayans are the lucky ones here, because neither had anything to lose when they took on these crapfests. This kind of movie is a metaphorical handgun with which various actors can voluntarily commit career suicide. For shame.And one more thing, if any of the people behind the Scary Movies are reading this, I'd like to ask a huge favor for the greater good of mankind - ""FOR GOD'S SAKE, NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!""",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

If you are, say, between 18 and 35, like stupid comedies, are in that special mood, and don't care much about your self image, boy, this is the film for you.I was looking to laugh, and I got a movie in which I couldn't stop laughing. So that means the movie works, right?Well. It's like a chiclet. At first it tastes great, but chew on it hard, and the taste is gone. First of all (the apology has ended, BTW), I am SURE I saw a censored version of the movie, since there was a huge gap between the professors' death and the kids trying to get out of the haunted house. Second (and I cannot stress it enough), how come the directors are so keen in showing us the drug addict as the cool guy? I mean, kids are going to watch this movie one way or the other (rental, anyone?) and I can only imagine what they'll think when they see that the dopey guy even gets the girl at the end. Do we really need a drug-glorifying culture nowadays? Sheesh... I have known friends who regularly use drugs, and they ended up isolated and alienated. Nothing at all what is shown on the films.The story, as it is to be expected, stinks. No continuity, jumps from scene to scene, lots of jokes that simply don't work (the whole skeleton thing is stupid), and way too many counterculture references.

"Scared me to death, from the almost zero laughs in this supposed spoof comedy.","Scary Movie 2 brings us once again Shawn and Marlon Wayans from the first and triumphant Scary Movie. This movie spoofs many different movies ranging from The Exorcist, House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Poltergeist 1 & 2, What Lies Beneath and many others. It has very funny opening moments with the spoofing of the Exorcist. However, the movie takes an absolute downfall afterwards. It had maybe and I'm being generous here, 2-3 more laughs scattered throughout the movie.For instance, there is a talking parrot who uses more curse words than I do, but in a VERY extremely non-funny way. It uses jokes like I had your mother last night and stuff like that. The jokes were so unoriginal, I wanted to shoot the person who wrote this crap. Since this movie is suppose to be funny and slapsticky, I expect funny for my buck. I don't expect good acting, plots, character development in these types of movies, but for god sakes, please show me the funny. Marlon Wayans brought a few laughs here and there as did Shawn, but the down-syndrome girl is oh my god, TOO ANNOYING TO DESCRIBE IN WORDS!!Avoid this movie at all costs.

It's just the same old jokes and repetitive swearing that this film offers. The thing that really bugs me though is the stupid woman constantly yapping! The deformity and disabled jokes although funny were getting out of hand by the end of the first half and the tired old sequences copying famous films have mostly been spoofed before. The plot is mostly based on the Haunting, which strangely, no review I've read has mentioned. But it could have been better if they kept the scream guy in.",,Anonymous,Horror

"Not terrible, just not very funny.","Let me preface this review by saying that I LOVE scary movies, and bad horror is an artform all it's own. Watching a bad horror film can be rewarding, but Scary Movie 2 is not a horror film, it's a comedy, and bad comedy is not an artform. There aren't too many websites dedicated to unfunny comedies, as there are for bad/silly/cheesy/campy horror flicks. I did not hate SM2, it was a fine date movie, but as with the prequel the ""satire"" breaks down into an endless stream of toilet jokes. Toilet jokes can be funny, as they occasionally are here, but to rely almost solely on them in a film that presents itself as a SATIRE is wrong. I have the same gripes with SM2 as I did with the first one. Not enough genuinly smart jokes. Most are just gross-out style. With so much to parody in the realm of horror it's sad to see the comedy ball dropped so often. An over reliance on swearing and bodily fluids really detract from the actual satire. At least this one went away from the ""Scream"" style movies that it rheemed in the SM1. This one is more like The Haunting, with a little Excorcist and What Lies Beneath thrown in. I have to say this much, Cindy had me hypnotised, she's so beautifull I just wanted the movie to focus solely on her and never leave. Chris Elliot is also quite funny as the grotesque and gimpy caretaker, he steals most of his scenes. The clown under the bed scared my girlfriend, so it scores points for that. Tim Curry is fat; Tori Spelling is ugly; Cindy is hypnotic; the chick with the leather pants and visable thong should do Playboy; Chris Elliot rules; Drug/Penis jokes get old fast; that's what Andy Richter's been doing?

A few passable laughs,"Hell House is a haunted place where there was an attempted exorcism on Megan (Natasha Lyonne). One year later, professor Oldman (Tim Curry) is using students Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), Shorty Meeks (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) to awaken Hell House. They are monitored by the professor and his assistant Dwight Hartman (David Cross). The house caretaker is Hanson (Chris Elliott). The other invited students include Buddy (Christopher Masterson) who pines for Cindy, Alex (Tori Spelling) and hot Theo (Kathleen Robertson).The Exorcist spoof start isn't that funny with a couple of passable gross out jokes. The main spoof is The Haunting. It's great to have Anna Faris back. There is a constant flow of gross out jokes. They're not always particularly insightful or relevant to the horror genre. There are a few big laughs but it's mostly a lot of random jokes that don't work. Following a single movie spoof gives the movie a better and more consistent flow.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"I don¬¥t know why I rented this movie, I really don¬¥t. I plead momentary insanity. I saw the first Scary Movie in a theatre and I thought it was quite bad. Some of the scenes and jokes were amusing, but overall the whole ""movie"" was just lame. It could be funny if you watch it in a ""proper"" state of mind. Anyway, now I decided to watch Scary Movie 2 and I really regret it. I just wasted two and a half euros and 79 minutes on one of the worst ""comedies"" I have ever seen.The trailer of the movie looks promising enough, but the film itself is unbelievably horrible. It¬¥s obvious that the movie was done very quickly because the studio wanted to capitalize on the first movie¬¥s success. Unfortunately there¬¥s nothing good to say about the result. Few chuckles here and there aren¬¥t enough and this movie¬¥s gets so low every other second that it¬¥s just disgusting. The makers also seem to think that bad and dirty language guarantees laughs. It just isn¬¥t so. The scariest thing about this whole disaster is that people actually put money into this! I don¬¥t even feel sorry for the cast members, their careers deserve to die if they seriously thought that this movie was worth doing. And James Woods...What the hell has happened to good comedies? All these rude teen comedies seem to rule the business and all the good ones are overlooked. I just can¬¥t believe it that there are people out there who liked this movie. Most likely those folks have never seen any real comedies like Airplane! or the Naked Gun which I will watch very shortly in order to forget Scary Movie 2.My advice is... AVOID SCARY MOVIE 2 AT ALL COSTS! It¬¥s horrible, terrible, disgusting, unfunny, boring, shocking and easily one of the worst so-called comedies of all-time. I just hope the third part will be able to top the second part as it has one of the Zucker brothers at the helm and Pat Proft as one of the writers. Beating Part 2 won¬¥t be hard, though. You simply cannot get any lower than this.>",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Funny, But the Weakest in the Series","While this movie was hysterically funny, the fact remains that it was the weakest in the entire series. Brenda has all of the best scenes, and some of Anna Farris's comedic genius shines through, but a series of unfunny sequences and several other bland moments make the movie seem rushed. It does have its moments though, and the deleted scenes and alternate endings are some of the best that the series has to offer. If only there was more to offer in terms of a really storyline, this would be much better. Still, it remains better than most parody films, many of which fall extremely flat. The original ending may be unsatisfying, and many of the characters are clich√©d and open-ended. Nobody has a real personality, and it seems to be spoofing one movie after another. Which brings us to the only real major problem: there is too much going on. The movie gets consumed in all of the material it is trying to spoof, and becomes sucked up in the stupidity of it all. Still, the acting is superb and many scenes really shine through. The rare scenes that have actual character development are actually written quite well, and pretty much anything involving the 'handyman' was excellent. Tim Curry's presence was truly a gift. Overall, the movie is worth several watches and it is a very good spoof film, but it is not without its share of flaws.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as funny as the first...,"The first Scary Movie was hilarious and I decided to wait and see the sequel on video because I heard it was bad. Good call. Although the first Scary Movie was disgusting and funny, Scary Movie 2 doesn't deliver as much big laughs as the first one. Another point, is that the sequel isn't as sick as the first and that's a nice quality. The spoof on old movies doesn't work all the time, but the Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission: Impossible II do. The returning cast is good (especially Cindy and Brenda), but not Ray (who's sexual identity is still questioned), and I wish a few other people would have returned. Some of the new cast isn't great, all the main adults aren't well done, but the new teens Theo, Alex and Buddy are great.

Not that great.,"Scary Movie was a great movie when it came out, so naturally many people were excited with the news of a sequel...Even though the first movie promised there wouldn't be any. Most of the main characters from the first film and a few new ones must spend the weekend in a haunted mansion for a school assignment. The main films spoofed this time around are The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill.Scary Movie was so funny because it pushed the envelope. It was stuff you've never seen in a movie before. Now, in Scary Movie 2 it's old news. There is far too much toilet humour in this movie and it just gets redundant after a while. Of course I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me laugh. It did. The only problem was that it reused many of the same jokes from the first one. That, and it was too short. Everything happens to quickly, and it makes the plot seem sloppy. It's just not as good as the first all around.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

To be fair, there are a few chuckles and those mainly involve David Cross and Chris Elliot, otherwise--forget it. Pointless 'parodies' abound, and many don't have any reference to scary movies. The script must have consisted of walking on the set each day and one of the Wayans' boys saying ""hey, this will be funny, let's throw it in."" If you're looking for good parody or satire stick with Spinal Tap or Wag the Dog or Best in Show or even Scream. The only thing scary about this movie is that it was actually released.

Not a great movie but a fun one,"Some people take comedy too seriously.  Look, if you want to kill some time and get some laughs in, SCARY MOVIE 2 is a good choice.Like many parody films, this one assembles its inspiration from a wide range of films.  As I started watching it, I almost started to write down the films they were lifting scenes from.  Fortunately, I stopped myself and went back to laughing.  Still, it's interesting to watch scenes progress that switch from one flick to another.  For example, the ""trapped in the freezer"" scene from HOLLOW MAN switches to the ""do I drown or freeze to death"" scene from TITANIC.Other flicks I caught references to--THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE  (Richard Matheson's homage to THE HAUNTING)THE EXORCIST  (most of the opening sequence)THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (the flies in the bathroom)Stephen King's IT  (the clown doll)A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (the invisible seduction)THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (the remake; the maze of basement corridors)HANNIBAL  (the second dinner scene)CHARLIES ANGELSCROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGONHOLLOW MAN (I think they LITERALLY swiped the infrared goggles from that flick)SCREAM (talking to Dad on the phone at the end of the flick)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There are no characters to care about, no plot, and shitty special effects. But guess what I fully expected that and put that aside. AND I STILL HATED IT!

Scary Movie 2 is scarily and laughably horrendous.,"You know I said the original was the worst in the trilogy? Yeah...I take that back. I didn't remember this sequel being that terrible, but boy was I wrong. Whilst the first flick focused on parodying the slasher sub-genre, the second instalment targeted classic supernatural horror films. A group of college students must stay in a manor for an assignment, where a ghostly presence starts to haunt them. A mixture of 'Poltergeist', 'House on Haunted Hill' and 'The Haunting', yet somehow the plot seems less cohesive than its predecessor. Reminiscent of random sketches stitched together in an attempt to create a story. Starting with 'The Exorcist' which holds no importance whatsoever, and concluding with an action sequence from 'Charlie's Angels' (although actually my favourite scene). It makes no sense. Heck, I myself could invite some friends over and imitate some horror films for you and mash them together using Windows Movie Maker calling it a ""film"". The vulgarity is increased to maximum potential, including a myriad of fart, poo and vomit jokes. The dinner preparation scene highlights the sickening tone of this sequel, and unfortunately that type of humour has expired. It's not funny in the slightest, it gained no laughs from me. Regina Hall as Brenda is just euphoric. ""Cindy, it's a skeleton! It's just bones!"" to which she really is the only good aspect to this. Tim Curry is in this, no idea why. Although, I have calculated a formula to solve the ""Curry Conundrum"". 'Charlie's Angels' is parodied which features Curry in a towel who is in 'It' as a clown which is not spoofed in this, therefore mathematically proving that Curry was in it for the money. Yes! It makes perfect sense now. No other way to justify his involvement in this piece of rubbish that bathes in the runny poo that it adores using in the countless unfunny jokes presented to us. Fortunately, the next sequel is a big guilty pleasure for me...",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Painfully Unfunny,"Making a comedy that is funny because it is stupid is one of the hardest things to do. Because it can very easily just end up being stupid. Scary Movie 2 has none of the charm, laughs, and fun that the original provided. It might have something to do with that the main movie being parodied (The Haunting remake) wasn't even that good to begin with. Instead of poking fun of the genre in a hilarious over the top manner like the first one did, this film instead goes for gross out humor and various unfunny jokes. There are only so many times I can say ""thats not funny"" so I just leave it at this. Scary Movie 2 is not funny, its dumb, vile, and idiotic. Just watch the first one instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Same problem all modern parody movies have,"These Airplane! style movies today are not movies at all. They may as well be just a clip show of the current pop culture. They can't stand on their own as a movie, the same way Airplane!, or Hot Shots! And as such, they don't hold up well over time the way the ZAZ (Or Mel Brooks) movies do. Another reason for that is they feel the need to throw SO many random, totally unrelated parodies in, that they are forced to parody things that may have been well known at that year..but no one remembers. So...where everyone remembers the disaster movies craze that Airplane! was parodying and can enjoy the jokes 10, even 40 years later..NO ONE remembers a stupid Nike basketball commercial, so people watching Scary Movie 2 pretty much any time after 2004 will be wondering what the hell is going on.I gave it a 5 solely because it is better than all the parody movies that have come out since.

Really Bad Sequel With Few Laughs,"Scary Movie 2 (2001)* 1/2 (out of 4)The original movie wasn't the greatest but at least it did manage a few laughs. This cash-in sequel has a few laughs as well but the majority of the jokes are just downright lame and certainly never funny. This is a pretty bad movie that has the people from the first, led by Cindy (Anna Faris), now in college and having their professor (Tim Curry) take them to Hell House where a year earlier a young woman was possessed by a demon. The opening sequence is a take off on THE EXORCIST with James Woods playing the priest. For the most part this entire sequence is bad but what few laughs there are come from Woods but I'm curious why he'd agree to appear in something like this. Either way, it's clear by the number of writers that this was going to be uneven but it was obviously also rushed to cash-in on the success of the first film. The first one was lazy for pretty much just remaking SCREAM scene-for-scene but this one here is just lazy because there's no imagination to it. Faris comes across rather bored this time out, the Wayans brothers aren't really bringing many laughs as like in the first film they are mainly here for gay or pot jokes. Curry is forgettable in his role. The only saving grace comes from Chris Elliott playing a deformed cook. SCARY MOVIE 2 lasts just 82-minutes but it feels twice as long and you know you're in trouble when a the smartest jokes seem to have been written by children.",,Anonymous,Horror

Lame and unfunny,"The first ""Scary Movie"" was funny enough and had some pretty silly but enjoyable moments, like the ""Usual Suspects"" gag. It was a crude movie, but entertaining nonetheless.The sequel is ugly, rude, crude, obnoxious, unfunny, lame and totally out of ideas. It spoofs everything in sight - mostly ""Exorcist"" - but fails on almost all levels.The entire cast basically returns. This time they get summoned to a haunted mansion where possessions are occurring. Weird people - including a creepy owner and a sick chef - turn them off and they soon find themselves being pursued by evil.If the plot sounds lame, that's because it is. The cast is at a loss for words; the Wayans Brothers recycle loads of gags from the first film and manage to make them worse.

This just bombards the audience with sex and disgusting jokes.With House on Haunted Hill, The Exorcist and the haunting as the main source material, this could have been a very funny film, instead it is almost a lower quality rehash of the original. I don't know if it was perhaps rushed, it feels a little rushed, but it is just not on a par with the original.

"Feeble, vulgar and tasteless humour, watch at the expense of your dignity.","Sequels don't come much worse than this atrocity. Scary Movie 2 is a spoof of the haunted house genre, which parodies other movies such as Titanic and Charlie's Angels to minimal effect. While its predecessor was creative and often laugh-out-loud funny, this sequel just goes way too far.The feeble jokes are for the most part, just plain disgusting. The new characters in the film are undeveloped, unwelcome and have no charisma. In particular, blow dryer Tori Spelling. Another thing, most of the characters who they killer off in the first one return here with no apparent explanation. They even decided to bring in James Woods and `Alien's Veronica Cartwright for a dreadful and rather pointless sketch on `The Exorcist' at the start of the movie. With more scriptwriters than jokes, I absolutely detested this film's risible attempt at humour.But then again, if a money shot of sperm, a man being smoked by weed, a deranged hand, an invisible genitalia, a big black penis in some poor clown's mouth, a girl p*ssing herself and a vomit marathon are your idea of humour, then watch this film. Otherwise, avoid, avoid, avoid. 2.6 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
Stay away of this movie if you care for your brain...,"Scary Movie was rubbish. Its sequel is even bad. Now the question is: will the 3rd part be worse? Is it possible to be worse than Scary Movie 2?I'm afraid THIS will be possible, because when you have Wayans directing, you don't know what to expect. Scary Movie 2 is a bunch of bad sexual jokes, trying to recreate the humor of ""American Pie"" or the Farrelli Bros.' style. But the whole film stinks from the beginning till the end.

Just a reworked version of the original.,"Scary Movie 2 is exactly like the original except that it isn't as funny. The reason for this is that all of the same jokes are used here and aren't even done differently. The first thirty minutes are funny, but then you just get the same old jokes over and over again. Of course there are a lot more black and white jokes in the sequel and they are funny for a little bit. The black and white jokes, however, are very over used and eventually become offensive. The only other type of joke you find in this movie is a fart joke. None of them are remotely funny. No jokes in this movie are new. They have all been used many times before. The beginning part with James Woods is really funny and would have been even better had Marlon Brando been able to fill the role.

"Worst of the Scary Movies, almost ruined the franchise","There are a couple laughs in the movie, so I won't rate it a 1/10. There are two memorable scenes in the entire movie for me. I went to see this with my best friend when it released in theater's. There were 2 other people in the theater.What really makes this movie so bad is the awkward scenes that draw on way too long. The movie had potential with the comically spooky plot, but the script, directing and casting ruined it.The only two actors/actresses that make this spoof movie funny in a couple parts are Marlon Wayans and Anna Faris. Marlon Wayans is responsible for one of the most memorable scenes in spoof movies, which I won't ruin for those who haven't seen it. Anna Faris does the best she can with the script she's been given, it would have been much worth with someone else cast in her place.Don't get me wrong, I'm an Anna Faris fan, but this movie almost killed the franchise for me.Some of what was supposed to be funny, instead made me completely uncomfortable as with anyone else I watched it with.I rate this a 2/10 because of two funny scenes that prevented the movie from being completely boring and not watchable. Scary Movie 3 saves the franchise from extinction in my opinion. The first Scary Movie was quite good for its time in my opinion as well.I hated Scary Movie 4, but Scary Movie 5 was a a lot more funny as a spoof movie than I expected.Please remember that the Scary Movie series is a collection of spoofs, not parodies. Movies like this are designed to be completely unrealistic. Spoofs are comedic copies of other movies.Scary Movie 2 almost has nothing to do with the rest of the series, so I'd suggest skipping it in the series entirely.

Good one,"Scary Movie 2, the second installment in the popular horror comedy franchise, attempts to satirize contemporary horror films like Hannibal, The Exorcist, and The Others, but ultimately fails to recapture the magic of the original. While there are moments of genuine humor, the film often relies on tired parodies and struggles to maintain a consistent tone, resulting in a disjointed and ultimately forgettable viewing experience.One of the biggest challenges facing Scary Movie 2 is the sheer volume of horror films being released each year. The franchise, which thrived on satirizing iconic horror classics like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, now faces a daunting task of keeping up with the ever-evolving landscape of modern horror. This leads to a sense of d√©j√† vu, as many of the parodies feel derivative and lack the originality that defined the first film.The film attempts to tackle several popular horror franchises, including Hannibal, The Exorcist, and The Others. The spoof of Hannibal, with its over-the-top gore and absurd cannibalistic tendencies, offers some of the film's most memorable moments. The parodies of The Exorcist and The Others, while relying heavily on familiar tropes, also provide a few genuinely funny scenes. However, these moments are often overshadowed by a barrage of uninspired gags and forced humor.The film also struggles to maintain a consistent tone. It veers wildly between slapstick humor, dark satire, and juvenile gross-out gags, often leaving the audience unsure of what to expect. This inconsistency undermines the film's comedic potential and creates a disjointed viewing experience.The performances, while serviceable, are largely forgettable. Anna Faris, who reprises her role as Cindy Campbell, seems to be going through the motions, lacking the same energy and enthusiasm that she brought to the first film. The supporting cast, including Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, also fail to make a lasting impression.Furthermore, the film's reliance on topical humor, while relevant at the time of its release, has aged poorly. Jokes about reality TV shows and celebrity culture feel dated and fail to resonate with contemporary audiences.Despite its shortcomings, Scary Movie 2 is not without its merits. The film boasts a few genuinely funny moments, particularly in the spoof of Hannibal. The visual effects, while not always groundbreaking, are generally well-executed and contribute to the film's over-the-top aesthetic.Ultimately, however, Scary Movie 2 fails to recapture the magic of the original. While it offers some laughs and a few memorable moments, the film's reliance on tired parodies, inconsistent tone, and uninspired performances ultimately undermine its comedic potential. It serves as a reminder that even the most successful franchises can eventually run out of steam.In conclusion, Scary Movie 2, while attempting to satirize contemporary horror trends, falls short of its predecessor. The film struggles to find fresh ground and relies heavily on tired parodies, resulting in a disjointed and ultimately forgettable viewing experience. While there are moments of genuine humor, the film fails to deliver the same level of comedic brilliance that made the first film so successful, suggesting that the franchise may have finally run its course.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Unfunny, crude, puerile and obvious nonsense that will please dumb teens but nobody else","As part of an experiment into the existence of an afterlife, Professor Oldham brings a collection of teenage massacre survivors to an old house on a hill where a year earlier there was supposedly a violent exorcism. The group get together at the house and sit for a meal ¬ñ but the work of housekeeper Hanson puts them off a bit and sees them all go off for an early night. During the night the presence of a supernatural presence is evident and is gradually getting more violent. With Oldham's assistant pleading with him to end the experiment early, the others start to twig that their lives might just be in danger.Some how or other this series has now reached four parts and, although I'll acknowledge that part 3 was an improvement on the first film, the second one is just as crude and stupid as the first. Sadly this really put me off and I honestly felt like giving up having watched a poo joke followed by loads of fake vomit in the first, very obvious, five minutes. Sadly this is followed by loads of very obvious spoofs very loosely held together in the ""haunted house"" plot but mostly it is loads of penis and sperm jokes that were not funny and were actually pretty unpleasant to watch ¬ñ not something I wanted from a supposed comedy. It gets no better and I can't remember laughing once, it relies far too much on gross-out stuff that I just found puerile and painful ¬ñ but I suppose that if you like that sort of then this will do the joke ¬ñ I don't and this didn't.The cast match the material by being sick and childish. For many of them I can understand why they are happy to work at this level but I can only assume that James Woods got a massive wodge of cash in exchange for demeaning himself in the opening scene. Faris is weak and the Wayans brothers are uninspiring and obvious. Hall and Robertson are both sexy but this is all they are used for. Elliott is gross and not funny while Curry turns in a very simple lecherous performance. Nobody is able to lift the material and everyone just swims (literally) in all the bodily fluid gags.Overall a dreary and crude film that I didn't find funny once. Maybe I'm getting older but I didn't even find it offensive ¬ñ just puerile. The cast can't do anything to make it better and generally the whole thing falls down thanks to the low aims of the Wayans brothers as writers and director; they are happy with the lowest common denominator and they aim right for it.",,Anonymous,Horror

The inevitable consequence of growth is decay,"Scary Movie 2 (2001) continues the franchise, focusing on the very dated haunted house sub-genre of Horror movies, and beginning with an explosive parody of The Exorcist, which I suppose is also a haunted house movie, in its own way.Lovable young punchbag Cindy is back, as is Brenda, despite getting the chop in the last film, and Ray, again, despite getting his ears brutally syringed in the previous instalment. The stoner guy is back too (don't they write it, him and his bro?). I say write it, but really, what writing is there?As before, Scary Movie 2 takes recognisable features of the horror genre, in this case the invitation to the selected few, arrival at the house, group meeting for dinner, sinister apparitions in the bedrooms, the corridors, the basement, and smears them with as much low comedy as the writers can squeeze out. How can we make this moment gross, and a bit different from the yuck in the previous scene? No faulting them for debased invention. It's not like the Horror genre is noble, not as a rule, but traditionally one does want someone to root for, not just gloat over. Every opportunity to hurl sexual humour of the nastiest kind, or toilet humour, is seized with glee in this movie.I used the word parody before, but parody can be achieved with a certain intelligence, even respect for its source material. The Scary Movie franchise has ZERO respect, and only limited affection, and as such it is parodic of Horror in much the same way that pornography holds up a grotesque mirror to the mainstream, with 'stars' whose names and even their appearances are vulgar copies of entertainment industry celebrities, and with parodies of mainstream content that reduce whatever happened in the source project to the soulless display of bodily functions on camera. I don't know if the fact they really do those things, whereas the Scary gang only pretend, doesn't in fact give the adult industry folk more integrity. At least they have a special skill, whereas this lot can't act, can't write, can't imagine. It's all a knock-off.But is it funny? Well, yes. In a horrible, self-hatred inducing sort of way (again, like the consumption of porn).

Hilarious,"Scary Movie 2 is hilarious.  There's one thing that I can't seem to understand, if someone didn't like Scary Movie then why would they go see Scary Movie 2.  They couldn't have thought that Marlon and Shawn Wayans were going to change the writing style they used on a movie that grossed well over 200 million dollars.  Anyway, the movie was funny.  I must say that I did like the first better, but I still thought this one was hilarious. Marlon Wayans is my favorite actor and I am a huge fan of the entire Wayans family.  Although I don't believe that any type of comedy is better than another, if I were to follow these beliefs then I would have to conclude that Keenan, Marlon, and Shawn are just very versatile.  Keenan Ivory Wayans wrote and produced I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, a spoof of blaxploitation films. This movie received rave reviews and didn't have ""toilet humor"" as many people like to call it.  Marlon and Shawn wrote and produced Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, which critically was not as successful as Keenan's spoof, but was a huge hit with fans and had very little ""toilet humor.""  Last summer the brothers Wayans wrote Scary Movie and mastered gross-out humor in the spoof.  They did it again this summer.  Perhaps many of the jokes in Scary Movie 2 are taken from scenes or even movies that many people might not remember, but the movie is still hilarious.  Straight up, if you didn't like the first one, don't go see the sequel expecting something totally different.  If you liked the first one and didn't enjoy the second, I supposed I can understand.  I give it a 10 because it did its job which was to make me laugh.  One final note, to anyone who says Marlon Wayans isn't talented, go out and rent Requiem for a Dream.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hollywood sinks to a new low...,"First they give Jim Carrey something other than a mop job, then they let the Farrelly Brothers make a film that isn't a documentary about the use of pooper scoopers, then they give the Wayans Brothers a budget to work with. Will the people in charge of the green light at Hollywood ever learn?It's ironic, really, that people from In Living Colour actually have careers some ten to twelve years after the show was cancelled. I don't know what Jim Carrey did on that show to convince anyone that he should get money for anything other than being severely brain damaged, but after Scary Movie 2, he seems like the lesser of two evils. Which is also ironic considering that the original Scary Movie was actually quite funny in places. Maybe this is a call for more editors and script doctors to be employed in Hollywood?I won't get into critiquing all of the points in this film that others have already bashed to death. It's just a waste of time. What I will do is go over a few things that I found ridiculously wrong with the film. First of all, basing the majority of a film around a similar setting or premise to The Haunting is only going to get you in trouble. The actual film was an unmitigated disaster, even when Owen Wilson got his head chopped off, so trying to satirise it in any way, shape, or form is a bad idea - it satirised itself very effectively.Secondly, when you're choosing source materials or directors to satirise, it is generally a good idea not to pick someone who is obviously at least twice as intelligent as you are (although that could mean billions of people for the Wayans brothers). I am, of corse, referring to the utterly pathetic and childish attempts to satirise Hollow Man. Whereas the original made a good, satirical swipe at the empty morality of the New Testament, as well as provided a good story about a generally decent guy gone power-mad, the satire here was obviously conceived and executed with no idea whatsoever as to what the film was about. This is hardly surprising since, in a Christian-dominated society such as America, hardly anyone is going to properly understand what Hollow Man was about, but trying to match wits with one of Western Europe and Hollywood's most ingenious political satirists with a string of fart/body fluid/stoner gags is like trying to take on the entire American armed forces with a .22 - it just ain't going to work.Lastly, while the America-centric humour of a lot of the gags in Scary Movie was countered by the possibility of seeing the original commercials or films, the former being shown on a ""greatest commercials"" show (""Whazzup!"" is actually an ad for Budweiser beer for all those people from the antipodes who don't watch ""greatest commercials"" shows), it falls flat in Scary Movie 2. The attempt to satirise the Nike ad was cut down in flames here by the fact that NOBODY had seen the commercial in this country. The fact that the satire was about as funny as a basketball match didn't help very much, either. Even though I like to think I am more cultured than most of my peers, I am also stumped on what the hell that gag involving Shorty's ""brain"" was about.So to sum up, Scary Movie 2 is an unfunny film written by a bunch of juvenile dipsticks, much like the original, but this time nobody thought to edit the script and bring some semblance of humour into the film. ""What the hell,"" thought the studio execs. ""We'll just print this crap up and show it on the screen - the kids will love it."" Well, sorry, Dimension, but adolescents are generally far more intelligent than films like this one give them credit for, and most adults like myself outgrew this sort of drivel so long ago that we can hardly remember when it happened.",,Anonymous,Horror
This is just ridiculous...,"And not in a ridiculously funny kind of way, either.  The pressure to put out a sequel to a movie that is only a year old definitely took it's toll on this film.  As you may have guessed the gross out humor was piled on pretty darn heavy and many times it just looked idiotic. There really is no plot or story to speak of, the movie just runs from parody to parody (some good, some painful to watch.)There were, thankfully, some good parts to this movie.  Kathleen Robertson, first of all, is just gorgeous.  Christopher Masterson ""blew up"" (see the freezer scene, you'll understand) in the role of Buddy in my opinion.  Some of the parodies were good, (""The Exorcist"", ""Charlie's Angels"") but not quite on par with other spoof movies like ""Hot Shots"" or, another Keenan Ivory Wayans project, ""Don't Be A Menace.""  Marlon Wayans was good at times as Shorty, but overdid it in spots.There were terrible parts also.  Anna Faris, for as good as she looks, can never get that same goofy look of her face the whole movie.  It really gets under your skin. Chris Elliot and the part he played, Hanson, were an abomination.  Shawn Wayans...oh, nevermind. Although no plot was intended, the choppiness and confusion that the storyline brings is ""nails-on-a-chalkboard"" annoying.

Badly good.,"Summing up Scary Movie 2 really depends on what you thought of Scary Movie. If you liked the original gross-out horror spoof, you'll probably like this one. If you thought that the first was horribly disgusting and gross and needlessly graphic, then don't go see the sequel. Simple as that.Overall, Scary Movie 2 packed more parodies (do we dare try to list all the movies? The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, The Haunting, 13 Ghosts, a Nike commercial, The Weakest Link, Poltergeist, Hollow Man, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Mission Impossible 2, Charlie's Angels, What Lies Beneath, Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs, Save the Last Dance, is that all? Probably not.) Heck, Scary Movie even parodied itself! Well, at least I sure hope the complete excess of genital humor was self-parody. At least we weren't ""treated"" to the sight of REAL male genitalia in this one.But anyway, Scary Movie 2 packed more parodies into less of a plot (is that possible?) than the original. True, the gags aren't as funny, generally. But the movie does indeed contain some classic satirical moments: The Exorcist opening is classic. The Hollow Man cooler parody scene is also excellent. Also nice is the way the Wayans unexpectedly throw in parodies out of nowhere. Sometimes this works (Save the Last Dance), sometimes it doesn't (Nike). But that's the whole point of a parody movie. Completely random satires of a movie or movies from the genre in question.But what exactly was the movie/genre in question? In the first we had an idea that it was Scream. Heck, we KNEW it was Scream. But this one seemed to just be a haunted house movie filled with every sort of parody possible - part Poltergeist, part Hollow Man, part ???. So the movie suffers as a result.Oh the laughs are great, and if you don't mind the juvenile humor, they're even better. But hey, it's not as good as the original, which really was a classic parody movie, even if it was disgusting at points.7/10",,Anonymous,Horror
"Aside from James Wood's funny opening scene and Kathleen Robertson, this movie can kiss my ass!","Woe is me; was this unfunny!

We also get one of the most annoying comedians in the world today. (Chris Elliot) I can't stomach the guy. He does nothing but gross out gags throughout the film, and I just wanted to slap him one. Watching Kathleen Robertson's cleavage bop up and down is a rather nice distraction. Her cleavage does the acting for her. Great performance! Anna Farris is fine as per usual. She plays it all straight faced like a trooper; I just wish she had better stuff to work with. Christopher Masterson makes me pine for Jon Abrahams. The Wayan brothers do their thang and it's not as funny this time around. Regina Hall sticks out like a sore thumb. I actually got very annoyed by her in this one. Tori Spelling & Tim Curry are both OK. David Cross is excruciatingly unfunny as the invalidFinal Thoughts: This is what happens when you get greedy and rush production. Scary Movie is quite funny, this isn't! By far the worst in the series2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the funniest,"One good thing about Scary Movie 2 is that it doesn't make you bored all the way unlike its prequel, which even though was better, but was dragging towards the end. The problem with this movie is that there are very little gags, and many of them are not that funny at all. Some of them are just stupid and not laughable. It had some good gags too like the Charlie's Angel's spoof and a few others. But many of them were just repeated from the first part. A few scenes, like the basketball scene, were good to listen but didn't really make any sense. I can't comment that much about the acting here as all had to act stupidly. Though I feel that the lady who wears lesser clothes and is one of the friends, has no acting capability as she wasn't funny either. One thing was good. Less nudity and whatever was there wasn't shown that clearly. 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
BIG let down from the first one ...,"Basically the same concept as the first one, only this one runs REALLY FLAT at times.  Using a movie as lame as The Haunting as the basis of this parody is difficult to start with because almost nobody saw that awful movie (or cares to remember it) - plus the last one had many more horror parodies than this one.  Too many scenes fall short of the necessary comedic power the first one had.  The whole thing with Chris Elliot and the wheelchair guy was lame, and the dinner scene was a complete flop (and pretty stomach churning too).  Nice to see Night Court's Bull Shannon back at work, though. RECOMMENDATION: If you can sneak into the theater for the first 10 minutes of the movie (the Exorcist scene w/ James Woods, Andy Richter, Natasha Lyonne & others) do that (you'll nearly wet yourself), then run away as quickly as possible from the rest of the movie.  Too obviously a rush job after the success of last summer's Scary Movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not as good as the first, but still somewhat entertaining.","SCARY MOVIE 2 is a film that is not as great as its predecessor, but what sequel ever is? The humor is not as funny as the original and the writers tried way too hard this time around, using cliched jokes and milking the cow until it screams. The opening spoof sequence of THE EXORCIST is timeless. I would pay just to see that. James Woods truly makes you laugh in that part.The film itself is even implausible because the cast consists of many of the same characters from the original who we all know met an untimely demise at the hands of the ghostface killer. This time around, they have added Tim Curry, Tori Spelling, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Elliot and Christopher Kennedy Masterson into the mix and you have a blend of ""sometimes funny, most of the time not"" type movie. Sexual humor galore and nothing to account for it, let us hope that the third entry will bring back some of the well-needed, original humor that we were all hoping for when we went and saw this crap. SCARY MOVIE 2 gets 3/5.Let me also take this opportunity to quote Jamie Kennedy from SCREAM 2: ""Sequels suck!""",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a bad movie for some mates, a curry and lots of beer.","All the people here who have laid into this movie are just missing the point.  The point of the movie being that there isnt one other than to make people laugh.  Who cares if something is original ?  How many jokes are these days anyway ?  IS IF FUNNY.

Not up to the original,"This sequel (to a movie that promised ""no sequel"") opens with an uproarious parody of ""The Exorcist"" (with James Woods) then goes downhill fast.  The ""plot"" has a bunch of college students (four returnees from the original--never mind that they died--and three untalented others) spending the weekend in a haunted house for some reason or another.  They get to the house, the plot goes out the window and it's a non-stop barrage of crude humor and countless parodies of other movies.  The big problems with this movie is the plot ceases to make sense halfway through, there are more bad jokes than good ones and the cast members are either annoying (Tori Spelling and especially Chris Elliot) or wasted (Tim Curry--why Tim?).  The jokes do ocassionally work, but this seems much longer than 80 minutes.  Too bad--the opening was so good.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

I spent the first hour telling myself that, at least, the last half would be funny.  Little did I know that the ""last half"" was fifteen minutes long and, no, it only got more inane.

more vulgar than funny,"""Scary Movie 2"" may well be one of the crudest, raunchiest and most vulgar comedies ever aimed at an essentially mainstream audience. This sequel to the original box office smash has a great deal of energy but little else to recommend it. The first film, though hardly a model of tasteful restraint, at least managed to be clever and witty from time to time. This version is a farrago of dirty jokes revolving around disgusting bodily functions and perverse sexuality - neither of which I have a particular problem with, but the least we could demand from such an assault is that the jokes themselves be funny. Unfortunately, most of the humor is executed in such a strained, over-the-top style that all the effort is visible right up there on the screen - the death knell for any truly effective comedy. At its narrative core, the film is a parody of all those ""Haunting""-type movies in which some carefully selected people are gathered together in a haunted house by a sinister doctor intent on conducting some diabolical experiment. Along the way, the filmmakers poke fun at ""What Lies Beneath,"" ""Invisible Man,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""Poltergeist,"" ""Charlie's Angels"" and an assortment of other well-known flicks.The fact that ""Scary Movie 2"" is aimed at a young teen audience should certainly give the parents of America pause. Although this film probably doesn't visualize anything most of these youngsters haven't articulated amongst themselves already, discriminating parents should at least be aware of the graphic nature of most of the material (if they have to pare this down for network television any time soon, there will be five minutes left of the movie).Almost inevitably - as is the case with most of these scattershot-type comedies - ""Scary Movie 2"" manages to elicit a few genuine laughs with its antics - just not enough to make the film really worth recommending.",,Anonymous,Horror

"At parts funny, but overall not substantial","Ok, just to set the record straight, I though the original 'Scary Movie'was tons of funny and really hilarious. I had high hopes that the levelof humor would be as funny as the first, but was kinda disappointed.The movie started out really funny, with a right-on spoof of 'TheExcorcist'. From there on, the jokes kept on coming, and occasionallywere quite hilarious. Hanson's hand had my friend and I rolling in theaisles. But after a while, tediousness set in and the jokes lost theirpunch.The reason I think the first installment was so successful isbecause this kind of spoof was so fresh and new. But now, it is kindaplayed out and even the extremely short running time seemed way to long.In short, 'Scary Movie 2' is ok summertime fun, but I would reallysuggest waiting for video; if at all.My rating: 6 out of 10",,Anonymous,Horror
Unnecessary and disappointing...,"""Scary Movie"", was a somewhat breath of fresh air in the year 2000, with a concept in the tradition of ""Airplane!"". Making a movie that parodies every clich√© of the late 90s teen horror genre like ""Scream"" and ""I know what you did last summer"" seemed like good fun. The Wayans brothers hit the target with their particular brand of crude humor that was very attractive to the MTV generation of the end of the last century.A year after, they broke their promise of no sequels with this movie focused on the big CGI horror movies like the remakes of ""The Haunting"" and ""Thirtheen Ghosts"" as well as other popular movies of the time, keeping the crude humor and the sex jokes in the same style as the original; the difference being that, as any sequel, there is the more of everything.Actually those two aspects are the main problems in the film; first, the popular culture references are only funny if one is familiar with those, and also become dated quickly as the time goes on. The comedy aspect of the film, unlike the original movie, is very weak, with most gags being repetitive and masking the movie tiresome. Sure, the Wayans are a very creative team and still can make a laugh, but in this movie it feels as if they had written the script on a hurry and without caring too much on the result.The acting is mediocre at best, with Anna Faris being again not only our lead character, but also the only one who knows how to give a good performance. Such a shame that her most famous role to date is as the lead star of this series of films, because she is a real talent on the rise. The rest of the cast is unconvincing and even the Wayans brothers seem bothered by their own script. The brilliant cameo by James Woods at the beginning of the film is among the few really enjoyable moments of the film.The special effects are far better than in the first one; having a bigger budget helps and director Keenen Ivory Wayans makes good use of them. Unlike the horror movies it parodies, ""Scary Movie 2"" doesn't abuse of CGI and at times it keeps the indie-look of the first one.The first ""Scary movie"" promised no sequels. If they had stayed true to their promise, maybe ""Scary Movie"" had been remembered as a jewel product of its time and not as the multi-sequel bore that is right now. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been so much better  -(,"Scary Movie 2 could have been so much better.  I don't have a problem with it stealing scenes from other movies to make fun of, that's what makes a spoof so much fun.  But it steals from itself!  It just repeated scenes that it did in the first movie.  Movies about ghosts and monsters are ripe for making fun of, but it didn't do much of that.  Instead it relied on jokes about potty humor, sex and drug use.  That would have been fine, except I wanted to see a movie that spoofed horror.  It was gross alright, but that didn't make it scary (or really funny either).  I was very disappointed. The Wayans are talented, but they seem to be afraid to be too innovative.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Lacks In Structure..Had Some Potential.,"Scary Movie 2....Boy wasn't this film made in a hurry? Its pretty obvious, just watch the movie, and you will think they did the whole film in one take. The film is VERY short....Thats what makes it feel very cheap, you would expect alot more, the original was GREAT this sequel had potential but it was far from great.The movie starts off with an Exorcist spoof...Wow.! Well done, that was a good job and left me laughing alot...After that though, many of the jokes just aren't funny or are simply irellevant. Many of the jokes fall flat some examples would be (The clown scene,Nike Ad, Weakest Link,Hannibal,The Haunting) they obviously weren't thinking, after seeing these scenes you would think to yourself ""How long did this really take to make""?. The acting was mediocore, the film barely had any dialogue, and it doesent have that precious relationship from the original.....Cindy is with Buddy, thy barely communicate and they're not funny together. Tori Spelling is there for nothing..I mean who is she? And the ""I LOVE DEAD PEOPLE"" chick...Who is she? Sure the whole movie is a spoof, but there must be SOMTHING, the movie had no plot and it lacked in structure, it was all messed up.On the other hand there are a few jokes that were great to watch (Charlies angels,Exorcist,VITAMIN C,Guy with weird hand) they were good...Yet they dont save the film from its many downfalls. Scary Movie 2 was very sexually crude, i dont reccomend this to anyone under 15 at all....Gross Humor is good in American Pie...Gross Humor in Scary Movie 2...Well..It doesnt quite work.ACTING: The acting wasn't good at all...Acting was barely required in the whole film, it is SO short and there is barely any dialogue, and this is what furthers the gap between this and its worthy original.ACTORS: Most of the original cast is back (Even though half of them died) a few good names...Excluding Tori Spelling, i guess the casting was ok..I wasnt expecting any better.SCRIPT: Very poor, this is what made the film sink....If they spent abit more time on the script, closing pot-holes, making the movie make sense etc. etc. Infact if they re-wrote the whole thing it would have been better...Seriously, they must have written this with their eyes closed.CINEMA: Very poor, lack of locations, its like the movie was made in a few days, i wouldnt be suprised if it wasnt.The lighting was good for the Exorcist but other than that, poor Cinematography.COMEDY: Had alot of potential, didnt really reach its goal. I did expect better, sure you will laugh in the movie, but dont expect many laughs...Just a few official laughs...Not artificial laughs where you are just laughing WITH the audience even though it aint funny to you.MUSIC: Hmmm music? all i really remember is GRADUATION DAY by VITAMIN C...Oh there was ""LET ME BLOW YA MIND"" by EVE and Gwen Stefani, also the music during Charlies angels was ok..Not bad!OVERALL: Scary movie 2 i recommend you watch ONLY if you liked part one, and i am not promising that you will love this film, you might end up hating it.... Yet i personally think the film had lots of potential, it tried...But not hard enough.** (2 stars)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"the lowest ""Scary Movie""","Most of the movies in this series were quite clever, but not this one. It's mostly a bunch of low humor - much of it scatological - wrapped around a loose plot. As it is, there's not really any reason to call this ""Scary Movie 2"", as it has no relationship to #1, save the presence of Anna Faris (actually, neither 1 nor 2 nor 3 nor 4 has any relation to each other). The only really clever scene is the part about the Florida votes.So, I would recommend watching numbers 1, 3 and 4 before you watch this one. In fact, they kind of got better once Leslie Nielsen joined the cast. Don't let this one bias you.

Generally a pretty bad movie,"OK.  I was not going in with a lot of expectations.  As some of the other reviewers so far, I was disappointed.  Too much appeal to the least common denominator.  Actually, I did approve and enjoyed, especially since over half the audience laughed, the very early joke about the priest teasing a child with candy.  However, that joke and the few others were not worth the matinee price I paid for it.  It was the worst of the 83 films I have seen this year on the big screen.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nary a laugh in this depressing follow-up,"How to describe the train wreck of a film that is ""Scary Movie 2""?  Well, at the screening I attended, laughs were about as far and in-between as a showing of ""Requiem for a Dream.""  The fact that the filmmakers this time out decided to concentrate on the plot instead of the comedy speaks volumes on this sequel's wrong-headedness.  No one goes to this kind of movie looking for a coherent storyline, as is evidenced by the first film's blockbuster grosses.  And as a fan of the first film, I can say that ""Scary Movie 2"" fails on every level.  It's not humorous, engaging, or even remotely watchable.  The desire to flee the theater struck me more times that I can even count, and yet I stayed, hoping for some salvagable, hilarious set piece.  No such luck.  This 4th of July weekend, or any other weekend for that matter, do yourself a favor, save your 8 bucks, and stay the hell away.  Only a masochist could enjoy this bomb.

The early 2000s iconic parody not so good sequel,"It's the classic early 2000s parody formula. All you need is to base the story on few recent and successful high budget movies, make fun of everything and everyone in the most ridiculous ways, have action/horror which mostly leads to comedy(which in this movie is amm), and everything else you would expect from a parody.It's a time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days and remember ""handsome"" and all the other iconic situations and characters of the movie which aren't many.The story is as clich√© as you would expect from a parody movie.
Clich√© story, music, effects, and the amazing 2000s vibe works kinda well.Overall I think quite a lot of people will not enjoy it and a portion will. Personally, after watching the original movie this feels like not the greatest parody at all and not the worst one, it's somewhere in the middle around 5 out of 10.
Would kinda recommend to anyone familiar or not with parodies, but it wouldn't be my first choice at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Give me my money back,"I've seen the first ""Scary Movie"", and rather enjoyed it, on a mindless, silly level. But this one makes Benny Hill look like Citizen Kane.One basic rule of a parody is that the audience should have at least a hint as to what is being mocked. Apart from a rather clever (in Wayans' standards) spoof of ""The Exorcist"" and the oh-so-expected ""Crouching Dragon"" and ""Matrix"" parodies there was almost nothing but a grade z collection of body humor, ranging between just tasteless and downright disgusting. Whereas Monty Python used this kind of humor (""The meaning of life"", for instance) to make a social statement, here there's no point whatsoever.Too bad this movie is so utterly terrible. In the right hand, with the right directors and writers (the Abrahms brothers, for instance) it could have been much funnier and a lot better.

Very rushed sequel,"Like the jokes were just the first that came to their mind and they started filming before having them all figured it out. A lot of the gags are repetitions of the original, and the new ones, based in the new characters, weren't particularly funny.Also there is no clear narrative, so the gags seem more random this time, and because of that, less funny and the movie overall less entertaining.In the end, its just not good at all at anything, but in the middle of all the bad, there is one amazing character with fatally too little time. David Cross plays the by far most fun character in the movie (and all ""Scary Movie"" movies). Every single second on screen with him is priceless.

Untitled,"Scary Movie 2 is completely different than the first film. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, but am willing to admit that the first one did have some funny jokes or sight gags. My biggest problem with the first one, overall was the lack of any real plot and the jokes that fell flat, which could have very well made up for the choppy plot. The second film has a _lot_ of flat jokes, although I will admit some of them were pretty funny, the crudeness has come down to an modified on steroids version of ""Home Alone"" - some of the films they make fun of aren't really too clear and stray too far from the orginals to really be parodies of them- The Mummy parody was unclear with a skeleton chasing them around? And the Sabrina The Teenage Witch parody was also unclear, with the cat fight and the ""Rocky"" ending? It was like a giant saturday night live episode- some funny, some not. But people will love this movie anyway, I saw it in a theatre filled with people laughing so loud, I may have to see the movie again, if for the sole purpose to really hear all of the jokes, or what the hell is going on. Just an added note- the script was pretty awful, but most of the perfomances were really pretty good, like Chris Elliots - even if the script seemed like it was written by a bunch of guys sitting down with a case of beer and Attention Deficit Disorder.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Some are actually ones that were used in the last film (I guess Miramax thought you can't go wrong with semen and genitals), but while some might say that's a bad thing, I guess if the shoe fits, and can make you cringe as well, it's good.

What a disappointment,"When I first heard there was going to be a sequel to Scary Movie I was excited. The first one was hilarious. I like the Wayans brothers, and I think they are pretty damn funny. Theres just one problem: When the Wayans are good...they're really good, but when they're bad...they really suck...HARD. A good example of that is when Shawn and Marlon hosted the MTV Video Music Awards..they stunk it up. Scary Movie 2 starts out ok. The parody of ""The Exorcist"" is done well, but it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. The big problem with this movie is that the unfunny scenes drag on WAY too long. Marlon's character is really annoying and not funny at all. That cursing parrot is extremely stupid and gets old very quick. The scenes don't flow together well either. It looks like they wrote the script in 3 days. I did laugh pretty hard at some parts, but most of the scenes were painful to watch and I felt bad for them. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but they made it impossible. What happend here Marlon, Shawn, and Keenan? Didn't you take the time to watch this thing before you put it out there? The casting was also a huge mistake. Chris Elliot is a funny guy (sometimes), but he sucks in this film. Don't even get me started on Tori Spelling, I'd rather watch my dog lick himself then watch her. Another big problem is that none of the characters die! Thats what made the first one so good...the parts where they got killed were hilarious. This was a huge disappointment. What is going on with comedies these days? The past couple years have delivered some of the biggest let-downs ever. Such as ""Little Nicky"", ""Joe Dirt"", ""Freddy Got Fingered"", and now ""Scary Movie 2"". Please Hollywood!...For the love of God! Take your time while making these movies, and make sure they are atleast funny before they are released.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not much different than the original,"Very quickly and seemingly only one year after the large success of Scary Movie, it was no surprised a sequel was coming. It made have been a mistake since this film made much less at the box office than Scary Movie.Found Scary Movie 2 to be a slight upgrade from the original in terms of comedy and overall setting. Though there are somethings about the original which made it better. Mainly spoofing the Haunting, the plot comes very quick and doesn't seem to take long to settle. The caretaker in the house is quite creepy, though with some funny gags. A talking crass mouthed parrot is one of the highlights.After reading other reviews, most seem to believe Scary Movie 2 as rushed and a downgrade from the original, though one's opinion is slightly different. The same original cast is brought back with added some newer ones.Scary Movie 2 does feel very short with a runtime of only 83 minutes (without end credits it's about 75 minutes), so everything that happens is crucial.As a rewatch 04/07/23' and watching this sequel almost directly after rewatching the original. Can see as to how the original Scary Movie is better than this sequel. This film isn't as funny, witty or clever in its jokes. The supporting cast aren't as great as the characters from the original. The plot is weaker and not as suspenseful or overall enjoyable. Still some solid moments and the film is relatively short. Rating changed from 4 to 3.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brainless and funny spoof,"There are a lot of reviews bashing this movie but I think if you go into the theatre with an open mind for a new movie (this sequel has a slightly different feel from the original)and don't take it too seriously (these kind of movies require no real brain use) you will crack up at some of the funniest and most extreme sight gags to grace the screen in a while. I find the opening 'exorcist' spoof to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen, more so than the rest of the movie or it's prequel. James woods does a great job (this is his least serious role I've seen him in, I'll always remember him as Max Renn) but his and Andy Richter's characters are only in the opening sequence. The most memorable characters from the original return, although most of them died in the first one, but in this movie they are more than the simple straight copy from another character in a scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer movie. In this movie the characters, being in a completely different spoof, have more of an identity. With this sequel being pretty much as gross and extreme as the original (I was just glad ms. man didn't return) it's still not for little kids, although I'm sure tons of little kids will end up seeing it anyway. The acting gives me a lot of respect for the actors and actresses, because just not every actor in a big budget Hollywood movie is willing to do such self-demeaning gross-out humor (like the Cindy character). The Wayans were lucky to find such great and willing actors/actresses because performing a lot of their jokes (in what millions of people will see) is not easy to do, and for that I give them respect. I laughed very very much when I saw this movie. One thing that may hold back a viewer's laughs: you need to have seen a LOT of movies to get most of the jokes, most importantly: The Haunting (1999), Poltergeist, Hollow Man, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Hannibal. Oh man, I thought this movie was hillarious.  Best gag: The exorcist's reaction to seeing the little girl's head spin around. It is a simple and fast joke, yet it was hillarious.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"It honors its predecessor, but it is neither as good nor as funny.","This teen film (one of the most abominable cinematographic genres I know) was made to parody some well-known horror films, just as it had happened to the film that preceded it. This time, the most obvious victims are the famous ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Haunting"". I don't know to what extent it was a predictable sequel, but the fact is that it seems to have honored the initial film, even though the formula is not so interesting and is already more difficult to bear.The film is more of a satire on horror films, made to entertain young audiences with easy laughter, eschatological jokes and a thousand of allusions to sexuality, in its several options and variants. Unlike its predecessor, which seemed to me a kind of ""guilty pleasure"", capable of even pleasing those who don't like this type of humor, this film was not so successful: it will almost certainly please everyone who loved the first one film, but the same is not guaranteed for audiences that are already more demanding with the humor they consume, or who have a loathing for ""teen"" films. The reason for this is simple: it is not as fresh, nor as funny as the first film, and there are lots of perfectly boring or predictable jokes.The cast is again led by Anna Faris, again in the shoes of Cindy, and she does as good a job as in the first film except that it's not as fresh or brings anything really new, and sometimes the character was overly sexualized, the that removed the stupid na√Øvet√© that made her funny. Another actress who is returning is Regina Hall, but she manages to be even more funny and iconoclastic than in the first film. Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans keep the same record with less interesting results. Tori Spelling does not bring anything special or interesting. Kathleen Robertson is a walking pair of breasts and Tim Curry isn't funny at all.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Worthy Of Its Predecessor,"I loved ""Scary Movie."" It was so absolutely stupid it was hilarious. I still laugh whenever I see it, and I had been so looking forward to an opportunity to see this next installment. My advice to all of you: don't tarnish your memories of the first with this abysmal sequel.One accepts that by the very nature of the series as a parody the story will be stupid, the acting deliberately bad and the humour silly. That was the case with the first movie, but in the first movie it was funny; it worked. Here, it's lost its edge. That's the problem with parodies. It's hard to do them more than once and keep them funny. This reminds me a bit of the ""Airplane"" movies spoofing airline disasters. The first one was great, after that - why bother? Now, sometimes the parody format can work in a sequel. I'm thinking of the ""Naked Gun"" movies or ""Austin Powers."" But ""Scary Movie 2"" doesn't cut it as a worthy sequel. I'm not sure that I even broke a smile the entire way through.While most of the cast is back (including Anna Faris as Cindy, around whom the sequel also focuses), I have to say that I really missed the character of ""Doofy"" from the original, and there was no one in this cast to really fill the hole that was left. And this movie needed something to recapture the fun of the first.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
More of the same (rubbish),"Despite finding the original Scary Movie an incredible disappointment I was dragged to see this much-of-the-same sequel.The opening 10-20 minutes are actually quite funny; there are hit-and-miss moments but generally the jokes hit the spot.  I found myself laughing at both the Exorcist parodies and the cringingly disgusting ""Caretaker"", and was preparing myself to be pleasantly surprised.  However I should have known better and the film quickly descended into the same boring junk as the original.What is so infuriating about sitting and watching a film like this is how you can watch it and KNOW in yourself: ""I could write something funnier than this"".  'Spoofing' is one of the easiest forms of humour yet the writers of these Scary Movie films still seem to be able to miss the spot on so many occasions.  The majority of the jokes are lame and predictable and I felt embarassed being amongst fellow adults who were laughing hysterically at the most pathetic scenes.  The makers have also managed to miss many obvious comedy moments which - while being predictable - would have at least added some generally amusing moments to this weak attempt at a spoof.I was also ashamed to see the amount of scenes that had been stolen from other films.  I am not talking about the parts that had been spoofed but rather the bits that had been taken straight from other COMEDY movies, such as the cat attacking Cindy (remember There's Something About Mary, anybody?).  And why was this film given an 18 certificate when it was clearly designed to be enjoyed by viewers in the lower-age teen bracket?I am a young adult who enjoys 'toilet-humour' comedy films, but I did not enjoy this.

What a disappointment. Don't bother with this one.,"I'm a movie nut and like just about everything so it takes a lot for me to not like a movie.  But SCARY MOVIE 2 achieves that.  This is very unfortunate because the first one was so good.There are some humorous moments in 2 but overall the ball was dropped and never recovered.  After watching this film, I basically feel they must have thought to themselves, ""Gee, the first one did so well we could just throw this one together and toss it out there and it will do well just on the merits of the first one.""  And based on the first weekend gross that maybe what happens.It basically felt like the just threw the movie together without any real thought for the script at all.  I don't they think they gave any real attention to detail, writing or anything.  This is very sad because one of the best types of film genres there is, is parody.  Look at the NAKED GUN films.  The original SCARY MOVIE was excellent but number 2 just tanks.Strangely enough, I hope they do a number 3 because I think there is so much good material to use but I hope they decide to give it some time and thought and try to actually make it good instead of just tossing something out there for a quick buck.  Based on the $35mil it made on it's opening weekend (and I expect a fairly low budget), I'm sure this one will make money but I'd be willing to bet that it won't come close to the first when all is said and done.  After a big opening weekend and, I expect, a mediocre second weekend, I am expecting this one to drop out of site and go to video quickly.Personally, I feel that if you haven't already seen it, then don't bother. If you really feel you must see this one, then wait until it comes out to rent.  Or better yet wait until it's on HBO or Showtime (or whoever ends up with it).

Send Hollywood the right message: Do not pay to see this film!,"Like a bushel of peaches left in the sun, Scary Movie 2 quickly breaks down into a stale, discolored, and distasteful piece of film garbage. Unfortunately for those who were lured into seeing this film do to a lack of quality movie alternatives, Scary Movie offers no reprieve from what can only be described as a lackluster summer.It pains me to learn that a movie of this poor a caliber has made over $52 million and that somewhere in that total my $7.50 has been included. A box office take that large will only encourage more ill-conceived sequels. And dare I say it...a second sequel to Scary Movie! I can only hope that will not come to fruition and if it is made people will not see it. And that is why I took the time to submit this comment: Out of hope that people will read this review and others like it and choose to not give their $7.50 to those responsible for this completely awful film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just like the first..,".. Although, it was to be expected. The same goes for this movie being made. The poster for Scary Movie reads ""..No sequel."" but it was bound to happen given it's opening gross. Even though the sequel offers the same crude humor and cringe worthy moments it doesn't make it a bad film. If you've seen the first you know what to expect, so you have the option to ignore Scary Movie 2.I found the only thing dissapointing about Scary Movie 2 was the deleted scenes on the DVD. In my opinion they were the funniest, and unfortunately, Regina Hall appears in them all. I felt her role in Scary Movie 2 was much smaller than it was in the first film and her best moments were cut. Anna Faris and Tori Spelling also had classic moments erased which would've made the film less similar to the first.Overall the movie doesn't dissapoint as long as you know what you're in for. If you think you're about to see something original you're kidding yourself. The fact that it's a sequel didn't do it any favours, but it delivers just what you'd expect.... whether you enjoy it, or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Exorcist skit was the funniest!,"Throughout the movie, it was funny as hell! But, it was not as funnier as the original ""Scary Movie.""  The best part in the movie was ""The Exorcist"" skit.  Everybody, including Father Harris was singing ""Shake That Ass"" by Mystikal, the demon girl was p***ing on the carpet for 1 minute, Father McFeely was screwing the demon girl, he shots her, out comes the title ""Scary Movie 2"" and there's Cindy Campbell and Shorty Meeks (the funniest character in ""Scary Movie 1 and 2."")  Also, another funny part was when Cindy was singing ""Graduation"" by Vitamin C (a.k.a. Collen Ann Fitzpatrick) and Collen tells her to shut up on the radio.  But, aside the sexual gags and gross humor, other than that, it was a great movie.

I'm really getting old....,"This film although being so idiot, had a successful release and provided what the audience truly wanted from it: laughs.The conversations between the characters are so stupid that makes it funny. ""Scary Movie 2"" is basically a spoof of all the things in our society: horror movies, teenagers, selfishness, proud, drugs, women's seduction on men and the constant seek for sex. It's funny the way they approach the women's seduction on men, that thing that makes men say yes to all the girls ask.Cindy Campbell should have won some Oscar for being the dumbest character ever!! Anna Faris really knows how to interpret this kind of persona!And you see, this film is unbelievably 9 years old.. the jokes are still current and they'll probably make you laugh (if you've seen the movies spoofed), so give it a chance if you didn't see it yet.

The new incarnation, while keeping the same sort of gross-out humor, remains fresh and interesting through its entirety. However much though that Scary Movie 2 is a comedy, it's a twice as good parody.  Instead of attacking the slash movie genre however, Scary Movie 2 goes for the heart of horror movies such as, The Haunting, House on Haunted Hill, and The Exorcist.  The Exorcist provides one of the best parodies in the film's opening segment.  While Scary Movie 2 isn't the best movie to see for cinematography or art direction (see A.I.), it does however provide a good laugh for teenagers and teenagers at heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Shawn Wayans was hillarious as not gay Ray. Marlon Wayans as Shorty was also a blast. Every scene he was in he was funny. Regina Hall i just couldnt get enough of she was the funniest girl in the movie behind Tori and i just loved her. Natasha Lyonne was very good as Jasonia. James Woods was funny as the preist.

The 2nd one, only had 1 of the 2 groups writing it, hence why it was slightly not as good.But this film is funny.  You must look at the films that it's making fun of. It's not the slasher films.  This time around, they're making fun of ghost films.  This is why there isn't as much gore and gross out jokes.  The ghost films simply didn't have that in them originally, so there's no reason to have them in this film.Those people who hated this movie should just shut up and let those who liked it write reviews.

Hilarious,"Like most sequels, ""Scary Movie 2"" was not as funny and raunchy as the first instalment, but nonetheless, it was still absolutely hilarious.  At one point, I laughed so hard that my eyes watered.It's a bit loopy that nearly the whole gang came back to this movie, especially since the majority of them died during the first movie.  This is just their way of making fun of movies that lack continuity.Overall, it was a great movie (a ""10""), just not as good as the first.  It was definitely better than any other movie out recently.If you enjoy movies that portray unrealistic circumstances and (extreme) humour (i.e., the Naked Gun, Hot Shots, Airplane, etc. movies), then this one is for you.

Help Me Again Because I have fallen again and I can't get up!,"Starring: Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Chris Elliot, Tim Curry, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Masterson, Tori Spelling, David Cross and James DeBelloRated R for Strong Sexual and Gross Humor, Graphic Language and Some Drug ContentGenre: Horror/Comedy/MysteryStar Rating: **** out of 5This is the second installment of the Scary Movie series with more spoofs and crazy stuff! As we left off from the first Scary Movie the survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting. So this movie spoofs ""Charlie's Angels"", ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""13 Ghosts"", ""Paulie"", ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""The Poltergeist"". One of my favorite parts in the movie is where Cindy is driving in her car and listening to Vitamin C's song ""Graduation"" and Cindy is singing along to the song very badly so Vitamin C on the radio tells her to shut up and let her sing! Another funny part I liked was when Anna, Theo and Brenda were going to fight Hanson the guy with the funny looking hand, the three girls where running down the stairs while changing into their Charlie's Angels costumes and then when they come down you at first see them with their underwear and then they run back to change into their costumes. Another part I liked was the part where the group was with Dwight and he was handing out their items to defeat the ghosts and Brenda asks if there where any communication systems like walkie-talkies but instead all he had was just a line of string with two dixie cups on both sides! Another funny part was Shorty was teaching Cindy how to be all ghetto. I like this as well as the first one! Another thing I liked about this movie is that Tim Curry is in this movie and I think Tim Curry is hilarious and a good actor.BOTTOM LINE: FUNNY AS WELL AS THE FIRST AND I'M STILL LAUGHING!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

They've Done It Again,"This movie is in the same boat with Scary Movie 1. It has the bad jokes out-numbering the good ones, some missing jokes they could have done but didn't and some jokes that lasted too long (the scene with the basketball). The sex jokes are seemingly toned down as are the body fluid jokes, but then they must have used up most of them in the first movie. The Excorcist/Amityville Horror spoof at the top of the movie was funny, almost a rip-off from Repossessed with Linda Blair, but it may have done a lot more damage to the Catholic church than the series Dave Allen at Large. Anna Faris is as cute as always, but she is embarrassing herself in some of the scenes. Calling her animal fighting moves for one and in her spoof of the cat fight scene from the Legend of Hell House are two examples. Kathleen Robertson is an obvious sexpot, but Tori Spelling ruins every scene she is in. Annoyingly grating as a middle-aged college student, she just doesn't belong in this movie. Regina Hall, Shawn and Marlon Wayans steal every scene they are in, and Chris Elliott and Tim Curry show the more tolerable range of their talents. The disability jokes between Elliott and David Cross are a bit tactless and tasteless and Chris Masterson is funny to watch in this full feature away from his role as a Malcom in the Middle second stringer. For me, the ghost effects are superb even if some of the simulated phenomenon was too over the top. I am definitely waiting for a Scary Movie 3; I only wish I could star in it too !",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I had to write a review because 4.9 is a disgrace,"I cannot work out how on earth this had been rated so low but the only conclusion I can come to is a lot of people mustn't have a sense of humour. I cant tell you how many times I was in fits of laughter at this film, from the very first Exorcist scene right until the end. I will admit there is a few moments that are to stupid but that is no way enough to stop me from giving this a 9. I am just going to give you an idea of how many things I can think of off the top of my head that are hysterical. Firstly the Exorcist scene, the red dress scene, the wheel chair V hand scene, the I.T the clown scene, Sydney escaping form the panic room scene, the Hannibal scene and like I said that is off the top of my head. I think who ever watches this knows they aren't going to get a well written masterpiece but this is a simple story filled with so many good jokes that it is worthy of much higher than 4.9. I can honestly say I have watched this about 12 times and still laugh at all the best one's. Just give it a try, I think its the best out of the whole series. The 1st one is good, this 2nd one is brilliant, the 3rd one is good but the 4th one is a let down (apart from the Tom Crusie scene at the end, that is genius).",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent comedy movie,This Movie was a fantastic example of gross-out comedy. I love the Wayans and think that they are a great bunch comedians.

Funniest movie I've ever seen...,"OK, now that I've got your attention...  If you thought the first movie crossed all boundaries of taste and morality, you have no idea what you're in for.  To enjoy this film, you must have the sickest sense of humor possible.  Any line that could possibly have been crossed was, and any attempt to exploit a scene for all it was worth was taken.  Many of the ""bodily function"" jokes take place out of nowhere and make absolutely no sense, but that's what makes this movie so funny.  It's quite obvious that Wayans made no attempt at a coherent story and put forth no effort in terms of plot and character development, but this film doesn't need them.  Like I said, this movie will offend many and disgust even more, but if you can put your political correctness aside and check your morals at the theatre entrance, you'll have the time of your life.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Funny Sequel!,"Scary Movie 2 is a pretty funny sequel to the first film even though it may be a tad worse than the first one. This film seemed a little rushed but still had the same jokes from the first one. I was happy to see Anna Faris return as the clueless girl because she's pretty hot.This movie parodies films like The Haunting, House on the Haunted Hill, and Charlie's Angels. It's about a group of college friends who stay in the same haunted house for a so-called college project.There were a bunch of stars here that made this movie funny such as James Wood and Chris Elliot.I liked all the spoofs here.

The Wayans brothers have done it again!,"Scary Movie 2 was by far just as funny as the first. Most sequels never live up to their predecessors. However, a parody such as this one exceeded all expectations I had. It definitely kept me laughing. This film not only poked fun at horror flicks (new and old) but also other comedy and action flicks from the recent years-much like the first did. The kids this time (minus Shannon Elizabeth, Lochlyn Munro, and Jon Abrahams characters) gather with some new friends and are tricked by their professor into spending the night in a haunted house (sounds like The Haunting, right?). This scenario in itself is destined to be humorous. Don't try to look for meaning in the opening Exorcist parody scene. There isn't any. It's just there mainly there for added comedy. If you are looking for a good, rolling on the floor laugh, Scary Movie 2 is the summer movie to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Response to Critics,"First of all, the Scary Movie series is not to be taken too seriously. I see people all the time whinging about its quality and its humour. This movie is only designed for a certain audience:those who like to watch a movie and have fun at the same time! I mean, how funny was the scene where ""Reagan"" spins her head around and James Woods does a runner? If you can't see the humour in that, there is something definitely wrong. Sure, the movie might not be at the same level of quality that Pulp Fiction or the Godfather are at, but it is a damn fine p***-take of many films.

"This time, the concept actually works...","Scary Movie 2 is a far tamer version of Scary Movie, but this time, the gags are actually funny.  The first Scary Movie was too much, both in shock value and in concept.  A parody of a parody, littered with parody that Scary Movie 1 was made the movie cumbersome and boring.  SM1 tried to have a backbone, but the backbone crippled the movieLess really is more with this movie.  The storyline has no backbone, nor does it try, which puts the focus on the gags.  You're not going to get Schindler's List-like depth from this movie.  This is a fun movie, and a really fun one at that.The problem with tamer gags is that people will expect more from the sequel.

Garbage - To the fullest,"I sincerly and genuinely liked and enjoyed the first SCARY MOVIE. Reasons? Because it targeted so-called horror flicks that needed to be spoofed, such as SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER(ugh, what a dumb name).  And by doing so, they were successful.  However, SCARY MOVIE 2 was mainly targetting THE HAUTING and THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL which didn't set any milestones and weren't that popular.  Since I watch every movie and know quite a bit about them, I knew the movies that were being parodied but my friends did not(and I bet most of the audience didn't either).  I really didn't like this movie, it was just a jumble of garbage.  It's kind of like the Wayans brothers wrote different little stories and somehow put them together.  The only scenes I liked were the scences spoofing THE EXORCIST even though they were pointless.Overall, no good garbage.",,Anonymous,Horror
more of the same,"I went to see this movie tonight expecting more of the same stuff I saw in the first one and I was right.  Thankfully, I absolutely loved the first movie.  From the opening scene, I was laughing through the entire movie. The returning actors did a tremendous job in reprising their original roles; the new characters were also fabulous.  Spoofing movies such as Mission: Impossible 2, The Exorcist, Hollow Man, The Haunting, Hannibal, What Lies Beneath and Charlies Angels made the movie that much more funny.  Some people may not like its gross-out humor, some people may say that it was a waste of time to go, but I'll tell you one thing...The Wayens Brothers are gonna be laughing all the way to the bank.",,Anonymous,Horror

scary how bad this film is...,"What a step down from part 1.  I didn't totally enjoy that first installment, but it only just barely missed being on my DVD ""to buy"" list. I knew about 15 minutes into to this one that there was NO WAY I'd have to consider whether or not to add this to my collection.  Aside from the fact that it's not as funny, the direction and editing are atrocious.  Angles where the actor is nearly out of the frame or shots that last literally half a second.  Wayans has directed a number of movies, so who knows why he dropped the ball here and made this look like a student film.  But, of course, above all else, you have to focus on the lack of laughs.  The targets this time around were either too old (""Poltergeist"" was damn near 20 years ago people!) or too unknown (did more than 10 people actually see that crapfest, ""The Haunting""?).  Then when they stray away from horror all they do is copy something instead of parodying it.  The ""squeaky cleets"" basketball commercial is basically just re-shot, and the ""Charlie Angels"" stuff looks like that movie's scenes.  Or they just throw in confusing and out-of-place moments like the idiotic wheelchair battle (what the hell was that supposed to be anyway??).  Only three cast members return, like poor Anna Faris, a cute and talented actress, who is reduced to bugging her eyes and dropping her mouth every other scene.  The unfortunate young girl appears to be trying hard, given the junk script she's working with.  And when they can't come up with witty lines for her, they reduce her to getting put downs, or touches, upon her breasts, as well as masturbating a guy till he bombards her with gallons of sperm.  Yep, that's right!  They even resort to ripping THEMSELVES off here!  Everyone else is reduced to swearing (even a trash-mouthed parrot), or is just wasted, like cult fave Curry.  This whole thing smells of ""rushed into production"" as over 10(!!!) writers couldn't come up with more than 2 or 3 good jokes.  The opening 10 minutes featuring James Woods in an ""Exorcist"" spoof actually provide a bulk of the film's big laughs, but don't seem connected to this movie, seeing how awful the rest of it is.  And even they ripped off THAT too!  An ""Exorcist"" parody was done over 10 years ago in a film called ""Repossessed"".  Just one last sign that this belongs in the crapper of the year's worst.",,Anonymous,Horror

Rushed filmmaking drops the ball....,"Scary Movie 2 was made in less than a year.  The filmmakers, when they realized that they had a hit on their hands with Scary Movie, started on the sequel.  Obviously under studio pressure to deliver a summer movie, they finished with no time to spare. Editing was finished just under two weeks ago, getting the film to theatres on time.  One year from script to cineplex; sadly the rush to finish shows.  What could have been a cinematic masterpiece of bad taste, instead is a marginally funny, yet sloppy piece of filmmaking.Don't get me wrong - the movie has its moments.  Not wanting to give too much away, James Woods as a priest, a spoof of the Nike basketball dribbling commercial and an appearance from the infamous ""mangina"" are segments that had me rolling in the aisles.  However, the movie was not consistently funny, and with a thin storyline, 10 minutes without a laugh can feel like an eternity.The story in Scary Movie 2 is not as coherent as it was in the original. Many times it's not clear what the movie is trying to spoof, and the audience often ends up with seemingly unmotivated wackiness.The movie is short (less than 85 minutes by my estimates) and the pacing suffers.  Instead of following the time tested ""set 'em up and knock 'em down"" formula of comedy, the set-up often seems to be ignored or cut out. As a result, the pacing suffers; when the jokes come too quickly, all in sequence, they become harder to digest and lose their shock value.  In addition, the shameless rehashing of several jokes from the first film lends a cheapened feel to the production.The budget for this movie was twice that of the original.  Give this fact, the production value is inexplicably shoddy.  I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane in terms of technical skill, but the editing and special effects were so poorly done that it was distracting.  Several action scenes that could have been comedic goldmines were filled with jump cuts and other editing errors that made the scenes incoherent.  And we barely get a glimpse of the main ghost (Richard Moll! It's Bull from Night Court!) as if the filmmakers were embarrassed at how bad he looked.Bottom line: If you loved the first one like I did, you'll probably like the second one.  You'll be a little disappointed, but admittedly, it would have been hard to top Scary Movie, which I still think is one of the best spoofs I have ever seen.",,Anonymous,Horror
Disgusting good fun,"Having enjoyed the original upon originally seeing it in theaters (It loses something in the translation from theater to video), I, of course, was interested in the sequel. Like I'm sure anyone else would tell you, it's not award winning material, but it's not supposed to be, and anyone who's watching should know that. Personally, I prefer this over recent ""award-winners"" anyway. The story is, for the most part, a spoof of the recent remakes of ""The Haunting"", ""House On Haunted Hill"", and the classic ""Poltergeist"" and its sequel, however you can pick a haunted house movie made within the last two decades and it's probably in there if it made it to theaters, the beginning featuring a hilarious parody of ""The Exorcist"" (Ok, maybe not ENTIRELY the last two decades...) and ""The Amityville Horror"".I thought the movie was, for the most part, hilarious. I also REALLY appreciate that the Wayans bros. actually took the time to research this one a little with a few nods to the past, as well as the present instead of doing what they did with the original, which was focussing entirely on the Scream trend and calling it a ""slasher parody"" and having absolutely NOTHING involving the true greats which did themselves inspire Scream, like the Nightmare On Elm Street series, the Friday The 13th series, and all of the Halloweens with the exception of the tremendously bad H20. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc. But, I realize these films are put together for a quick laugh and not analysis under a critical eye for centuries to come, so such little annoyances can be quickly dismissed. After all, neither the Scream trilogy or the two I Know What You Did Last Summer films were that bad, mainly just garbage like H20 and Urban Legends...Anyway, enough of my Scream trend bitterness...Chris Elliot is at his all time greatest as Hanson, the butler. The character is based entirely around Julian Beck's ""Reverend Kane"" persona from ""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"", but my favorite character was definately Marlon Wayans' reprisal of Shorty, the loveable pot-head. Now that Doofy's gone, Shorty is really the only likeable character, which I also believe is intentional. The others are such repulsive, back-stabbing, consciously cruel sex fiends, you almost applaud their misfortune. Shorty, however, seems oblivious to pretty much everything. You can't really blame him for being an @$$. I miss Doofy...Anyway, Richard Moll played a great goofy villain...again. I think this casting decision was a nod to one of my favorites from 1986, the Steve Miner vehicle, ""House"". Another favorite, Tim Curry, pops up, as well as James Woods, replacing Marlon Brando due to illness just before shooting began.All in all a very funny picture except for one small thing...what the hell was Tori Spelling doing there? I don't think her character even had a name...or not a spoken name anyway. There are also a few missing characters which we'll hopefully see the return of in the event of a Scary Movie 3; Doofy, and Cindy Cambell's drug-dealing father. Interesting note on Rick Ducommun, who played Cindy's dad. He portrayed the character 'Art' in THE all-time greatest horror spoof, 1989's Joe Dante classic ""The 'burbs"". I recommend it, as well as Scary Movie 2.",,Anonymous,Horror

But, if you are spending $7.00 and expecting a plot from this movie in the first place, then you are in need of some serious help.

Dreary Movie,"This is a prime example of how not to make sequels. The original Scary Movie was not a great movie (or even a good one), but it did at least have guts and was able to supply audiences with a decent amount of laughs.Alas, Scary Movie 2 is a hack effort from K.I. Wayans, who showed a lot of true comic talent years ago with I'm Gonna Kit You Sucka and TV's In Living Color. This is the thinest possible material for a major sequel (oh, I forgot Speed 2), with gags not even measuring up to those of Leslie Nielsen flicks like Wrongly Accused or Spy Hard. There are a lot jokes thrown at the audience, yet only the occasional one actually gets a laugh...the James Woods/'Exorcist' spoof mildly manages to succeed.
