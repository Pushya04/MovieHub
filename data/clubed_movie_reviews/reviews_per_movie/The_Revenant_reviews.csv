One of the Best Movies I'll never watch twice,"The Revenant falls into the same category as Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" for me, in the essence of being a terrific movie but not something I think I can sit through a second time. In all these movies there are brutal sequences that cause emotional stress and disgust just watching because it is so REAL and GRIPPING. To think that events in these movies actually happened or that they could very well happen is too much for me to think about. Not to say that I did not enjoy this film thoroughly.The Revenant is a technical masterpiece that left me wondering ""How the hell did they do that?"" after many scenes and sequences. With beautiful cinematography and adroit camera movement this film is a visual magnum opus. It is apparent that the great minds that put forth this film are none other than the same ones that brought us Birdman: Lubezki and Inarritu. There are many long shots without cuts that are sprinkled throughout the film that add a sense of sophistication to it with the added bonus of predominantly location based shooting and natural lighting for the film , that can even make a novice film watcher raise an eyebrow at its complexity.The camera work is not the only noteworthy aspect of the film; The actors did a superb job executing their rolls. Many are raving about DiCaprio's performance but I was more of a fan of Hardy's brutal and gritty character Fitzgerald. Granted, half the words that came out of his mouth were unintelligible but he left no doubt in my mind that he was fully devoted to his role and bringing Fitzgerald alive instead of just Hardy playing a character named Fitzgerald. He was simply amazing.With all this said, there are still flaws in the film. At some points it was dragging on and moving too slow. It gave the impression that the film itself was cocky and wanted to show off all of its beautiful scenery and camera work too much. Then there was the ""he shouldn't be alive"" situations. Hugh Glass was a real guy that really did survive a bear mauling but in the film they make this guy practically immortal. There were too many instances where I was thinking ""he should be dead three times over right now, for me to enjoy the film as much I should have.All in all a great film that I only recommend to seasoned and mature film viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Spellbinding contrasts of nature's beauty and brutality,"The Revenant (2015), Alejandro G. Iñárritu's sixth film, is one of the most visually stunning statements ever put to film in cinema history.With a simple plot of chaos ensuing, and a father's quest for revenge, there is not much to the story, albeit I thought it had some emotionally engaging moments. Rather, it is The Revenant's technical merits that makes it truly unique.Naturally, DiCaprio's performance is in a class of its own, and what the entire crew endured is impressive, shooting the film only in natural lighting and thus extending production considerably. Rather, it is Iñárritu's expert vision for cinematography and ability to translate this vision to his director of photography which is the driving force in making The Revenant a special piece of cinema. The way in which Iñárritu takes the viewer on an intricate journey through America's nature is breathtakingly beautiful and brutal - this is truly a place a survival, chaos and solitude. The film's depiction of this is not for the faint-hearted with its gruesome violence.Highly recommended for its cinematic value.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Harrowing storytelling with a gorgeous cinematic backdrop, The Revenant is not for the faint of heart but will stick with those who make the journey.","Since the first trailers of this movie came out I knew it would be an experience. Following the incredible Birdman, director Alejandro G. Iñárritu had the public anxiously awaiting his interpretation of this bleak survival story, and much like Birdman, Iñárritu is also the star of this film. The Revenant has some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen. It's cold, visceral, and almost entirely authentic from the use of natural lighting to the barebones yet powerful storytelling. You can tell Iñárritu poured his heart into this project and it pays off tremendously. This is not to discount the incredible performances of DiCaprio and Hardy (DiCaprio finally getting his well-overdue Oscar), but it's hard to imagine the movie being so impactful had another director been at the helm.The story is as simple as it gets. In the 1800s, a group of settlers escape an ambush by an indigenous tribe, and during their travels one man gets separated from the group and gets brutally attacked by a wild bear and subsequently left for dead by his team. It's a revenge story more than anything. What it also highlights is human perseverance and the will to live. The things that happen to this man are truly horrific and difficult to watch. I'm not sure what parts of the story were embellished or Hollywoodized, but this film sucks you into this world and puts you right alongside this fatally wounded man desperate to survive. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heart-wrenching performance as Hugh Glass, expressing a wide range of emotions despite the limited dialogue. Tom Hardy is also phenomenal as one of the most vile, wretched human beings on the planet. This guy is despicable to the core, and you forget you're watching Tom Hardy at times because he's completely absorbed in the role. The supporting cast is great as well despite their small time on screen. As far as performances and cinematography goes, The Revenant is flawless.What prevents this from getting a perfect 10 is one particular storyline that I didn't think was needed, and it involves the wife of Hugh Glass. She's never developed as a character but she appears intermittently in visions and dreams and it almost sucks you out of the movie for a second because of how intense the main narrative is. But this is a very small gripe. From beginning to end this movie had me on the edge of my seat, my jaw on the floor and my eyes glued to the screen. The Revenant is definitely not for everyone, but it's impossible not to appreciate it for the breathtaking cinematic achievement that it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
In the Bleak Mid-Winter...,"In a cold and bitter land the pelts are gathered, in these times and in this place it's quite a hazard, as the indigenous attack, many find arrows front and back, as they seek to find a daughter who's been taken. An escape leads to a boat and then a hike, where Hugh Glass becomes the victim of a strike, from a rather angry bear, who pokes, prods, rips, shears and tears, leaves him motionless and looking quite deathlike.And so begins a tale of revenge and retribution, of persecution and those with an incredible constitution, in conditions as bleak as any opposing restitution. Great performances all round, especially the two adversaries, from a great director who can spin a yarn, through cinematography that really captures your imagination, and leaves you grateful for the home comforts you have today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Absolutely brilliant, one of Iñárritu's and Di Caprio's best","'The Revenant' to me is one of 2015's best films and deserved its hype, its critical acclaim justified. It is easy to understand why the audience reaction is more divided, but to me the low ratings are too harsh. The visuals, direction and acting are so brilliant that even if the film didn't impress me it still would have gotten no lower than a 4 or 5.Its best assets are the visuals and direction. Simply put, 'The Revenant' is one of the best-looking films of the year and a thing of sheer beauty. The settings are rich in atmosphere and the lighting remarkably natural, but it's the cinematography that shines brightest, it's both intimate and immersive. Iñárritu's direction is even better than in his outstanding direction in 'Birdman', some of the best direction of the year.Acting is marvellous, everybody showing great commitment. Leonardo Di Caprio got his only Oscar for his performance here and it was more than well deserved in one of his best films and performances, a performance of emotional intensity and honesty that is most agonisingly poignant. Tom Hardy excels in bringing brooding menace to his role, and Will Poulter is impressive too.'The Revenant' has much more to it than those things. The action is brutally tense and the story, while deliberately paced and very simple, immerses the viewer in how gripping it is, being intense and emotional. The characters are strongly realised.Film fares least in the script which is not bad at all but occasionally a little garbled. This is such a minor criticism however and not enough to bring down my rating.In conclusion, brilliant film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Survival,"A favorite era of mine for film stories has always been the mountain man era in the American west. No white people in great numbers, just single shot weapons, they were the ones outnumbered so survival against the Indians was far more an even struggle than in the post Civil War west. The Revenant by dint of its many nominations has laid claim to being the greatest film about that era ever made. It goes up against such items as Across The Wide Missouri, The Big Sky, and Mountain Men, Jeremiah Johnson all pretty good films.It would have been hard to deny Leonardo DiCaprio a Best Actor Oscar this time around. He's on screen for most of the time and with minimal dialog DiCaprio has to use facial expressions and body language to convey his emotions. He does it well and should share his Oscar with the cameraman who did all those closeups of him.The plot is best compared to another mountain man picture A Man Called Horse that starred Richard Harris. DiCaprio who was guide to the expedition of fur trappers is badly mauled by a grizzly bear and is after being toted for quite a distance is abandoned by Tom Hardy who claims he died. DiCaprio just wants to settle the score. Unlike Richard Harris he does not find a friendly tribe of Indians to take him in. His survival is his personal story.The Revenant also won the Cinematography Oscar for the shooting of the rugged winter country these men are in. It's so good the landscape, cold and forbidding, becomes almost a character in the film.Like The Old Man And The Sea was for Spencer Tracy The Revenant is a personal film for Leonardo DiCaprio. Unlike Tracy who had that magnificent speaking voice for the narration, no narration here. Just anguished expressions convey what DiCaprio is feeling.Leo got his Oscar and it was a deserved one for The Revenant. It's a great film, but very brutal at times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Visually beautiful, story-wise not on par...","The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, you believe are a part of Hugh Glass' journey through the wilderness and back to civilization. Also with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as the unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind.Story-wise, it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture. Glass' quest for vengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and is being more or less, chased himself. The story arc of the Indians quest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange. We also get to see the fur trappers p.o.v. that left Glass behind and the Captain way ahead of them. Which in my opinion takes a little bit of the magic of Glass' total perilous journey.All my stars goes to the beauty, production value and performances alone! Regardless, this is one of those overlong movies one like, but would not sit out for another viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Almost un-bearable pain,"I went to see ""The Revenant"" on the day that it was nominated for 12 Oscars, which certainly sets the expectation that it is going to be good – and it is. But I saw it described by DiCaprio as an ""epic art-house western"" and that's a good description. In the same way that Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" (this time last year) was unarguably a brilliant but not very mainstream film, so I think the Oscar buzz will attract a big audience to this movie who may find it a struggle to really enjoy. Because it is bleak unremittingly bleak, in terms of the landscape, the weather and the motives of the characters. It is also extremely violent but, unlike ""The Hateful Eight"" (another film I saw this week that was unremittingly bleak) the violence is much more gritty, realistic and visceral making the drama a lot more compelling.DiCaprio plays ""Hugh Glass"", an historical figure who was a legendary fur-trapper in the early 1800's and the central figure in this bear-related yarn. Although the story has been re-embroidered over the years, the 'facts' align with the film's basic story (there's a good ""Daily Telegraph"" article outlining this - see the link on bob-the-movie-man.com).Attacked and pursuing by local natives, Glass's party is striking across woodland when he is viciously attacked by a 500lb Grizzly bear. Although appearing mortally wounded, he is a highly respected individual and so is stretchered up by his boss Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). Unable to proceed further, Henry pays for the mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay with him, together with his half-Pawnee son Hawk and friend Bridger (Will Poulter), to die in peace. Predictably, Fitzgerald is not to be trusted, and Glass is abandoned in a shallow grave. If this is not enough, for other reasons we won't go into, Glass has even less inclination to keep his fellow trapper on his Christmas card list. Thus is set up a classic revenge movie, with Glass determined to stay alive to enact that revenge despite the enormous odds stacked against him.This is surely DiCaprio's year for his elusive Oscar as he turns in a cripplingly painful performance. It is clear that the suffering on screen is not all acting – it cannot be, given the inhospitable conditions in which the crew were filming (in Canada and Argentina). As examples he had to eat raw bison liver as well as suffering a much discussed Han ""I thought they smelled bad on the outside"" Solo moment. Despite having very few lines to deliver, DiCaprio is on screen for 90% of the time, and it is a bravura performance.Tom Hardy – also Oscar nominated – is also impressive as the villain of the piece, although for most of the time his lines might have well been delivered through his Bain mask for the sense they made. He is an inveterate mumbler.Domhnall Gleeson's performance is also compelling, adding a degree of goodness and compassion to the film that was so missing from ""The Hateful 8"". (Gleeson is surely vying this year with Ben Whishaw for the busiest mainstream film appearances after this, ""Ex Machina"", ""Brooklyn"" and ""Star Wars""). Finally Will Poulter gets a chance to shine in an A-grade mainstream dramatic movie and he well and truly makes that grade.Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu has to be commended for eschewing the use of green screens, insisting on live performances and in natural light to boot. Stylistically (and indeed story-wise) the film has many parallels with ""Gladiator"", with its effective and artistically constructed dream sequences. But the film is not without special effects, and these are phenomenal, most incredibly delivered during the relentless and gruelling bear attack scene: a seamless blend of live animal work and effects that make it horrifically believable.There is also some fantastic camera work (by Emmanuel Lubezki) of the ""how the hell did they do that variety"". Recalling his work in ""Birdman"" it's challenging to do single tracking shots of people walking through buildings. To do these same tracking shots during a pitched battle scene is just phenomenal. During one scene in this harrowing sequence at the film's start, the camera is on the ground filming a native galloping towards a victim, then the camera is seamlessly filming the rider as he gallops away. Astonishing.The only area I really didn't care for was the music, by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. A combination of droning strings and (later) some whiny ""Ligeti-style"" elements, it was in turns intrusive, gloomy and annoying. Music should largely stay in the background to set the mood. This didn't.Overall, this is a masterful film, but it is a slog and not a feel-good film to sit through. It also has significant violence which might not suit all viewers, with the final confrontation in particular being one of the most visceral fight scenes I've seen in years.By the way (I had to look it up) the definition of ""revenant"" is:noun1. a person who returns2. a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost.Now you know too – this public service announcement brought to you by One Mann's Movies!

Absolute oscar bait,"Yes the cinematography is stunning, that's very true. But it's also most of what the movie offers.

love this movie highly recommend.,"Finally saw this movie (yes 4 years late) and I understand why Leonardo won the Oscar, along with the many academy awards the movie and director won. It is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing, the whole cast (Tom Hardy is great here) is great. The costumes and weapons used (early 1800s) look so damn good. The story is very simple and not complicated. It is about revenge and surviving in the cold and icy wilderness of 1823. The action scenes are brutal and gritty, like they should be for that time period. Officially in my top 10 movies of all time. If you've never seen this film, do yourself a favor and rent it or buy it. It definitely deserves to be in your collection. Some people might not like all the spiritual stuff or reading subtitles (lots of Native American language here) but it is needed since there a lot of interaction with Native American tribes here.

Stunning,"Go and see this movie. In the cinema. As soon as possible.Simply put, it is an excellent story of family, revenge, survival, and nature.The Revenant is one of the most beautifully-shot films I have ever seen. I lost count of how many scenes I sat there in utter amazement, which is undoubtedly due to the brilliant directing and spectacular cinematography: there's no shaky-cam, no quick-cut editing, and a lot of incredibly complex shots which appear to have been completed in a single take. If all films were shot similarly to how the Revenant is, then the movie industry would drastically improve.The entire cast did a phenomenal job and they all deserve recognition for their performances; however, if Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar for his breathtaking portrayal of Glass then that will be the single biggest injustice of the year.Do not miss the opportunity to see this masterpiece on the big screen!UPDATE: I've read an unnerving amount of other user's reviews complaining about the plot. I can understand that the plot may seem a little basic or perhaps lacking at times; however, the plot is not what makes this film so excellent, and I feel as though those who failed to recognise this have seriously missed out. You don't just watch the Revenant: you experience it. Every single element from the music to the cinematography is cleverly concocted to draw you into the film and put you alongside the cast in the brutal wintry conditions. If you've not been drawn in due to being too concerned with the premise of the story, then I fear you've missed a truly enthralling and one-of-a-kind cinematic experience.UPDATE TWO: Leo won the Oscar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Eyecandy,"""The Revenant"" is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a long time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also to the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work. Frequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough terrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there are a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge story line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D).When I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great things I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the longer I was outside the movie the more I recognized that ""The Revenant"" is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in the cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home again.Still, the movie is definitely a must-see.

Revenge is a dish best served cold!,"It's a long movie, but when you watch it, you don't realize how time passes. The movie, which starts with an action scene, moves calmly and stagnantly for a long time, as if hypnotizing you. But even in this case, your eyes and soul live the nirvana of acting. There may be those who find the situation of the hero of the movie exaggerated, but remember that the will of a person who has a vengeance to hold on to life may be much more than that of a normal person. The finale is already awesome. I enjoyed watching it very much. You will feel the pain and the cold while watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Stunning cinematographic feat.  How on earth did they film that?,"If this wasn't such a fantastic piece of storytelling, I would be interrupting every three minutes to ask ""how the hell did they make that shot?"" Even if you know a lot about special effects, this film will have you scratching your head all the time.There are shots that start as close ups, go super wide, half way up a mountain and then close to something else miles away. There are interactions with animals like the bear, shot in a way that defies any cinematographic, animal training, prop, or other trick you can think of.I can't wait to see some sort of ""making of"" that will allow me to sleep at night when I understand how they did it all. Instead of that jerky, overdone, getting us all motion sick, hand-held camera, there is a wide angle system which sucks you into the action in a way we haven't see before.It doesn't matter if you don't like DiCaprio or dislike ""that type"" of movies. This is an awesome piece of work, worth watching regardless simply for the technical artistry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Linear survival tale in which revenge becomes secondary,"I haven't seen all of Alejandro González Iñárritu's films. Those I have seen were excellent or at least very good: ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"", ""Babel"" and ""Birdman"".When I saw the trailer for ""The Revenant"", needless to say, I immediately thought it had tremendous potential and got pretty hyped up about it. It showed gorgeous, naturally-lit cinematography, dynamic directing, a historical depiction of the early 19th century savagery, and what seemed to be quite a visceral performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.I thought that, with Iñárritu's name attached to it, this would be a much deeper film than what I ended up watching, at least in its depictions of history, first nations, and in its ability to exploit classic themes such as revenge and survival.Without saying that ""The Revenant"" is an empty shell (although a gorgeous one), Iñárritu's film fails to impress when it comes to depth, thanks to a linear and predictable narrative structure, one dimensional characters, and a revenge plot that never manages to be compelling to the audience.DiCaprio offers a demanding, physical performance with very little dialogue, but his character, always in survival mode, never reached me emotionally. All the agony grunting and wincing, enhanced by the costumes and make up sure make the character believable, but the script never allows the character to develop or to unfold anything that goes beyond an extremely narrow range of emotions. Very unfortunate.Tom Hardy is okay as the antagonist, another character that suffers from his development being jilted by the writers. This is an unfortunate mistake to make in a revenge-themed film, where the antagonist is supposed to nourish the quest. In ""The Revenant"", the antagonist is barely a background character that will leave the audience almost emotionless and neutral.The directing (Alejandro González Iñárritu) and cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki) are the highlights here. Visually, ""The Revenant"" is flawless. The framing of the shots, the camera movements and the snowy, low-saturation imagery are all gorgeous. Some scenes are absolutely incredible to watch.Editing-wise, Stephen Mirrione could have cut a few corners here and there. And this is coming from a movie enthusiast who sure appreciates a slow-paced film. Watching Hugh Glass walk through the endless forest was great, but you do see at least a dozen very-low angle shots of trees. They're just as beautiful as they're eerie, but slightly redundant at times.Overall, ""The Revenant"" is not a bad film. It just isn't a great one either. It does have its moments. Definitely a case of style over substance, ""The Revenant"" disappoints both as a revenge tale and as a meditation on the savagery of both man and nature. Plot-wise, its flaws keep ""The Revenant"" in a linear survival tale in which revenge becomes secondary.Too bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Powerfully Bleak & Masterful Film,"Take the direction of Alejandro González Iñárritu, combine it with the stunning cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki and toss in Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy for their acting charms and what do you get? An extraordinary and masterful film.Fresh off of 'Birdman,' Iñárritu moved straight on to 'The Revenant,' a western-epic inspired by the true-life experiences of frontiersman Hugh Glass in the winter-struck landscape of 1820s America. The film gained some notoriety in mid-2015 for its production problems and has thus been regarded one of the most challenging film shoots in the history of cinema. Rightfully so. The film opens with the soothing sound of running water, thrusting the audience into an almost meditative state, and then it strikes, an action-packed sequence ensues with a near single sweeping take. Now this is a spoiler-free review, so I'll leave the pleasure of viewing that scene to you.This film heavily evokes reactions from the audience and does so well, whether it's staring at the screen in awe or gasping at the visceral violence, if you face this film with the right attitude and expectations, it will be a thrill ride like no other. Lubezki has proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning. Supporting this is the score from the relatively unknown composers, believe me, when the sudden orchestral boom strikes your eardrums, it's mesmerising.The makeup, the direction, the editing, the visual aesthetics, and of course the performances from a hopefully soon-to-be Oscar winning DiCaprio, 'The Revenant' is a visual treat for those who appreciate cinema and for those who wish to just get absorbed by the immense landscapes and poetic justice Iñárritu has given it. This is, for me, a modern masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A Work of Art,"The Revenant was an incredible film, from start to finish. The cinematography was breath taking, and the acting outstanding. It's the only film to ever be shot in chronological order, which is not an easy task. Leonardo submerged himself in freezing waters, in 40 below temperatures, for the perfect shot. He ate a real, raw, and bloody buffalo liver, when he's a strict vegetarian. It takes 100% more acting skill to act alone, in the elements, with minimal dialogue, having to convey every emotion, and physical struggle, with your eyes, and facial expression, and body language, then it does to act in any other capacity. That is true acting. Roles like this are to be respected. They show an actors raw ability.The film was shot in all natural lighting in the Canadian rockies, in the middle of winter, and when the location was effected by a change in climate, production had to be stalled for 5 months while they moved it to the tip of southern Argentina to shoot the last few segments.The entire project from idea to finish, was 5 years in the making. This film is a work of art, paired with a beautiful score, that convey's every emotion.I've seen this film 3 times in theaters, and every time it gets better and better. You can't compete with a masterpiece like The Revenant.I live in Hollywood and work in the entertainment industry. I have been on countless film sets, and have worked with many actors and directors, I know how the industry works, and have witnessed first hand what goes into making a movie.

Leonardo DiCaprio said what needed to get said,"""The Revenant"" marks a big turn for both star Leonardo DiCaprio and director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Following up on his roles as maniacal tycoons in ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", DiCaprio plays a fur trapper abandoned in the snowed-in wilderness. It's intense enough knowing that this was a true story, but how they film it makes it even more so. Like ""Birdman"", the movie contains several long shots filmed in a naturalistic style to create a sense of realism. Hugh Glass's determination to survive and find those who abandoned him provides one of the most harrowing stories ever put on screen. Covered in blood, sweat and dirt, DiCaprio spends much of the movie not talking, keeping the focus on his actions. And by actions, I mean that you rarely see something this intense on screen.I'd say that the movie deserved its Golden Globe wins (but it repeatedly irritated me that the presenters kept mispronouncing Alejandro González Iñárritu's name). And while accepting his award, DiCaprio spoke up for the world's indigenous peoples and called on people to protect the environment from corporate interests. Indeed we should heed his call. In the meantime, definitely see ""The Revenant"". It's an experience like you can't imagine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A masterpiece...but would you really want to see it twice?,"It's a good question, given the nature of cinema, its transfer to streaming and television. This isn't a play being put on in the town square for one night only, after which the company's wagon rattles away to the next village (do things like that still happen?)Two and a half hours of raw, wintry misery, with some dream sequences and floaty camera nature photography that kinda reminded me of Terrence Malick. The story's basic premise put me in mind of Jeremiah Johnson (1972); Wiki suggests even more pertinent sources for comparison. The difference is that films like Jeremiah (dir: Sidney Pollack) wanted to tell a richer story and entertain the audience. I suspect the team behind The Revenant wants the audience to suffer for their however many dollars spent to sit in a chair, get bombarded by ads, and then watch cold, wounded, miserable people half freeze to death for 150 minutes. The Malicky images of nature's beauty, visions of the fallen looking like happy, carefree spirits, are so much arthouse padding.I don't see that much difference in what DiCaprio is doing in this movie from what Reeves does in the John Wick series. Essentially it's a one-note performance, only instead of urban jiu-jitsu here we get wilderness dragging and groaning across country, grimaces of pain and the avenger's mask of determination being common to both. Maybe that means Reeves deserves an Oscar too? I've always said, action movies that rely on physical fitness and a lot of careful choreography deserve a category of their own.I'll stick with Malick and Pollack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Visual Tour de Force with a Captivating Story,"Many films excited me towards the end of 2015 such as Star Wars VII, Spectre, The Hateful Eight but I must be honest I was most excited to see The Revenant. The movie follows a simple revenge/survival story with Leonardo DiCaprio being the focal point of it after being left for dead by his crew in the wilderness.From watching the teaser trailer last year, I could already tell that it would be visually stunning but after watching it I have concluded that it is more than visually stunning it is a visual achievement, there are scenes that will shock you and make yourself wonder how it was shot. There are many scenes in the movie that are shot in a ""Birdman"" fashion with the slow tracking shots with long takes however it never feels like Innaritu is milking on Birdman's visual success. The movie also looks very realistic in showcasing the grit and filth of being a frontiersman. The acting in this movie is also very good and DiCaprio puts on a very captivating performance which could very likely win him an Oscar. I feel as though Tom Hardy should also be recognized for his performance as he was excellent as well. However amidst all this praise I cannot help but feel as though the film has flaws. I feel as though the plot is very simple in essence and is just how DiCaprio's character survives and how he obtains vengeance. However I never feel as though the moral Innaritu was trying to portray at moments in the movie is fully expressed. It was almost like the film was going to go in a more morally conscious direction but was changed. However the movie is still one of the best I have seen in 2015 and is sure to win many awards.

Stunning locations and incredible aesthetics,"DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, for roughly 30 minutes, then allows the viewer to not have to hear his voice for the remaining 2 hours of the film. And I'm sorry to say that his attempt to illicit my emotions with just his expressions was a failure and only made me wish the bear had finished him off...sorry. Nothing about this performance screams Oscar, and none of his previous performances do either, which is why he doesn't have one!Tom Hardy plays Fitzgerald, your standard ruthless, racist, Texas d-bag, which he completely pulls off, with the exception of his voice. If he had hit his mark, then perhaps this was award worthy but instead, as with most of his other roles, he struggled with the accent and he succumbed to mumbling and incoherent speech. A shame really, so close to a perfect performance.Forrest Goodluck is perfect as Hawk, and honestly he could have pulled off main character status had the film been centered around him! He was flawless!!! I felt what he felt and all I wanted was more of all of it. This kid will have no problem getting work in the future.If anything the DP deserves an Oscar for the stunning locations and incredible aesthetics in this film but that unfortunately is all it deserves. Cinematography was definitely the 12th man that brought this film to its peak.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
You have to see this movie,"This was, in my opinion, one of the best movies of 2015. The way the movie was filmed was astonishing, the actors were great and the story was good as well. The film was shot using only natural light so all of the scenes in the movie look authentic. I have never seen a film shot so gracefully to the point where when each scene starts I am amazed again. Every scene feels like you are in it. And the bear scene that everyone is talking about, is mind-blowing. Honestly, I do not know how they did that but if you see the movie for nothing else, see it for the bear. The actors did very good as well. Leonardo DiCaprio has another stand out performance along with Tom Hardy who did great as well. Many people felt like DiCaprio did not show enough emotion for his role but I think he played the role perfectly for the type of character he was. I do not think this was his best performance but I also do not think this was his worst, it is one of his best. The story did not carry the film to me. I felt like it was a good story but the acting and the visuals of the movie really carried it.So,Story (How well the story was) -8.5Re watch (Are you able to watch this movie multiple times)-8.5Cinematography (How well the movie was made) -10Overall, 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Excessively violent, and yet manages to be boring","This film tells the story of a man in the 1820's, who sets out with a group of men for a fur trading expedition. He is attacked by a bear, then left for dead by his men. After he witnessed his son being killed, he sets on a long journey to live for revenge.There is so much buzz around ""The Revenant"" so I had high hopes for it. However, I was thoroughly disappointed after just ten minutes. It is excessively violent and graphically gory. I think there is no need for ten minutes of fighting and five minutes of bear attack, when one minute each is already enough to convey the message. Most scenes drag on and on, what could have been told in ten seconds are often dragged to minutes long.Another thing that I dislike is the fact that all actors have long unkempt hair, covering most of their faces. This makes character recognition an intense mental challenge! Thirdly, the story is not engaging or interesting. It only involves Leonardo walking around in snow most of the time. There is nothing to captivate me. I watched the whole 2.5 hours of ""The Revenant"", and I was thoroughly bored.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Masterpiece,"A tale of eternal desire to right those who have wronged you. Frontiersman Hugh Glass is part of a fur-trap expedition, things go awry when the crew is decimated by angry homicidal native's. The last of the crew continue on but when Glass is mauled by a bear he's left for dead only after fellow crew member & former confidant Fitzgerald inadvertently murders his son. Glass somehow recovers on his own, regains strength & although heartbroken goes on a undying path of retribution to avenge his lost son. The cinematography is a sight to behold, a relentless bleak & harsh world is uncovered. The landscapes are absolutely gorgeous & the sets & wardrobe were incredibly accurate to the time period. DiCaprio & Hardy were both incredible, both characters portray good vs. Evil so well. I personally love every minute of this movie & the rewatch got an added bonus being in 4k Ultra HD, it looks better than ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
DiCaprio Holds Together An Over-Rated But Watchable Movie,"I was surprised to discover that ""The Revenant"" was based on a true story - then disappointed to learn that it was only very loosely based on a true story - a lot of important details in the movie (like Glass's Pawnee wife and son) are simply not true, and the real story of Hugh Glass wasn't really a revenge story. What was true was the bear attack. I was familiar with the silly story about Leonardo DiCaprio (or really Glass, his character) being ""raped"" by the bear. That was utterly ridiculous. The movie made clear that this was a female bear with cubs nearby. Why anyone would start such a story is beyond me. It was a bear attack - a pretty vicious one that was very well portrayed. And, as I said, it's really the primary connection to the real story of Hugh Glass.Set in 1823, the movie starts strongly, with a depiction of an Indian attack on a group of American fur traders. That's very well choreographed. In fact, overall - including the depiction of the bear attack and the choreography of the Indian attack - the strongest part of the movie is probably the work of director Alejandro Inarritu. His work was excellent. All throughout the movie you see great camera work, excellent photography and spectacular scenery. All that is so good - and, in fact, it's almost too much. It seems to take over the movie at times. That's probably because the story as a whole didn't exactly enthrall me. The movie is set up as a revenge story, with Glass hunting down Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) - who had killed his half Pawnee son. As I said, that's fake, and really the movie doesn't emphasize the revenge element. This is really a survival story - and there are times when you wonder how Glass survived. How did he survive the wounds from the bear attack? How did he survive the raging river and waterfall? Why didn't he freeze to death once he got out of the river, soaking wet in the middle of winter with snow on the ground? How did he survive the plunge over the cliff? He's almost superhuman - the survival scenes are too unbelievable to make Glass a character you can really empathize with. There are also more than a few cringe worthy moments. There is that gruesome bear attack. There's Glass cauterizing his own wounds. There's Glass gutting the horse so he can crawl in to stay warm. Yeah. I was wincing a few times. But those are scattered throughout the story, and for long periods there's not much to fall back on but the scenery and photography. It's beautiful, yes, but some of it could probably have been taken out for the sake of making a tighter and more focused movie.Having said that, the story did grow on me as it went along and came closer to the climactic confrontation between Glass and Fitzgerald. I admit my attention wandered a few times, but I was never tempted to just step away from this. DiCaprio offered a basically one man show for extended periods, and was all right doing that. I've probably seen actors pull it off better than he did (Tom Hanks in Cast Away, James Franco in 127 Hours, maybe even Robert Redford in All Is Lost all come to mind) but DiCaprio was pretty good in holding it all together. And I did like the ending. The final scenes in which Glass finally confronts Fitzgerald were very well done. It wasn't true, but it was well done. Interestingly, I also found a pretty consistent spiritual theme running through the movie - which I wasn't actually expecting.I think this is a bit over-rated, but it was worth watching.

No spoilers here!,"I'm new to reviewing films and this is my first official one so I'll keep it short. The Revenant was undoubtedly an un-matched visual and artistic experience, the film won the Oscar for Cinematography and when you see the film it is easy to see why, every shot in this film is of nature I have heard there was no use of artificial lighting! Northern America has never been more grandly viewed than in this film. However the film also tells a fantastic story of Vengeance, trust and survival, it does all of this without ever feeling pretentious or over the top. Leonardo gives a brilliant performance and as we all know, this is Leo's first Oscar win, although he is criticised for a lack of dialogue, Leo makes of for this with his physical expression and stress. Action scenes in this movie are above anything I have ever seen, in a certain battle containing Tom Hardy (who also gives an outstanding performance) it was so hard to both watch, and turn away, and although there are limited major conflict scenes in this film (which never feels disappointment) every battle is so beautifully tense, brilliantly shot and choreographed, I can honestly say I had no idea what to expect and tried hard not to blink. Finally, I would like to say that this film is not for the impatient, the film often takes its time to display its epic cinematography which is obviously not for everyone. I will never give a 10/10, but this film got extremely close, definitely one of my favourite films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The cinematography,"A survive story. Impressive, în my case, for cinematography and acting. The physical huge effort of Leonardo DiCaprio, the way to give to his character fascinating nuances by Tom Hardy, the flavour of fairy tale because it is not adaptation of a biography but portrait of a super- hero. But, sure, the image is the mist important in this case. Maybe, too important, giving a sort of obvious aesthetism. But , sure, the Oscar of DiCaprio remains the mist powerful memoriu about it.

REVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED COLD....and COMPLICATED! (The Operative Word Here!),"If You LOVE Cinematic ""ONIONS"".... REVENANT is Your Movie!But Before diving in...
FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title's Content and Context...This Review is dedicated to my student and dear friend, Luisa Bacca, who has played a key role in focusing International Attention on the rights of Indigenous peoples in Colombia, especially here in Nariño, as a mediator in the ongoing Peace Process between the U. N. High Commission on Human Rights and the Colombian Government!Leonardo DiCaprio, upon his acceptance of his Golden Globe, used the occasion to express his concern for indigenous peoples and their portrayal in movies. At the time, this seemed a bit difficult to put into context, but now that I have seen the film, it is crystal!And I sincerely feel there are basically 2 ways to react to REVENANT... A straight up, Grizzly (No Pun Intended!) true-story Man vs. Nature Action/Adventure, take it exactly as it is reaction, or, an infinitely nuanced ""This Movie is a Metaphor"" approach...Need it be said that I am most certainly an Option B person!?!?!?That having been said, REVENANT is such an astoundingly overwhelming experience, it is a tad difficult to decide on a starting point!Director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu shows himself to be the perfectionist he is via the numbing, jaw-dropping beauty of the filming locations that provide the numerous impressive visual backdrops seen throughout. The list of locations includes Tierra del Fuego, Mexico, and various U. S. and Canadian ones! As to the veracity of the ""True Story"" aspect of this harrowing tale, who knows???Wikipedia mentions that Frontiersman Hugh Glass' (Definite Oscar-worthy performance by Leonardo DiCaprio) life and accomplishments were often prone to embellishments, and Punke's 2002 Novel apparently plays fast and loose with the truth. Aside from just what IS true and what isn't, Gonzalez Iñárritu has permeated every frame with a level of reality that is truly chilling, both literally and figuratively!In the early 19th Century...The U. S. was most certainly a very young, expanding nation that had doubled its territory just 20 years earlier through the Louisiana Purchase. REVENANT unfolds clearly accentuating the uncertainties of life in the Missouri Territory, where the only existing technological implement in your daily existence was your firearm...Oh, and probably, in Captain Henry's case, a pocket watch, one would imagine! Their fur gathering/trading expedition comes under surprise attack (Was there any other kind back then?) by considerable numbers of Arikara Indians, who consider their actions as justified, since, in their opinion, it is the trading expedition that is trespassing on Arikara territory.After both suffering and inflicting heavy losses, the expedition's survivors manage to raft away to safety. After cautiously biding their time on the river, they finally return to terra firma. Soon after, Hall has his ill-fated encounter with a grizzly bear, who, instinctively, simply was protecting her cubs. This scene is, quite honestly, spoiler-proof! No written words could ""ruin"" it for you! It is a bone-chilling vision that you really must experience for yourself! Most certainly, you will be scratching your head, as I and most others were, wondering ""Just how in the HELL did they do that!?!?!?"" Apparently, A Man In the Wilderness (1971) was also inspired by Hugh Glass and his ordeal...But I never saw it! There is a 1972 film, which came to mind a few times while viewing REVENANT...JEREMIAH JOHNSON, A Sydney Pollack Classic with Robert Redford in the title role!Some of you might be wondering, about now, if there will be any reference to elements mentioned in this review's title. Not to worry! My Review title should be ""CRYSTAL"", too, if you take the dualistic viewing approach mentioned early on here. To avoid crossing the Spoiler threshold, let it suffice to say that taking REVERANT in its entirety, it seems to speak to putting our treatment of indigenous peoples in the U. S. into some kind of more rational perspective. Personally, I found the ending to be rather spiritual and uplifting.....or Maybe it's just me!10********** ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!

Iñárritu's surprsing blockbuster.,"One year after the release of Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Oscar winning effort, Birdman, he and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki look to take their seamless, almost cut-free brand of cinema, from the ultra-intramural of their previous effort, and apply it to the diametric opposite; the wide-open, exhilaratingly earthy, extramural scene of a brutal 1820's Dakota. Following the mourning Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) traipse his broken body in pursuit of vengeance across the fledgling American frontier.Sometimes trippy, sometimes telluric, always proximal to the action of the unfolding events – for better or worse, this is oft poor Leo's bared, mud-clagged incisors. This new piece stays away from the naval gazing, creative existential crisis of Birdman, in favour of a surprisingly straightforward blockbuster romp; if that's what you want from it.Being an Iñárritu film, there is plenty going on beneath the clart cosmetic. Since its release, a number of those involved in the film have gushed about the West's treatment of indigenous peoples; if bringing this subject to a wider discourse was the film's intention, I must admit, I find myself at a loss to have recognised it. While we are subjected to a very corporeal painting of atrocities against such peoples, the film never seems to go beyond a 'we did this and we should feel bad' level of insight. The focus of the goings-on is much more on the Caucasian players, namely the fur- trapper Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio).The ill-starred Leo, over the course of the film, falls and, quite literally, hits every branch on the way down. In one of the film's most indulgent moments, it does fall prey to crossing into self-parody as it turns into a DiCaprio suffer-a-thon. A rather inapt laugh was uttered when upon seeing what next disaster was befalling the protagonist, a mental image was conjured of Homer falling for a second time into Springfield gorge. This is done with relatively early on in the film's substantial 156 minute running time, however, and soon gets back on track, never missing a beat until its climax and allowing Leo to show some range beyond exhausted, in pain, getting spittle on the lens and so on.The manner of DiCaprio's performance leads me to address the bison in the room: The Academy Awards. The timing of the film's release, along with the casting of the 'always the bridesmaid never the bride' Leo is a shame, because the film stands to be notably excellent when viewed in a vacuum, whether it boards the band wagon of Academy attention or not. The idea that an actor must suffer 'x' in order to get the gong they so crave is a shame; perhaps, without that unfortunate, extraneous thorn in his mind, Leo would have given a more nuanced, less grimacing and frothing approach to the character. Tom Hardy as the wild eyed, mumbling, but brilliant John Fitzgerald and Dohmnall Gleeson as the sober and solemn Captain of the beleaguered band, have the room to fully showcase their expertise in their craft and really impress. Will Poulter equally inspires and shows competence far beyond his years as the baby-faced voice of morality amongst growingly desperate men.A somewhat unforeseen turn in Iñárritu's body of work but one that is no less valid: We are given a spectacle that feels truly like something never done before in the way which it is presented. Amalgams between real, in camera work and CGI are seamless, performances, when viewed on their own merit, are colossal, and if there was ever a film to make you subconsciously want to pick the grime from underneath your fingernails, or take a shocked breath of the imagined frigid air, this is it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Highly overrated,"I think this movie is really overrated.The photography is great and the acting is good (i liked the Tom Hardy performance, and I liked the Di Caprio one too, although I think he did better performances in other movies).The plot is really inconsistent and not coherent at all, I do not want to spoiler it but the first part of the movie is well built and believable, the second part feels fake, the behaviour of the captain has no sense and the final sequence remember more a super heroes movie than a ""true story"" one...I don't wonder at all that the second part of the movie (and of the book), the revenge one, totally divert from the real fact that inspired the book.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Brutal and Beautiful,"The Revenant was released in 2015 and was directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. It won 3 Oscars for Best Performance in a Leading Role, Best Achievement in Directing, and Best Achievement in Cinematography. The Revenant is based on true events and a novel of the same name written by Michael Punke.Plot Synopsis: The film takes place in Montana in the 1820's and follows fur trader Hugh Glass - played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Members of his team include John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), Bridger (Will Poulter), and Hawk (Forrest Goodluck). The movie opens up with Glass and his Native American son, Hawk hunting for deer. Soon after this, Glass's team is attacked by a Arikara tribe and the few that are still alive escape to their boat. Back on land, Glass is mauled by a bear and barely survives. Fitzgerald grows tired of carrying Glass so he plans to leave him for dead. Hawk tries to save his father, but is killed by Fitzgerald. This event starts the journey of revenge for Glass as he hunts his son's killer across frozen Montana.____________MY REVIEW______________Story and Characters: The story is relatively simple, but there are certain elements to it that set it apart from other ""revenge stories"". Typically in a story of revenge, the chase is the focal point. You have your characters developed at the start of the film and once the trigger event happens, the mission of revenge is all the movie has left to offer. What The Revenant does differently is instead of being told about our main characters we are shown through imagery, visions, and dream sequences across the film's entire runtime. The dream sequences in particular offer us a look at who Glass is spiritually and where his mind is at currently. They are also the only scenes we get to see of him with his wife. The film focuses greatly on the relationship between Glass, Hawk, and Fitzgerald. Hawk and his deceased mother are Pawnee which makes Fitzgerald very uncomfortable. We first think of Fitzgerald as a cold, ignorant man and ultimately the villain of the story. However, we soon find out that he has a scar on his head where he had been partially scalped by a Native American tribe which shows us that he views the natives in a much more negative light than the other characters. It's the difference in perspective for Glass and Fitzgerald that drives the plot forward and sets the movie apart from others with a similar plot on the surface.Directing, Cinematography, and Visual Effects: Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki have created one of the most beautiful and impressive movies I have ever seen. There are many long, continuous shots of the landscape that give you an idea of brutal and unforgiving the world is, but also how beautiful and untouched it seems. There are so many of these shots that the landscape and world becomes its own character. The sense of scale that these shots bring is also very effective. There is very little CGI used which makes each shot even more impressive and immersive. Sometimes CGI can compromise an otherwise good scene and that didn't happen for this movie. There are some visual effects that are used and they all look very convincing. For instance, the scene with the bear was done in so convincingly that you really believe that Leo is being thrown around and mauled. In other scene, DiCaprio and his horse fall off a cliff escaping some pursuers. Of course, stuntmen and visual effects were used for this scene, but it all comes together nicely and doesn't seem unrealistic in any way.Acting and Writing: The performances across the board are great; DiCaprio won a well deserved Oscar for his. Despite not having much dialogue, he gives a very emotional and convincing performance. DiCaprio is a very familiar actor at this point. He has had many great, memorable performances, but I think he does his best in this film. Hardy also gives a good performance. He's extremely unlikable and you can't wait for him to get killed by DiCaprio's character. He has his typical Tom Hardy mumbling, but I think it works for his character. Forrest Goodluck gives a strong performance as Hawk. Even though his part is relatively small, he leaves a big impact. Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson both have smaller roles, but they are important for the plot and they do a great job. The writing for The Revenant is good, but most of the storytelling is visual which is a positive in my opinion. There's no dialogue that sticks out as unrealistic and the characters speak in a way that would be appropriate for the time period.Other Comments: I can't find any flaws with this movie. I can see how some people might get annoyed with the dream sequences or find it too brutal, but I feel that everything is there for a reason. I also know that it took five years to make and that it was difficult for virtually everyone involved, but the results speak for themselves.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
nature,"The landscape is ethereal and profound, with a chill, and many of the shots are used as screensavers.

"Hardy adds a lively touch to da film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than the crawling, moaning n groaning of Leo.","The opening sequences are fantastic and should be seen on as big a screen as possible. Tom Hardy's character was by far the most multi-dimensional and characteristic. The cinematography was astonishing in every aspect, the acting  was great, but the story was monotonous and slow paced. Good cinematography and camera-work, and superb acting all round. From the films I have seen so far it should definitely win Best Cinematography. The scenery and backdrops are epic in scale and totally immersive. Tom Hardy blows Leo off screen for acting ability in this movie. Leo's role had a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning compared to what Hardy's role where in certain scenes he spoke with his eyes. The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! Sadly, this film borrows too much from the equations of Saving Private Ryan, (extraordinary opening battle scene) n Gladiator with snow, (the wife and son flashbacks were way too similar and predictable). Tom Hardy adds a lively touch to a rather slow film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than his actions. I was wondering why a fish would be eaten raw when there is a fire just feet away? The story itself is a typical survival tale, rote and predictable, with more than a touch of Terrance Mallick's inspiration. The Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is very similar to what he did in Mallick's movies. Mirrione has had a notable collaboration with director Steven Soderbergh n he did a terrific job in all Ocean's trilogy but with Alejandro he gets lazy. He did a lazy job for Babel n again a lazy job for the revenant.

Iñárritu's Revolutionary Re-interpretation of American Myth-Making,"There have been two masterpieces in cinema this year. In Mad Max Fury Road, George Miller gifted us a dystopian deconstruction of the inevitable consequences of the will to own: a society both totalitarian and nihilistic, headed by an obscenely controlling monster commanding drug fueled Jihadis, regulating every resource from water to mother's milk. Misread in some places with a strictly ""feminist"" critique, exegesis of Miller's film can fly marxian or libertarian – it hardly matters as the solution to the chaos of dictatorship the director provided with Furiosa's victory was both egalitarianism and freedom.In The Revenant, Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu attempts something more subtle: with one stroke of his pen, by giving protagonist Hugh Glass a native wife and son, he weds an early icon of American Exceptionalism into a matrimony of Old World and New. It was not long after Glass's travails that ambitious frontier writers grew his legend, and by the end of the 19th century Glass had entered a pantheon of American folklore heroes from the wholly fictitious Paul Bunyon, to the richly documented Davy Crockett. The historical Glass fell somewhere between symbolic characters like Johnny Appleseed and fictionalized pioneer figures such as Daniel Boone. Glass's place among these icons ebbed and flowed with each new literary interpretation, but none has challenged his role as an early representation of the American cultural values based on Puritan work ethic, Calvinist Pre-Destination, and economic liberalism. By the time Thoreau poetically stamped naturalism on the emerging national character, the attributes of perseverance, ""rugged individualism"", and emotional solitude had solidified into the championing of an individual persona that collectively birthed the philosophies and policies of American Exceptionalism and Manifest Destiny.Wholly within a European tradition, neither Glass's experience nor iconography made room for a shared native American narrative. The value of communalism, spiritual communication with the natural world, and preservation of the environment were never compatible with the mission to homogenize and control that environment with ever increasing technological advancements. Native lifestyles and beliefs, in particular the unwillingness to entertain the notion that land could ever be privately owned, doomed any hope for a co-existence of equals. But in the Revenant, Iñárritu suggests that Glass's almost super human fortitude and survival skills were sourced not just from the core early American cultural value of self-sufficiency, but from the First Nationer acceptance of nature as a reverential if temperamental partner; a mate not to be dominated and contained, but to be respected and cajoled into compatibility. In the face of the arbitrary brutality of nature, it is not Glass's master of technology that saves him, it is his native-like learned connection to the spirit world and his understanding of the natural world that restore and guide him. Glass is a man with a foot planted firmly in both worlds, but it is his chosen one that is both sacrificed in the person of his son Hawk, and transcended in the visions of his dead wife and son. On his recovery and ""revenge"" mission, his sustenance is derived from animism; his survival from a native conciliation with the harsh environment.I believe in The Revenant the film-maker wants his audience to extrapolate the sources and resources of Glass's survival and consider the role that native peoples had in the formation and growth of a nation, to ponder and accept the importance that native people's beliefs and practices had and still have in creating a harmonious balance between a natural world that is and will always be capable of demolishing the best plans and inventions of men, and the harnessing of that world in the name of advancement. Iñárritu's revision of the Glass story is not a mere plot device; it is a radical epistemological one that poses timeless questions. I do feel the wonderful performances, majestic cinematography, and riveting action in The Revenant are all subordinate to what the director would like us to entertain about the survival and ""revenge"" of Hugh Glass.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Technical Wonder With A Lacking Script,"I'm not really sure what to make of 'The Revenant'. It has been a week since I saw the film but it sort of feels like a distant memory.I definitely have respect for the film. You've heard this before but I have to say that the cinematography is pretty fantastic. I was never in awe at its beauty but it pretty much captured the perfect look for the film. I can't help but feel that it looks ""correct"". The long takes and hand-held shots are also pretty impressive. The acting is great all round. Pretty much every actor does an impressive job in the roles that they are well suited for.However, I wasn't really that engaged. I wasn't bored out of my mind either, but the great craftsmanship can only go so far. The characters aren't very interesting or relatable. This is especially a problem for Hugh Glass. He didn't feel like much of a person, which meant I couldn't feel his desperation or the brutality of the more violent or gory parts of the film. I will admit that there were a couple of moments where I looked away from the screen to see who in the cinema was talking. I'm pretty sure I missed one of the dream/flashback montages earlier on in the film because of this, which could have resulted in me not caring much about the character, but I still feel that we didn't learn much about the character throughout the rest of the film.Overall, 'The Revenant' is a bit of a disappointment. It is a technical wonder but there was too much focus on making it look real and not enough focus on laying down the foundations that would make it actually feel real.(In case you're wondering what happened to the people in the cinema talking, it got the point where I had to shush them. One of them glanced over at me as if I was being rude and they left a few minutes later.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Blood and Snow. Bear and Flesh.,"It's wonderful to follow the path of people who are never afraid to try, no matter how comfortable and applauded they already are in whatever they are doing.So here we have Iñarritu who has been working on story layering from the beginning of his career, first with the wonderful Arriaga as a partner. Together they have created 3 films with some of the best writing ever in the history of cinema, layered writing, stuff that is now kicking in and becoming the standard of film (and TV!) stories; the kind of bricks we use to remember our own lives.After their collaboration Iñarritu did Biutiful, which almost as strong in its territory as you can get, but almost intentionally stripped of any of the layers that had been so masterfully built in the trilogy. Somehow it looked as though Iñarritu (and Lubezki) was actually ""just"" the visual vessel to which Arriaga poured his dreams. But Birdman tells otherwise, and indeed builds a whole new version of layered stories, meta-narrative and ways to dream.Now Iñarritu gets into Herzog's territory, using the Biutiful approach: to have the story as quiet and simple as possible, here nearly absent, and get you to enter the journey by means of visual enchantment. Something like cinematic hypnosis. You're simply enticed to follow it, move along, survive with the character, suffer with him. The trick is simple: we are always with Dicaprio, we are him, we suffer what he does, and we aim at the same things that he does. So here we get the concept of classical hero revived and recovered, supported by the , as usual, brilliant photography of Lubezki (what a master...).This is a wonderful experience, which in my opinion balances the graphic violence as the conductor of the story as Wook Park does in his trilogy of revenge. But it falls a little short of what Herzog did in the 70', and i suppose the reasons are relatively easy to identify. Leonardo is no Klaus, not as crazy as him, and not as ready to travel to Madnessland with a one way ticket as Kinski was willing to do (and did). And the whole production is not about a bunch of guys living the madness they are trying to film. This is probably as risky a film as you can get from Hollywood, but it is still Hollywood. This is an almost extreme film about an extreme (real) story, which is unbelievable, except for the fact that it actually happened.I'm guessing that if he keeps doing what he has done after Babel, next time Iñarritu will reward us with a multi-layered narrative complex gem like Birdman. But the time after that maybe he will loose his mind, Coppola-style, and maybe he will really go up the river where this time he only washed his feet. Maybe he will actually spill the blood over the snow, instead of just enacting it. Someday maybe he will complete an opera house in the middle of some jungle, although i don't think Iñarritu is the type of artist who needs to leave his writing table to change our lives.Dicaprio will probably get an Oscar for this one. I think he is a clever actor who senses where talent is and goes with it, in the tradition of Brad Pitt. But i don't think this is superlative acting, merely competent moaning. He has had more demanding roles already.4.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Awesome movie heading for many Oscar awards and nominations!,"Awesome movie, that will surely get many Oscar awards for best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), supporting actor (Tom Hardy), cinematography and makeup, best director and best picture, possibly costume design and editing. The bear attack scene is monumental and memorable, I do not remember having seen a bear attack described so well in all its wildness in any film or documentary. The many landscapes of wild nature are very beautiful! Leonardo DiCaprio's wounds and tormented face are so well rendered, I do not know how one can lose the Oscar for makeup. Throughout the film, Leo plays absolutely brilliant, with Tom Hardy also excellent. The movie is very well built in details, it has memorable scenes (like the one when jumping on the horse from the cliff and surviving in the freezing night that followed) and depicts very well the struggle to survive in harsh natural conditions in frontier areas in those times.

If you think you'll be warmer inside the cinema watching 'The Revenant' this winter... You're wrong!,"'Birdman' introduced Alejandro G. Iñárritu into the limelight last award season, virtually stealing the Oscars with 9 nominations and 4 wins including Best picture and Directing. Now a year later and it's the same story with 'The Revenant' being nominated for 12 this time round. The academy aside... Can it really be as good as everyone is saying?No. Good would be an understatement.'The Revenant' is and will always be one of those very rare films that weren't just a trip to the cinema, but an experience. With the film being a lengthy 2 hours 36 minutes I was pleasantly surprised that I never had the urge to check my watch, because of how well the film pulled me in. We are thrown into an intense, brisk, frozen adventure of pure revenge but with far more depth and meaning than you may think. Iñárritu uses his seemingly signature long takes to completely submerged the viewer in the freezing temperatures, along with using natural light and wide angle lenses to show the vast landscapes and real settings that the characters are trying to survive in.Leonardo DiCaprio's 'Hugh Glass' as the desperate protagonist abandoned by his fellow hunters after a brutal encounter with a bear, serves up one of his best ever performances. Showing that he is more than capable of expressing deep emotions with minimal dialogue. Tom Hardy's 'John Fitzgerald' is an amazing antagonist who is being hunted by Glass to seek revenge for leaving him for Dead. Hardy was great in the role, adding yet another outstanding performance to his near flawless track record of films and performances. Domhnall Gleeson is also in the film as the hunting group's leader who does a decent job, further cementing his status as an actor to watch out for with cinema-goers.Whilst the plot may sound relatively simple for a 2 and a half hour film, you will never even think about the time as you'll be so immersed in the dramatic, adventure thrill ride that you'll start to shiver from the frozen environment.A must see for everyone!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Will to Survive,"The Revenant, the movie that will give Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar. For the second time in the last two years we have been blessed by the extraordinary vision and direction of director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Iñárritu brought this amazing story Hugh Glass, the frontiersman, fur trapper, and explorer that was mauled by a grizzly bear and ultimately left for dead by the company that hired him. The film follows the theme of the will to survive, bringing the audience to question, What would you do to survive?Leonardo DiCaprio will win his first Oscar for his role as Hugh Glass. If he does not win the award there is something wrong with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The scenery was amazing and to know that the film was shot with no artificial light. With Iñárritu at the forefront again don't be surprised to see him win for best director again and it sure looks promising that The Revenant will win Best Picture.I urge you to see this film because of the trials and tribulation that Hugh Glass went through. The shot selection that Iñárritu used was fantastic and personally I wouldn't change it. From the opening body camera to the closing close up, the film kept you engaged and wanting more.Alejandro González Iñárritu may not be the easiest man to work with in the film industry but he sure knows how to direct and how to make something truly fantastic. Though certain characters didn't have the most dialogue, what they did say ended up leaving more of an impact. Tom Hardy was fantastic as John Fitzgerald and really did a good job convincing the audience that he was doing the right thing throughout the movie.Overall the film was great and will pull in some awards and people like DiCaprio and Iñárritu will be recognized for their work. The film emotionally connected with audiences challenging them to put themselves in Glass' situation. It calls into morally what one would do, as well as, spiritually what one would do. The quotes ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already"" really makes the audience fell for Glass and that all he does to survive and his actions are justifiable and that it is true that he has died and does not care if he does so again.As I finish, I would give this movie an 8.8 out of 10 and for one last time I applaud the job Iñárritu did directing and the performance of DiCaprio and Hardy as well as others like Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson. I will leave you with the quote that stuck with me and really ties the movie together.

"Brutal, Violent Art-Revenge Flick Among the Best this Decade.","Wow. What a classic. What an absolute legend of a motion picture. I don't often give out 10/10s, but when I do it tends to be for the sort of brutal, cynical edge-of-your-seat madness that The Revenant thrives on. I really liked Birdman, but Innaritu has done some of his best work here. From the cinematography to the performances to the technical finesse to totally maddening brutality, this is a masterpiece of epic proportions. With regards to immersion, there are sort of two types of films. Some, like the works of Goddard, seem to want to have us think intellectually about the movie, to interact with the movie as a person external to the film interacting with that film. I like these movies, but The Revenant comes from an entirely different world. This is the sort of movie that you get drawn into, where you forget that you are inside a movie theater watching a movie and instead feel the movie at a raw, terrifying, fundamental level. If the frenetic delivery of Birdman was tantamount to jazz, the bare bones brutality of The Revenant is more like industrial metal. I've seen it twice, and intend to go again, and I'd recommend that anyone with eyes and a strong stomach to do the same.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"The Revenant, the film of visceral and aesthetic yin and yang.","The Revenant is a film that works on a plethora of levels. It follows a fairly basic storyline that the average moviegoer could wholly understand. However, there is much more looming within the incredibly imagery and filmmaking of the Revenant than one might assume. The Revenant is not a film with a clear message, but instead one with many, small hints as to what the underlying implications are. Alejandro G. Innaritu's directorial style and choices shine through this film, creating a visceral and aesthetic yin and yang as we watch the gorgeous and gentle landscapes and scenery meld with the brutal, harsh storyline and occurrences. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Hugh Glass is one of little dialogue, but large impact, and may win him an Oscar this year. Tom Hardy's performance as John Fitzgerald is one that is possibly more exemplary than Dicaprio's, although that's up for debate. Although parts of this film are slightly too long winded or slow, overall it is a film that's imagery and story will resonate with the viewer long after watching it, and truly pays homage to the art of filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Badass epic,"Leonardo DiCaprio gives his all in this survival movie. He walks, then walks some more, and then does a bit more walking. If an actor putting himself through hell equals awards glory, then DiCaprio deserves his name on the trophy for his performance representing a kind of progressive frontier man. Part of the entertainment of watching The Revenant is knowing its cast and crew went through the same crazy conditions and endurance tests the actor went through in the various middles of various uncharted wilderness.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu transports us to another time and place in this depiction of First Nations people. The movie is based on historic fiction, when a fur-trapping expedition in the Midwest gets attacked by a Native American tribe and history gets written in blood.

"A for Effort, C plus for Story","The best things about this movie are the beautiful scenery and cinematography, the top-notch acting and some interesting dream sequences. But what is it all for? Everyone knows the plot: Somebody killed my (insert loved one) so I'm going to kill him. Have we not seen this a thousand times? Is it really different when shot in the wildernesses of Canada, Montana and Argentina? I almost walked out of the movie after the bear mauling scene. Many have criticized this scene, but what troubled me about it is that a supposedly experienced woodsman would be unaware that you have to flee if you see bear cubs, and if the bear attacks, you're supposed to lie still. Also from what I know an experienced woodsman would be able to tell that a bear was in the vicinity and would leave the area as soon as possible.The movie improved in the last half because the action heated up and there was more dialogue.

"Mostly Gut Wrenching but Also, a Bit Simplistic","I just finished reading a series of commentaries by people giving this movie a single star. Take your hatred elsewhere. If you didn't like the film, fine, but because it got hype, it's not your job to lower its rating; it's your obligation to say something intelligent about the filmmaking. This is one of the most visually striking features I've ever seen. The camera angles and the framing of the scenes is spectacular. During the first scene ambush, we get to see what it must be like to suddenly be in the middle of a maelstrom. Arrows are frequently seen as sterile in most films. Here, we get a taste of them being a kid of artillery. LIke ""Deliverence,"" which is another unsettling film, these guys are just in the wrong place. Whether those furs were worth a lot or not, all their work wasn't worth it. Yet, from what we hear, they are people who are the dregs of society and need something to keep them going. Yes, when DeCaprio shows up, we began to see men who, despite their oaths, will look after their own butts. Honor only goes so far in this universe. The story of Hugh Glass is part of history. I, like many others, question the extent to which this guy is pushed to the limits (a lot of Hollywood gimmickry). It takes some real skill to deal with real historical figures. I doubt that a third of this happened. I do know that Hugh Glass was mauled by a bear and that he literally crawled across three states to get revenge. Had he been totally fictional, we would be much more forgiving. In this case, less would have been more, with some compactness and restraint. I will leave it to the experts to get at the technical stuff. This is a highly entertaining film. Anyone that gives it one star is just being spiteful. I suppose they don't like DeCaprio. One even criticized the fact that it took place in the early 1800's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Visual Marvel,"It has been over a month since I saw this film at the cinema... and I'm certainly glad I had the chance to experience it on the big screen. The visuals are so strikingly captivating that they stayed with me to this day - I wouldn't have a problem with saying that this is some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in film, especially if you take the natural lighting into consideration. If you're anything like me and you appreciate innovative camera work, you'll be amazed with the shots they managed to capture in 'The Revenant'. But besides being a visual marvel, does the film succeed in being a compelling tale like Iñárritu's previous works?Well, yes, it does... to an extent. We follow Hugh Glass on a harrowing journey as he fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead, and what we get is essentially a simple revenge story. This is one of those films that absolutely excels in some parts, yet barely delivers in others. After the amazing opening sequence and the terrifying bear attack which was just simply masterful, the film felt like it slowed down... and although I wasn't taken out of the story at any point, I definitely felt that there were some pacing issues. It's not by any means a ""boring"" film - as it crafts tension extremely well and feels consistent with it throughout, but with the addition of slightly pretentious dream sequences and a reliance on style over substance (or in this case, beautiful imagery over narrative) the film unfortunately starts to drag a little.In regards to DiCaprio's performance, it was great as usual, but was it Oscar-worthy? This was a role that clearly relied on physicality rather than emotion - which is what I felt the character was lacking where it seemed necessary. If this performance wins Leo an Oscar it'll feel like it happened purely because the Academy believes it owes him one. Besides, Oscars don't define good acting, as many great actors have never won an Oscar... but I digress. Tom Hardy pulled off a decent job as usual, Domhnall Gleeson was absolutely fantastic despite his limited amount of screen time, and I was pleasantly surprised by Will Poulter's also small but memorable performance. All in all, I can't really complain about the performances, and despite a lack of emotion on DiCaprio's part, his energy and drive still kept me at the edge of my seat.If I were to rate this film based purely on its visuals and cinematography, I would give it a perfect 10 out of 10. However, due to its flawed pacing and other minor negatives (such as out of sync dialogue) I cannot give 'The Revenant' a perfect score. Iñárritu decided to showcase physical brutality instead of emotional brutality he incorporated in his previous films such as 'Biutiful' or 'Birdman' - which I found to be more effective and far more emotionally powerful. That being said, 'The Revenant' is still an incredible achievement in filmmaking and provides one hell of a compelling journey. It is a simultaneously mesmerising and suspenseful piece of cinema that not only showcases breathtaking cinematography alongside a beautiful soundtrack, but also displays the dedication of one of the best directors working today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Inevitably Spectacular, not perfect.","This movie is simply a journey through the minds of director Alejandro G. Inneritu and Emmanuel Lubezki, fuelled with creativity and flair from the offset. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous. It is an honour to watch such a spectacularly filmed movie, it's almost like a dream. Although some shots may seem repetitive (low angle tree shots) the shots seem relevant and important to the film as it focuses on the harsh reality of nature and the environment in which we live in. The representation of the 19th century is also a brilliantly executed aspect of this movie, showing the viewer what times were like in the era and how difficult it was to earn money.The narrative of this film is simple yet underestimated. Revenge is always a tricky topic to cover for film makers, as sometimes it can end up being somewhat far fetched or cheesy, but this time, it was really effective and had me hooked from the moment Hugh Glass' journey to find Hardy begins. The acting is always the crucial part of any film, and in this particular film, it needed to be the best performance for all involved, which would be tricky as DiCaprio and Tom Hardy have had extremely impacting careers. As for Tom Hardy, this was undeniably his best 'Supporting Actor' role, showing the fierce, unrelenting nature of his character and in end, rewarding the actor with his first Oscar nomination. For DiCaprio, I believe it was up there with his best performances, but the lack of dialogue from his character could not mean that it was his best unfortunately. This does not in any way mean that his performance was anything other than world class and he deserved all credit received from this film, if not more, for me, The Wolf of Wall Street was his best, closely followed by his short spell as Calvin Candie in Django Unchained.Overall, the film showed positive signs in all aspects, notably visual effects, make up and costume design, as well as the obvious directing and acting, but it was not perfect.

"A Masterpiece, and A Reminder of Why We Love Cinema","The Revenant is a Masterpiece. It is the most visually impressive film of the year, that it leaves audience both in awe & in wonder as to what methods were used in filming. It features as well, a gripping storyline, an extremely bleak & brutal backdrop and powerhouse performances, guaranteeing a viewing experience like no other.Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki achieves an almost impossible feat, the use of natural lighting throughout the entire film's runtime. It is then unimaginable, the amount of patience & perseverance spent to be able to shoot at perfect conditions & in such a remote location. In the end, these sacrifices paid off, as we are treated to natural beauty caught on lens, and IT WAS STUNNING! With the masterful Alejandro Gonzales Iñárritu at the helm, the striking gorgeousness of plateaus, snowy mountains, river and rapid are organically & skillfully captured as well, and my eyes happily feasted upon them. Amazingly, these scenic renders act as moments of solitude in between the violence, offering respite that is genuine and mystic even. The natural world's splendor however, represents only half of the film's central themes, as its brutality is vividly conveyed through the odds faced by one Hugh Glass.Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of the broken, haunted hero, literally torn apart by humanity & nature, was absorbing. He gives such a ferocious performance, foregoing the need of a script to portray unrelenting vengeance. His agony, rumblings & raging are very well conveyed & at times, provides the film's most harrowing & memorable moments (that bear scene). Happily, Tom Hardy meets Leo's excellence head on, with his characterization of the cold-blooded John Fitzgerald. He relishes his role as the film's object of ire, demonstrating remorseless cruelty, worthy of our hero's icy cold carnage. Thank God for subtitles though, as the Tom's ""Bane Mumblings"" makes an unwelcome reemergence.As for the film's screenplay, the revenge fueled drama is riveting on its own, yet the backdrop of amazingly shot ruthless violence & despicable inhumanity is one that will leave you both mesmerized yet shaken to your core.Overall, The Revenant marks an absolute new artistic high for Iñárritu, Lubezki & DiCaprio. It is a film that pushes the limits of commitment in filmmaking. It as as well, uncompromising in its messages & raw in its depictions. The result is then a truly immersive experience that is rewarding in every way possible. Without a doubt, this gut-wrenching piece that tells a harrowing tale of survival & retribution, is my favorite film of 2015, and a perfect reminder of why we love films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Beautiful, poetic, and immersive","Much will be said about this film. Whether it is a disappointment or not. I've never been huge on Inarritu. I've always felt his films take the melodrama and contrivance way too far, even if I don't hate any of his films. The first of his that I loved was Birdman, and now I can add The Revenant as his second and his most accomplished film to date. I feel like many will not take to its pacing. It's pretty much the most plot-driven Malick film that the director himself never made. Technically it's breath-taking, with really beautiful and powerful cinematography that will surely blow you away. But then again we all knew that. If there's one aspect of the film that perhaps is flawed, it is the editing. I do feel like the transitioning of scenes at times felt a little off, and because of it the film as a whole can sometimes feel disjointed. I think this, in particular, makes the film feel like it is dragging in its second act. The biggest surprise here is how strong the actual narrative and screenplay is. I didn't know much about these people, the novel, or the plot summary of the film, but I think that the screenplay does a really wonderful job of letting us into many of these characters' heads and really permeating the entire film's atmosphere with intense psychological dilemmas that really haunt the screen. For such a physical film, it's also very much an internal one, and that essentially applies to Dicaprio as well. I've always been hit or miss with him, but this is the best I've ever seen him, and I think that's because it's a role that is totally unlike so much of what he usually does. He has to physically inhabit this character completely. He surely gives it his all, and it's visible all across his face. It's a role very much not driven by dialogue, and instead it's a completely soulful performance. If he was to win an Oscar for this, then congratulations to him because he would be completely deserving. The other standout is Tom Hardy, another actor who is usually hit or miss with me but who also delivers some stunningly good work here. He's chilling, and he should definitely be in contention for an Oscar nomination.Ultimately, this film is one that needs to be pondered more to see how it fares with time. The great thing is that, so far, I cannot recommend it enough. It's very much a humorless, miserable film, with only bad things happening to characters we care about. In that respect, similar to Inarritu's previous films, and yet none of it rang false here. It's far from perfect, it remains a daunting, exhausting, overwhelming, yet beautiful, poetic, immersive experience, and those adjectives alone make it one of the best, if not the best, films of the year.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Breathtaking but repetitive.,"'The Revenant' is unlike any movie you will ever see. It is an absolutely breathtaking film about one of the most insane human feats ever. The film is all about a man by the name of Hugh Glass. A man that survives a bear attack. A man that then crawls and limps his way 200 miles after the man that slaughtered his son before his very eyes. Saying that this man is hardcore is an understatement. What he endears is a testament to how resilient the human spirit can be. So who better to play him than the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio. This could very well be the film that finally gets him that coveted golden statue at the Oscars this February. Aside from the insanity that is this story and Leos superb performance, this film has a lot to offer. Most noticeably is how the film itself looks. Shot in all natural light, 'The Revenant' is able to bring a sense of realism that few films have achieved. It's a beautiful film to behold that effortlessly sucks you into its world.Honestly, if I were to rate this film from a technical stand point it would most definitely receive a perfect rating. Everything done behind the camera is flawless. The standout being Inarritu himself. There are some scenes in this film with so many moving parts it's a wonder how he is able to control them all. We have fights between white men and Indians that flow so naturally that you can practically feel like you're there.Yet I found myself ultimately disappointing with this film. Perhaps this my fault. Coming straight off 'Birdman' I found the next film that Inarritu was making and kind of went crazy. I saw this films story line along with the director and all star cast and have been losing my mind waiting for it ever since. I held this film up like many people were doing with 'The Force Awakens'.That being said, as I watched I found some very obvious mistakes. The film never felt like it quite made it to a final draft. The problem with this film is that we don't learn one single thing about our main character. He is certainly the most determined human being of all time but what do we really learn about him? There seems to be nothing making him a man other than a convoluted back story with a side of vengeance. There is so few character traits that we can actually point to that make him human.This makes the lengthy two and a half hour run time drag at times. He tries to survive then runs from Indians over and over and over again. There is a point where this just isn't exciting any more. And it left me longing for some actual character moments from him. In fact the only characters we really get to know aren't in the film all that much. What's stranger is that, through the entire run time, a tribe of Indians is on his tail for absolutely no reason. Yeah they are looking for a stolen girl but why on earth are they following the company that they demolish at the beginning of the film? Obviously she isn't with them so why on earth didn't they investigate literally anyone else?The subplots in this film made so little sense that switching back to our relatively bland main character came as a breath of fresh air. The film never really felt like it was fully thought through. There was so many things that didn't add up that following the repetitive journey of DiCaprio became, at times, a strain. But somehow, it remains a good movie. It's gritty, hard to watch, but most of all an absolute spectacle and landmark in film making.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Screenwriting students, you must see that!","Apart from all the stuff that you can write about DiCaprio, the plot, the meaning behind it, which is all good and set... let's talk about the structure.

"The Revenant is an achievement in filmmaking, an adventure you will never forget","Alejandro González Iñárritu serves as a director, producer and co-writer in this breathtaking and incredible movie.
The Revenant is based on the historical fiction book of the same name and it is about Hugh Glass and his experiences in 1823 when he guided Captain Andrew Henry and his trappers through the territory of the present-day Dakota. It's an adventure you won't forget, with the film being shot in a continuous shot or its what we are believed to think as its superb editing makes it unnoticeable when they cut the camera.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass and we follow everything through the eyes of that character, other actors in the film are Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson. But Leonardo and Tom has the best performances, Leo actually won his first Oscar for best acting in a leading role. If you watch the movie then you will understand why he won, he even called it the hardest performance of his career and I believe him.The story and screenplay is fantastic but nothing special, the huge amount of aunthencity is where it shines though. The director and producers hired consultants to make the Arikara culture as accurate as possible, small and big things like that makes a movie so much more better as it gets more believable.On the technical side of things it's a really well made movie, from the production design to cinematography. The latter won an Oscar for Achievement in Cinematography and I agree. It's breathtaking from start to finish, I still remember a lot of scenes from the first time I watched the movie which was in 2015 at the cinema, the experience was amazing. Alejandro González Iñárritu also won an Oscar for best Director which I agree 100% with. Incredible musical score and sound design. Costume and makeup department was fantastic, the amount of attention to detail and how authentic everything is. The musical score is powerful and gives you goosebumps, it's that powerful. The overall production was perfect, not a single bad thing that I can think of.This was the third time I watched it, first time was at the cinema and that was the true way to watch it but watching it at home comes close. The Revenant is a memorable experience and a great movie, it's filled with phenomenal acting and scenes so beautifully shot. It won 3 Oscars but got nominated for more, its best picture nomination was worthy as it truly is one of the best motion pictures of 2015.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Traveling far outside but seeing one thing,"The blueprint here is simple. A world that lies in wait and summons unexpected violence that wrecks lives - it can be an Indian ambush, a bear, or a greedy little man who will do anything for quick profit. A world of immense beauty, inscrutable in workings, that we try to subdue to our satisfaction.DiCaprio as our ability to coexist and adapt to the land, the Fitzgerald character as that nature in man that only wants to please itself and to grab. It's not just a meaningless violence that visits them. We're made to note Indians out in search for a daughter that was stolen, a bear that was only protecting its young. Meaning, there's agency behind the random cruelty.Other filmmakers, Malick for one, would be content to evoke different ways of framing the question posed by this world so that we would end up hopefully with a whole cloud of floating realities. (Malick no doubt knows that agency as what the Chinese call the Tao). Inarritu is plot- and action-driven and reflects in the gaps instead.I mean this is a film where two hours in we still have shenanigans like DiCaprio crashing down from a cliff. It has a clear causality. One event precipitates the next. So when the Indians spare a pointless death in the end, it registers as plot contrivance instead of spiritual realization that severs the cycle of suffering. We ask, why would they spare him? Which is the wrong question.This is just not a very astute work and it comes down to perhaps one thing; how the camera breathes life into the world. It is Malick inspired, most obvious in the dream scenes. But it rests on a poor understanding of him. Malick - like Tarkovsky before - frees eye from world, the eye that recalls and reflects from the world of events with its clear causality, so that the eye can float in and out of lives, entering events, memories, urges, anticipations in a seamless flow that encompasses a bigger whole.Inarritu has no notion of this yet. Birdman showed that he might be coming around but no dice. This one frames events as action or dream; its idea of visual poetry is to embed characters in beautiful vistas and have that surround from the outside. It enters this one guy and we have revenge and regret. Oh there are a few continuous shots, an impressive one early; but it's just elaborately choreographed action. The shot ends with the Indian chief whispering a plot point to the camera about his stolen daughter.No harm in seeing this one. But it would be even better if it propels you to study Malick beneath the soliloquy as a master of the floating eye. Further back it was Jancso and Tarkovsky. It's on discoveries of people like these - people who'd be deemed too abstract and would have gone jobless in Hollywood - that this one rests.You'll know this if you track down a previous retelling of the same story in the Richard Harris film. The most notable difference between the two is that one uses the naturalistic camera of the western, this a more abstract one. But as commonplace in its use as the other was then.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Beautiful but not for everyone,"Alejandro González Iñárritu who directed last year's Best Picture winner 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' has returned with his next film 'The Revenant'. The films couldn't be further apart in nature. I remember saying when I reviewed the former film that it wasn't going to be for everyone, and despite the films being worlds apart, this fact remains the same. 'The Revenant' is a beautiful film to look at, but it's a tough film to sit through. There's a pretty amazing true story being told here, but it's being told in such a slow, drawn out way that it lost a lot of impact for me.The buzz around town is that the time may finally have come for Leonardo DiCaprio to get an Oscar for his performance in 'The Revenant'. Personally I would be disappointed if this turns out to be the case. Don't get me wrong he delivers a very fine performance here. But of all the charismatic, layered performances he's given over the years, this was not his best work. People will justify it saying the filming conditions were immensely tough and that he put in the hard yards for the role, however the I believe any actor given this role could have come up with a very similar performance. There was nothing DiCaprio did here that no one else in the business could have pulled off. That hasn't been the case in other roles he's nailed.Be prepared going in to 'The Revenant'. Be prepared to be very patient. It's a long film with not a lot happening for the most part of it. The flaw for me was how much time was given to each aspect of the story. The survival aspect takes up 95% of the time, which granted was a great way to show just how harrowing of an experience it would truly have been and the determination it would have taken, and the ""revenge"" aspect is just rushed in at the end almost as an afterthought. For mine the ratio needed to be closer to 80-20% for the sake of an audience who are demanding a more satisfactory ending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Phenomenal acting - Praiseworthy scripting - Oscar worthy performance,"I love that this film allowed us to see things from the Native American's perspective as-well, and not just the New-American hunting teams perspective.What many movies lack nowadays is the ability to really showcase character development, though I feel this movie succeeded in this. If you can grow attached to a certain character in a film, then the development of that character is portrayed correctly. I like that.Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite actor of all time, because he is able to smash any role he plays with pure believability. I haven't seen all of Leo's films, but my favorite performances of his were from the movies ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", ""Inception"", ""Shutter Island"", ""Blood Diamond"" and now my all time favorite performance of his is ""The Revenant""; he absolutely dominated this role! His ability to portray a character with such depth is stupendous. He has previously played many good character rolls, yet no Oscar; if he doesn't not get an Oscar from the most in-depth character yet, then I have no idea how he will ever get an Oscar.. Give this man and Oscar already! HE DESERVES IT! 10 TIMES OVER!I'm not usually one for slow paced films because they tend to drag on and on for eternity, but for the slow paced film this was, it was very intriguing. I love a film that can capture you in the moment and really bring you in on their story. Although, I do believe The Revenant ended prematurely. Though this movie goes for 156 minutes, I feel as if an extra 10-15 minutes could have been added to create a superb ending, making for a near perfect film.If you struggle to stay enticed by a slow paced film because it doesn't have fast pace action and/or story movement, then I recommend you steer clear of this movie because it's most likely not for you. For those who don't mind if a movie is slow paced because it has a phenomenal story build-up and admirable character development, then I'd recommend the watch!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Epic masterpiece worthy of every award it wins. spoilers, sorry.","Title says it all, tied with 2 others for best movie I've seen in a decade? I do watch them, movies, sometimes, just this one is so vastly superior. 20/10 I honestly didn't think I'd like it, Mr. DiCaprio isn't a fav and the premise seemed weak to me, I've lived sorta close to this kind of experience before, so it's kinda old-hat to me. And then I watched it twice. I did not waste my time, I had to watch it again, it was just that good. I do gotta say that the lack of concern about staying wet and cold bothered me a lot. I got moderate hypothermia one spring when I was a teen by falling asleep with no blankets or padding on the floor of a concrete porch at 5-7 Celsius, and the hero goes over a waterfall series and then floats for what seems like hours, then doesn't even light a fire and get dry right away before it fades to black on him? First watch through, I swore he was a gonna, no doubt in my mind.ANd I still couldn't blink. But the whole cast and crew deserve an Oscar each, pulling off that level of ""I can't take my eyes off it even to blink"" in SPITE of an issue that for me would normally kill my interest marks this truly one of the best flicks ever. I'm even gonna push this one on my unsuspecting friends. They'll thank me for it, I'm sure.

"Handsomely made, compelling in its brutality, but narratively a bit too simple","It is good to be wary around this time of year because with the Oscars and many other awards imminent, there is a tendency for studios to release 'worthy' films – many of them are really good too, but a lot of them are 'worthy'. It is hard to say which one The Revenant is, but it does certainly seem like a film where everyone went through a lot of physical hardship. I don't read around films much, so I'm guess on that, but the on-location shoot and freezing conditions seem too tangible for them not to have made the shoot a long and challenging one. If so then it paid off because this aspect of the film is by far the strongest element – the brutality, the fight for survival, and the contrast of these tiny people against the vastness of the landscape.As such it is the technical delivery which is really the star. It is a consistently impressive and handsome film - whether it is the CGI bear of the opening 30 minutes, or cinematography which manages to have both nimble movement in/around the action as well as taking in the sweeping vistas as it reproduces the cold onto the screen. This aspect of the film carries it a long way, because for the most part this is a dialogue-free affair as Glass pulls himself from death to try and get revenge on another character. As a journey it is a tough slog and unfortunately it partly becomes that for the viewer too, because the film does have a slow pace and is essentially a slow crawl to its target. It does enough with the atmosphere to ensure the viewer is in the mindset where this works well, but it is not the type of film that one would throw on for a relaxing Friday night in. It is an odd feeling, but for me the time did not drag, and I was help by its single minded and consistent brutality, but at the same time it was not a story I felt gripped by in the detail of the character – more the overall experience.The story does have the constant theme of parents and children. Of course this is the motivation for the revenge plot, but it is also behind the group of Native Americans who are also integral in the film; and of course the bear attack itself is a parent acting in defense of its cubs. This element is interesting but it doesn't always work. In the main plot it feels just like a plot device (which it is) and the floaty other-worldly connection to the dead wife doesn't chance that. The other father, hunting his daughter, doesn't bring a great deal to the film in terms of emotional content and, being honest, the only parent/child relationship that I really felt for was the bear cubs left behind by the death of their mother (I know, typical liberal watching people die but getting teary over the animals).The cast match the sense of brutality, and they wear it well in their characters. DiCaprio of course gets the headlines, but others are just as strong and one could argue that Tom Hardy really gets the best of the film as he gets all the good lines, has the most tangible character, and where the film has standout scenes, he is mostly in them. The technical delivery is the overall star though, because it is a film that is handsome, very well made, and has a lot to like in the look, atmosphere and sound work throughout.In this way it is more than worth a look, and it is compelling in what it does, even if at the same time it is not as strong in the characters and their stories as it is in the creation of this atmospheric struggle to survive.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An Odyssey thats far too long and too serious,"This is a tough one, I get it. Yes I already got that after 80 Minutes. But then the movie continues to repeat ""Hell, you've seen nothing yet"", but it stalls on the same barbarian level where Decaprios body has to suffer ones more. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy Zombi-Flicks and splatter movies and I love tough westerns, but the Revenant would have been better if it wouldn't take itself so f***ing serious an Mr. Inarritu would have cut this down to 115 minutes. Its just like the doctor said in ""The Marathon man"": This dent is dead, there is no need to torture it anymore, I have to drill a fresh one. The Revenant is trying too much to stay at 110 % pain until the end, so that I felt numb when it came to the final showdown. It has spectacular cinematography and a brilliant Tom Hardy, but less would have been so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Cinematographer was the star,Just got around to seeing this as I have been bored/disinterested with Hollyweird for the last 20 years. The only thing impressive about this film was the cinematography. The beautiful shots of the river were stunning. Quite sure the book was much better which I am now going to add to my must read list. As far as performances go DiCaprio is Jack Dawson in all his performances that I have seen so far. This time his acting was decent I guess because he didn't talk much. Wonder how he will do in the Flower Moon movie coming up. (Also on my reading list) Hardy playing the typical murderous bigot was an Oscar baiting role that clearly showed that it was. Inarritu bless his heart but trying to direct this cast didn't show his talents all too well. Lubezki was THE star.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It is as beautiful as it is brutal. As always, Leonardo DiCaprio gives us a stellar performance as Hugh Glass fighting for his life and vengeance, but just as good were the other key performances in Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter.

One of the best films I have seen,"Before I saw this film today, I knew that The Revenant was nominated for 12 Academy awards, so I had high expectations. Then yesterday I started reading several reviews and I got surprised of how many reviews were quite negative. They mentioned the same things like that: ""The movie is way too long for its own good. The movie is boring. The movie is too slow. The movie lacks story and depth. The main character is unrealistic and seems immortal. The movie contains too many repetitive shots of trees and nature. The movie turns almost a parody.""So when I saw this film today, I had lowered my expectations, but was still really looking forward to seeing this film. To my big surprise, I actually didn't agree with anything of the things mentioned above. Surely it's not everyone's cup of tea because it's more of an art film than a blockbuster giant that's appealing to everyone.To me The Revenant is: Beautiful - the most beautiful film I have ever seen on the big screen. The scenery's and lightning are absolutely incredible, and it feels so real like I'm right in there. I love the pace and the calmness throughout the film. The story is quite simple without weird twists and turns, BUT that's not needed because that's not how this story goes! I love the simplicity combined with the brutality, struggle and determination for survival and revenge, as well as love. I really felt for the main character.I love Leonardo DiCaprio in this role. He is perfect and I love him in more mature roles like this. Everyone credit Tom Hardy and yes he is brilliant, as well as all the actors are actually. Everyone fit in so well in their characters. But I would like to give an extra credit to Leo who is definitely not outshined by Hardy. What an actor and what a performance by DiCaprio. I was really touched and impressed by his character as well as his performance. He deserves an Oscar that's for sure.There is more to this film than just Leo crawling around grunting and the Revenant is definitely not close to a parody as some people say it is. I can't believe people saying these things. It's one of the best movies I have seen and it's been a long time since I've been so touched by a film. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's my cup of tea.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Revenge is a dish best served in the beautiful cold.,"The Revenant weaves history, nature and war into a beautifully shot film. This slow burning tale of revenge does not rely upon dozens of dialogue heavy scenes, but it instead focuses on the quintessence of its subject. I am glad that Iñárritu strays away from a history lesson, as it allowed a tender era to unfold in a brutal light without insulting the audience with tiresome exposition.The Oscar dodging Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance. From start to finish, he puts everything into the character of Hugh Glass, a man of the American frontier who seeks retribution for the death of his half-native son. Tom Hardy is Fitzgerald, an unusual aggressor in that he never truly inflicts harm for pleasure, but his actions are rather a circumstance of nature, war and innate survival. This again isn't entirely what we hear, but it is what we see – many glances, expressions and explosions of anguish tell us of burgeoning conflict without a word.I feel The Revenant achieves greatness in these scenes. The bear mauling, Glass' speechless days injured and his subsequent hunt are beyond enchanting. The supporting cast do what they need to and they do it well, but their scenes are often stolen by Leo and Hardy's masterful performances. The past is alluded to in spiritual scenes, and although gorgeously meaningful, some only exist to retell recent toils in a confusing fashion. Nonetheless, Iñárritu has directed yet another masterpiece, soaked in blood and snow, and it would not surprise me if Leo and he return from The Oscars with a golden man in hand. They certainly deserve it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A truly gripping masterpiece.,"Dicaprio is a talented actor for sure. He was awesome in Titanic, funny in Catch Me If You Can, hilarious in Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood, and, to be honest, weird in Romeo and Juliet. But of all of those movies, and possibly all of the others I haven't seen, this is my favorite.I was expecting some average western with a cliche ending. Bad guy dies, good guy lives on. Constant gunfights and fake looking action. But it was so much more than that. The movie was a somewhat fictionalized movie about a historic fur trapper who gets attacked by a bear and left for dead. The only thing keeping him alive is his craving for revenge against the man who ruined his life. I can understand why Leo won an oscar for his portrayal of Glass.This movie is gripping from the minute it starts. The action and drama is almost non-stop. Just like Shawshank, I completely underestimated this movie. I'm offended that it didn't make it to the top 250. Definitely a cult-classic in the running.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""The filming may not appeal to those who are reluctant to watch a snowbound, wintry forest in slowness of motion....""","The Revenant is a remarkable story in a film that crafts survival and adventure into a bleak season in North America.

Although, maybe not as outstanding ( in comparison ), the film is very close as an epic: of a cinematic journey of a masterclass of film making?The filming may not appeal to those who are reluctant to watch a snowbound wintry forest in slowness of motion in its character of nature -exquisitely slow, in thoughts and in masochism- but I found it to be exciting in a harrowing, but brutal, true tale to reveal the heart and spirit of mankind in survival, and to search for that wonderful compassion that will arise in sanction of mercy.The film was directed by Alejandro G.

The Wonderful Visuals Bring the Film to Life,"The Revenant (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Visually striking drama/action film about guide Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who crosses a grizzly bear and is seriously wounded. Before long the man (Tom Hardy) left back to protect him leaves him to do as well as taking away someone very close to Glass, which leads to a tale of revenge.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has quickly become one of the greatest directors in regards to visuals and it pretty much happened over his last two movies including this. As with last year's BIRDMAN, this film here takes the director's visual style to a whole new level and it helps create a rather unique and original looking film that takes on a subject that has been told before but it works.I say this type of story has been done before and it has countless times. With that said, more than likely the majority of people watching this film hasn't seen the story before because we really haven't seen this type of Western in several decades. I think it's fair to call this a Western but it's rather hard to imagine the Indian massacre, the bear battle or the intense ending not making this a Western in its own way.The strongest thing about this film are the visuals but we've also got a couple excellent performances from DiCaprio and Hardy. Both men are wonderful in their roles and this is especially true for Hardy who is just so cold blooded and evil that you can't help but want to see him in a lot of pain. The actor does a marvelous job building up this character without too many words but when he does say something it rings right through you. As for DiCaprio, I'm not going to lie but he's one of my favorite actors and he has been since I first saw him in THIS BOY'S LIFE back when it was released. I don't think this is one of his greatest performances but he is still wonderful here and especially since he has to do the majority of the acting with his eyes.The film's settings are another major plus as you really do feel and believe what you're seeing on the screen. The director does an excellent job at making you feel everything that the lead character feels and this includes the now already legendary bear attack. The film's brutal violence is another major plus because it just makes everything seem a lot more realistic. THE REVENANT is certainly one of the most beautiful looking movies you'll see from 2015 and it has two great actors delivering excellent performances.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It's a certain movie for a certain mood, where the picture slices the story off and stares at itself for each moment before the next page.What is missing however is sufficient explanation as to the background to additional minor characters, and the overall reason for the main story taking place is badly conceived and lacks believability.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An utter masterpiece of cinematic filmmaking,"Marvel fanboys will find this movie ""boring"". No superheroes or crappy CGI. Just marvelous scenery, cinematography, acting and writing. The best of the best. Quite possibly one of the last truly great films before Marvel took over and ruined film for a generation.

I fall for the hype every time,"There is a giant flaw in current major Hollywood productions; the essential art of telling a good story.We desperately need writers who can produce strong screenplays with plots that develop and hold our interest throughout a film. And we need directors and editors who are able to seamlessly weave together a story through film. We do not need a bunch of scenes tacked together and called a movie.The Revenant being hailed as a great film is a travesty to movie- making. It's a movie without a story, something far too common these days in Hollywood.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"The ""Revenant"" copies Tarkovsky?","The ""Revenant"" copies Tarkovsky? Renevant copies Herzog's ""Aguirre"", Annaud's ""The Bear"", Mel Gibson's ""Apokalypto"" is the right question and answer is yes. The Mexican director has put a lots from these films in the mix, that's why you have the sense of deja vu, watching ""Revenant"". The story with Tarkovsky is just a brilliant -but fake- marketing idea to give a touch of art and ""poetry"" to this moderate big budget Di Caprio film and so to achieve better sells outside America, where things seem to be difficult at the box office. The only common between Inarritu and Tarkovsky is that they both finally give you the same empty taste under the well done but completely artificial universe they create. But this is not what the creators of this incredible story ""Revenant by Tarkovsky"" want to spotlight!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Beautifully Striking Art House Film,"""The Revenant"" features the same successful formula of Alejandro González Iñárritu's previous Oscar winning film ""Birdman:"" excellent filmmaking from a very talented cast and crew. It heavily relies on its visceral power, filmmaking technique, committed performances from its actors, and the majestic beauty of its setting to overcome its simplistic story.""The Revenant"" starts out strong with one of the most well shot and immensely gripping scenes of the year in which Indians attack the fur trappers. The scene was executed to perfection with stunning visuals, gut wrenching intensity, graphic violence, and a realistic perspective the audience experiences first hand through the use of a meticulously engineered tracking shot. Then there was the intense bear mauling scene which was also masterfully shot, though not as ambitious in scope as the opening scene. Unfortunately for ""The Revenant"" its best scenes were in the beginning of the film.As ""The Revenant"" dragged on it became sluggish, unfocused, and almost inaudible. Although throughout the film it showed signs of life by expertly depicting intense confrontations and beautiful scenery. But at the same time, between the gripping and exciting moments, there were many dull dream-like sequences that failed to give a clear understanding of DiCaprio's Hugh Glass. For the long runtime, Hugh Glass was not properly developed to feel the sufficient magnitude of his suffering. Leonardo DiCaprio's engaging, and somatic performance was enough to overshadow this flaw, and it may even land him his first Oscar.Then there was Tom Hardy's menacing John Fitzgerald. Tom Hardy's portrayal was good yet underwhelming for Oscar standards because it was difficult to understand what exactly he was saying. Yet maybe this was done on purpose for authenticity but it still made it hard to understand his character and some vital plot explanations. Finally the film felt so self-indulgent in its own style of natural light filmmaking that it seemed like the filmmakers stretched shots and sequences for too long just to show off their prowess.In conclusion, ""The Revenant"" is a well-acted, masterfully shot, slow moving revenge/survival art house film with amazing scenery. The film will definitely win Oscars for its filmmaking craft but falls short of greatness because of its flaws. It may win best picture, but it is not the best movie of the year. ""The Revenant"" did not fulfill its duties as effectively and successfully as ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" or ""The Hateful Eight"" to reach 'best movie of the year' status.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already.""","Fifteen minutes into the film, right after the Native attack that opens the story, two people next to me got up and left the theatre. It was about ten minutes after that that I looked over to my wife, she seemed bored out of her mind. As the credits rolled, I asked her what she thought. She went on to list off all her problems with the film, mainly the length and how 'boring' she found it. I on the other hand, found it utterly visceral in the unrelenting grittiness that bathed over my eyeballs.After a vicious bear attack, Hugh Glass is left battered and beaten. His men try their best to help transport him back to their settlement, yet the harsh environments and tracking Natives on their heels make it near impossible. Three men, including his son, decide to stay behind with him, while the others venture forward. One of those men is Fitzgerald, who only volunteers due to the promise of extra money when they return. Fed up with waiting, Fitzgerald takes matters into his own hands, leaving Glass behind to die. Fueled by revenge, Glass is determined to stay alive, crawl 200 miles and kill the man responsible for leaving him in the dirt.There's been a lot of talk about the behind the scenes drama surrounding this film. Multiple crew members quit mid production over the shooting conditions, which included harsh cold weather, dangerous stunts and only using natural light. The trials and tribulations of those who created this film, benefits us, the audience. The film is absolutely gorgeous and should undoubtedly win Lubezki a third straight Oscar for the cinematography, a first in the Academy's history. There were multiple moments where I simply sat in awe at some of the beautifully painted pieces of nature that both Lubezki and Iñárritu give us. There were many times during this film that I felt like I was watching a Malick film, which makes sense since Lubezki shot The New World, which feels similar to The Revenant.There's been a lot of buzz around Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, how it might finally earn him that alluding Oscar statue. Honestly, he deserves it. The man ate raw meat and he's a damn vegetarian. Most of his performance, which is brutally savage, has him fighting for his life. He doesn't say much, it's hard to talk after having your throat slashed by a bear. DiCaprio always delivers great performances in my opinion, this one took him to his utter limits. It's hard to see another performance this year that deserves it more. I pass equal praise to Tom Hardy who stars as Fitzgerald, the ""villain"" of the picture. Hardy always seems to disappear into his roles, this one is no different. He's equal parts menacing and rough. DiCaprio is strong and you need just as strong a performance to support him, Hardy does this in spades.I'm sure there are people out there that will have the same reaction as my wife. The film isn't perfect, it has some issues. There are numerous sequences that showcase DiCaprio's dead wife, these elements stall the already lengthy film. Had these sequences been cut out completely, or even down to one scene, it would have helped significantly. The film clocks in just under two and a half hours. That is a long film about a fur trapper slowly making his way across some rough terrain. Add on top of that the long take shots that Iñárritu loves to show off and you have yourself a film that feels long. Iñárritu loves to showoff his fancy camera work, he did this almost obnoxiously with Birdman a film I did like. He does it again here, sometimes to great effect, sometimes to annoyance. The camera gets so close to the actors at times that their heavy breathing literally fogs up the lens of the camera. It takes you out of the experience and reminds you, this is a film.......but what a film it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Over-hyped and overlong,"Well acted and well photographed, yet unfocused, as it is told from multiple perspectives (DiCaprio's, Hardy's, and the Native Americans) , while I think Hardy's character was much more interesting and conflicted than DiCaprio's.Film turns DiCaprio's character into a sort of wilderness superhero, able to survive being mauled by a bear (twice) , hypothermia, near drowning, and, in the film's best scene, a fall from a great height while on horseback. However, its dramatic effect is largely negated by the fact that the scene was shown in the trailer. Even worse, by that point in time, we are positive he will survive, considering all he has already lived through.There's a difference between resilience, being determined to survive, and being an indestructible (and unrelateable) superhero.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Visceral, savage, and beautiful.","The Revenant was fantastic. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters. Movies like this are a truly rare experience.First of all, the obvious. It is a visual and technical masterpiece. Filmed on location in the wilderness with all natural lighting, this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It truly feels like you're placed in the American frontier along with the characters. It's a stunning mix of old, new, and groundbreaking film techniques.The film makers went through hell in order to create as authentic of an experience as possible. No obvious and glossy CGI special effects here. Even an avalanche was created for real by detonating explosives in a mountain. Also, all of the actors fully committed to look and act the part of hardened wilderness explorers.However, this movie isn't for everyone. This isn't a romanticized patriotic flick like most Hollywood movies set during America's early history. It's visceral and savage, examining the relentlessness of nature and the harsh reality of frontier life. The fight scenes aren't just set pieces designed to entertain the audience. They're gripping and absolutely brutal. I've seen bloodier movies, but almost none have felt this real. It's obvious that a lot of the stunt work was done by the actors because there are no quick cuts or cheap editing tricks during the action sequences. Even Tom Hardy, who can be seen pole vaulting onto vehicles in Mad Max: Fury Road, was concerned about the safety of some of the stunts he had to perform. That being said, this is NOT an ""action"" film. Much time is spent on the captivating landscapes and quiet moments of being alone in nature.The story is simple. It's about the fight for survival over limited resources in the wild. It almost feels like a nature documentary because the people are just another species trying get by. Almost all violence erupts from the need for self preservation. The bear that attacks Glass is simply defending it's cubs. And even the villain of the story is driven by fear, not just because he's the ""bad guy"". The acting is all phenomenal. There wasn't a single mediocre performance. I doubt we'll ever see a film like The Revenant made again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Survival of the fittest.,"This is my review of The Revenant (spoiler free).Cast: six time Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, Academy Award nominee Tom Hardy*, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter.Plot: Hugh Glass (DiCaprio)is a frontiersman out an adventure with his team in their fight for survival in the bitter landscape. When the unthinkable happens Glass' life is in the balance.Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu (Birdman, 2014) over the period of five years in harsh conditions, this film literally changes the history of filming. Let me go through some points on why I think this is the film of the year:Performances: The performances throughout are all Oscar-worthy, especially considering that this is the first film with Leonardo DiCaprio, since The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). The performances are exceptional throughout and they didn't come out of character one single bit.Story: The story of the film keeps intact throughout regarding the length of the film. The director knew what story he wanted to do and he stayed with it.Lighting: There was no studio used to make this picture it was entirely around nature. The use of natural light in this film is the real clincher. The director didn't use any artificial light to take away the landscape.Atmospheric landscapes: This film is set in the American wilderness and was filmed in Calgary, Alberta. The acting isn't the only thing that makes the film,it is the beautifully atmospheric polar landscapes, from the vast forests to the incredible mountain ranges this film literally has it all.All in all this is the film of the year and I completely recommend it without regret, and I would go through the flaws at this point but there aren't any this film is flawless. Even though DiCaprio doesn't say that much I hope he wins the Oscar. 10/10 pure excellence, a must see.*Best performance by a supporting actor The Revenant (2015).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Gruelling and unforgiving yet somehow beautiful..,"Those two words sum up nearly the entire movie. Moments where I had to look away because of how gruesome it was and moments where I took my time admiring the scenery.
It was certainly a roller coaster ride. Not recommended for anyone who dislikes violence and all that crap. But this is a movie with a history genre so how can you not expected it.Alright story with little meaning and ok pacing. The music composition and visuals were gorgeous and were amazing, the costume designs were also Impressive. The characters were good enough for me, well written and were different from one another. The acting, the directing, and writing were some of the best I have seen from any movie I will admit.A movie that I cannot get out of my head, I'm going to remembering some of the images in this movie for a while both good and bad.Memorable: No. Rewatchable: Maybe depends on my mood or to waste time I guess",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Revenant,"Film ""The Revenant"" by Alejandro González Iñárritu is highly acclaimed for its realism combined with almost fantastical landscapes. The film is incredibly beautiful and was shot using natural light and with minimal special effects.There is a conflict in the film between the beauty of nature and the ugliness of human relationships. Cruelty and intrigues set against the background of majestic mountains and forests. The talent of the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki without a doubt deserved the most prestigious film awards.The director was obviously influenced by Andrei Tarkovsky and Terrence Malick, who also took a lot from the great Russian director. Some scenes from the latest movie with Leonardo DiCaprio have copied from the works of the Soviet director. The similarity is evident: people are composed similarly and matching cinematographic techniques are used. The scenes for example where the protagonist is dreaming about ruins of a castle or sees his levitating wife are taken directly from the films of the Russian director.The acting of Leonardo Di Caprio is one of the strongest sides of the film and combined together with the unique cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki made the film ""The Revenant"" a masterpiece of modern cinematography.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2016/02/the-revenant-review/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
trapper revenge,"This is a simplistic tale of revenge that has been done many times. And this is definitely not Leo's best performance, but I guess they finally gave him the Oscar for his body of work. He did a better acting job in Wolf of Wall street and when he played Howard Hughes among others.He plays a trapper that is attacked by a bear. The boss decides leave him with 2 others to take care of him till he passes while the others make their way back to the settlement. One of them, Fitzgerald is an awful person, and just wants easy money and when Glass doesn't die the first day, he wants to help him along. He basically uses lies to get the other guy to leave Glass behind.But a miracle happens and some how Glass recovers. And of course is out for revenge on Fitzgerald. So we get some scenes of survival, him helping a Native lady till the final tracking scenes with Fitzgerald.FINAL VERDICT: It's OK, not what I would call one of the best films of the year. But I think the cinematography captures the feeling of settlement times. Worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Inarritu's tale of survival and revenge is beautifully brutal in its execution,"From the opening moments of The Revenant, I knew this film was going to be special. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film opens with a mesmerising battle sequence, both brutal and beautiful in its execution, and goes on to tell a captivating story of survival and revenge that will remain as one of the more memorable cinematic experiences I will ever have.When a party of fur trappers are driven off course by an attack from a Native American tribe, they look to Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a frontiersman who knows the territory well, to set them on a new one.After being mauled by a grizzly bear and with his life hanging in the balance, Glass is eventually left for dead by members of his own hunting party, leaving him facing a fight for survival and a chance of revenge, if he can survive the harsh conditions.The troubles that the film faced during filming have been well-documented, with crew members quitting due to the harsh conditions and locations however, the finished product would suggest to me that it was all worth it because The Revenant really is an amazing piece of filmmaking.I left the cinema absolutely breathless, mainly just because of how visually stunning the film is. There are shots that will leave you opened-mouthed and shots that will simply leave you questioning, ""How?!"". The decision to shoot the film in natural lighting is a brave one and it really adds such an authenticity to proceedings. There's a moment late on in a forest where the only light given off is from torches and it's just glorious.Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, really is in a rich vein of form in his career and his work on The Revenant really is up there as some of the best I have ever seen, his wide shots showcasing the vast and beautiful mountainous terrain and his long takes during the opening battle sequence, taking us from tussles on the floor to horseback in one flowing motion, setting the film off in such pulsating fashion. Lubezki has won the last two Academy Awards for cinematography, expect the third one to be his come the end of February.The film's length has come under a bit of scrutiny but I could have easily sat through a further half hour, I was that engrossed in Glass' search for revenge. The film is a basic tale of survival and revenge yet, through Inarritu's filmmaking choices and narrative, there feels so much more to it all.There is one intense scene that has already made the headlines for all the wrong reasons and that is the moment Glass is mauled by a grizzly bear. Obviously created through CGI yet feeling as real as anything else in the film, it really is an outstanding moment that I will just have to wait for the blu-ray to see just how they did it.Coming to the performances, The Revenant is just as strong as other departments. Leonardo DiCaprio leads the film as Hugh Glass and it's much more of a physical performance than anything else, using his eyes and facial expressions to great effect throughout. By the end, you feel as if you have gone through everything, from freezing cold conditions to eating just about anything to survive, with Glass. While I don't think this is his best performance, it's still one of such a high standard and I will be cheering him on for the much coveted Academy Award for Best Actor.DiCaprio is joined by an impressive supporting cast, headed by the always impressive Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald. Hardy again possesses a bit of mumble here though it's not hard at all to make out what he is saying but I did notice more than ever in this Hardy performance just how much he uses his eyes in his acting. Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are also on hand to provide able support, Gleeson as Captain Andrew Henry and Poulter as the naive Jim Bridger.I am aware that, like many of the films going for gold during awards season, The Revenant has leaked online however, I urge you to seek it out at your nearest cinema because it really is an immersive cinematic experience that simply has to be seen on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Visually Stunning with a self aware script,The first hour and a half or so of this film is deserving of an 11/10. This film has some of the best cinematography i have ever seen in my life. Along with that DiCaprio gives perhaps his best performance of all time. This is a very visually structured film meaning that there is very little dialogue and a lot of DiCaprios is in a different language anyway. The film takes its time and doesn't clog the audience with excessive exposition. Many complaints on this site are against the depth of all of the characters but after watching it three times you begin pick up on the point of the flashbacks. You see what DiCaprio and this boy went through many years ago and you begin to understand Dicaprios deep connection with his son. Tom Hardy also gives an excellent performance as well. He does not have these flashbacks but that is because the audience can figure out all they need to know about him through his actions. Hardys character did have a role in which more dialogue was given and in every sentence he spoke and every move he made you would begin to dive further and further into the character and understand the extent of his insanity. There are some quick flashbacks of Hardys character that I have yet to decipher. The only flaw that i could find with the movie is that DiCaprio suffers life threatening injuries one too many times. The first hour and a half is one of the best movies I've ever seen with the second have being one of the best films of the year. Phenomenal movie for those who can endure it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A brutal, harrowing, and visually stunning adventure film unlike anything that's been seen before","The Revenant is Alejandro Iñàrritu's majestic revenge story set in the early 1800s that follows the larger than life true story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he travels across old America in hopes of exacting revenge against the men that left him gravely wounded and his son dead. The revenge story line is the oldest in the book and, no matter how overplayed, evokes the most emotion especially when the players are right. DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter make for some pretty excellent players in Iñàrritu's more visual film and this allows audience members to connect with the film on a more accessible level rather than the cinephiles that this film was made for. Emanuel Lebezki has, yet again, outdone himself. The beauty in each frame is undeniable. The landscapes, the snow, the blood, the violence. No matter how harrowing a situation is, the film is still one of the most beautiful ever made and this is a testament to Lebezki and Iñàrritu. The patience they endured on set speaks volumes to the film that they made. The Revenant isn't fast paced, it isn't action packed, it is a story told through the eyes of a visionary and that may off put some people who are looking for a film like The Hunted or The Grey or any other man against wilderness film. The film is slow and takes it's time in giving the audience something they can sink their teeth into. Instead, they allow the audience to be submersed in this cold and desolate landscape, all while capturing the beauty of the American landscape. The battle scenes are epic. Mostly done through extended long takes, the film is a cinephile's dream. The camera movements, the tracking shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done and shown in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with an over 10 minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly captivating and awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to their limits both physically and creatively. But as much as the filmmakers pushed themselves, so did the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a brilliant performance as Hugh Glass. In films before, we've seen DiCaprio fake pain. In this film, you actually feel his pain. With every bite from a bear, every broken bone being reset, every wound being crudely stitched, his performance reeks of perfection and that is exactly what we get from him here. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald is a typical bad guy here, nothing more nothing less. He's good, he's not on the level of DiCaprio here though. The rest of the cast is amazing, as always with any Iñàrritu film. Overall, The Revenant is a brilliant film that isn't quite a masterpiece but has enough technical achievements within it to set it apart from any other film this year. I definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A thrilling story for revenge overshadowed by the survival instinct of mankind,"A truly magnificenft film with an amazing story and an even greater Oscar winning performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. The cinematography in this film is very beautiful and gives the story a very real feeling to it, also because of the story about Hugh Glass which the film is based upon. Though largely fictionalized the storytelling, cinematography, acting, worldbuilding and all that a film has got to it, makes the story feel real even tho it is not. The brutalness of some scenes makes me ponder on how they managed to make it so real and leave you startled.This film had me sitting on the couch face in my hands because it was so intense and Leos performance was truly mesmerizing. Even tho he barely speaks his face gives of so much raw emotion that speaking isn't needed.My only problem with this film is the runtime tho not super long some scenes feel very drawn out and unnecessary long. However it is not to much to make this film unenjoyable and boring, it is still a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The technical are the only aspects to take away from this one.,"Google defines revenant as: a person who has returned, especially supposedly from the dead. It is safe then to say that I was a Revenant after finishing Alejandro G. Iñárritu's big budget 2015 film. Strapping in for a 2.5+ hour film, that I was ensured would be pure cinema mastery, The Revenant proved to be a grave disappointment. All of the buzz from critics and fans only assure me that herd mentality is alive and well, and far more prevalent that even Friedrich Nietzsche could have envisioned.The audience is introduced to explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) early on in the film. A legend in his own right, Glass is charged with making sure his fellow fur trappers get home safely, as he is the one who knows the open country best. Joined by his son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) who is half Native American, Hugh is no stranger to tragedy. His Native American wife was killed by white soldiers, devastating Hugh and set him on a vagabond lifestyle afraid to call anywhere home too long. Along the journey, a long (seemingly endless) winter ensues and the group is forced to make difficult decisions to get home safely. Glass is seen as the most knowledgeable in regards to traveling which upsets another group member, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who almost always disagrees with Glass's assessment of whatever situation is at hand. After being viciously attacked by a bear, Glass is rendered incapacitated, unable to speak, and reliant on the group to return him to full health. The more brutal the winter becomes, the more Fitzgerald wants to leave Glass for dead and make headway along with the men, taking their firs to a big payday that awaits. Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), unable to pull the trigger and put Glass out of his misery, splits the group up, leaving Glass, Hawk, and the young Bridger (Will Poulter) to care for him and return home. Seeing an opportunity, Fitzgerald volunteers to join the boys and Glass along the way. After a scuffle with Hawk, then tricking Bridger, convincing him there are Native Americans on their trail ready to kill them, they leave Glass behind to fend for himself. In abandoning Glass, Fitzgerald goes against Captain Henry's orders that if Glass should take a turn for the worst, he is to have a proper burial. Believing he will die, Fitzgerald goes about traversing the wilderness with the unwilling Bridger (who sees what kind of man Fitzgerald really is). With nothing but anger and will power assisting him, Glass vows recovery with the notion that he will hunt Fitzgerald down over his betrayal. Forever dedicated to the memory of his family, Glass fervently searches revenge as vengeance overwhelms him.Sadly being overshadowed by DiCaprio, as the belief persists that he is overdue for an Oscar, Tom Hardy performs exceptionally well in this film. He plays a simple, yet greedy man capable of evil incredibly convincingly. It is not easy to pull off such opposite personalities, yet Hardy's brilliance as an actor makes it look easy. DiCaprio, on the other hand, plays his part in a perfectly mediocre way. There wasn't a lot to the part of Hugh Glass. Anyone can feign revenge and freezing. Why this part was seen as such a difficulty escapes me, but ""it's his year"" they say. The cinematography was a thing of beauty, but how could it not be? When you have billions of billions of dollars and are using the great outdoors, you better turn out a fantastic product. The infamous bear scene was incredibly juvenile, as the CGI bear looked ridiculous against the real life wilderness. I understand Iñárritu's genius, as a I was a huge fan of Birdman, but he took everything that was good about Birdman and overdid it to the point of making it look ridiculous. What I do not understand is why Iñárritu chose to allow condensation and blood to splatter the camera. This was an odd decision as so much work was taken to establish realism; to then remind the audience that ""this is just a movie, see?' was a peculiar maneuver. This film was also over the top in its use of gore. What is interesting to me is that the same reviewers that criticized Quentin Tarantino's Hateful Eight for over the top violence, have no problem for that same imposing gore in The Revenant. Just goes to show, if you are viewed as an artist, like Iñárritu, instead of a director like Tarantino, you can get by with a lot more in Hollywood.What can be learned from The Revenant? Revenge should be left up to God, or the world, or Native Americans-whichever you prefer. If you are thinking, ""ok, lots of movies share that message"" so was I, but for some reason, I thought this movie would tell it differently—it does not. I trusted that The Academy saw something in The Revenant that I needed to see too; I remain unsure of what that ""something"" is. There are more problems than positives in The Revenant, and I am only left hoping for another Boyhood awards night; the movie everyone thought would win every award it was nominated for, yet only took home a single award. I am ever more convinced with each Best Picture nomination that I watch that The Academy really missed the boat on giving a nod to Carol.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Finally Leo will get his Oscar,"I've never written a review on this page, but I thought this movie is worth it. I walked into the cinema with some expectation as to how the movie would be, but by the end I was completely amazed by the incredible work of Iñárritu and his crew. The whole cinema was quiet once the credits started rolling and nobody said a word until they walked out.The story isn't complicated or hard to follow but at the same time it is so intense that you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. Trying to not reveal any spoilers, there is a part of the movie that there is no dialogue at all, but it is never boring to watch, you feel like you're the main character trying to survive. The landscape shots are amazing and the music is captivating, the acting never disappoints as all the main characters give great performances.If Leo doesn't get a his well deserved Oscar for this, then I don't know what he will get it with.

"Watchable, but...","Of course I knew about this 2015 movie, I just never gotten around to watching it before now in 2023, as the opportunity presented itself. Yeah, I am not overly keen on Leonardo DoCaprio in general, so I haven't hard the particular urge to track down this movie.And now having just sat through 156 minutes of it, I can honestly say that I hadn't been missing out on a particular grand moment in cinematic history. Sure, the movie was watchable and entertaining enough for what it was, but it was by no means an outstanding viewing experience.Writers Mark L. Smith, Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Michael Punke put together a fair enough script and storyline for the movie. It was entertaining and watchable for what it turned out to be. Though I doubt that I will ever return to watch the movie a second time.The scenes in the movie were nicely filmed and nicely choreographed and set up, and it definitely felt and looked like a frontier-based movie. The visual aspects and the cinematography really helped to bring the movie and the storyline to life on the screen. I especially enjoyed the fight scene with the grizlly, because it looked rather violent and realistic.The character gallery in the movie was fair enough, though there aren't really a whole lot of a character development going on throughout the course of the 156 minutes that the movie ran for. Which, I suppose, makes it a somewhat shallow experience.The acting performances in ""The Revenant"" were good. Leonardo DiCaprio actually carried the role quite well here, however, I will say that the movie was carried by Tom Hardy's performance, because it was really a rather interesting performances and a rather memorable one as well for him. It was a shame that Brendan Fletcher and Kristoffer Joner weren't given a bigger roles to play in the movie.Worth watching, sure, but ""The Revenant"" was not a gem in the history of cinema.

A Rare Experience,"It is one of the most beaten clichés of movie-marketing to call in the viewer to experience something unusual. When in truth there are very few filmmakers who are able to pull off something like a sensory cinematic experience.Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu is one of those rare directors. His movies defy narrative conventions (""21 Grams"", ""Babel"") and also visual templates (""Birdman""). Now he has achieved his next big step. A big budget adventure story that is reduced to its most minimal plot-elements while being a truly immersive experience that manages to give a tangible sense of a long-gone era.Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a tracker who assists a band of fur-trappers in the early nineteenth century. He is attacked by a bear along the frontier of Montana. And after being left for dead finds himself amidst an unforgivable wilderness.The screenplay written by Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu is a starting point for a film that relies first and foremost on the image and is therefore reconnecting with the era of silent film and the most fundamental roots of the medium. Iñárritu who tried to avoid as much as possible the trappings of computer effects has production designer Jack Fisk, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, costume designer Jacqueline West and his actors pull out all the stops. You are left with images, sounds, faces and languages that force you to reflect on your life two hundred years after the events shown here.Leonardo DiCaprio manages, not unlike Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"", to hold the screen with his presence in a performance that is mostly wordless. From teen-heartthrob to superstar to character actor; DiCaprio's trajectory seems to be about choosing his projects according to the challenges they face. And it must be said that his devotion to the portrayal of an archaic character whose prime motivation is survival is as simple and riveting as can be.Before he began shooting ""Birdman"" Iñárritu sent his cast an image of Philipp Petit, the high-wire artist who walked between the towers of the World Trade Center. It was a symbolic gesture of what he and his collaborators were trying to attempt with their movie. ""The Revenant"" represents another high-wire act by this Mexican iconoclast. It is a successful attempt to resurrect not only a forgotten time, but also some often neglected qualities of cinema.May it jolt all those timid formula-makers out of their slumber.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Alejandro González Iñárritu + Leonardo DiCaprio = A Bloody Hell Movie,"Alejandro González Iñárritu + Leonardo DiCaprio = A Bloody Hell Movie Called The Revenant; literally blood everywhere. What I like about this movie was the director (Alejandro Iñárritu) shot techniques. I don't know what they call it, I have to research on that one. But its pretty amazing! If you have been watching Iñárritu's films such as Babel, Biutiful, Birdman and The Revenant, you will know what I mean. It's like a one-take shot of 20-30minutes scene and its really cool. I think that's Iñárritu's trademark. Every time I see that kind of shot technique I know for sure its Alejandro G. Iñárritu films. 2 Thumbs Up to Leo's performance, he's always been a great actor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
DiCaprio - the Revenant,"I must say that DiCaprio is continuously over the topTo explain the least – Mr. Glass, DiCaprio's character, is a strong source material. But to be able to deliver such a performance, you have to not only dedicate all your strength and stamina, but also have a huge talent – something which Leonardo has in abundance. Combining this with Inarritu's perfect directing skills and Lubezki's paranormal filming abilities – this one had to be the best of the year.And indeed it is – the struggle between man and nature, the vengeance trip, the human relationships, the environmental message – we all see that in its entire run. I must admit that the rawness of the shots were a bit too much at some times for me, but this indeed made the movie true to the real life of these people at that time and at that place.The music is by Ryuichi Sakamoto and I strongly recommend it to every open soul which desires to hear something new and vibrant. The costumes are profoundly adequate and the narrative is rich with pristine survival instincts.But the main character in this film is the nature itself. No matter if we speak about the snow, the trees, the bear or the wind itself – this is what really shakes the viewer in his seat. I purposely didn't pay much attention to the dialogue, but rather enjoyed the ""conversations"" between Glass and his environment. His journey is delicately decorated with flashbacks and dreamlike visions which explain not only the personal story of the character, but also his urge to finish this journey and do what he has to do.The movie is long enough for you to be able to immerse in the setting, so take your time and don't rush to deduct or explain it. There will be plenty of reasons to do that in the next years which I am sure will prove it to be a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Original, Fascinating, Brutal and Realistic with another Great Performance of Leonardo DiCaprio","In the Eighteenth Century, in Louisiana, a group of fur hunters under the command of Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) is attacked by Arikara Indians and the few survivors escape by boat through the Mississippi. The experienced hunter Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who knows the area since he was married with an Indian and lived with her in her tribe, feels that the Arikara are following the boat and tells that it is better off hiding the fur and walk along one week to their fort through the mountains. However Glass stumbles with a grizzly bear and is severely wounded before killing it. He is carried in a stretcher and the hunter John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) suggests killing him since he is near-death, but Henry offers an amount to the man that stays with him. Glass's Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and the teenager Bridger (Will Poulter) offer to stay and Fitzgerald, attracted by the award, also volunteers to stay. However he tries to kill Glass and stabs to death Hawk. When Bridger that was fishing returns, Fitzgerald lures him telling that twenty Arikara are coming and he does not know where Hawk is, forcing Bridger to leave Glass behind. Now Glass begins his dangerous journey of returning alone to the fort seeking revenge against Fitzgerald.""The Revenant"" is an original, fascinating, brutal and realistic film with another great performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. Supported by wonderful landscapes and the music score of Ruiji Sakamoto, the viewer does not feel the 156 minutes running time in a perfect pace balancing drama and adventure. The scene of the struggle between Glass and the grizzly bear is impressively real and mesmerizing.

Inarritu brings captivating story and spectacular spectacle with his best film to date,"Alejandro G. Inarritu's The Revenant is a 19th century western drama that brings the most gritty, realistic, and brutal take I've seen. The Revenant follows Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he battles the elements and native inhabiter's to avenge a loss committed by nemesis John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The Revenant pushes the limits of cinematography and tells one of, if not the most gripping film of the year.Emmanuel Lubezki created a lived in and natural world. I saw the beautifully shot scenic scenes and the first-person like tracking shots, but more importantly I could FEEL them. An edge will grip any viewer and with environmental shots alone i felt genuinely frightened of this unknown wilderness. The bright orange sparks from fires, the dark blue skies, and the black trees that laid on top of the bare white ground were real, they were unforgiving and beautiful.Leonardo DiCaprio gives in my opinion, the best performance of his career. For the first time i wasn't watching DiCaprio, I wasn't watching a man with a malice heart, I was joining Hugh Glass on his vicious struggle for revenge. Tom Hardy has been a busy man but he seemingly cannot stop giving great performances with rather rare dialogue. Hardy becomes his best villain (thats saying something especially for Hardy). Hardy delivers a character we hate from the very beginning giving a untrustworthy, selfish, and genuinely dirty man life. Domhnall Gleeson (Andrew Henry) and Will Poulter (Bridger) both give great performances. Poulter breaks out of his typical comedic acting to give a surprising but magnificent performance, one of the best young actors today.Although the film was inducing and beautiful its script at sometimes fell flat for me. Dialogue at times felt out of its time and a bit too staged but this problem is overlaid by terrific acting, cinematography, and camera direction. Birdman's mind-blowing continuing long-takes are very present in this film creating the most edgy and again realistic scenes I've seen in film. The Revenant has everything Inarritu did perfectly in Birdman and corrected mistakes made in previous films. This film is entrancing but artistic film lovers will fall in love with this film like they did with all of Inarritu's past work. The Revenant pushes every single aspect and limit in filmmaking while delivering a totally unique experience because of this, The Revenant is a excellent film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Would be great without any actors at all - just scenery,"The stars of the movie is the scenery and the cinematography (even though I'd never want to go to any of those sites). It was beautiful in a way 'Dr Zhivago' was but the Russian epic had other things going for it too.The story was 'Tarantiono does Grisley Adams'. The violent opening scene is an echo of the starting scenes to 'Saving Private Ryan' - shocking violence, retelling what were once portrayed as bloodless. While this was an action movie it was no thriller. Knowing the running time and that some of the main characters had to die, was my guide but I wasn't invested in the outcome. The end came as a welcome relief and if they are editing for a shorter version - less DiCaprio would be my preference.The bears were beautiful and almost too believable with every hair distinguishable. I confess, I was rooting for the bear! Right was certainly on her side.Tom Hardy has had a hell of a few years from 'Loche', 'Peaky Blinders' and 'Legend'. He was easy to watch because his character clearly didn't give a '*&%$'.D Gleeson was almost unrecognizable in 'Star Wars Ep VII' and is the new hope for gingers everywhere.Some people think the movie will have trouble making back the budget because the handsome stars keep their clothes on but in fairness, depressing doesn't sell. Look at 'The Road'! I say - imagine it without the woeful drama and just enjoy the majesty on the big screenFor those of us who don't lead a charmed life like DiCaprio, we don't need to pay 6 -10 for another 3 hours of it.

"+Technical Mastery, -Synthetic Spirituality = Memorable Mediocrity","My popcorn tin was heavier when I binned it than when I collected it. Why did I throw up when watching The Revenant? There isn't that much gore to speak of.. What's worth a loud unflattering speech is the wooden spoon of pseudo-philosophical pretensions AG Iñárritu gags the audience with for 2 hours and 26 minutes. I sat with that warm tin on my lap even through the 10 minute credits, contemplating.Consider that Glass' chief motivation for returning from the grave (gravely wounded really) is his love for his Pawnee son, with whom the only memorable scene shared is patting him down from an outburst against Fitzgerald's (Hardy) ferociously racist taunts. He only becomes that much close to him after Fitzgerald coats his rusty knife with the teenager's gastric juice, in a powerfully screamed-out scene.Consider how much running time we spend watching Glass wander wistfully into the afterlife, despite knowing full well he'll overcome his bear wounds for a showdown or the film wouldn't be funded. He eavesdrops on whispers by his murdered wife's wraith, only to wake up and cauterize his torn-open neck with gunpowder; Iñárritu wants to both have his bison liver and eat it. How much can you cheat the narrative?Most redundant of its sophistry is the Darwinian symbolism, as Glass evolves from being bruised and buried, to a crawling creature, to a one-legged limper, to a biped man to a horseback riding gunfighter... In Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, evolutionary symbolism at the end served a purpose of literalizing how survival is a prerequisite for evolution; we wouldn't be writing reviews on IMDb if Neanderthals hadn't scrambled Mousterian tools 300,000 years ago. Here, Glass gets wounded and persists only to become the same man again.... not even a wiser fellow.Above everything, the over-ballyhooed bear attack is dampeningly underwhelming. Not-to-spoil anything, but you remember it, how you give a cat a bowl of milk, the bowl gets swirled around a bit with only a few licks of milk spilling over the edges.. Yeah. Oh, it's not even all in one long continuous take as it's been touted to be, there's a very visible cut soon after Glass arms himself with a knife. What it isn't is even 1/10th as visceral as the jaguar-mauling from Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. What it is is ten times more pointlessly protracted and thusly expensive.On the other hand, The Revenant is filmed with such hypnotic beauty. Lubezki's camera floats around inordinately, (pans more than it tracks) and he seems to find heavenly imagery in every 360° plane. Nature has never looked better in a Hollywood production. There's a grim fairytale (& Ron Fricke-esque) edge to the proceedings. The wide-screen frames are filled with towering forestry, snowmelt and dew drops dripping off the damp lushly colored leaves in close-up. Negatively charged oxygen reaches for your lungs off the screen. When the film slackens to luxuriate in wonder, never is it boring; it's only catching its breath.The editing is often fabulous. From flame-to-flame match cuts in the snow, and most memorably, Glass' labored breath fogs the lens, dissolves into clouds floating in the mountain ranges which are then viciously consumed by Fitzgerald's pipe smoke.But Ho! there... characters' lives are risked for this virtuosity. There's a scene in which Jim Bridger, the story's most conflicted entity, when finding their way to camp with Fitzgerald, happens upon a massacred Native village, huts still smoking. Him and us, (but not Fitzgerald) see a surviving lady, for whom Bridger leaves a parcel whose contents neither we nor her know to be; she's seen Fitzgerald stomp around and cuss, she's surmised his inclination towards violence. She has to choose between 1) staying safely alive by hiding a little longer, or 2) bowing to the logistical limitation of Iñárritu needing to pan around, show her to the audience discovering bread in the parcel and pinching off mouthfuls, then urgently cut to the next scene. Does she play it safe? Not if The Revenant is going to strike a balance between manipulative and masterful.Still, despite the objectionable, emetic and offensively on-the-nose endeavour, Iñárritu deserves an Oscar again, if only for the scene in which Glass eviscerates a dead horse he's ridden off a cliff, and the camera smoothly sails around from the horse's back as its viscera are scooped out, travels in a long take, timed to the action, to find Glass snuggling into its steaming 'womb' then conclude with a close-up of his face. Wow!! (No matter how many takes and fired crew members it took)The most human performance is by Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, consistently flawed and gleaming with gallows humor. Don't be surprised if during the final snowy showdown, you're rooting for him to cut down pretentious.DiCaprio, well, he..... works the hardest. You know that clip they play at the Oscars, your most electrifying moment during a performance, DiCaprio's here is effectively a grisly series of those. My two favorite are him trying-to-not-blink to save his life, and him crawling out of a shallow snow grave, and mortared between his teeth, equal parts spit and grit. Despite my reservations, I'll cheer a lung out for either clip.You can almost hear the voices in his head (his Birdman?) yell in Calvin Candie rhetoric; ""Eddie Redmayne, that new kid, he gimped hisself out last yur, won that Oscar for it.. What are you gonna do, Huh!?!""Such a troubled production, he ate real raw bison liver, yet still he required 5 stunt doubles and 3 photo doubles... that there is a metaphor for the whole movie.While the film is never boring, calling it entertaining would be flattering it. No exhilaration derives from watching a man ride a horse off a cliff; the experience is very akin to staring into an open wound, waiting patiently for it to a cicatrize into a scar. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Art Come to Life,"Alejandro González Iñárritu is on an absolute roll. For what is essentially the second year in a row, Iñárritu has put out arguably the most ambitious and well-crafted film of the entire year. The Revenant is art come to life in the form of a genre-bending survival/revenge epic.First things first, I believe Leonardo DiCaprio has given the best performance I have seen out of him. While there isn't the humor or charm in his character that there was in The Wolf of Wall Street's Jordan Belfort, DiCaprio manages to make a turn against type as introverted bilingual woodsman Hugh Glass. While Leo has been known to turn on the charisma with his previous characters, he gives a more reserved performance in The Revenant and primarily uses physicality and body language to inform the audience of his Hugh Glass' state of being. It plays very well against the confrontational and loudmouthed antagonist that is Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald.Speaking of which, Tom Hardy is magnificent here as well. There's been a lot of talk about Hardy upstaging Leo in his own film, though I wouldn't go as far as that. Hardy gives a magnificent performance as Fitzgerald, but is given much more dialogue and traditional characterization than Leo's Glass. Other supporting actors such as Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson turn in terrific performances particularly in the second half of the film.One of my favorite things about The Revenant is how it is shot. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki captures an impressive amount of beauty and detail utilizing only natural lighting throughout the course of the entire film. One of the best examples of this is the tracking shot of the opening assault on the camp (in particular where it begins to follow characters in combat). The Revenant might not be one of the best-shot films of the year, but one of the best-shot films in the last decade or so. Set to the backdrop of a haunting primal score by the impressive trio of Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, The National's Bryce Dessner, and German electronic musician Alva Noto, The Revenant is transformed into a feast for the eyes and ears.The narrative of The Revenant is fairly straightforward, though it is delivered in the most interesting, raw, and violent ways possible. Much like a favorite film of mine from 2013, Lone Survivor, every bit of violence is felt because of how it is presented. Every gasp, cringe, and wince from the audience is well earned because it isn't too over-the-top and it isn't over-saturated like many action blockbusters tend to be.I can't really think of too many negatives against The Revenant, however I can say that this is not a film for everybody. It's a brutal film that goes at a pretty slow pace, so those who were planning on watching this because they thought it was Leo vs. Bear like the trailers suggested, will probably be turned off. The Revenant is a film that also utilizes silent techniques and forces the viewer to look beyond what is being said. This works for some times and not for others. Personally, I feel as though the surrealist dream sequences are a bit unnecessary and break up the flow of what is essentially a fairly realistic take on a survival/revenge story. Though, seeing how much this film is able to do right, it is a rather small complaint that I have there. Overall, The Revenant is a film that deserves your attention. If you are not opposed to a more slow-paced style of storytelling and enjoy survival movies, The Revenant will be able to deliver in spades and then some.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Spectacular, yet spectacularly slow","The visuals in this film are stunning, and it absolutely draws you into the atmosphere. I can't imagine what all involved went through to capture some of these scenes. It deserves to be seen on the big screen, and, perhaps, is the only way it will really be appreciated since the cinematography is really the star here. What action there is is spectacular, but the film moves along at an extremely slow pace. In one scene where characters were sleeping, I heard snoring, which seemed rather appropriate. However, when I continued to hear the same snoring during other scenes, I realized one of the patrons near me had fallen asleep (and slept through most of the film). A man sitting next to me also spent a large amount of viewing time with his chin on his chest. I personally fought off sleep a time or two as well, but never succumbed.In short, the filmmaking itself is a spectacle to behold, and the special effects are fantastic, but this isn't an action epic, so I'd suggest not going to the theater tired. Oh, and I'd also suggest eating BEFORE you see this, because you might not have much appetite afterward. Reasons will become evident if you see the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Haters only have one argument:,"""This film is boring because he is crawling around and grunting for 3 hours. But the cinematography is good, tho.""Geez. Go back to your over-hyped cookie cutter Hollywood bullshit with lots of unrealistic action scenes and childish jokes. Yes, this movie is slow, and there isn't much of a story going on. Yes, the most part of Leonardo DiCaprio's acting is crawling on the ground and grunting. And yes, the cinematography is outstanding.The point of this film is showing the struggle the protagonist has to go through to get his revenge, and I think the movie delivered this point in a brilliant way. Your lack of patience doesn't make a movie bad. But that seems to be the crowd nowadays. They want a 90 minute cliché film with a lot of action, boobs, funny lines and a ""mind-blowing"" plot twist at the end.Also, saying that DiCaprio was only crawling and grunting shows that you people have no idea about acting. He didn't talk much, and that makes this character even harder to portray: with facial expressions. I'm not saying the performance was Oscar-worthy, but it was very good. And the other actors, especially Tom Hardy, did a great job, too.This film is very much about atmosphere. And I'm not only talking about the filming locations, camera work and editing, you also need some empathy to feel what Hugh Glass must have felt. That's what makes the movie interesting and also suspenseful. Yes, I thought that movie was very suspenseful, believe it or not.Next thing is, of course, the camera work. The amount of absolutely outstanding one shot scenes is amazing and shows the high professionalism of the cast and crew. Did you guys even notice that the whole battle scene at the beginning was ONE SINGLE SHOT? And also every other scene in the movie lasted very long. You feel like you're in the middle of it all. I know this is not new, but they do this on such a high level here, it's amazing.I know this ""review"" reads more like a defense of the movie, but I couldn't keep this to me after reading all the ""opinions"". If you don't like slow movies, it's OK. But don't say a movie is bad or boring just because it's slow.

Solid film,"Overall, this is a solid film with great cinematography and a full appreciation of a way to draw viewers into the rawness of the frontier during the time period which the film set.

The entire venue becomes somehow colder, more isolated, more barren... This is very much one to watch in theaters or high-quality home venues. The efforts are applauded and a quality story is told.How it fares on the road to the Oscars may be a different story but DiCaprio certainly has given Depp and all competitors a run for their money.

"strong, exciting journey","This movie showed amazing cinematography amid majestic settings from the opening scenes and throughout the movie. With direction of the photographer following individual characters in the line of battle, the audience is on the edge of its seat figuring out what is going on from the start, as Journeyman, Explorer, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) leads a troop of Fur traders cross country along the Northwest (North Dakota, actual location).This true survival story from the early 1800's made me describe the movie roughly, as a cross between Jerehmiah Johnson (Robert Redford), The Patriot (Mel Gibson) and Deliverance(Burt Reynolds). With those titles, if any of them tripped your trigger, then you will very much LIKE the Revenant!There are good lessons of character in this movie for which are brought out in the way the badly injured Glass is treated by his troop after being viciously mauled by a huge bear.

Style over substance,"THE REVENANT: I realize what I'm about to say will sound like blasphemy to those who consider Alejandro Inarritu a cinematic god, but I gotta call it like I see it. Let me say at the outset, I fully appreciate the artistry of Inarritu's superb direction, his innovative use of highly choreographed and well rehearsed long takes, the splendor of the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, the severe climatic conditions and the logistical nightmare it must have been to shoot in such inhospitable locations, the hardships the cast and crew endured and on and on. But, I have learned after decades of performing and directing theater, the average audience member doesn't give a crap about any of that and I have to comment as an average audience member. Nobody cares how hard you worked, that you were in rehearsal for five or six weeks, what obstacles you overcame or what your process was to achieve the finished product, we just want to be entertained or moved in some emotional way or be made to think. The problem here is this: Instead of being emotionally involved, we're sitting in the theater wondering 'how did they do that?'. I found many of his choices to be repetitive. Each new scene beginning with an Ansel Adams-like landscape photograph, skyward shots pointed through the trees, the moon shining through parting clouds, rifle barrels entering the frame in extreme closeup and long tracking shots of beautiful scenery. I admit I had to look up revenant: 'A person who has returned supposedly from the dead'. The film ""inspired by true events"" is the survival and revenge story of fur trapper Hugh Glass, as played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who was severely mauled by a bear and after some efforts by his companions to save him, is eventually left in the wilderness to die. We then spend the next two hours watching DiCaprio moan, groan, grunt, crawl and stagger through the film while his will to live is fueled by his hallucinations of his dead wife and son urging him to go on. His son, who's mother was Indian, is killed before his eyes by the villain as played by the mostly unintelligible Tom Hardy. Fortunately the visual images are strong enough that we can figure out what's going on without his dialogue. All of Glass' struggles build to an exciting but predictable final confrontation scene. Revenant may possibly be the best directed movie and it is likely that Inarritu will win the Oscar. But is this the best picture of the year? Not by a mile. DiCaprio, who will surely be considered as one of the best actors of his generation, does a fine job. But worthy of an Oscar for Best Actor? Not in my book. As you may recall, I was not particularly impressed with Inarritu's Birdman. I find that he seems more concerned with style ('Look what I can do!') over substance and therefor, sad to say, I felt nothing. Score: 8.

A masterpiece................................,"An absolute masterpiece of movie making.It wont be to everyone's tastes but its been a while since I watched a film and came out of it thinking that was a masterpiece and is now in my top 10 films of all time. Leonardo Dicaprio absolutely knows what hes doing as everything he does, whether thats professionally or personally just gets better and better and better. Although its not much of a speaking role for him (especially in the middle part of the film) it doesn't matter because of what he goes through in the movie. It really is his fight for survival and how he is determined to get to his destination is where his acting is just mind blowing when he is up against nature and the elements.At the time of going to the cinema there were only late showings in IMAX but I will definitely go and see it in the format for my second viewing.An incredible piece of film making which actually makes you 'feel' like you were there. A top notch cast as well with Domnhall Gleeson, again like Dicaprio, just getting better in everything he does. Everyone behind the scenes saying that this was without a doubt the most difficult shoot they have ever done, but boy oh boy every bit of hard work is up there on screen. Beautifully shot as well with some mind blowing imagery and a perfect score for such a powerful film.As mentioned, it wont be to everyone's tastes, but if you appreciate films like Dances With Wolves (another masterpiece) you will love this film.

The Revenant: Beautiful and Vacuous,"""The Revenant"" is the Angry Super Model of the Oscar SeasonThe Oscar for best cinematography goes to Emmanuel Lubezki for ""The Revenant.""""The Revenant"" is the best looking film I have seen in many years. The depth of the shots is overwhelming; the mountains and the snow in the film are amazing to look at. Unfortunately, the plot and characters don't live up to the look of ""The Revenant."" The film is vacuous and lacks substance, much like a china doll.DiCaprio is good as Hugh Glass, but like the best player on a team that doesn't win a championship doesn't deserve an MVP award, DiCaprio doesn't deserve a best Oscar nod for his performance in ""The Revenant."" The other characters are flat and underdeveloped, and the acting is crushed under the beauty of the photography.Certainly, John Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy has his moments, but he doesn't bring the character up to the level of pure hatred. For a revenge film, you need someone like Bill McKinney who played Captain Terrell in ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."" Now that was a character you love to hate. Fitzgerald didn't have enough of a past for us to fully appreciate how despicable he is. Thus, the revenge tale is not charged enough. Besides, Fitzgerald had a point when he told the Captain that he didn't trust Glass as a guide since Glass had failed to detect the Ree surround the trappers early in the film.While Hugh Glass is a man of few words; his son Hawk is practically mute. There are decent flashbacks that demonstrate their relationship, but what of the son in the present? There is little to go on. And the role of the Captain might as well have been left out of the film. The actions the Captain takes are heroic, and at the same time, incredibly stupid.There is little tension in the film other than the violence of some of the moments. There are no revelations of Glass's tracking acumen, no feeling of impeding doom felt by the evil Fitzgerald who thinks Glass is dead, no surprises in the chase and nothing revealed that is a surprise at all. All that is left is the beauty of nature and the inevitable cruelty of humanity.

Anyone who likes this film is also a fan of the Rocky films. Just like Sylvester Stallone, Leonardo di Caprio gets off the mat after a near lights-out experience and goes on to defeat the enemy of the time. That's all there is, folks - Rocky in the Rockies! Unfortunately, Rocky movies were far less boring than this steaming pile that Iñárritu has deposited (again after Birdman).Is there something worse than mere boredom? Yes there is. Tom Hardy's portrayal of a cleft palate requires subtitles to decipher what the hell is this character's problem. Sorry Americans but some of you really don't render the English language in a way the rest of the world understands it. How did this performance ever get the Best Supporting Actor Oscar? In fact, how did Leonardo di Caprio get his best actor award? I suspect that it was for The Wolf of Wall Street and not this orgy of grunts and crawling out of dead horses and freezing rivers.I might have given The Revenant a better rating for the cinematography as the movie lovingly portrays the Canadian Rockies. This movie was given an award for Best Achievement in Cinematography. Sometimes the Academy does the Right Thing. That being said, maybe they should have just made a travel documentary instead.At the end of The Revenant, I was cheering for the bear at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps if the she-bar had really finished off Leonardo's character, I wouldn't have wasted my time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A master class in acting,"Two heavy weight actors go head to head in a brilliant yet gritty film.

definitely one of the best movies out there if not the best,"this movie was wonderful, i had high expectations for it and it didn't disappoint me it lived to my high expectations.The Revenant could be just one more survival story, but Alejandro Iñárritu directed a movie that can be described as a great cinematic experience. I've really enjoyed its dark but beautiful atmosphere created by director Alejandro Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (both Oscar-winning). The soundtrack just emphasizes it perfectly. Outside of some brutal scenes, the movie is visually superb and will take you to the beautiful landscapes of the Far West. You should be ready for some extreme scenes of violence, though.Some of the most incredible things about this film, is by far the cinematography and the sound design/mixing. Visually this movie is a masterpiece. I say this because i've never seen a movie with this style of filming. It's unique and refreshing to watch, especially because their is not a lot of innovation when it comes to unique style in cinematography. The sweeping, continuous shots that go on and on are a Emmanuel Lubezkis trademark and they work beautifully. The absence of music for a lot of the movie and the sound of the falling snow, or the wind rustling the trees, or water flowing down the river is absolutely beautiful. For some of the scenes, even if you close your eyes and listen, you get the sense of where this film takes place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Visual experience like no other,"I have no intention repeating what other reviewers have said about this film, but I do want to chime in with an often overlooked aspect of The Revenant - cinematography.First of all, the whole film is shot on digital 65mm Arri camera with not a single medium or telephoto lens. Everything is shot with wide angle lenses and the framing is done basically by moving the camera either further away or very, very close to the main actors.This super-close framing combined with wide angle lenses creates an incredible immersive effect, where you simply cannot help but physically feel the cold, the water, the dirt, the blood splatter, the nature. Many times during the movie the lens itself gets splashed in blood or dirt, it fogs up from the breath of the protagonists or even gets kicked during fight scenes. Also, the faces are so close they get distorted from the wide-angle lenses, which in turn creates an even greater effect of honesty. There are no masterfully lit beauty shots here. Instead, it's all very, very, very rough and very real.Also, the movement of the camera is incredible. The huge sweeping 360-degree vistas right in the middle of massive combat scenes create the effect of the viewer being ""in the middle of action"", it is almost as if you're turning your head to look around. The fact that the whole movie is made with only natural light is an interesting factoid, but it's important because the DoP Emmanuael Lubezki suddenly isn't confined in his framing by where the artificial lights are placed. He's free to move any where and any way he wants and that sense of liberty is definitively something we don't get to see very often.Every one of these visual aspects add a new layer of authenticity and what you end up with is an incredible movie that can almost be described as ""an experience"". It's a ride that's hard to forget and is certainly something that anyone interested in film-making is going to want to take a good, hard look into.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Inarritu in Winter,"Alejandro Inarritu has made gripping movies set in such places as Mexico, Tokyo, Morocco, Barcelona and Manhattan and now he conquers the Canadian Rockies and Tierra del Fuego (standing in for the U.S. Rockies) in winter with this tale of brute survival, loyalty to loved ones and humane principles and the limitations of revenge.Leonardo DiCaprio gives another of his super-charged performances as a white fur trapper who, in the company of his half-breed son and other trappers hunts for a fur trading company in the years immediately following the Lewis and Clark Expeditions that jump started U.S. expansion west of the Mississippi. En route he runs afoul of an emotionally damaged and brutal fellow trapper (Tom Hardy) and encounters a sympathetic Indian who is looking for the killers of his family.There are similarities in look, theme and situation to earlier Westerns (""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" ""Jeremiah Johnson,"" ""Dead Man"") and even an Eastern (""Dersu Uzala"") and a Mid-Eastern (""The Passion of the Christ""). The mostly male cast is appropriately grizzled, bearded, unkempt and squalid, with Hardy notably vanishing into grungy dishevelment with a dead-on Texas accent to boot.Gore is everywhere from the earliest scenes, as is fantasy. It is impossible to believe that DiCaprio or any human being, no matter how fit, could survive the bear attack that sets the tone for the grueling survival narrative that follows. Further tests and trials are no more convincing, but DiCaprio gives it all his actorly oomph to make it seem believable. His struggle takes on a mythological quality after a while; you don't believe the literalness of it but you are carried by the spirit of it. Over the course of more than two hours he is repeatedly mangled, frozen, crushed, starved, drenched, sliced and punctured. He probably even dies for a while before emerging reborn from the bloody slit of a horse carcass he has gutted and into which he has crawled naked to keep from freezing after the animal and he fall off a cliff into a snow bank.The sparsely swelling chords of Ryuichi Sakamoto's musical score complement the intensity and obsession of the journey.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Nasty, brutish and long","Based on a book of the same name by Michael Punke, this is the tale of frontiersman Hugh Glass and his battle against the harsh climate of the Montana and South Dakota in order to exact revenge.A revenant in European folklore is a corpse rising from the dead and terrifying the living and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is outstanding as his journey has him straddling the border between alive and dead. The acting here is largely physical and as he jumps in the icy water, is buried alive and eats raw meat, his suffering is incredibly vicarious to the view. It is a film of both survival and revenge; in essence they are both interrelated as it is his desire to avenge his son's death which is keeping him alive.The cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is just stunning as the entire film is shot in natural light and most of it in that ""golden hour"" shortly before sunset. The landscape is visceral and you can almost feel the chill of the Midwestern air through the cinema screen. And though the grizzly bear scene may well be artificial compared to the rest of the film it was certainly no less intense.But in a strange way, the problem with The Revenant may well be its photography. The film is in love with the scenery so much that it becomes an art installation at times and the overlong run-time can possibly be blamed on this. I also had issues deciphering Tom Hardy's American accented dialogue on occasion and this is a problem in a film where relatively few lines are said. There is also an awkward spirituality aspect to the film which appeared to be crow-barred in simply because the film is set in Native Indian territory.It is a terrific cinematic experience visually and this will probably get Leonardo DiCaprio his Best Actor Oscar. However, it is certainly not the best film of the year. To misquote Thomas Hobbes, The Revenant is nasty, brutish and long.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Not just a ""Revenge"" film","Some explanations to why ""The Revenant"" didn't win the Best Motion Picture Oscar were that it is just a revenge film. I hardly disagree. While the story basis is a survival and redemption story, they way the story's told makes it much more. Also there are some other themes than revenge dealt with in this film, such as native Americans, and the exploitation of their lands.We're constantly introduced to stunning visuals of nature, wonderful single-take scenes, alternated with some singular dream sequences.I remember that, when they adverstised the film, they constantly paragonated this to Tarkovskij films. After seeing the film, I can say that the influence can be spotted well.The gore level is quite high, gratuitous and realistic. I feel like it's more gory every time I see it. I don't really like explicit violence depicted in films, but that's just necessary in this particular movie because of the story.Speaking of casting, I feel it was perfectly done, and no one seemed in the wrong place. I'm not sure we can call this Leo's best portrayal, but he definitely acted well, together with his antagonist, Tom Hardy. The music wasn't a stroke of genius, but fitted in the film well, and added emotional layers to it.Lastly, The Revenant is a great film, and soon made it to my personal top 10. But this is a film for those movie-watchers that look at movies as a form of art, not just some mean of entertainment. It's quite slow, definitely not action packed, but also very intense.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Too long for the story,"Just seen it. I give it a six because of the cinematography, sound, and acting. Otherwise, this is a 5 minute story that lasted 2 and 1/2 hours or so. Pretty disappointed. I went to see an entertaining movie, not hear snow melting, insects in the background and streams running.There is a sub-backstory that never really develops and you can't make any connections to the main story when it's over.Originally I thought the bear scene was worth the price of admission. After the next hour or so of minimal dialogue and constant scenery, I re- thought about it. The bear scene is worth the price of a rental!I like realism, but found myself wanting them to ""get on with it already""! The main character's struggles lasted ENTIRELY too long. This movie could have EASILY been about 90 minutes and just as good.WAIT to rent this. DO NOT go spend $10+ for the ticket and then $20 for treats.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Can't put my finger on it...,"When i left this movie I had trouble putting my finger on exactly what I thought about it, but the one conclusive statement was 'Meh'; although annoyingly i couldn't really capture why. It has most of the ingredients I usually dig in a movie. The acting is good. The characters have depth. The story is good. The intro scene with the pelt hunting was awesome directing. The main character is a total bad-ass! Everyone is believable, although it took a little while to get used to Tom Hardy's characters voice, which at first it was hard to understand. It overwhelmingly felt like a Terrance Malik movie (which for the most part I dig). It was brooding and nature was as much of a main character in the film as the actors were portraying. I guess my main gripe was that it was too long. Not the movie as such, but most of the scenes or shots. They just felt like they took too long. Lingering shots of sky, or trees or water, or actors but just a few seconds too long than I think they needed to be to make me feel differently. When done consistently throughout a 2.5 hour film, i think it threw off the pacing in a weird way. It's worth watching definitely. It's pretty and dirty at the same time. You feel the cold and dis-comfort the characters are feeling. DiCaprio is good. Hardy is great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Equally beautiful and ugly,"I am extremely surprised with the tepid reactions by so many on this sub. I absolutely loved this film, and I was expecting to react as many here have instead. Maybe this is because I love Lubezki and Malick and find this to almost be a Bizarro-Malickean film (I might make a post to expand on that later).A lot can be said about the stunning cinematography, great performances, and moving score, but while those elements helped immerse me in the film and made it an entertaining two and a half hours (that felt more like just two to me), the film's themes are what really struck me. I've only been home for thirty minutes since seeing it this afternoon so bear with me.There are the obvious themes about survival and revenge, but I also think the film explores other ideas through these main themes -- namely cooperation, selflessness, tribalism, destructive selfishness/greed in man (and its relation to tribalism/racism/etc), and others that I need to put a finger on still.I think there's a reason that there are there are different nationalities and tribes present in the story (US, French, Pawnee, Arikara, Sioux in dialogue). I think there's a reason that neither are truly friendly to the other, with the Sioux killing Pawnees and the Americans not showing much compassion to the French (and vice versa and intermixed and so on). I think it was similarly purposeful that Glass has a half-Pawnee son, that he is assisted by the lone Pawnee man, that his rescuing of Powaqa ensures he does not suffer the same fate as Fitzgerald, and that the young boy (Bridge?) also survives to the end of the film. Imagery that I think also highlights these themes include the scene where the lone buffalo is abandoned by the group (similar to Glass) to be killed by a pack of wolves, Bridge feeding the lone surviving Native American woman, the scenes with Glass and the Pawnee man, and even the bear and her cubs relate to survival and a group dynamic.This isn't the most articulate presentation to my impressions of the film, but these are the ideas that are swirling around in my head thirty minutes after seeing it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Can you bear it?,"Puns aside (and I can only guess that you at least heard about the infamous scene I'm referring to), this is a rather gruelling and very violent movie. It really is very visceral and you will see things that are commonly attached to either horror movies or violent action movies. But it is necessary to go all the way to show what characters have to endure and go through at certain points.So the viewer can really feel what is going on. No matter how hard it is to watch that is. And Leonardo Di Caprio did win an Oscar. Finally his fans will say. Though even they admit, it might not be his best movie or rather best performance in a movie. But that's not what counts. What counts is the journey and the fact he did deserve one overall speaking.

Iñárritu Triumphs Again!,"After giving us a Masterpiece & Winning The Academy-Award for Best Director, Picture & Screenplay in Birdman, Alejandro G. Iñárritu returns on celluloid with 'The Revenant'. And the master storyteller triumphs again!Let me inform you: 'The Revenant' is NOT Meant For The Faint-Hearted. This is a brutal, unforgiving, hardcore film about survival & revenge. This a story filled & driven by blood & bruises. But if you are thick-skinned, don't dare to miss this one. This is filmmaking at its most creative & most relentless.'The Revenant' Synopsis: In the 1820s, a frontiersman named Hugh Glass sets out on a path of vengeance against those who left him for dead after a bear mauling.Inspired by the life of frontiersman Hugh Glass, 'The Revenant' is ideally a vendetta fare, that's been shot so gorgeously, you forget you're watching a story thats been depicted on celluloid an endless number of times. Iñárritu creates a World of violence in the wild, where people are butchered, the animals are ferocious than ever. Watching the protagonist struggle after a brutal bear mauling (Which by the way is a Frightening Sequence), is often difficult to watch, as he struggles & how. But at the end, Justice is served & the dramatic climax leaves a superb impact.Mark L. Smith & Iñárritu's Screenplay is unforgiving. Its a survival tale with vendetta as its wallpaper. The wilderness & the violence have no end here & the narrative remains strong, despite its predictable storyline. Iñárritu's Direction is Masterful. He has handled the film with breath-taking ambition. Emmanuel Lubezki's Cinematography makes 'The Revenant' a visual marvel. The Two-Time Back-to-Back Oscar-Winner has captured every frame, with such beauty, you almost feel you're in the story. A Third Oscar? Well, why not!Stephen Mirrione's Editing is sharp, although the film tends to drag a bit & is a bit too long (157-minutes). Some trimming would've only enhanced the impact more. Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto & Bryce Dessner's Score is brilliant. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Action- Sequences are raw & brutal. CGI is perfectly done.Now to the Performances! 'The Revenant' features Two of the Finest Actors of their generation coming together: Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Hardy. And they more than rise up to the occasion. Leo is phenomenal as the struggling protagonist, who must avenge the death of his son & bear any numbers of consequences that come his way. Its a committed performance, that has great layers. Hardy is despicable as the chief villain, delivering a marvelously evil performance, that haunts you. Of the supporting cast, Domhnall Gleeson stands out with an impressive act.On the whole, 'The Revenant' is Visually Dazzling, Fabulously Acted & Impeccably Made. A Must Watch!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Leo has a shot at an Oscar. And the film, too.","""Nature red in tooth and claw"" TennysonThe 19th century's romanticism and growing naturalism inspired Tennyson to describe in these lines the dark side as Darwin would change forever our benign view of man and nature. Director/writer Alejandro Gonzalez Innarritu and writer Mark L. Smith adapt Michael Punke's novel in a naturalistic way that makes the 156 minutes seem as long as it must have taken noted explorer Hugh Glass (Leo DiCaprio) in the 1820's to recover from being buried alive in the wilderness he helped open.After being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his comrade in trapping, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who also murders Glass's son in front of him, Glass drags himself 200 miles! back to civilization to exact revenge. Although it is a survival/revenge story, with the usual formulaic occurrences, DiCaprio and Hardy succeed in making it real, tortured, and visceral in the extreme.I can try to guess how much discomfort DiCaprio went through for this Oscar-worthy performance, which lacks only the variety and nuance of speech that characterizes frequent Oscar winners. What the role demands and delivers is the almost insane will to survive and revenge.A heavy dose of naturalism (not just realism but realism with bedrock of rawness and violence) is best exemplified in the mother bear protecting her cubs by savaging Glass, a tour de force scene. The Pawnee Indians also illustrate the harsh world with one chief briefly cataloguing what the white man has taken from the tribes.Needless to say, the cinematography by Tree of Life's Emmanuel Lubezki is stunning in sharp grey to reflect the winter conditions that contrast with the snow. Rarely does the sun shine, and in figurative terms it shouldn't because this is a grim world where animal pelts are a man's riches, and a life can be lost for a simple miscalculation or an indifference bred of Nature's seeming carelessness for human life.Glass accepts, as all must, Nature's final demand: ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already.""",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Stunning but Boring,"""The Revenant"" is a movie that I thought was just okay. It has a lot going for it, but I found it pretty boring overall. The story follows Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is left for dead after a bear attack and then fights to survive and get revenge.The movie looks amazing. The cinematography is stunning, with beautiful shots of the wilderness. You can tell that a lot of effort went into making the film look as realistic as possible. The scenes with the bear attack are intense and really well done.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a strong performance. You can feel his pain and struggle throughout the movie. He definitely deserved the awards he won for this role. Tom Hardy also does a good job as the main antagonist, making his character both menacing and complex.However, despite these strengths, I found the film to be very boring. The pacing is slow, and there are long stretches where not much happens. The movie is almost three hours long, and it feels like it. There are lots of scenes where DiCaprio is just wandering through the wilderness, which made it hard for me to stay interested.The plot is pretty simple, and while the survival aspect is compelling at first, it starts to drag after a while. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never really did. The focus on the harshness of nature and Glass's suffering became repetitive and, frankly, exhausting to watch.In the end, ""The Revenant"" is a well-made film with great visuals and strong performances, but it didn't hold my attention. If you enjoy slow-paced, visually stunning movies, you might like it more than I did. For me, it was just okay and not something I'd want to watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This new life of frontier men will take courage!,Mr. Hugh was on a frontier expedition to acquire furs. It was clear that that the frontier was going to take large amounts of courage.

He was looking for the gate that is slim in Leeds to a peaceful life . Suddenly he was viciously attacked by A Big brown bear. He understood that only a few frontier find that road to riches and that the path to destruction is definitely larger because so many people are going that route and he had to find a way to survive. You're going to be inspired by Leonardo DiCaprio on the narrow road .In this movie you're going to be encouraged By those who in the face of danger stood strong and find their way through it. In the movie we take hope that the natives do not hunt him down. Obviously Leonardo DiCaprio's character had to review the betrayal and persecution of John Fitzgerald. John Fitzgerald did not help Leonardo DiCaprio to become stronger he did not allow for Leonardo DiCaprio backbone to To obtain optimal and persistent strength. At the end of the movie even John Fitzgerald might be able to write his own Ending and Leonardo DiCaprio was able to withstand all the assaults that came his way and it definitely assaulted his faith and judgment. We know that when he went on that expedition in 1824 he was going to make decisions that would ultimately require commitment to the higher power. This was no ordinary higher power it was a A power that would determine the rest of his life and it won't allow him to live even longer how was he able to carry all the challenges that came his way?

"Extremely Bleak, Exceedingly Brutal & Exceptionally Cold-Blooded","Extremely bleak, exceedingly brutal & exceptionally cold-blooded, The Revenant is that savage beast that charges at you with relentless fury, mauls you from head to toe without mercy, and leaves you utterly bruised, broken & helpless in the freezing cold of a harsh winter. Absolutely uncompromising with its content, unflinchingly raw in its depiction, and pushing its cast & crew to their limit, Alejandro G. Iñárritu's latest is one of the most harrowing films ever made.Inspired by true events & based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Revenant takes place in the 1820s and follows Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who, during the expedition of the uncharted American wilderness, gets viciously attacked by a bear and is left for dead by members of his hunting team. In an effort to survive, Glass endures unimaginable grief & extreme winter conditions in order to bring vengeance upon those who betrayed him & also murdered his son.Co-written & directed by Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu who's distinguished for his ruthless, evocative style of filmmaking, bleak subject matters, and themes relating to death, loss & redemption, The Revenant exhibits all these trademarks and is quite possibly his most distressing film to date for Iñárritu here aims to capture the pain & suffering in the harshest of conditions in the most unforgivable manner possible, and delivers a cinema that's undeniably difficult to endure but also hard to look away from.The script packs in an icy cold revenge dish set against the backdrop of remorseless surroundings in an era marred with conflict, carnage & cruelty. The punishing cold, desolate locations & lack of civilisation brings an authenticity of its own. The whole film is shot using only natural light and with Emmanuel Lubezki behind the camera, each frame is crisply photographed, the cold colour palette is brilliantly utilised, and there are several long takes that make you wonder how those sequences were filmed with such effectiveness.Clocking in at 156 minutes, The Revenant is a long film to sit through but the drama manages to be so absorbing that its lengthy runtime is barely felt. The slow pace allows it to be a more immersive experience, and also helping the ordeal is its arresting cinematography which works in contrast with the unadulterated brutality that's on display here. The background score is mesmerising and emits a sense of warmth but it makes its presence felt only intermittently. However, those flashback scenes don't add much to the story and should've been left out.Coming to the performances, The Revenant features an excellent cast in Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter, and this is one aspect that plays to Iñárritu's strengths as a filmmaker. DiCaprio delivers a powerhouse performance that makes the viewers feel every bit of agony his character undergoes in what is, without a shadow of a doubt, his toughest on-screen work to date as this actor gives his all to play his role from inside out. Hardy is no slouch in his supporting role and plays the antagonist with great restraint, while Gleeson & others do well with what they are given.On an overall scale, The Revenant is another gritty, unrelenting & audacious piece of filmmaking from Alejandro G. Iñárritu that finds the director in sublime form and also happens to be his most direct & accessible film to date. Definitely not for the easily distressed, this thrilling story of survival & retribution is destined to upset many viewers with its graphic nature of storytelling but for those who can manage to stay on board, it will be rewarding on more levels than one. Marking another artistic high for both Iñárritu & Lubezki and catapulted to a greater level by DiCaprio's extraordinary performance, The Revenant is one of the finest films of 2015 and certainly one of the proudest in the careers of its cast & crew. Strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Beauty and brilliance, tedium and toil","The Revenant is in many ways absolutely masterful; to criticise such a stunning piece of film-making almost feels inappropriate. But the film highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of its talented director, and lacks a few key ingredients which could have made this a masterpiece in cinematic history.I doubt I need to comment on the fantastic visuals: the locations are breath-taking, and the landscape shots repeatedly made me sit back and marvel throughout the film. The actions scenes are some of the best-directed I've ever seen - the Native American attack which opens the film has the camera following events down low, on horseback, underwater; it picks up a moment of action and moves onto the next. The effect is to have the viewer feel involved in the scene, as if it were unfolding right before your eyes, and it really drives home the sense of chaos and confusion felt by the characters. The final fight of the film (no spoilers) is one of the best of its kind ever recorded. I'm tired of seeing perfectly choreographed, dirt-free finales. What you get in The Revenant is so tense and visceral that everyone around me in the cinema - many of whom were bored and restless with the film by this point - were suddenly transfixed, gripping the arms of their chairs. The scene combines the tension of the knife-fight towards the end of Saving Private Ryan with uncompromising, unflinching brutality that looks more like a bar fight than a movie duel.Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent; over the last few years he's grown from one of my most disliked to one of my favourite actors. However, I enjoyed Tom Hardy's performance even more. Partly this is because his role in the film allows him to do much more than mostly express physical pain; but what I love about Hardy is that he always makes his characters believable as well as mesmerising to watch. Time and again he steals the show and becomes the actor you can't wait for the camera to pan back to in his recent films; another top-notch performance here. Credit also to Domhnall Gleeson, who impressed me here as he did in Ex Machina and The Force Awakens - a new star, for sure.For the points I've made so far, the film is worth seeing. It's an astounding cinematic experience, especially in an age when over-use of CGI predominates. Unfortunately, the film has its shortcomings too. To say it felt 'bloated' would be unfair, considering the meticulous attention to detail; but undeniably, this movie makes its length felt. The key problem is the lack of an emotional core; the main character's physical suffering and feats of endurance can only sustain our interest for so long without any character development. An attempt to flesh out the character is made with the clumsy inclusion of flashbacks and hallucinations - these segments were tedious, though thankfully short. Ultimately, we never really get to know our protagonist. Now, this need not be too much of a problem - one of my favourite films, Apocalypto, also indulges in minimal character development for its survival story. Apocalypto did two things differently, however: firstly, the pace never slackened; the main character is constantly chased and the action is non-stop. The Revenant stops and starts and pans up to a tree canopy a few too many times. Secondly, Apocalypto had a 'ticking clock' element, lacking here. Apocalypto, then, was full of tension; The Revenant really misses a narrative drive and ended up feeling too long. It's similar to Werner Herzog's Aguirre: lots of stunning landscape shots, lots of great cinematography, lots of admirable on-location work by the actors and crew - but it's patience-testing. The ponderous nature of The Revenant made it disappointing for me that Inarritu misses a couple of great opportunities to ratchet up the tension: the opening attack could have had a tense prelude before the action kicks off, and there's a scene where the main character is discovered by Native Americans and has to flee, which doesn't take its time and create some fear.It's difficult to create a strong narrative core to a film that's essentially about the survival feats of one man, granted. But the stop-start pace doesn't work well with the lack of character depth or development, and leaves the audience questioning why they're watching the gruesome spectacles on-screen; as we sit through another long scene and reflect - there's certainly enough time to stop 'experiencing' the film and start reflecting as a movie-goer - we wonder what all the spectacle is in service of. And the answer is, well, a very shallow story. Not that I think Inarritu aimed for a particularly deep story - but his visual masterpiece struggles to fully hold the viewer's attention. There is one opportunity for moral complication which is declined (very non-specific to avoid spoilers): one of the men who leaves the protagonist for dead doesn't simply leave him because thinks he's going to die anyway and is worried about his own survival - he also does *something else* which gives the main character reason to hate him and want revenge. The *something else* is a non-historical detail and could have been omitted - wouldn't it be more interesting if, rather than a straightforward revenge plot, we have to question our protagonist's right to seek revenge? If we the audience had to question whether we would leave the man to die - if the protagonist himself had to question this?If you're an impatient person, don't watch this film. To most people, however, I'd recommend a watch. Go book yourself a good seat at a cinema with a big screen and marvel at the visuals, the acting, and the action.There's certainly enough that's great about this film to make me excited to see what Inarritu does next.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A Triumph in Movie Making,"First of all, the cinematography in The Revenant is one of the most amazing I've ever seen. In combination with beautiful nature, it forms something magical. It's important to point out that Emmanuel Lubezki shot only with natural light (one fire scene being an exception), adding more value to the film and making it look realistic, even though it was much more restricting. Shooting with wide lenses makes us feel like we are a part of the character. Camera movement is slow, going from extreme close-ups to perfectly composed wide shots, and then back to a close-up. I was especially fond of so many details, such as fogging of camera lens when a bear's snout came too close.Secondly, after cinematography, acting is the strongest part of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy bring something special with their performances, and in my opinion, both of them deserved an Academy Award, while only DiCaprio has received one. As he said himself, it was by far the most demanding shoot he has ever done. After seeing this movie, you see why. I can imagine (or rather I can't) how excruciating it must have been, from filming in such remote locations, in dark with freezing cold temperatures and scenes in bone-chilling rivers to all the body make-up design and raw meat eating.Thirdly, it was the music. The main theme song reminds me a bit of All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) in style, but with a major difference: it isn't overused. Sakamoto's musical score creates great depth and a lot of emotions. His recent death saddens me, but with his life's work, I know he will forever be remembered.All in all, Alejandro González Iñárritu puts all aspects together, forming a unique movie, and every single person who contributed to it's making can be proud.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Pain and Glory,"The Revenant is based on true incidents. It is a rough hewn and visceral film of survival and revenge.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass a member of a fur trapping expedition escaping native Indians and who is viciously attacked by a grizzly bear. Gravely injured, a small party is left behind to care for him which includes his half Indian son and callous John Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy who dislikes Glass and especially his son.After some time Fitzgerald leaves Glass for dead and kills his son and goes off to rejoin the main party. Glass does not die and wants vengeance.The film was shot in natural light and has wonderful cinematography, the CGI bear attack was very well done. Director Alejandro Iñárritu is on a high after his best Director Oscar win for Birdman last year.However looking at this, I just felt it was a well made, sturdy but overwrought and lengthy revenge flick. In fact with a heavily male cast I regarded this film as a box office risk, one of the only major female characters that it does have is seen to be getting raped.This is a gruelling picture of survival in harsh conditions but strangely empty despite the pained performances from DiCaprio and Hardy.I actually found when Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) set out to apprehend Fitzgerald at the end rather laughable as it was so incompetently done. Not only was Fitzgerald allowed to escape from the fort as he was not guarded, nor was the money which was also stolen by him but he does not take a garrison with him when searching for Fitzgerald. It was a rather blunt attempt by the script to have a final fact to face showdown by the two protagonists.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Intense, beautiful, gripping","The Revenant has a gripping story, gorgeous cinematography, fascinating depictions of time and place, and a spiritual dimension I appreciated and associate with the director. What I liked most:* the story arc -- lots of involving and suspenseful scenes within a larger story that is part survival drama part revenge tale.* the ""grit and grim"" -- did you ever see a movie about someone in a harsh time and place, and find yourself working to overlook an actor's coiffed hair or capped teeth? Or a cottage room, for example, that just seems a bit too picturesque? This ain't a problem here. The harshness of this world, which includes lots of grizzled men surviving in the freezing wilderness, is unrelenting.* the spiritual dimension -- nature is ""red in tooth and claw"" but Inarritu gives time to its majesty too. That is to say, the God in this movie is pretty fearsome but is also there in the wind and trees and mountain vistas. (Note the film's main bad guy at one point quotes his father describing God as a squirrel he shot and ate. Maybe the ultimate sin is not recognizing the beauty and awesomeness of the world as it was given to us?) The humans in the movie do all sorts of terrible things to each other and to animals, but the fur trapper Glass (Decaprio) also embodies extraordinary human strength in the face of adversity. His strength comes from his loved ones -- namely the whisperings in the wind of his wife, her spirit and her philosophies, as well as his love for his son. There is a beautiful scene in which Glass dreams of his beloved son, hugs him within the ruins of a missionary church, some of its frescoes still intact. In keeping with the balance of beauty/goodness and ugliness/violence/death, the frescoes depict Spanish colonial soldiers torturing indigenous peoples.* the ""equal time"": I'm old and grew up watching traditional cowboy and Indian movies. So I appreciate this film's care in creating complex characters and motivations on all sides, even the ""Rees"" (Arikara tribe)] when they attack Glass and his fellow trappers at the beginning of the movie.Those were my favorite elements but there is lots more to appreciate, especially the fine acting. If you can handle very intense movies, by all means see this one. And if you haven't, I also recommend Biutiful by Inarritu.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
terrific passion for survival,"I am extremely happy I saw the 2hr36minute movie The Revenant. excellent Direction once again by Alejandro González Inarritu (loved Birdman , Babel )and superb acting by Leonardo DiCaprio (awesome in every movie :wolf of WS, Departed, Shutter island, Revolutionary Road to name a few) as Hugh Glass. Hugh Glass fights for surviving the bitter cold after he is left behind by his team in 1820s.He survives the bitter cold and seeks shelter and warmth inside body of a dead horse after he removes all organs. I love the scenes where Hugh crawls into dead horse empty on the inside. I enjoyed when Hugh makes friends with the native American and enjoys sticking out his tongue and making happy sounds. The scenes when Hugh sees his young son dragged and killed are done very well. When one loves life and has a strong desire to live, one can withstand whatever comes in the way and Hugh Glass proves this in the movie. Terrific. Superb movie. Excellent acting by Leonardo DiCaprio. Superb Cinematography. Superb Direction. Oscar worthy in many categories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Disappointed - Not credible, needs editing, visually beautiful.","The sheer volume of promotion should have rung warning bells for when a work has quality word of mouth will promote it better than expensive advertising.Since the entire film is shot on location without artificial lighting and was clearly an endurance test in many ways there is no excuse for not making it credible. In short no human I know of could survive what di Caprio's character, Hugo Glass, lives through.The film is far too long at some 153 min. and urgently needs editing.In this setting - the wide open spaces of Canada - more silence would have been appropriate but at times I felt the volume of the theme music was just over-done. We don't need to be told how to feel for it's a visual medium so let us get atmosphere first from the visuals.The faces of the indigenous actors were wonderful and lent a note of authenticity and really the performances overall were very good. It was the survival of the central character which lacked credibility, not the acting (people die from hypothermia quite quickly when exposed to the elements yet our profoundly wounded and infected hero just keeps going!). Also the two 'wild' scenes made for exciting viewing (not specific as don't wish to spoil).The plot is fine. It's not a new story, the appropriation of assets from native peoples,along with greed and revenge and that plot was well established.Overall and in one word, disappointed.

Interesting tale of survival and revenge,"Interesting tale of survival and revenge.Set in America in the 1820s, a frontiersman, Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), is attacked and badly mauled by a bear. He is left for dead by his comrades. Meanwhile a group of Indians are after him. Thus starts his fight for survival and revenge...Loosely based on a true story, this is part drama movie, part action movie. Written and directed by Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu, who usually directs emotional human dramas which veer from interesting and profound (Ammores Perros, Birdman, Babel) to dull and pretentious (21 Grams, Biutiful), this is a bit of a departure for him. The dramatic touches - dream sequences, symbolism - are still there but the action side is new.And therein lies some of the problems with the movie. The drama, catering for his existing followers, seems, at times, overwrought and padded. Some of the dream sequences and flashbacks weren't entirely necessary.Then we have the action, there to cater for the short attention spans of Generations Y and Z. Some of it is good, and contributes to the movie, but some of it feels very clumsy and just action for the sake of it.This all said, the plot is interesting and engaging. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a good performance in the lead role. Tom Hardy is solid as the villain (though I would have preferred if he didn't try to make his voice so unintelligible).Superb scenery and cinematography.It does drag towards the end though, as Inarritu adds sub-plots and scenes that don't really add much. He slows the pacing down too. The final scene is inevitable and largely predictable.Overall: a good movie, but not a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Bleak, beautiful and brutal visual poetry","The Revenant tells the story of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who is mauled by a bear and then left for dead by his hunting team. Following this, Glass goes on a harrowing journey through the wilderness to find and take revenge upon the man who left him to die. The Revenant is not so much a film as a simulator. As Leonardo DiCaprio lives in the wild, we live in the wild alongside him. We remain fully engaged in his story and thanks to the stunning direction, every scene in involving and we are there with the characters ever step of the way. Want to know what it's like to live in the Alaskan wilderness? Look no further. As for DiCaprio, he needs that Oscar now. He doesn't say much throughout the film, yet he remains an emotionally devastating, engaging and fully believable force of nature through the entire movie, and as a physical performance it's truly astonishing. The Revenant is not an easy watch. It's brutal, hard hitting and unbearably intense. To add to that it's also a pretty sad movie as well. You may not enjoy it, but most will be moved by it.It's not as good as Birdman, Alejandro González Iñárritu's last movie, since it's too long and at times is just a bit too much. It's not necessarily a film I'd be up for seeing again, but it's a monumental achievement. The lack of plot is effective and allows the film to focus on the hugely gut wrenching survival stuff while the themes of the movie are subtle, but they're definitely there. This is deep in some ways, but thankfully without shoving it down our throats. DiCaprio is backed by several other fine performances, but even with DiCaprio's amazing acting an argument could be made that Iñárritu is the star of the show alongside cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. With some of the most amazing cinematography of recent years, and some of the most consistently involving, mind numbingly intense direction of the year, The Revenant is a visual marvel. Overall, it's a really, really good film with many incredible moments. It's bleak, breath-taking, powerful, ferocious and harrowing. And that's just the bear attack scene.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Beautiful Scenery, Ugly People","Leonardo DiCaprio won a Golden Globe for his performance as Hugh Glass in The Revenant, and the movie is nominated for a dozen Oscars. If these awards were for fortitude alone, the accolades would be well-deserved, as cast and crew have spoken at length about the physical hardships they faced in filming this movie. ""The elements sort of took over,"" DiCaprio told Wired interviewer Robert Capps. One must wonder, why did they undertake such a difficult and potentially perilous project? Perhaps they did it because younger audiences today haven't grown up knowing about the privations and violence inherent in the settlement of the West—there was life before Disneyland—and need to have the blood and guts smacked in their face. In which case, the movie is a success. It's based in part on Michael Punke's novel The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge, set in 1820s Montana and South Dakota along the Upper Missouri River. If they want to give cinematography awards to Emmanuel Lubezki for this film, I will be standing in the front row cheering. It is a beautiful film—with breathtaking views of the western United States (and Canada, Mexico, and Argentina)—shot with a deep depth of field worthy of a Sierra Club coffee table book. Snow-melt rivers, star-spangled nights, forests that pull you into the sky. It's just that we're shown unspeakable violence, then astounding beauty, then unspeakable violence, then astounding beauty, then unsp. . . .you get the rhythm. In fact the violence was always so gruesome that it became (I hate to say this, since human and animal lives were purportedly involved) borrring. The beauty that followed it began to feel like heavy-handed ironic commentary, losing any capacity to soothe. The sound design and music are emotionally apt and compelling, I thought (score by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who wrote the script with Mark L. Smith, did not conceive of Hugh Glass as anything more than a character bent on revenge. Glass pursues this hollow quest for pretty much two hours and thirty-six minutes. What I like to see in a character is some growth, some change, some ""ok, this is awful, but I can rise above it"" (or not). But while DiCaprio may well be capable of a meatier performance, the film doesn't ask it of him. We learn nothing by watching it except that having an angry mama-bear drooling over you is really disgusting, but wait a sec, now she's going to fling you around like a rag doll again. And drool some more. For good reason, we don't like the Frenchies, or the single-minded Indians, or the dim Americans. Everywhere they appear, Lubezki's beautiful landscape is soon tainted by blood, usually human. Please. A little nuance. But, as Manohla Dargis says in a New York Times review, Iñárritu ""isn't given to subtlety."" The word revenant means ""ghost,"" and it was clear why the ghosts of Glass's murdered wife and son keep reappearing and where they will lead him. And I won't even mention the many, many instances in which the viewer Sees What's Coming a Mile Away.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Ultimately a massive case of style over substance,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the late part of the 19th century, explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio-no laughing at that name!) is on an expedition for the fur trade in the wilderness when he is savagely attacked by a bear. Whilst the other members of his expedition team are stoic and try to rescue him, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) decides they should cut their losses and kill him, which he attempts to do when no one is looking, as well as killing his adopted Native American son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck.) After surviving his ordeal, Glass is thrust on a desperate quest for survival-with revenge on his mind.Director Alejandro G. Inarritu is certainly a hot property at the moment, most notably for 2014's Birdman (Or, the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.) As befits someone making a name for themselves, he appears to be someone prepared to break away from convention, taking a relatively simple premise and applying a post modern, surrealist touch to it. But whereas Birdman went engagingly off kilter with its material, this appears to be an exercise in self exploration and reflection...without very much at the surface.In the lead role, and to a large extent the only role, in the film, DiCaprio must carry a sense of isolation and foreboding, in a stranded role similar to that of Sandra Bullock in Gravity or, much further back, Tom Hanks in Cast Away. The problem here is, rather than exploring his individual angst and inner turmoil as he finds the resilience to cope with his ordeal, there's just too much grunting and crawling around, and when you can't relate to one guy for the long time you're with him, there's problems.For those with a keen interest in visual landscapes, Inarritu has undoubtedly captured some truly beautiful, majestic cinematography that will sweep your eyes onto the screen, even if the story and pacing don't. He's matched this with a dark, moody soundtrack that is as haunting as the screen. The trouble is, the story just seems to be non existent and for a film weighing in at roughly two and a half hours, that's a big problem.It's all a big case of style over substance, a big, ultimately pretentious piece that badly misfires. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Outstanding,"Webster defines revenant as someone who comes back after death. (So reincarnation is real?) In 1823, frontiersman Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is left for dead after a vicious attack by a bear that was only protecting her cubs. Glass somehow survives and must find John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who killed his son and who abandoned him.I had reservations about watching this movie as I knew I will follow Hugh Glass, who will endure much pain for a very long time. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Yes, Leo DiCaprio was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. However, if truth be known, Leo DiCaprio should have won that award for Blood Diamond, or The Great Gatsby and possibly many more. He is that good. When a performer raises the talent level of all those around him, and does that often, he or she deserves the Oscar. Think about that, Academy. This cast performed beyond all expectations. And let's give some kudos to Director Alejandro G. Inarritu who put all this together and won the award for Best Director. Kudos.Most of the movie is Glass' determination to survive the elements, Indians, and his own weakened health. One wonders how some of those scenes were done as they are simply breathtaking. Watch a horse and rider (Glass) go over a cliff into a tree. Wow! Glass swimming against a strong current. Hey, and let's not forget about the cameramen and the work they did. Outstanding.Aside from all the survival tactics employed by Glass to survive, the plot is a simple one: Get healthy and find and kill Fitzgerald.Subtitles were used generously mostly in the beginning and let's face it: they were not necessary. Also the Fitzgerald character (Hardy) was practically the only one to use F-bombs a lot when he didn't agree with the decision, by Glass, to abandon the river boat, hide the furs and walk back to the fort.As I watched, I had the feeling that that here was DiCaprio winning the Best Actor Award. And it was sometimes hard to actually realize that Hugh Glass was a real person who lived through all this, and it was probably much worse than depicted as we saw on the screen by DiCaprio.So when all was said and done and Oscars were awarded for Best Director, Best Actor, best Supporting Actor (Hardy), something was missing: The film did not get the award for Best Picture.

"""The Revenant"" has greatness within it, but is not a great film as a whole.","Sometimes two movies come out at the same time and share a lot of elements even though they're completely unrelated. For example, the parallels between two films which both came out in limited release on December 25, 2015 (even though one went into wide release before the other) are striking. I'm referring to ""The Hateful Eight"" and ""The Revenant"" (R, 2:36).Both movies take place in the 19th century American west, are set completely in the wilderness and include a lot of snow. In both films, men die by shootings and stabbings, women are abused and even killed, someone takes a drink and ends up spitting out blood, at one point, there's a naked man wandering in the cold and, later on, someone is hanged. Each movie even contains a brief scene in which someone catches snowflakes with the tongue. I could go on, but suffice it to say there's an unusual number of similarities between these two films, considering how different they are. While ""The Hateful Eight"" is a completely fictional tale with multi-layered characters, an interesting story and even some light-hearted moments, ""The Revenant"" is an even simpler story, which is mainly about one man, and is dead serious – and even semi-fictional.""The Revenant"" is the film adaptation of Michael Punke's 2002 novel of the same name, which is inspired by a true story. The book takes some liberties with the truth. The film takes even more. The truth in the story is that, in 1823, fur trapper Hugh Glass was attacked by a grizzly bear and left for dead by his companions, but, having been abandoned, he still managed to limp, shuffle and crawl over 200 miles to Fort Kiowa in present-day South Dakota.This is another one of those movies (like ""In the Heart of the Sea"") which, rather than just telling a fictional story with fictional characters, takes an incredible true story and uses the names of real people, but also inserts main characters which weren't part of the actual story, changes the motivations and fates of the real people and tells a story of half-truths. Well beyond taking dramatic license, films like this often leave many people with a perpetual misperception of historical events that will never be corrected. (I'm saying all this now, because doing so during my plot summary would result in spoilers.) Leonardo DiCaprio plays Glass, an experienced hunter and guide who once lived with the Pawnee Indians, married a Pawnee woman and, in the movie, has a teenage Pawnee son (Forrest Goodluck) with him on this particular expedition. When the men come under a sudden and brutal attack by a group of Arikara Indians (Rees, for short), they run for their boats, carrying as many bundles of their beaver pelts as they can get away with. Having lost over 30 men in the attack, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), the leader of the quasi-military hunting party, rallies his remaining men and orders them to start heading back to their trading post at Fort Kiowa.With the journey barely underway, Glass is attacked by a large brown bear protecting her cubs. He is mauled so badly that the men in his party hold out no hope for his survival. It becomes impossible for them to carry him over the increasingly rough terrain, so Henry leaves Glass in the care of his son, Hawk, the young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter), and experienced trapper John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). ""When"" Glass dies, they are to bury him properly and then catch up with the group. Fitzgerald, unfortunately, is a man who only cares about protecting his own hide and selling as many beaver hides as he can. He soon takes actions which prevent the two young men from staying and looking after Glass.The rest of the movie remains focused primarily on DiCaprio's character, but tells three stories simultaneously. Glass basically wills himself to survive and improve enough to try to get himself to Fort Kiowa. Still badly injured, he literally drags himself toward his destination, doing his best to survive in spite of his wounds, the rough terrain, the worsening weather conditions and lack of food. He also has to make sure that he steers clear of the Rees. They continue to be a presence throughout the film, as their chief (Anthony Starlight) leads his men in search of his missing daughter (Melaw Nakehk'o), whom he believes was taken by white men in the area. Meanwhile, the men who left Glass behind are making their way back to their trading post, unaware that Glass is still alive – and is coming for his revenge.""The Revenant"" is a great achievement in some ways, but not a great film. The main reason to see this movie is the acting, especially DiCaprio's performance. Leo completely immerses himself in his character's suffering and deserves an Oscar for everything he went through to deliver such a powerful performance. The problem with the movie is that it's almost all about the central character's physical and emotional pain, making for one depressing movie. The scenes of the bear attack and one harrowing escape from the Rees are both remarkable, but dragging out this character's suffering for as long as co-writer and director Alejandro González Iñárritu does, makes for an unnecessarily long movie. However, the movie's eventful final thirty minutes did help justify the time I had invested. Seeing this film is an endurance test – physically, emotionally and intellectually (for those of us who know how the story really unfolded) – but seeing Leo portray his character's endurance so effectively is just this side of being worth it.

""" No I'm Afraid to Die, I Already Did """,""" The Revenant "" direct to the Academy Awards.Why is there betrayal? Has always existed the revenge? What is survival? Does God exist? These are some of the millions of unknowns that the director Alejandro G. Iñárritu allows us to experience with his cinematic gem. ""The Revenant"" a visceral but artfully delicate piece that surpasses his previous project (Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) and marks a new era in the survival movies.Based on the 2002 novel by Michael Punke, chronicles the life of a man of the 19th century that after a couple of misfortunes must survive and seek revenge in a risky and hostile, territory, discovering that the more dangerous is not abroad, the more dangerous is where can reach.It is a survival story, It's an ancient epic, It's a drama, It's a western, It's a teaching and explanation of the spirituality of a human being, It's all. Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu manage to create perfect DNA between a frozen forest and a frosted heart questioning the human potential to its maximum splendor.Although a little invisible, the spiritual concept of God is often present in the development of the main characters (forgetting the Indians red skin) around the film, hidden in some scenes but in others this fully explicit (the analogy of Hardy between God and the squirrel). Literally this movie is ""in the hands of the creator"", any being that breath has reflected on their forehead the concept of a God, for Glass his son and his wife, for Fitzgerald a profitable future, for an Indian the loss of his daughter, In general are based on the physical, making stress upon the strong Glass wounds, creating a very temporary container to enter the presence of God. A measure that advances added more and more injuries in the metaphysics of the protagonist, but this only creates more strength in his head.DiCaprio is the touch of any movie, it has been part of Quentin Tarantino in ""Django Unchained"", it has given it hand to Martin Scorsese in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" but not even ""Django"" or ""Wall Street"" or ""Titanic"" Leonardo has made a physical, mental, psychological and spiritual performance so overwhelming and complicated as did with Alejandro. Walk dragged all the time, eat unimaginable things, murder, fight, pretend, and burn in locations devastated, have few hours of shooting, enduring cold, and experience work more complex (in all senses) of his career.DiCaprio is a master, even when doing something as simple as a bath naked, rimmed his physical scars and emotional in below-zero temperatures. Will be this the Leonardo year? Hardy has not lost his talent, especially coming from the infernal desert ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and the double performance of the gangsters in ""Legend"". He is alive, again. Hardy takes part to give a bit of testosterone and to demonstrate the customs of the (mostly male) Indians where kill, eat, shoot, hunt and rape was the only thing that could make a few heads, but that well was the 19th century.Inarritu assassinated our minds, ears, eyes and hearts with a close- up images uncomfortable and bloody but both tense and exciting Open our auditory canals with a battle with arrows, shooting and adrenalin and close our eye focuses with blood, cold and fight. Number of elements are used in the film, forming the perfect union of the director and the crew a product with 12 nominations in the Academy Awards.""Birdman"" most striking point was the apparent recording in only one take, now, the point most visually striking was the Emmanuel Lubezki stunning decision in record fully with natural light for once again generating something new in the Hollywood world.Auditory and visual accompaniments are perfectly incorporated, resonating strings and the ashes of a campfire is a clear example of the excellent work done by Ryuichi Sakamoto , Alva Noto, and others, having some results quite compelling. It is interesting that if we think, usually all the films nominated for a statuette from the Academy have such cohesion.DiCaprio, Hardy, Inarritu and the team effort is analogically in the shedding of blood in the Glass front. Alejandro is breaking schemes, limits and stereotypes of Hollywood. It is all proud to see that a Latin American triumph in the most top of the podium. It makes me dream, the show me that it is possible.

A very long journey,"This is a story of a trapper in the 1800's who is double crossed, left for dead and has to find his way out of the rugged wilderness.The film opens with a great action scene. All the action in the film is top notch, edge of the seat.The scenery is stunningly beautiful and the characters are quickly fleshed out.I didn't really feel the harshness of the environment, people wander out of freezing streams with hardly a shiver and force march for miles like they are strolling around the park.Leonardo gives a great performance and I did really care about the character and I was rooting for him. However, he take a massive amount of physical punishment. This goes on to such an extent that I became desensitised to the character's pain by about half way through and really stopped caring when he was winged for the the umpteenth time.A good adventure film, a bit low on action for such a long film. Not really my cup of tea.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Stunning photography, boring movie","Pretty much everyone has written about visual appeal of the film and how nature is portrayed in raw form. I grant that. But for me movie has to have a story first of all. And this fails miserably. There is hardly any story, no connection with protagonist, excruciatingly slow pace, and absolutely no direction where movie is heading. I mean, I had to force myself to finish this and would not have missed anything had I abandoned it. Utterly forgettable. Pathetically boring.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"It is a bleak film about revenge, survival and the Human Spirit. It is pure Cinema and needs to be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate it.","""The Revenant"" is brilliant. It is a bleak film about revenge, survival and the Human Spirit. It is pure Cinema and needs to be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate it. It is intense, thrilling and a very immersive experience. It fully justifies its length. Give Leo Dicaprio that damn Oscar. He was great and shows once again what a versatile Actor he is. Tom Hardy and Will Poulter deserve major credit as well. Hardy might have been doing anything one of his trademark ""voices"", but he was stellar as a wide eyed, unhinged, and aggressive villain. The much hyped Bear scene was terrifying and brutal. The fight scene at the end has to be the most gory and intense fight scene since ""The Raid 2"". I swear even Tarantino would have said this movie was too brutal at times. This movie made Bear Grylls look like a Poser. Everything was on point in this movie, from the acting to the directing and cinematography. Alejandro Inarritu deserves the Best Director Oscar again. The man's passion shines on screen. If this movie wins Best Picture I won't mind because I can't really fault it. It's definitely a Must See for both Men and Woman. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Crude but beautiful,"""The Revenant"" is an adventure for revenge that is violent and crude but also so beautiful. Iñarritu invites the audience to let themselves be shaken and taken on a journey for survival, in one of the most spectacularly and beautifully filmed movies of recent years, with a breathtaking cinematography and scenery. Leonardo DiCaprio giving us, once again, a great performance and every time I watch his movies, I understand why I am one of his fans since way before ""Titanic"". The jokes about him never getting an Oscar, I think will stop this February. This movie has a really powerful story and although a bit overlong, is nonetheless a stunning achievement, and one of 2015's best movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Masterclass filmmaking,"Visceral... Onslaught on the senses... Nail-biting... Unforgiving... Brutal... Punishing... Riveting... Chest heavingly breathtaking... Spiritually meditative... Hellishly harrowing... Disconcertingly beautiful. Believe the hype. This is master cinema!The Revenant feels like it could easily be reduced to the usual revenge thriller platitude, but Alejandro González Iñárritu just loves his big themes - redemption, loyalty, betrayal, survival, loss and revenge. What Iñárritu does so masterfully well here is that he creates a world so real that this is the only world that matters for 2.5 hours. Then he amplifies these themes till they filled the entire canvas. This is no wrong move. Every one is calibrated to hit the right note.Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is fluid, contrasting against the heaviness of the narrative. It feels like Birdman all over again with all the sublime long takes but IMHO he absolutely ups the ante with his hovering and weaving shots drawing you directly into the action. The opening attack scene reminds me so much of the storming of the beaches of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. It draws you in, making you one of the frontiersmen under siege. There is such a level of realism to the action because Lubezki uses natural lighting in all his shots except for one scene. While my eyes were riveted on the mayhem and madness, I remember feeling a little sad for Roger Deakins' outstanding work in Sicaro. I have a strong feeling it is not going to be his year again.Talking about strong feelings, I think Leonardo DiCaprio is almost a shoo-in for Best Actor. If the Academy loves to give the Oscar to long-suffering and tortured soul characters, then DiCaprio deserves at least 3 awards for The Revenant. OMG... The stuff that happens to him... Getting mauled by a bear, left for dead in a grave, having to eat raw nasties to survive... Give him the award already. Not only did DiCaprio bring his A game, so too did Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hardy. The latter fully deserves his Best Supporting Actor nomination. His enthralling portrayal brought an internal logic to his character and I could understand so vividly how he ticks.As much as the film is about so many things, I also feel it is about nature. This isn't an ode detailing the awe of Mother Nature but about the danger and no-holds-barred take-no- prisoner nature of it. Nature is treated with the deepest respect and it is constantly fraught with danger from every angle. Nature is definitely one of the stars of the film.This is a film that above all else has a certain death rattle rhythm to it and Iñárritu's hold on the proceedings is impeccable. He is the master. To watch misery heaping on misery and pain piling on pain for 2.5 hours do not make for easy viewing but Iñárritu's command is absolute. This is not a movie for all tastes. In fact this is not a movie. It is an event and you are in good hands.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A masterpiece,"'The Revenant' provides me with all I have been looking for during the last year without success: a bunch of feelings, which get my full attention through the movie.The film is based on a true story that leaves you without words. The realism is obvious from the very beginning. Believe me or not, but the natural light makes a difference. Native dialogues fit well in the script. Moreover, the interaction of the characters is fluent during the entire plot.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is majestic (he truly deserves an Oscar this time). He is able to express all the necessary types of feelings using few words. Tom Hardy makes a credible antagonist producing hate on the viewer. Even Will Poulter is good and believable in this movie.In conclusion, when I watch a film, I search for learning and emotions and 'The Revenant' fulfill these requirements. Hence, I strongly recommend you to see this masterpiece, but please go to the cinema; it is worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Great Visuals, Cinematography & Acting but lack in Story","No wonder DiCaprio won oscar for this his acting was top notch in this movie add the visuals, cinematography and direction in this it's totally 10/10 but the only average thing was story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Slow-moving and far too long, but some impressive sections make it worth sticking with","Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team are on a fur trading expedition when Glass finds himself badly injured after being mauled by a bear - this is after a subsequent attack by a bunch of Indians. As a result of his injuries Glass is barely alive and is left in the care of two members of his hunting team John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Bridger (Will Poulter). However, Fitzgerald has no intention of looking after Glass and leaves him for dead (after killing Glass' son in front of him). This prompts Glass to track down Fitzgerald and seek retribution against him.The Revenant is another in a long line of 'big films' that has been hyped as being a brilliant film (its current IMDb rating of 8.1 seems to follow this trend). Whilst it's far from awful, I think it's both inaccurate and misleading to represent it as being a flawless piece of work.In order not to appear to be too negative I'll begin with a few positives; firstly this is a very handsome looking film; the bleak, cold cinematography makes the film look and feel realistic. Some of the special effects are also very good - the bear attack on DiCaprio was one of the highlights of the film and again was so realistic that for a moment you may actually believe that he's fighting against a real bear. The brutality of the picture and its sheer rawness means that it's a film that you rarely want to take your eyes away from and much of DiCaprio's story arc sees him having to survive against the elements with little more than his instincts and knowledge and again it made his journey interesting if nothing else. The performances in this film are also excellent; DiCaprio is an actor who has steadily improved over time and this is easily one of his best performances and likewise Tom Hardy is also excellent and to his credit his American accent isn't bad either.So yes there's a lot to praise this film for, but there are clearly some problems here that need addressing; firstly we come to the pacing and although the first 15 minutes are pretty exciting and well-staged Inarritu seems to take his foot off the gas after the opening battle sequence and fills the first hour up with the huntsman squabbling and dragging DiCaprio around in the snow - OK there is a bit more to it than that, but not much more if I'm being honest. The second problem lies with the running time; at its core this is a revenge thriller and I personally feel that if they're tightly plotted revenge thrillers can be wrapped up in 90 minutes or so - quite why a 150 minute run time has been assigned to a film with a plot as basic as this is a mystery to me? This results in The Revenant being chocked full of lengthy scenes which add very little to the film and ultimately make the film a bit boring at times.One thing Inarritu does seem to get right is the tone of the film; it does have some brutal violence and it does contain some stomach churning scenes, but these things are included at the appropriate moments and many of these scenes do serve a purpose (in other words these scenes are included when the narrative dictates rather than simply to shock or induce nausea).Ultimately The Revenant is worth your time because when it's good its very good, but at 150 minutes it's too long and I personally feel that if it had been more tightly plotted and had the narrative been a bit stronger than it would have been an excellent film rather than merely being a good film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Absolutely beautiful cinematography,"To start off, I thought Inarritu and Lubezki did an incredible job with Birdman in terms of cinematography. I could go back and re watch the film endlessly, being completely mesmerized by the directing and the performance of the cast..I thought there would be no other film that would match this perfect balance of fine acting and directing.I was wrong...The Revenant reached God status, evoking emotions i quite similarly experienced in Birdman.Remarkably detailed and coordinated shots, making Inarritu and Lubezki two of the very best in this industry as of now. These are the films I dream of seeing and we need more of these, as short takes and quick cuts have long become inferior in Hollywood.

Twizard Rating: 100,"The Revenant is truly something to behold. It's beautifully shot and maybe even more impressively directed. This could have easily gone awry in the wrong director's hands, but Alejandro Iñárritu makes it look too easy.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a fur trapper in the American Northwest in 1823. He and his crew are on the run after escaping a Native American ambush. One day, after going off on his own, he is attacked and savagely injured by a grizzly bear in a scene that will stay with you for a very long time. It might be one of the most intense sequences in film history. Nearly dying, he is deemed, by Tom Hardy's character, as too risky to be carried along with them, so Hardy leaves DiCaprio to die.The film is really long, but riveting. Not once does your mind wander to something else. Scene after scene is like nothing you've seen before.This film is about revenge, but it's also about moral decisions. It's never preachy, but those who wish to get something out of it will. It's hard to watch, but completely rewarding in the end. And there may have never been such a dark film that is also this beautiful to look at.Tom Hardy, while audibly incomprehensible at times, plays grimly sadistic to perfection. From the beginning, he walks around like nothing ever bad is going to happen to him. He's cocky, but there's something subtle in his tone that makes you believe that he's unsure of himself subconsciously--even though he thinks no one notices. Perhaps they don't.It's a no brainer that DiCaprio has given the best performance of the year, even if just for his commitment to making his character real. The film is shot in actual freezing temperatures and throughout the entire thing you really do feel his pain--just from the piercing cold itself. He's in a league of his own with this one.But if we're going to talk about commitment, we must also discuss Iñárritu's insistence that there will be no green screen used and everything that happens will be happening for real. Last year, Iñárritu's film Birdman won the Oscar for Best Picture. This is a step even above that. Birdman was filmed in a controlled setting. Watching The Revenant, you feel like everyone on set is playing with fire. The fact that they get a breathtaking film out of it is superbly impressive.Twizard Rating: 100",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the greatest achievements in cinema in my lifetime!,"If this movie is not a perfect 10, then I don't know what is. This movie was nothing short of a masterpiece! When I think of the greatest movies of all time, I think of pictures such as: The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, Shindlers List, The Departed, There will be blood...For example. After seeing this film, I do not see any possible way that this picture is not in the top 10, or even top 5 greatest cinema masterpieces of all time!The Revenant was a true testament to a mans will to survive and the power of revenge. There are so many good things I can say about this movie, but I will keep it short. There is no way that this film should have lost to Spotlight. Spotlight was a very good movie, not taking anything away from it, however, I think giving the Oscar to Spotlight was more of a ""politically correct thing"" to do for the Academy. Yes,, Spotlights subject matter was more close to home for the average person and yes, it is a remarkable story of breaking the lid off of the power of the catholic church, but there is NO WAY that if you want to watch a 2 and a half to 3 hour movie...that you would choose Spotlight over The Revenant.

"Dull, Dark, and Dreary","I am giving this movie a ""5"" because I recognize that some serious movie-making was involved, and I want to recognize it. However, I am also giving this movie a ""5"" because I did not like it.The opening scenes are exciting, but disjointed. Who are these people? Where are they? What are they doing there? Why do the Native Americans care? The bear attack is genuinely exciting and, for me, the highlight of the film. The problems is that there are two hours to go.The film is dark. The sun surely shines under the Wyoming/Montana/Dakota sky, but rarely in this film. A lot of ""squinting"" is necessary.The dream sequences are unnecessary and poorly edited.There is some character development, but not much. Glass is obviously respected, but it isn't clear why. Fitzgerald's character seems to morph by the minute. The other characters simply pass through the scenes. And everyone looks like everyone else! It isn't clear why the Arikaras are so intent on capturing Glass. It isn't clear who, exactly, got back to Fort Kiowa. The intervention of the Pawnee who comes to Glass' aid strikes a positive note, but what does his brief involvement add to the film? And, who exactly were the Voyageurs and what were they doing there? And what did the sexual assault add to the movie? My biggest gripe is also my highest praise: The cinematography is magnificent but, oh so, languid! By the end of this long movie, I was numb. And bored.Leonardo won the Oscar for his portrayal of Glass, but he has been better in a number of other films. But, there is no denying that he got into his role.I bought the BluRay. I will watch it three or four more times, at full volume and with closed captions, to see if I can better understand it and appreciate it. I think, however, that it will take a ""director's cut"" to bring clarity to this film, if that is even possible, and it will take the patience of Job to sit through it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Length, without any new development, it is really uninteresting, I has to recognize all the same the magnificent decorations which my recalled reservists sometimes those of the Lord of Rings!

Watch Dead Man (1995) instead.,"All in all this isn't a bad movie however considering All those hype around this movie, it was very disappointing. I'll start with good parts: Acting department did its job very well. Both, leo and tom hardy performed outstandingly well. I've read some reviews in which criticizing the movie for too much violence and too much blood scenes. In my opinion this scenes are acceptable since the deeper layer of the movie is about human nature and harsh nature itself. Now the bad parts of the movie starts with the main story or the one that is on the surface and is very obvious: a cliché story of a revenge, battle between the absolute bad and absolute good. a man who left to die rises from tomb and gets his revenge. The thing that surprises me is the fact that even the deeper layers of the movie which is about human nature, nature itself and cruelty against first nations is also very cliché and doesn't have anything new to present. The movie is too long and slow. I guess more than 80% of the movie is an empty shot of nature or Leonardo starring at some unknown spot. Now in Dead Man we see that Jim Jarjmosch ( I chose this movie on purpose because it has a lot in common with this movie) focuses on a solid story with accents of irony. However in this movie Alejandro G. Iñárritu choses poetry in motion pictures with accents of a story. I love poetry on motion picture In the mood for love, apocalypse now, or many of Akira kursawa's movies can fit in this category but if you fill 80% of your poem with the same words it will make your audience get bored or fall asleep. At the end of the day, I'm not there to listen to the poem, I'm there to see what does your poem means.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Hollywood meets Native Americans,"Yet another over the top movie with too many graphic effects and no substance. At the end of the movie, I just sat there wondering what the whole point of the movie was, because if I wanted to see raw violence, I would just go on the Ogrish website and watch the be-headings and other atrocities from ISIS.Perhaps it is this continuing pointless display of violence that causes the manifestation of all the violence in this world.For me, the movie went wrong as soon as the bear attack happened. Of course, only in Hollywood would it be possible to create an epic fight between a bear, four to five times the size of the pro/antagonist, yet with the bear still loosing the battle. What gives, though; as long as there is an epic CGI battle with blood splattering all over the screen, then the movie must be good.Truly disappointed in yet another Hollywood garbage movie that is meant to excite the Zombies here in America.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Story so Intense that it would make Bear Gyrlls' Compassionate!,"The Revenant may be marketed as a revenge-thriller, but it's really about Hugh Glass (Leo) vs nature. Nearly the entire movie is about Glass battling Mother Earth and struggling to survive the night. And I gotta say it was both breathtaking and stressful. Day after day seeing him struggle with simple tasks and knowing the insane journey he has in front of him is taxing. The amount of punishment the man goes through is enough to make Bear Grylls compassionate.Some people might try to water this one down and say it is nothing more than a revenge flick. That may be true to some extent, but it is more to the movie than just that. It's a man vs nature and his struggle to survive for one last cause (that cause obviously being revenge). There is also a message about white men vs Indians that can't be ignored. It's something we have seen before, yes, but it doesn't make it any less sorrowful or profound.The middle of the film does get a tad repetitive as we watch Leo struggle for shelter and fight the cold again and again. This would be a major drawback if the movie didn't look this beautiful (fingers crossed for a Best Cinematography Oscar). The location mixed with the camera work seems to make the cold jump off screen. The movie might not have hundreds of characters, large-scale battles, or fantasy-like elements, but this truly is an epic.I can see how a lot of people might be turned off by the movie (a huge chunk of the movie his Glass literally wandering the wilderness day and night), I still stand by my statement that it's one of the year's best and deserves to be seen on the big screen!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Surprisingly Good,"Wasn't going to see this film, and wouldn't have except for that I was in area when it was filmed (during the waterfall scene filming we were on the river just a few hundred yards from where it was being filmed). Very fortuitous happenstance, indeed.Parts of the movie are a little bloody, but not what I'd personally consider to be gratuitous violence. What violence and gore is shown is entirely necessary in building the story. Heads up, though, if that kind of thing bothers you, you may find the film disturbing.Incredibly beautiful cinematography; no slow boring segments; the characters are very engaging.

"The ""Boy"" DiCaprio; Far from Oscar worthy","Any Baldwin brother could have acted his part.DiCaprio's problem is that every time he opens his mouth it screams- ""Young Boy"". He hasn't the physical or more importantly- vocal requirements that would display him as a ""Man"", and that's where films like this just don't work with him. He fits well into movies like ""Catch me if you can"", but he is NO John Wayne or Clint Eastwood... or even Alec Baldwin! and that's not good.For me? Standing up (or laying down) and making impressive looks on your face isn't acting, really. Not the kind that should bring you Oscar. Unless all the others last year were pretty lame.His role was pretty shallow and didn't offer much for him to show off acting talents.The Film? was put together quite well. Very well. I am very picky about reality though, simply walking through a stream and soaking your feet in those conditions would have been a death sentence. There were several other things that made me smirk, but there have been other movies that take liberties with reality.John Fitzgerald acted better than DiCaprio. Either the other movies actors were even more shallow, or he was given this award for some other reason.The movie was good, would I buy it and add it to my collection? No.PS- Open note to Chris Rock... I am a white guy... does this review make me racist?.... you idiot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great Acting and Visuals,"This film seems unlike any revenge film to come before this one. It is incredibly well-shot, it is brutal and intense, well-acted, and it takes place in the early days of America when Native Americans and Caucasians didn't get along so well. Tension between these two very broad groups is what drives the action in the film's opening sequence, and it is a motif throughout the film.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a man who raised a young Native American named Hawk on his own after the boy's parents either abandoned him or died in a battle. Glass fights a bear and miraculously survives to be buried alive by Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who wants to cash in on this ""service"" since he has somewhat of a feud with Glass and does not want to see him live. It is unclear whether Glass is okay with this since he technically ""makes a deal"" with Fitzgerald, but Glass gains the will to fight for survival once he realizes Hawk was killed by Fitzgerald.A huge chunk of the film is devoted to following Glass' journey to return to his community, and this proves to be visually beautiful, but also causes the film to feel slow at points. There are incredible shots of Glass in relation to the land around him, which proves to show scenery and landscapes in a poetic manner. One impressive shot is a tracking shot which moves from an extreme wide shot which focuses on the mountains with Glass as tiny as an ant in the distance and eventually moves to a close-up on the same character. There are many long takes in the film that are executed brilliantly, some during action sequences and some when Glass is simply walking on his journey. However, as the story follows Glass on his journey, some of the scenic shots go on too long and seem monotonous since we understand that Glass has to go a long way, but the film keeps reminding us this with more and more scenic shots that don't move the story along.DiCaprio is at his best here, and will probably receive his fifth Oscar nomination for acting. Whether or not he will actually win the award as fans often complain about, his performance in The Revenant will live on in history. Glass' desperation comes across very convincingly even though DiCaprio does not even need to speak throughout a lot of the movie. That's the real acting - when actors can express emotions and motivation clearly through body language rather than how they handle dialogue.Every action sequence in this movie is incredible. Most are done in just a few long takes which means these sequences needed to be really well-choreographed in order to get the shots right. And these sequences were on location rather than in a studio, so one has to respect the direction and the cinematography that was done with amazing effort outside in cold environments.If there is one thing to take away from The Revenant it is the visuals. It's funny that not many movies are done this way today even though filmmakers know that film is a very visual medium. Innaritu understands this very well as we can see in Birdman as well as in this movie, and hopefully he inspires the next generation of filmmakers to follow in his footsteps.3.5/4.0",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A spiritual journey from nowhere to beyond,"Iñárritu's been a hot commodity lately, and his Birdman was a movie well deserving its fame, a perfect combination of intricate style, witty multi-leveled delivery and free spirit that made it such a unique joy to watch. A year later, the maestro is back with a new story, way gloomier and deeply rooted in symbolism.In a way, The Revenant is the Birdman's dark twin. Both films concentrate on the problems of a person struggling with finding a new path in his life after the old bridges have been burned. This time, however, looking back is only a source of sorrow and grief which can hardly be a guide on your way forward. In fact, there is no way forward for Hugh Glass, just like there is no reason for him to live. And when the last tiny thread tying the hollow present to the beloved past is forcibly torn, Glass' will to live comes back once more - just to drag back to the void those responsible for it.Throughout the film one can't shake off the feeling of illusiveness of everything that happens on screen. This time Iñárritu relies heavily on various visual tricks like filming through a fish-eye lens or a camera that dashes around the scene like a trapped animal. Combined with a dark troubled score, this produces a sense of discomfort that builds a glass (no pun intended) wall between the audience and the characters, not letting us too close to them and preventing an emotional participation in the events of the film. At times, The Revenant feels like a dream you got caught in, unable to wake up, and the only thing you can do is to simply follow the path charted by some grim mastermind.However, the director's brilliant and truly Oscar-worthy intentions are constantly foiled by one thing this film has been praised the most for: Hugh Glass himself. The unnatural vitality of the character portrayed by DiCaprio requires some suspense of disbelief, but is not a problem per se since it's clear that he's drawn forward by something stronger than mere human nature. But Leo himself simply belongs too much to the world of the living to fit this role. He's been too alive through all his career, and this time, working so hard for that Oscar, he, in my opinion, simply failed to show us how it feels to be dead inside and be pushed forward by a greater mission. Unlike Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald, who actually felt like a savage power with no real humanity inside, as if it went away with his scalp.Can't say that The Revenant is a bad movie. On the contrary, it's a fine piece of cinema well-thought and well put together. However, in an attempt to take the place warmed by Dead Man by Jim Jarmusch, it kinda missed and fell into a pit nearby. But the pit is shallow, and Leonardo DiCaprio is so good at crawling, which allows the film to remain entertaining, albeit at the cost of a blurred concept.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Another Inarritu's masterpiece!!,"Harrowing, gripping, brutal, bold, harsh and a visceral depiction of one man's willpower. Murphy's Law kept slipping from one crap to the next, to the next and the protagonist survived somehow every time, I'm not sure about if one should call that luck or the exact opposite? The Revenant is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of the works of writer/director Terrence Malick. Inarritu's masterpiece, a tour de force, if I've ever seen one. From the amazing opening shot, this movie immediately hooks you. The movie is a brutal depiction of man against the wild. a survivalist story that can sometimes be difficult to watch, as some of the scenes can be quite gruesome. the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are spectacular. Effectively it transports us to another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of visual art. You don't just watch ""The Revenant,"" you experience it. The camera movements, the tracking shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done and shown in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with an over 10 minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly captivating and awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to their limits both physically and creatively.PS- It provides an immensely absorbing experience to those who have an affinity for the wilderness. It'll be highly ludicrous of Academy if Leo doesn't get his first Oscar for this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Unbelievably Captivating,"Let me start by saying that I cannot believe someone actually gave this wonderful film one star in his review. That tells me that the reviewer has some sort of grudge for doing this.This movie is what cinema is all about, gripping, captivating and extremely scary in many parts. I believe this work from the wonderful director reinvents the adventure/survival/revenge genre. My jaw was on the floor several times, especially with THAT bear scene. How it was filmed to be so realistic is a mystery to me. Just wait till you see it. In all my life I have never seen anything like this, so for someone to give it a one star review leaves me bewildered and wondering what goes on in some people's minds. This is a magnificent film and I have given it ten stars for the amazing experience I had watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

This is one of those movies,"Awesome in every way. From the breath taking scenes, to the wonderful and masterful use of music/bgm to the amazing story.I'll keep it short and sweet. This movie shines in how much Glass had to struggle and fight for every second. I could really feel that wind/chill and I could really feel the serenity of those quiet moments. Like Gravity, this movie is absolutely an experience. The Story was ... well it was alright. The ending was satisfying. There were moments where I was sad but nothing jerked any tears out of me. It kept me at the edge of my seat for most of the duration, so hats off to that.Its got drama, strife, survival and combat. It was a real trip. So the bottom line is that this movie imo didn't blow me away story-wise but it was one hell of an experience. Hardy and DiCaprio did an amazing job. The other actors played their parts very well too. It really did feel like DiCaprio had to give his all in order to pull it off and he did. I cant imagine anyone giving more.All-in-all, I think its a must see. Or at the very least, it's an experience that you'll be pretty sorry you missed.

"Meticulously crafted, physically draining","First things first: The Revenant looks absolutely gorgeous, no doubt about that! The fact that it is shot entirely on location with natural lighting paid off in spades, as you'd be hard-pressed to find a film as visually striking as this one, that also feels so gritty and brutal at the same time. The action scenes are riveting and masterfully directed, with the camera seamlessly flowing from one shot to the next, often leaving you amazed and wondering how they pulled it off. That being said, there are a few times where CGI had to be used and even though it did not look in any way bad, the fact that the rest of the film looks so incredibly real, made those moments stick out a little more than they otherwise would.However, for all its amazing achievements in cinematography and direction, it is far from perfect. I felt that it would have greatly benefited from a shorter running time, as its excessive use of landscape shots often brought an already slow paced film to a crawl. The story isn't anything special; a pretty straightforward tale of survival and revenge with some spiritual self-discovery thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, character development was minimal and I wasn't as emotionally invested as I thought I should have been.DiCaprio's performance was compelling as usual even though some of the more extreme situations his character manages to survive stretched my suspension of disbelief a few times. Tom Hardy also gave a noteworthy performance and the interactions between the two throughout the film felt appropriately tense.Overall, while it falls short of greatness and requires some patience, it's still worth seeing at least once for the cinematography alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Revenant is a cinematic masterpiece that most likely will be remembered for years to come!,"Alexandre Iñárritu did it again! Birdman was an extraordinary film and Iñárritu followed it up with The Revenant which is a fantastic film! It has breathtaking cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki which is even more impressive when you look at the challenge that Iñárritu decided to tackle: filming it entirely in all natural light. This just added to the realistic nature to the film and made it visually breathtaking.This film is partly based on true events in the 1820s and stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a frontiersman named 'Hugh Glass', who is brutally mauled by a bear leaving him seriously injured and out to get revenge on Tom Hardy's character 'John Fitzgerald' for something that took place just after his encounter with the bear.Leonardo DiCaprio gave an outstanding performance showing his struggles, turmoil, and general survival. His performance was very visual involving very little spoken words and when it was, it was mostly another language than English. This has to be one of the best visual performances I have ever seen from an actor in film, it was incredible seeing this character go through what he went through!Tom Hardy also gave a brilliant performance as this cowardice, backstabbing, liar who does a great job at making you show disdain for the character. Glass and Fitzgerald have a defining scene at one point in the film showing them fighting against each other with quite a lot of brutality to the fight that left me on the edge of my seat with its intense and unsparing nature. I feel that this along with the bear scene are some of the best from 2015.Now speaking of the bear scene, it will go down as one of the best scenes in cinema history. It was incredible how realistic and intense it turned out to be! The CGI on the bear is the best I think I've seen for an animal: making for an extremely believable bear that I was finding hard to believe wasn't real! DiCaprio's performance is also one to be acknowledged for this scene with the pain and desperation of his actions as he struggles to survive. Extraordinary!However, I did have one issue worth noting and that was a choice of words towards the climax of the film, I don't want to give anything away but I feel that was an underwhelming remark within the situation. But overall this film is fantastic and I would definitely recommend watching it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Leo and Snow and Bears, Oh My!","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Keep breathing."" A flashback in the opening sequence has Hugh Glass whispering the phrase as advice to his young son Hawk, the product of Glass and his beloved Pawnee bride. The phrase has a recurring role throughout the film  possibly serving as a courtesy reminder from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu to the moviegoers mesmerized (and nearly traumatized) by the incredible brutality of what is on screen.It's a master class in filmmaking by those at the top of their game. Inarritu is the reigning Oscar winning director for Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), and he has re-teamed with the reigning Oscar winning cinematographer from that movie, Emmanuel Lubezki. Two of the finest actors of their generation, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, strip away any semblance of pampered movie stardom to deliver ultra-realistic performances in a story ""based in part"" on the true to life novel by Michael Punke.An early action sequence is startling in its ferocity as Arikara surround and attack a group of hunters and trappers, and the whoosh of arrows – many of which find their mark – abruptly drag us into a world that we are unfamiliar with and certainly unprepared for. It's early 19th century U.S. frontier, and just about everyone and everything can kill you. Providing just enough time for us to pry our fingers off the armrests, Inarritu stuns us with what is undoubtedly the most fantastic grizzly bear attack on a movie star ever filmed. In what appears to be a single take (which also happens to be the number of breaths I took), Mama Grizzly treats Leonardo the way a young puppy treats its first chew toy. Scratched, chewed, tossed and stomped. This scene is savage and brutal, and sets the stage for the true, yet still unbelievable odyssey of survival by frontiersman Hugh Glass.Tom Hardy excels as the calmly psychotic villain Fitzgerald, though some of his early hillbilly-tinged dialogue is difficult to catch. His hulking presence fits with our imagined look of the frontiersman of the era  tough and unforgiving nearly beyond belief. His bullying of youngster Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter) and power struggles with Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) are at frightening levels of intensity. Fans of Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds will smile as they recognize the name of mountain man Jim Bridger  though that's one of the few smiles offered by this 156 minute gut-wrenching ordeal. It would not be surprising if DiCaprio's mantel sports an Oscar in a few months. He is that superb in a role that has nothing to do with good looks or charm.A tale of survival. A quest for revenge. It's both of those, as well as a reminder that nature can be both beautiful and brutal. Some of the photography is almost poetic, and often reminds of the work of director Terrence Malick. And in the blink of an eye, that moment is shattered by the torrential force of river rapids carrying Glass over the waterfall, or his taking a horseback ride off a steep cliff (one of the most dramatic shots of the film). The journey of Glass is unknown in distance or time in the movie, but there is no question as to the numerous struggles with the elements and the raw physicality required to persevere. If you can avoid diverting your eyes, there are visuals here that will be sincerely appreciated – even as you squirm, cringe and moan throughout.From a technical standpoint, the film was shot on location in Canada and Argentina using only natural lighting, and emphasizing aspects of nature that often are overlooked. The sound of arrows, bears, and even DiCaprio's breathing are profound and crucial to the overall effect, as are the animal skin garments and other costumes. It's impossible to tell where CGI meets reality, but the visceral experience will be quite unique for most viewers  and not soon forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"If this doesn't get Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar win, I don't know what will.","The terms ""immersive"" and ""visceral"" are often loosely used, but THE REVENANT has taken strong ownership of them, and all it takes is director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's sharp and creative directing and maestro cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's distinctive camera style and seamless edits that take us through the landscape, up close and personal. THE REVENANT is one of those films that will be talked about for generations to come, whether it be at a film school among students and experts or at a coffee shop among aficionados who've just seen one of the most incredible films ever.The character Hugh Glass is a legend when it comes to the history of the frontier, these are the times before the things we often associate with wild wild west. Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and co-scribe Mark L. Smith take source from Michael Punke's novel but they put a fictional twist of their own on this actual historical character, played in the film by the great Leonardo DiCaprio. In this film, Hugh Glass has a mixed race son because he was once had native-American wife, Glass and his son join fur-trapping business that got attacked by the natives, one of the people in their expedition is John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy. One day, Glass gets mauled by a bear and left for dead by his team members. Fitzgerald is one of the three staying behind to care for Glass and to give him a proper burial should he passes. But Fitzgerald kills Glass' son and takes off instead, an event which then motivates Glass to survive in his relentless pursuit of revenge.Whether it be interior like ""Birdman"" or outdoors like ""The Revenant,"" Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a director who's committed to taking the audience to fully experience because he understands the wide range and the scale and he also fully understands the stories of these characters and he smartly conveys them to you. Yes, it's a primal existential survival story, yes it's also a revenge and redemption story, yes it's also father and son story, but the way Alejandro films it, the way he tells it, makes THE REVENANT more nuanced than that. And just like how this film manages to transport you to a land and time that's rarely tackled in cinema, it also successfully transports visual spectacle to a new height that's never before seen nor felt. The sequence in which Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass gets mauled by a bear, for example, it's as if you could feel Glass and the bear's breath. This is also why Lubezki is one of the greatest of all-time because his cinematography aims to make you feel like you're present there, you see the angles, the edges of the screen, everything about it is very welcoming, very inclusive.This is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance yet, one of the things that makes him a great actor is that he's clever in his rhythmical movement and facial expressions, he's on point, he knows how to make a scene more emotional or more intense, this is an actor who gives his all for his characters, and you see that dedication once again in THE REVENANT, working in toughest most uncomfortable conditions, he even strips down naked, Leo's devotion to this character, Hugh Glass, is admirable. Tom Hardy also gives an equally outstanding performance as the villain, Fitzgerald, who's only looking out for number one, what matters to Fitzgerald are himself and his ambitions, he doesn't have a problem with kicking integrity or honor to the curb if need be. And so when Hugh Glass ultimately gets in the way, it's kill or be killed mode for Fitzgerald and Hardy, with his sturdy intimidating stature, accomplishes that.THE REVENANT is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of the works of writer/director Terrence Malick, whom Emmanuel Lubezki collaborated with several times including ""The New World.""

A colossal disappointment.,"The Revenant is what happens when a strictly bordering-on- mediocre film gets universal acclaim. It wouldn't be correct to call it a mess because there are some scenes to marvel at, especially the wide angle shots of Calgary's forests and sunlight filtering through clumps of forests on a white canvas. The one take thing which gave Birdman an edge is simply a distraction here as the camera seemingly cannot decide where to stay and , instead, meanders pointlessly here and there as the film does. There are a lot of inspired moments from Kurosawa's climax in Throne of Blood, a lot of Tree of Life inspired juvenile philosophy thrown in for good measure and a ready dose of scenes structured around Birdman. But what absolutely kills the film is the amazingly banal sentimentality which is presented in the form of universality. Innaritu presents us with a lot of images. A lot. They are pretty dazzling to be honest, extremely cinematic, but as light as fluff. And as pointless as DiCaprio eating a raw bison liver to get into the skin of his character, or a horse. or whatever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Mostly a success,"The Revenant -Hot on the heels of the success of his Oscar winning Birdman, Alejandro González Iñárritu turns his hand to the Western with a tale of double cross and revenge. DiCaprio plays fur trapper Glass, who is gravely wounded during an attack by a bear (in a fantastic and utterly convincing sequence) and ultimately abandoned and left for dead by some of his companions. How his lust for vengeance keeps him alive is the crux of the rest of the story. First of all the film looks fantastic, with a real Kubrick/Barry Lyndon feel to some of the visuals. From the snow on distant mountains to the mist winding through the forest its a fantastic looking piece. The score, by Japanese legend Ryuichi Sakamoto with Alva Noto and Bryce Dessner is also great, sparse and haunting. It mirrors the landscape perfectly. The acting by leads Leo DiCaprio, an almost unrecognisable Tom Hardy and Will Poulter is universally great, with DiCaprio in particular giving a completely committed performance as the wronged frontiersman Hugh Glass. If I had to criticise I would say that not everything works, some of the dream/fantasy sequences seem a bit naive and contrived, and it could also have benefited from being maybe 20 minutes shorter. But although the story is pretty slight and one-note I didn't find myself checking the time at all. I actually preferred it to Birdman. Overall its now my second favourite weird and violent snow draped western, losing the top slot to the vastly underrated Ravenous 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I've done it already.""","The Revenant is directed by critically acclaimed and 3-time Academy Award winning director Alejandro G. Iñárritu and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter.Left for dead by members of his hunting team after being mauled by a bear, and betrayed by his confidant John Fitzgerald, Hugh Glass sets off on an incredible path to redemption. Journeying across a vicious landscape and in great turmoil, Glass pushes his body and spirit to breaking-point.With his experience travelling across Europe in his younger years, Iñárritu has acquired a rather large and passionate mindset for visuals and interestingly intricate locations in his filmmaking. With Birdman blowing away movie-goers and critics alike in 2014 with its beautiful camera work and long, steady shots, with superb acting all accompanied by a smart screenplay; Iñárritu had to return with strength. And he has. The Revenant is already gaining major attention from The Academy with 12 Oscar nominations and 3 Golden Globe wins. If that doesn't convince you, take it from me; this is how you make a movie about survival. This is how directors should start shooting action sequences and entire movies all together. Long and smooth shots which never cut unnecessarily, settling you right into the world with no noticeable jogs or jolts that could pull you out. You can see everything that's going on around these characters. I'm sure there are filmmakers that are already taking notes, given the success of both this and Birdman. Not only is this Iñárritu's influence, but cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has the eye for nature, and using what we've been given, to ultimate effect. It's worth noting that everything; every word of dialogue, every scene of violence, every shot of scenery, was shot in natural light. Only once was an exception made, for a campfire scene. Meaning each day of shooting had to be carefully planned ahead of time to make sure that those vital hours of light were used. This is one of many reasons I love Iñárittu's work. Maximum realism, results in an immersive experience.The screenplay is significantly convincing, and although around 40% is spoken in Native American languages, it manages to keep you connected to what's happening on-screen. Iñárittu is one of the writers for this movie, amongst Mark L. Smith and novelist Michael Punke, who wrote the story this movie is loosely based on. I'd like to read the novel and see how this adaption varies from the original story.The acting by all members of the cast were outstanding, but with 2 Academy Award nominations being tied to DiCaprio and Hardy, you'd be wanting to know if they deserve it. My answer; Absolutely. Both are neck and neck with each other throughout the movie, and fall into their characters with extreme intensity. DiCaprio has stated that this was the hardest performance of his entire career. With all the things he had to learn and do to become Hugh Glass I'd say he should definitely take the Oscar. Whether he does or doesn't, will not affect my views. The same for Hardy. Impeccable skill is on show here, by everyone, it would be a shame if it didn't win, but it's already gained huge amounts of attention so that's fine by me.Music by Ryuichi Sakamoto & Carsten Nicolai is fabulously soft and subtle, yet energetic and expeditious when it needs to be. It was used as a part of the overall sound design for the movie, and was added with the natural sounds, not slapped on after, so to speak. This is something I think that filmmakers should also think about doing more often, weaving the music through the visuals without singling out anything until last minute. It really adds to the overall viewing experience, and makes for a pleasant surprise.The visual and special effects were barely noticeable, which isn't a bad thing. They look real, feel real, sound real. The bear scene is brutal. And I mean brutal. If there's one thing I can say about this film, it's that it's brutally violent and gory. Again, not a bad thing. This helps with the realism and nature of this story. There's never a distraction.My verdict; The Revenant is another masterpiece by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and showcases the finest acting, and passion for filmmaking. This is a definite must-see.""My heart bleeds.

A movie without heart. Tom Hardy do it better then Leo Di Caprio.,"Great picture, good direction by Inarritu, and two giants in the lead roles: Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy. But behind a formerly perfection there in no heart in this movie. Beautiful nature, rocky mountain, snow like in The Big Silence, but i can't live one real emotions, neither during the famous bear scene: the bear is incredible real, but so cold, as if Inarritu is more focused in achieving a perfect fight instead of an emotional fight. For this reason i found the movie a little boring due to it's long duration - 2 hours 36 minutes. My favorite scene is the final one (but i don't reveal what happen).

Great!,"So, where to start?The beauty of the shots: basically every scene was stunningly beautiful. The nature had such a raw and rough and wild atmosphere. In contrast to the wide shots of nature there where a lot of close-ups to the characters. You felt like you were standing right in front of them. In the action sequences you were so close to everything that happened: you see the perspective of one character and only his. You don't get an overview what's happening. You're close to some very graphic scenes (contrast: beautiful shot composition - brutal scenes the shots show). A lot of long takes (hello birdman) were used and it helps to stay in one scene (I hate scenes with 15 cuts in 10 seconds). Inarritu also lets the camera stay with the actors. You see their faces when they learn new things, how they react to it.I loved the spare use of music. There was some much tension in a lot of scenes, adding music would have ruined it. But when the (great) music was used it underlined the moments perfectly.The actors were great, Hardy's performance especially.

One of the year's best,"The Revenant is one of the best movies as far as cinematography goes.The natural shots they were able to take are amazing and mesmerizing.The visuals are beyond perfect and that ""Bear scene"" is so great that it's hard to believe how they were able to do it.The movie is gritty and also intense while still being very interesting and gorgeously shot with top notch performances and directing. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best,if not the best performance of the year by a male in a leading role and I truly hope that this time he actually gets to win an Oscar for this.He's so committed to the role and it shows especially in some of the more brutal scenes. Tom Hardy also nails the role perfectly and gives almost an equally great performance as Leo.His voice is weird though but by now we're used to him having different voices on different roles,even though sometimes is hard to understand what he's saying. It does get brutal though and some of the things that the characters have to do to survive are beyond disgusting but reasonable and understandable for the situations they're in. The soundtrack is also very good but it's not what you take away from the movie the most,because the amazing cinematography and the style of the movie,the direction that Alejandro G.Iñárritu goes including here the two amazing performances of the leads are what you take away the most about this amazing cinematic achievement. At 153 minutes it is a bit too long but that doesn't take away from the movie that much because this still remains as one of the best movies of the year with some of the best performances,cinematography,visuals a really good score and memorable scenes that are bound to stick in your mind for a long time after.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An epic adventure that's a struggle a fight for survival that's overcome by spirit and faith.,"""The Revenant"" is without a doubt one film that thrills with drama and action and it's filled with blood and it shows that human life can often be pushed to the extremes. It also blends themes of faith, survival and revenge to fine form. Actually the picture is based on the true life story of Hugh Glass an 1820's fur trapper and his quest for survival. And the cinematographer work is well done as the scenes of nature and wilderness is stunning it seems so real as it almost takes a little from the narrative as it seems the images move this long drawn out adventure film.Anyway Leonardo DiCaprio(in his best performance yet)is Hugh Glass the 19th century hunter who stalks the American west on guard with his rifle. The peace and beauty of the outdoors is shattered quickly in the film as the Glass camp of fur traders are attacked in a blood and gore carnage by Native Americans. This begins a saga a journey mission of search and escape and this all involves Hugh and his son and thru time flashback you find out about the demise of Hugh's wife. And in a fun and compelling and seems like real yet very brutal and blood bath like is the grizzly bear attack fight sequence that leaves Glass to almost die. After this the adventure becomes more about a struggle to survive and a journey that has twist and turns all it really turns into is a revenge hunt that Glass must seek as payback can be hell.Overall ""The Revenant"" is a harsh and tough emotional film that proves life is a struggle as one must fight for life all while dealing with faith, and the spirit of believe as it's supported by loving nature and loving family just as Glass did. And the performance from Leonardo DiCaprio is his best ever he pushed himself to the limit for this role nearly transforming his look and enduring the cold and snow type scenes that he had to shoot in, yet all in all that helped make ""The Revenant"" an emotional drama that shows tough images yet it dazzles.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

I would've liked it more if I got more involved in the story, but the pacing dragged. Leo was really good in it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Deep-rooted, barbarous revenge tale aided by a staunch DiCaprio performance and breathtaking visuals","It was just over a year ago that renowned Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu brought us ""Birdman"", a fantastic and audacious dark comedy that deserved every one of it's 4 Oscars which included Best Picture and Best Director. He's a filmmaker that has built up a reputation for being very nihilistic and bleak in his approach to his work, often leaving viewers feeling rather inhospitable. And whilst ""Birdman"" was a drastic and welcome change to his style, with ""The Revenant"" he has crafted a sprawling, violent and visceral epic that is an experience like no other.The film is set in the 1820's and follows American frontiersman Hugh Glass who is mauled by a Grizzly Bear whilst hunting in the frigid, mountainous landscapes. Left for dead by his fellow hunters and witnessing his son killed by one of them, he embarks on an agonizing journey through treacherous winter conditions as he seeks revenge and justice.The opening sequence sets the tone right from the off, as we're introduced to Glass through a stunning dream sequence in which his wife and son are present. Many familiar with Terrence Malick's work will immediately find semblance in the way a majority of scenes in the film are put forward; dainty close-ups projecting a wide array of human expression and emotions, and appreciation of the beautiful nature that surrounds them. Shot in pure natural light, cinematographer Emmanuel 'Chivo' Lubezki masterfully captures every facet of the awe-inspiring but harsh exterior which almost feels like a character of it's own. In a growing list of sublimely lensed films by Lubezki, this may be his most impressive and personal work to date.DiCaprio has made no secret of the tribulations that he endured making this movie, going as far as to saying that he almost died a couple of times. And watching him as Hugh Glass, it's not hard to understand why it was such a difficult shoot but which I think will ultimately turn out to be very rewarding. He immerses himself fully into the role, whether it be crawling on rough terrain, relaying maximal anguish and pain or trying escape from the glacial waters, it's a role like nothing he has ever taken on before. It's the perfect example of a part that is dependent on the actor being able to transmit their character's identity to the audience in an almost 100% physical manner. DiCaprio embodies Glass with the utmost devotion and this may finally be his ticket to long awaited Oscar glory.The rest of the cast also do very solid work. Tom Hardy's intuitive and fierce charisma jumps off the screen once again as an unhinged and villainous entity. His disheveled appearance also gave him an extra layer of cruelness. And Domhnall Gleeson, who's enjoyed a great year, ends it with another impressive turn as the stout Captain of the hunting troupe.This is not a film for the faint-hearted; it's savage and austere. Yet amongst all of the brutality, one cannot ignore the lyrical visual splendor that is present in every frame. Iñárritu isn't afraid to show his spiritual hand here; in fact he embraces it. It's a story of survival. It's a story of one being able to find peace with themselves. And it's a story of what nature means to our world and how stunning and savage it can be. ""The Revenant"" is a spellbinding piece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Nostalgic visual effects with thrilling moments,"Several things made this movie amazing, the demonstration of human resilience, the stunning visuals and the outstanding cast. Despite the minimal use of Leonardo's verbal acting, his ability to display the character's sheer emotions in every aspect was both invigorating and powerful. With every new challenge came the display of pure will power; understanding survival in the truest sense in a way which really transcended with me and I'm sure with many other viewers of the film. Another aspect of the movie I loved was the beauty within the film - the vibrancy of the locations really added that extra ""punch.""Although it had its captivating scenes whereas I would certainly place one in particular for ""scene of the year"" contention, the movie developed slowly with less human interactions than expected. I would relate it to other adventure movies like 'Wild' or '127 Hours'... as the movie did not wrap around vengeance and fighting like I anticipated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Boring and Pretentious...Banality and Mediocrity in abundance,"I truly hoped to finally enjoy a decent outing at the movies. I haven't seen a decent flick at the cinema in over a year. 2015 was very painful for a fan of the silver screen with such duds as Black Mass, Crimson Peak and Sicario all previewed with that ol' Miramax feel, a brand of underground hits from the 1990's which featured great casts and crew. I also was duped into the Hollywood hype-train flicks like Ant Man, Jurassic World and The Martian... Lord knows I was finally going to get a decent flick here with Leo and Hardy, even though Inarritu's Birdman was pure garbage, IMO. Unfortunately, this ain't happening, not today. Without spoiling anything vital to the story. I will say that you will see an exact copy of the early scene in Saving Private Ryan at the beaches of Normandy, only this time it will feature cowboys (fur traders) vs Indians. You will see Leo saved from brutally cold weather in the belly of a Tauntaun like in The Empire Strikes Back, I'm sorry I meant Luke saved in the belly of a horse!? I will also say that you will see Tom Hardy do a completely outstanding job of emulating the Tom Berenger role in Platoon, however, in this flick he will be rolling around in the snow and the scar will be worn on his scalp, not on his face. Kudos to Hardy cause he really sounded like Sgt. Barnes. Hardy enjoying a smoke off a pipe really sealed the deal for me. I will also say that this script has the same revenge motif used several times before, primarily in Braveheart and Gladiator. The end result is a ton of wasted scenes featuring snowy mountains, snowy trees and snowy rivers, all of which seemed like they were stolen from, or at the very least, inspired by Godfrey Reggio. Needless to say, I could easily see Leo signing on to this Inarritu project after the Birdman hype because, Hey! if he could get Michael Keaton a best actor award... Bottom line, a bunch of pretentious garbage by Hollywood and their new favorite hack director.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, carefully directed movie.","To start with, a movie like this should be viewed multiple times to understand and absorb the little details the director tries to reveal. Every landscape shot, every breath exhaled, every bite taken, is all done in such a way that it flows like poetry.The plot is fairly simple, but it is the journey our hero has to undergo to seek redemption that grabs the viewers attention and demands all of it.The acting is almost perfect. The question is, what does DiCaprio has to do to get an Oscar?The director injects a little bit of mysticism in many scenes that have underlying themes that somehow relate to what the hero is going through.The movie is two and a half hours long but the time flies by because the editing compliments the story.Other aspects also help to make to make this movie great.Go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The most spectacular move of the year (and no FX),"I am not a fan Iñárritu; but I concede I saw all his directed movies since AMORES PERROS. I went to THE REVENAT with doubts; mostly because having seen the original about 40 years ago, still remember it as boring and depressing. However; when I saw this version trailer; the images were so amazing that I felt the urge to see it. Well, I was not disappointed at all.The story is pretty much the same but told in much more bearable way (the original Richard Harris spent 90% of the movie alone). But are the images and effects that stand out; created by using wide angle lenses on close ups and moving the camera on 360 degrees; creating immersive images that easily transmit to other senses. You feel the cold, the water and the suffering.If Iñárritu tried to demostrate that nature is the greatest and most spectacular (and dangerous) thing in this world; he succeed. The digitally created THE FORCE AWAKENS should hide ashamed of what has been achieved with a camera and some lenses.Just the Indians or the Bear attacks; completely compensates the price of the ticket; but there is more from where that came from in this incredible movie.The acting is superb. It required very humble and committed actors to accept these roles.Tom Hardy is terrifying in a character that pure selfishness and not allow a hint of sympathy. Di Caprio in his most physical interpretation until today is outstanding. You are able to feel his pain and suffering.In brief; if you want to see the most spectacular images or the most terrifying fight man vs nature. Just go and see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Unlike Anything I have Ever Seen!,"(No Spoilers Here)Honestly I am astonished at the lower ratings this film is getting, are you kidding me! Right off the bat in the beginning I could tell this film was going to be something special.First off the Direction from Alejandro González Iñárritu, and cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is some of the greatest film work I have ever seen! The way the camera moves throughout the film is unparalleled. The feeling immerses you into the film that uses nature as its main star. Definitely see The Birdman duo getting a 2nd straight Oscar nod this year!As for the acting, yes everyone asking will this film finally get Leo his first Oscar? I can honestly say for now yes! The reason I say for now, is because there is still a few months up to the Oscars and I am sure more films will arise as contenders, but for the time now, I personally haven't seen a performance that betters Leo's Hugh Glass for The Revenant this year. What he offers in this film is shear acting! If there is a better performance for an actor this year, please by all means tell me, because this will be hard to top people!That being said I believe there will be another actor nominated for his performance in this film as well. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, Tom was superb as the frontiersman and in my opinion definitely deserves a nod.The plot is a pretty straight forward revenge story, but never the less the amazing acting, direction, camera work, and natural capture of a extreme cold wasteland will immerse the viewer into a film I think is unlike anything ever seenI give this film a 9/10 and as always enjoy the show!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The wilderness can be a brutally lonely and beautiful place.,"The Revenant is an almost seemingly impossible movie to make. Long stretches of quiet, lonely time in a world that seems so distant from the one that we live in now. But behind the task of bringing the wilderness to life and giving it the screen time it deserves, is a story almost too good to be true. If there is one duo capable of taking on this task it is the director and cinematographer, Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki. They brought this movie to life in ways I wound never have imagined. You really feel like Hugh Glass is right there next to you. When he gets injured you feel it, when he succeeds its like you do too. On top of an already beautiful looking movie from top to bottom,the cast is also at top notch. Leo turns in a terrific performance as Hugh Glass, aside from it being a bit overplayed in certain spots and the fact that it is difficult to not see him as the most famous actor on the planet, it is one of his most memorable performances. Will Poulter, and Domhnall Gleeson also turn in strong supporting performances but the real display here is from Tom Hardy. While he has always been good at playing the villain, never has he been so right for a role as this one. You will truly grow to despise his character and love every second of it. While their is not much writing to speak of, the two and a half hour run time seems to fly by. Iñárritu is cementing his name as one of the top directors going right now, and this movie really shows off how far he is willing to go. There are so many little touches that make this move feel as real as possible, from only using natural light to the long cold shoots, Iñárritu pushed these actors to the brink, and I think the movie is better for it. Back to the look of the film, it really is one of the best looking films of all time. Everything is captured with great expanse and fluidity. Some long shot scenes without cuts are mesmerizing and jaw dropping. These two got it right last year with Birdman, and they have taken the talent and moved it outside of the theater. It may be difficult to watch other movies for a while after viewing the Revenant. Nothing will come close to the expansiveness of Iñárritu's wilderness. The realism alone will make most other movies look silly. One of the few problems I thought plagued The Martian was that I never really felt alone up on Mars. Contact always seemed far too accessible. In the Revenant There is a real feeling of desperation and loneliness that is incredibly hard to accomplish. This movie is a real cinema masterpiece, and while not a perfect 10/10 it is still a must see movie this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Bear rape epic sadly doesn't deliver for me. Poor editing.,"I watched this film on the same day it was announced it had been nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture. It is set in 1823 and follows the journey of a group of men hunting for lucrative furs in South Dakota.The main star is Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass one of the fur trappers. After escaping attack from native Indians and their expert arrow attacks Glass is brutally attacked by a wild bear in what some people are calling a 'bear rape'. It isn't but it is brutal featuring lots of claws, flesh and scars and lots of blood.What follows is over two hours of survival techniques by Glass as he is left for dead by his double crossing colleagues including Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald. Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu delivers an epic film to the big screen with great snowy landscapes and cinematography. Glass survives in scenes reminiscent of one of those survival television shows. However I believe that a good twenty minutes could have been edited from the 156 minute run time. No doubt DiCaprio will finally bag a Best Actor Oscar but this film did not deliver for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Quite good!,"Oh,man... If Leonardo does not get his Oscar for this finally, I think that those people sitting there are insane!The film as a whole is good. Although it is some two and a half hours, it is not boring, but it is not really exciting either. What kept me watching it was beautiful scenery and really beautiful shots! In the beginning of the film, I had an impression that the film was shot like panoramic photography...wide angle to really capture the beauty of the scenery. And the scenery is great. I believe the film was shot in Canada... Not sure.The scene with a grizli bear...Man oh man...Was that the real bear? Whatever it is - it was impressive! As well as the dead horse scene when he sleeps inside. Brutal, powerful and at the same time beautiful! And I must say that there were so many powerful, brutal and beautiful scenes as it is the movie.My rating takes mostly into consideration how beautifully shot the film was, how good Leonardo - first of all - was and Tom too. As I said, the story and 'entertainment' were not really to my liking.Worth the watch! Hoping Leonardo to get that statue!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Another Great Performance By Leo,"The reason why I haven't given this top marks is, I don't think it's very re-watchable for some reason. I've seen it twice and don't get me wrong it's really good, but it's effort having to watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Beautifully shot, formulaic blockbuster","I was really looking forward to this, I love wilderness films. I was slightly looking forward to it less when I realized it was a re-hash of the classic Man in the Wilderness. Its a beautifully shot film with some good moments but it just seems that Hollywood bods get together, select a scenario and inject the same components over and over again. This could have been a war film set in the 1990s, or a 'defense against aliens' film set in 2200. Its the same growling macho performances, tinged with an honor and pride that only seems to exist in the dream world of Hollywood, finishing with a lesson that the human spirit, especially if you are American, seems to know no bounds. Why not tell the story like it is? People don't survive numerous powerful attacks by the same bear, or manage to endlessly dodge weapons, bullets and Indian ambushes. Build the story about what is realistic and inject some subtlety around it. People were simpler in the 19th century - this lot look like they have been spoon fed a cocktail of Tony Robbins and Bear Grylls. People are so impressed with big stars, huge performances, epic music and unworldly cinematography that they can't see that there is just so much padding to this simplistic narrative of growling and fighting. It's an OK film, it will win Oscars. Give me Richard Harris any day over this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"A harsh, brutal and engaging depiction of one man's willpower","The trailer for Revenant is very misleading. It would have you believe this film is full of fighting scenes, battles and generally action. It's not. It's mostly about one man's struggle against nature. Overcoming his weakness and injuries in his drive for revenge and survival. The majority of the film is slow-paced and focused on the incredible willpower of the protagonist.Seeing this film on the big screen can be overwhelming. The brutal, realistic scenes, close-up shots of actors' faces, perfectly showing the struggle and pain they experience, and the incredibly harsh environment, make for one of the most memorable cinematic experiences this year. As can be expected from DiCaprio and Hardy, the acting is phenomenal. One can almost feel the pain, the cold, the hunger and the fear they experience. The camera captures all this perfectly, as well as showing beautiful scenery and biting winter weather, all filmed using only natural light.The plot, despite being quite simple, keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats, rooting for the hero's survival and admiring every time he manages to get up and keep going.The one criticism would be about the realism of all the misfortune, that befalls DiCaprio's character. There are points where it is really too much for one man to endure and the opinion of the antagonist, that ""there is no way he could survive that"" seems quite correct.Another thing to note: this is not a film for the squeamish. The graphic, bloody scenes involving both humans and animals do not hold back in realism.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Yes, the cinematography is good, Tom Hardy is exactly what you want him to be, the story, historical accuracy and camerawork is really good. But.... The praising I've heard in 2015 about the CGI and the brilliance of Di Caprio did not really sink in with me. Amusing low budget movie, but two and a half hours is more than the storyline needs.

Feels like a great journey!,"I saw it when it came out in theaters and I remember not being blown away by it, despite finding many aspects of the film very impressive. In particular the brutality of the violence, the quality of the choreography of the action scenes, the intensity of the bear mauling, DiCaprio and Hardy's performances, the practical and digital effects, Alejandro's direction, and the cinematography. However, that might be due to the fact that I was sitting next to these two people who wouldn't shut up throughout the whole movie like a couple of idiots! Anyway, I watched it last night and I like it a lot more now than I did before. All of the praises I gave it back then still stand.I wince when I watch that bear scene. My stepfather is a hunter and he said it was very accurate to a real bear mauling.Will Poulter is great in everything but this is the best acting I've seen from him. This guy needs to be in more stuff! Seriously, he was amazing!This is the best acting I've seen from Domhall Gleeson.The dialogue is really good.I have a lot of respect for Alejandro for sticking to his guns and being as unforgiving as he was when making this movie. People bitched and moaned about working in the cold but if they had green-screened the movie it wouldn't have been half as effective as it was. I will definitely keep my eyes on him. He is one of the best directors out there, by far.I felt as though the movie feels longer than it is. I understand that's the point of it but it still bugs me. So I guess that's not really a criticism it's more of a preference.My only real criticisms are with the canteen and the Ree showing up at the end. Those were a little too convenient.

A harsh winter for beast and man,"While having Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio is a definite boon, what really makes ""The Revenant"" a splendid cinematic experience is the utmost care for visual and cinematography. It's a series of immersive events taken with extreme care, minimal editing and a continuous shot after continuous shot of wintry landscape as it witnesses revenge and ordeal of savages.It tells the story of Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he fights against beast, nature and fellow man to stay alive. There are a couple of other subplots though Glass' perspective takes the focus. One can argue that this is Leo's closest chance at Oscar in recent years, and it's hard not to see why. He's an expert on conveying emotions with sheer gestures and psychical attributes alone. If this movie is advertised as actual survival show, Leo would make people believe it.On the other spectrum Tom Hardy as Fitzgerald is just equally amazing. He presents a much different persona than his other roles, I admittedly didn't recognize him for half of the movie. This is a brilliant act on his part to showcase the brutality of the time. Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter round up the crew nicely as duty bound captain and the more inexperienced frontiersman. The average length of scene is demanding and the cast delivers pleasantly.The other subplots happen simultaneously as Glass' predicament, they could be highlighted more but this is just a slight scratch on the narrative and also not to impose on the main story line. Its visual is certainly a triumph in film making. There's no shortage of refinement on the sequences, whether it's dialogues or action. It's a precise, deliberate and unwavering presentation, captivating with its pronounced details as well as slight whisper or howl of the winter.Few other movies manage to allure the audience into the world of the movie with stern excellent production and acting, ""The Revenant"" is truly breathtaking.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A Masterpiece about Vengeance and Redemption,"Unlikely the complexity in his previous masterpiece Birdman, Iñárritu has approached a straightforward story without much dialogues but enriched with metaphors about vengeance and redemption. It is an unresistant hypnotic drama that combines revenge, survival, violence and desperation intensely that would certainly chill audiences both physically and mentally. Each and every single detail of the film is taken care perfectly, death and evilness of the characters are well captured with beauty and horror thanks to the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, the setting of the stranded nature background and the powerful orchestral scores add on the sombre effects which all contribute to the impressive technical aspects of the cinematic experience. Leonardo DiCaprio amazes again with his brutal and anchoring performance struggling to survive while the commitment between him and Tom Hardy into their respective roles have successfully turned the director's artistic visions into an immersive life of death journey. Although it seems to be a strange film with striking images of blood soaking ground, animals and humans, it is an inspiring wild expedition about humanity and inhumanity that is elegant in its own simplicity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Raw, brutal yet breathtakingly beautiful epic","Greetings from Lithuania.""The Revenant"" (2015) is in my opinion the best movie of 2015. ""Spotlight"" was very good, yet ""The Revenant"" is more visceral experience, one of the kind actually - once seen this movie is hard to forget. Cinenamtography by the great Emmanuel Lubezki was breathtaking - he just delivers viewer to the place and time - ""The Revenant"" has to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Directing was amazing, and the overall craftsmanship of this movie is simply stunning. And yes, the bear attack scene is brutal and unforgiving - how did they done that? And yet i don't really think that Leonardo DiCaprio was such a sure Oscar winner. His performance is very good in here, he surely got trough a lot during filming, but is that what best performance is all about? The only reason he won is that there weren't really strong contenders last year, given any other year in the past, he wouldn't won.Overall, ""The Revenant"" is a great movie, but can be a disappointment for those who are looking for some adventure flick. It has some spirituality themes along, and it's not very easy to sit trough this long 2 h 35 min movie - but it's a damn worth every minute of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

visually impressive director's film,"From the opening of the movie, you already have a good idea that the work is masterful. From the shots of the flowing water in the middle of the forest to the shots of the mountains and the sky, the technical achievement is impressive, most notably the camera work and the visuals. It started great, and then augmented by Leonardo's performance, it retained its strength towards the end. Although it's not much on the writing department, with some forgettable conversations, its driving force is the visuals, and perhaps it can be even told well as a silent film, although we might miss the aptly written film music. The point here is that this is one of the best directed films of the year and in many years. One notable scene is the raid of the American natives against a band of White hunters. Albeit small in scale, it felt grand and challenging to shoot, given the unique angles and action sequences. It was rather a gory scene, which Alejandro Inarritu masterfully mixed with artistic values.There were a lot of other scenes with bloodshed and gore, and in terms of effective use of visual effects, it is the battle with the huge bear that stood out among the rest. If we talk about the most violent among them, one cannot rule out the combat in the last part of the movie. Although it is not really as violent as most of Tarantino's movies, one cannot help to notice the director's fascination of the artistic value of blood in the snow.Apart from the direction, there were two other strong driving forces in the movie: DiCaprio's performance and the cinematography. The role was definitely challenging, but then it was a bull's eye. The other characters were not developed well, but you will not be bothered by it because the plot is simple. Miss some of their conversations and you won't miss a lot. It was after all a director's film about survival and revenge, impressively made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Why Leonardo DiCaprio Shouldn't Win the Oscar This Year...,"Starting with ""Titanic"" in 1997, I grew up watching Leo's movies. He is a great actor; I hope no one denies that. This year marks his 6th Oscar nomination for Best Actor. But to say that he should win an Oscar for his portrayal of the bear-mauled hunter/fur trader Hugh Glass in ""The Revenant"" is an overstatement.This is, after all, an award category for best acting, not for physical suffering. I applaud Leo's dedication - freezing in the cold, eating raw bison, sleeping inside an animal carcass - all of which was difficult even to watch. Leo's lines were minimal due to the fact that his character's throat got ripped open by the bear. His acting also lacked depth; besides a very strong will to survive, I did not see anything unforgettable.Nominated for Best Supporting Actor, Tom Hardy, on the other hand, dominated the screen. Hardy's John Fitzgerald was not only believable but also relatable. Hardy, down to his facial expressions, gave us a flawed and vulnerable villain.I'm not discrediting the movie all together. The film, aesthetically speaking, was very enjoyable. Director Alejandro Iñárritu insisted on filming in natural light with simultaneous sound recording, and production took 9 long months. I have to give major props to the entire cast and crew for surviving such harsh conditions.I would rather Iñárritu win Best Director (but I'm really rooting for George Miller on this one) than having Leo win Best Actor. I know I am not of popular opinion this year. It was sad to watch him lose in 2015, but I want him to win one day for the best performance of his career, and this is not it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""Revenge is in God's hands, not mine.""","Good revenge film, especially one inspired by true events. Also a pretty dang good performance by DiCaprio and one heck of a nominee winner during the 2015 Oscars. The style of filmography with the ideas of using one long shot for most scenes, the very subtle cuts, and the in and out music. Some of the nature scenes were extraordinary, some of the best I've ever seen in a film as such. The ending was a bit unclear to me, but the rest beforehand was pretty straight-forward. This is yet another successful film that hardly uses dialogue and more emotions and expressions (a film like Wall-E being another). This is indeed an ""epic adventure of survival.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
7.5/10,"A haunting, complex, uncompromising piece of film of which its biggest success is how much it opens for a conversation about filmaking and the power of movies. It is really challenging in craft and provides for a very, very singular experience, despite some overbearing and slightly pretentious touches.There is one thing that really struck me in thinking about the film: it could be really easy to hate on it for its flaws, because there are flaws and they are the reason this film isn't getting the universal acclaim people were expecting. The flaws it has are actually quite relevant: the screenplay isn't really anything special, there is so much acting thrown to your face in an way too overwhelming way. It is one of those films that really pushes the ""look at us we're acting"" thing and almost everybody is part of it. There also lots of breathing space that isn't really necessary and overall the whole thing really is thrown into your face in an overwhelming way that sometimes totally forgets subtlety and brings down also the film thematically. But the point is, all of these flaws are there and they would normally really knock a movie down, yet there is so much triumph here in the craft of filmaking, so much ambition, so much sheer cinema, it is really hard to get mad at anything of this. Basically the positives outweigh the negatives.As much as I said that there's the ""look at us we're actors"" thing, of whom Inarritu is also to blame for, there is even more genuine fantastic work from them. Could DiCaprio have done with being a little more subtle in points? of course, but you simply can't discount a performance of this caliber based on that. He has problems in disappearing from the screen a an actor, but overall what he does here is some kind of remarkable. With his recent movies he is almost creating a new school of acting that isn't quite anything we've seen before, good or bad I don't know. Domnall Glesson and Will Poulter also have their chance to shine. Still, nobody manages to take over the Brando of our generation: Tom Hardy can do no wrong, he upstages all of the actors and steals every moment he is in, he is just a powerhouse.A thought that really, really hit me after this film and that I cannot stop thinking about is how much I would now love to see Inarritu direct an action film. Just writing that makes me even more excited about it. He just has a thing were under his direction the technical aspect of a film is beyond debatable. It is just flawless. The sound, music, Lubezki's photography, everything, it just leaves your jaw dropped. He does take a little too much breathing time as I said before, but it is easily forgettable when you see what he can do when sh*t hits the fan. I repeat it, I just want to see him direct two hours of action now, that's how visceral this film is, it is astonishing. He reminds you what is the power of cinema and actually goes further in that in creating new ways to use the screen. There is a horse chase in this film where I couldn't believe what was happening with the camera and the shock value it has floored me.As I said, if you really want to hate this film there is nothing stopping you, but as a fan of cinema and filmaking and as an obsessed lover of the craft behind everything involving film, ""The Revenant"" was really an achievement.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Beauty and Brutality of Nature.,"""The Revenant"", Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu was a film I was sceptical to see after viewing the trailer and 8 years later I now regret never heading to the theatres to watch this picture. With a stellar cast and an amazing director this has hands down become one the most beautiful films I have ever seen and earns its place as more than just a movie. I found myself in aw for most of this film as I was transported into the beautiful landscape and surreal shots that are presented to us. The use of natural light instead of studio lights in majority of the scenes help to produce the realism and add to the tone of the film. The beauty and brutality of nature are equally presented in ""The Revenant"" through this and the story itself. Leonardo DiCaprio shows us his talent on another level we have not seen before, on a physical level. His role with little dialogue is carried through his ability to produce such an authentic performance of pain, vengeance and a never ending battle between man and nature. Another performance in this film that stands out is Tom Hardy. Whenever Leo isn't on screen Hardy is there to provide the same calibre performance on a different level as he usually manages to do. This film is intense, violent, beautiful and overall an amazing piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Ecstatic beauty of a linear survival tale,"Of course we can tease that DiCaprio has turned Inarritu's latest majestically-looking Western revenge saga as his almost-perfect Oscar-draw with all the exacting physical tribulations: severely mauled by a bear, being buried alive, worming his way in the wild, floating on the raging torrent, eating raw fish and bison liver, falling from a cliff and keeping warm inside a dead horse's cavity, etc. etc. some of those are real deal, others are cinematic creation, but there is no shame for an actor challenges himself to the extreme in order to win an Oscar award, although to many a cinephile, most of time Oscar looks like a joke, but for those whose career is making movies, getting the recognition from their peers is a huge honour and temptation rather difficult to refuse, also at least Leo does all those impressive stunts in his film instead of in the tiresome self- campaign.Last year's Oscar winner Inarritu returns with an even more grandstanding showpiece, running over 2 and a half hours, the narrative is fairly simple, inspired by a true event, in 1820s, a member of a fur trading expedition, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), survives a deadly bear attack and embarks on an astounding journey to avenge the killer of his Pawnee son Hawk (Goodluck). Basically, it is an eye- opening survival tale plus an old-fashion Western ending, but under Inarritu's perfectionist and harsh working ethos, DP Emmanuel Lubezki's mind-blowing visual grandeur (I'm talking about THE TREE OF LIFE level of magnificence, even the sky is not the limit for this guy!) and a fearless cast headed by DiCaprio and Hardy, we are awed to witness Hugh's entire ordeal with admiration and inconceivability. One sure thing, apart from Leo's Oscar chance, is Lubezki is on the fast track to fulfil his hat trick after GRAVITY (2013) and BIRDMAN (2014), one can only feel particularly sorry for Roger Deakins, who might lose to the same guy three times (consecutively) after his 13th nomination for SICARIO (2015) and still be Oscar-less.Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this year finally belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio, personally I am not a fan of bodily transformation or endeavour, because the highest achievement of acting is reflected through an actor's expressions and articulation, to convey one's subtle or un-subtle emotions, other things are all bells and whistles, but after beholding all those exploits, one has to surrender to a feeling of commiseration, give Leo the damn Oscar!An interesting side-note is that every time DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar in leading role, there is always a collateral supporting nomination for his male co-star, first is Alan Alda in THE AVIATOR (2004), then, Djimon Hounsou in BLOOD DIAMOND (2006), next Jonah Hill in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), and this time the fluke comes upon Tom Hardy (three out of four, save Hounsou, their nominations happen out of nowhere without any significant precursors), who plays Hugh's nemesis John Fitzgerald, although it is a very dark character, Hardy generates great intimidation but as a whole not exceptionally superior to his other works, so the nomination could be conceived as a career-boost for his consistent output and a banner year in 2015 (with MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and LEGEND), although his co-star Domhnall Gleeson, has an even more staggering line-up (EX MACHINA, STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS and BROOKLYN).After my tepid reception towards BIRDMAN, THE REVEMANT complacently shows more potentialities of Inarritu as a visionary auteur, his compassion for the indigenous and scorn to the Western colonisation, are all admiring, only if he could underplay the flourishes a little bit and find some source material more pioneering other than boosting self-worth and endurance, that's my little wishful thinking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

We are all savages,"I'm a sucker for films set in the 1800s, it's always been my favorite period in history, so this film (Along with Hateful Eight) was a must see.

Simply put, this is the second best movie of 2015 (After Mad Max: Fury Road). The cinematography is breathtaking, showing off the unforgiving yet beautiful scenery and the bear mauling scene is the most brutal bear attack in cinema history. DiCaprio gives another great performance, possibly his strongest yet, in a role that is almost dialogue-free for the first hour. Props to Tom Hardy (Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max) for once again disappearing into a role, this time as murderous fur trapper Fitzgerald, he really is the new Daniel Day Lewis, there is no actor, just a brilliant character.

Not enough character development,Dicaprio and Hardy were great in their limited roles. The expedition Captain was a poor casting choice as he was unbelievable in his role.

"Leo commands an empty landscape, Overrated survival film","The Revenant is a strong movie for the first half hour or so and then it reduces to a series of 'greatest hits' moments from survivalist films that we have seen before. This movie is about sixty minutes of material padded to two hours plus, and is too emotionally distant to be worth the endurance that it asks of the viewer.With that in mind, the film has strong points. This is NOT remotely an award winning performance from Leo Dicaprio, but he is indeed commanding. He is one of those actors who can make himself seem bigger through his physical performance, and Leo has never felt this naturally big before. Tom Hardy also brings some a-game and knows how to be threatening through small nuances in his demeanour.The Revenant is a well shot movie, making great use of camera work and the same wide lens effects that aided Birdman but the problem is that mostly there is nothing to look at but scenery. Leo wanders through the wilderness for a long time, leaving the audience with nothing but a chilly feeling. The Revenant is meant to be a tale of revenge but there is no sense of drive or character motivation which makes it worth investing in.It's a clunky, and unmemorable film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Visual Masterpiece,"To be honest, I was not very interested in the film when I started watching it, and the trailer did not look all that engaging either. Though I do still think the first half of the film is a little boring, it was actually quite interesting. It depicts a different era, with a way of living that I am not much aware of, and so was quite an eye-opener.I just have to mention first of all, that the cinematography is absolutely phenomenal. Emmanuel Lubezki certainly knows how to position the camera, and along with Iñárritu's directing, manages to produce an exceptionally beautiful film. The shots of nature are so breathtaking that I feel like the film could have just been a documentary about the attractiveness of Canada (and Argentina). Indeed, during the first half of the film, it seemed like the appeal of the nature scenes far outweighed that of the narrative.The story is based on the true story of Hugh Glass, though of course through a Hollywood-ised version. (I spent a good amount of time reading through the trivia page on IMDb.) From what I gather, there is a lot more anger and confrontations with other groups in this film that was not experienced by the real Hugh Glass. Though I have been saying that the narrative was not engaging, it did get better as the film progressed. Do note that the film is primarily focused on the aesthetics and not the narrative.Speaking of aesthetics, I've already mentioned the amazing cinematography, but the visual effects are absolutely stunning as well. There is ton load of gruesome scenes and depictions of violence in this film, and they are all done with so much detail it's amazing. It is almost too hard to believe that what happens on screen didn't happen in real life. The bear attack -though seemed a little long, was absolutely chilling to watch. There is another scene involving another animal further on in the movie, and that too is unbelievably realistic. Adding to that, the make-up crew did a fantastic job at creating the wounds and scars. Seriously, everything that contributed to the visuals of this film supported each other into creating this visual masterpiece.Last of all, I am sure all of you know by now that Leonardo DiCaprio finally won an Oscar for this film, and rightly so. Though it did not seem like much of a performance at first, I understand now why he won it for portraying this character. The sheer intensity of raw emotion that he manages to convey, transcends the screen and brings so much feeling into his role. I really applaud his dedication to acting (apparently he ate a raw bison liver even though he's vegetarian- check the trivia page). Additionally, Tom Hardy gives a great supporting performance. I did not even recognize him for some time, and was extremely shocked to realize that he was in the film. His accent sounds so natural, and leaves no trace of his British origins. Gleeson is believable as the Captain, and I was surprised to see him in this as well, since he is mostly in romantic films. It was pleasant to see some of these major movie stars in roles not normally their style.Overall, a visual masterpiece with amazing acting. The narrative was intriguing at best, and did feel convenient at times. Plus, the beginning was confusing, and I would have liked more of a background into Glass' life prior to the exhibition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Will The Revenant get Leonardo DiCaprio the Oscar?,"Plot: A fur trading expedition goes wrong and wildered after an attack by the Native Americans. The onus is on tracker Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) to get the team safely back. The pursuit becomes more complicated when Glass is viciously attacked by a 500lb grizzly bear. When his team is unable to carry him further, they leave him behind after paying mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay back until Glass breathes his last. The untrustworthy Fitzgerald betrays Glass by the worst means possible. Thus begins the ruthless quest for survival and revenge.For starters, The Revenant is a visual spectacle from scene one. Ace Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who has two back-to-back Oscars to his name for his impeccable work in Gravity and Birdman, hits the bull's eye yet again. Each frame is a work of art in itself, a feast for the eyes. Based in the nineteenth century, the film is shot in the most exquisite of locations in Argentina and Alberta and look almost heavenly. Alejandro G. Inarritu, the Mexican import who dished up the intense drama 'Birdman' last year helms a project much more complicated and ambitious. And he checks all boxes, well almost.The film, which looks like an extended episode of Bear Grylls' 'Man Vs Wild', seems a tad too disbelieving at times.From Cast Away to 127 Hours, we've all seen survival films where the odds are heavily against the leading man. But Inarritu's protagonist, who by the way is 'loosely' inspired by a true character and true story, goes through stuff that even the manliest of Bollywood heroes wouldn't be able to endure.From getting ripped off and shattered by a merciless wild bear (in a spine chilling sequence- a highlight of the movie), to defying the Arikara warriors on multiple occasions, to falling off cliffs, to getting washed away in menacing streams, Glass has to be the toughest man to have ever walked on planet earth to survive it all.That probably is the only flaw in the otherwise flawless project. Innaritu's camera work is thrilling and mesmerising (Kudos to the brand new 6.5k ARRI 65 camera which makes its debut). His cast couldn't have been better. Will Poulter does a fine job. Tom Hardy, whose look reminds you of Game of Throne's 'The Hound', puts up a solid performance. At times, you cannot help get a reminiscence of Bane due to the similar voice pitch. All said, at the end of the day, The Revenant is a film made for Leonardo DiCaprio. Oxford dictionary might have to come out with fresh adjectives to describe his no-holds-barred performance, it is that good.He fights a grizzly wild beast. He eats raw bison body parts. He sleeps in animal carcasses (The latter two for real to attain authenticity). He does it all. And with mind boggling finesse. Amidst freezing cold temperatures and fighting constant hypothermia. His struggle shows on the screen (in a good way of course). He speaks lesser dialogues than he ever has and that too in a husky voice, but expresses more than ever.Leo's scintillating performance takes the survival turned revenge drama to an all new level of immensity. Without him, the film could have been just another visually appeasing film. Leonardo turns it into something else. You live with him throughout the length of the film, almost holding your own body at times to check if it hurts. As Hugh Glass defies all odds in surviving the wrath of nature, DiCaprio defiles all odds an actor could ever face. If this doesn't get him the coveted golden statuette, nothing will. There a famous joke that someday there will be a biopic made on how Leonardo DiCaprio never won an Oscar and the actor playing him will win an Oscar for it. After this role, that joke is ought to die a welcome death.The Revenant might not be Leonardo DiCaprio's best film, but Hugh Glass is surely his best performance. It has all the ingredients the Academy looks for in an Oscar winner for Best Actor, something which critics have claimed he lacked all this while. (Yes even after Titantic, Catch Me If You Can, Aviator, Blood Diamond, Departed and more recently The Wolf of Wall Street). This year seems to be his year finally. Yes we've said it a half a dozen times before only to be proved otherwise, but this by far is the most realistic bet. After all the years of struggle and disappointment, the moment when it finally happens would be quite historic to say the least.

Revenge is a dish better served cold,"As a ""survival movie"", The Revenant is the perfect example of why I didn't like Dunkirk, released 2 years later. In Nolan's film, besides the timeline being a mess, the pace was tedious, the focuses were multiple and in uninteresting characters, and consequently, there was no atmosphere to keep me interested in whether these characters were going to die or not. Indeed, that film is the perfect example that a movie is not made only by its technical aspects.Fortunately, this is not the case here. Leonardo DiCaprio is the soul of the film, the audience can feel him fighting to survive, and why he's fighting so hard to stay alive. The threat he faces, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), feels more dangerous than any military war scene, his presence is strong, as are his motivations. He is easily one of the best villains of the last decade. And the bear fight was something BRUTAL.Technically, the film is as good as the other one I talked before. The cinematography is dazzling, and the sound work transforms the movie into a sensorial experience; that's how a survival movie should be, I envy those ones who saw it in IMAX. The soundtrack is competent (strong, but not memorable), and I loved how the battles were filmed in long plans, the direction is manificent.Finally, there are some monologues in aboriginal which I'll definitely carry with me for my entire life, especially one involving a tree.

I give it a 10/10 but there are major problems with the inversion of the historical narrative narrative,"By problems I mean Hollywood's need to simplify and woke interpret this story.The fact is that Glass, who is portrayed here as the good guy, and portrayed as having an native American wife and son, never had any any children and his writings show he was even more bigoted against native Americans than the average contemporary.In fact it is Tom Hrdy's character, Jim Bridger, who had native American legally married spouse and all his six children were half native American.On one hand simplifying a story is OK, but if we are to be woke by Hollywood, it is important to note that, in this case, it was southerner Bridger was in fact the racially tolerant, and it was northerner (Pennsylvania born) Glass who was an inveterate and hateful racist against the native Americans.Also if one reads up on the history of this period and the trapping business, virtually all the trapping was done by native Americans who would then go to the outposts and private forts and sell the pelts. Even when Europeans were engaged directly in trapping the party they were with would be half or mostly native. So that party of purely European trappers that you see at the beginning of the film is total fictionDon't get me wrong this is an otherwise great film. The cinematography is stunning. Hardy who is a first class actor is at the top of his game. Dicaprio, who I think is a moderate talent certainty delivers his best performance ever. The directing is genius.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
2½ hours of self torture - for what?,"There is nothing wrong with the film. The acting is perfectly natural all the way, so natural, that you can't understand what almost anyone is saying for their mumbling in their shaggy beards, especially the main crook (Tom Hardy), who isn't credible in his unmotivated evil, and of course everything goes constantly wrong. They do everything they shouldn't, go wandering alone in a dark forest when there are bears around and you can even hear their cubs - these bear hunters couldn't be unaware that there must be a worried bear mother near by when she smells a human hunter close to her cubs. Of course, the bear attack triggers the drama, without which there would be none; but the greatest folly is in the end, when the two good men go a-hunting for a desperate murderer in the wilderness and they split up. How could they be so dumb? Sorry, it's a weak story with no psychology mainly made up for its effects, and of course, these are marvellous, the main prize going to the fantastic photography of the wilderness in the awesome landscape scenes, and here you could actually speak of poetry, but that's about all. They say it was all shot without any artificial light, which of course adds to the intriguing atmosphere of the nocturnal scenes, and the whole enterprise of shooting such a film under sinister conditions in the wilderness deserves much credit. At best some of the wilderness scenes succeed in creating some ""Call of the Wild""-ecstasy, especially the most spectacular of them all with the buffaloes. But the story is such, that you feel rather inclined to take sides with the Indians and the bears than with these villains causing nothing but mischief in the wilderness and even failing with that, while the original Richard Harris-John Huston film from 1971, which I haven't seen yet, could be expected to be better.You could blame the flaws of the story, which appears to be founded on fact way up in the Dakota wilderness in the 1820s among Sioux and Pawnees, on the necessity of the truthfulness of naturalism, people could actually be this beastly, and if they are beastly they are usually dumb as well, so let's make allowances for that - realism in absurdum, which though only makes you take the stronger sides with the Indians and the bears. One final question mark - even an Indian would in the end feel motivated to do something for the trapper that after all saved the life of his daughter, which she couldn't be unaware of, when she exits with her father with no more than a look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Simply Breathtaking!!!!,"The Revenant is simply said a beautifully shot movie with some amazing performances from the cast.
I can only say, just watch it, its brilliant.
Its a story about survival and revenge shot in the most beautiful surroundings, with a beautiful soundtrack.
Leonardo dicaprio won an oscar for his role in this movie and its hard to say if the oscar was deserved or if it was because he was nominated several times before and didn't get an oscar.
But he does play his part really well.
The only downside of this movie is that it does get a little boring from time to time and feels a little stretched in certain scenes.
Because of that it didn't get a 9/10 but an 8 but still a beautiful movie that i will watch again and again in the coming years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Pompous Exercise in Film-making,"The Revenant is an intense but excruciatingly long film. It recounts the true story of the incredible return of Hugh Glass, an ace fur trapper, who was left behind as ""dead"" by a treacherous accomplice after being badly mauled by a bear. Without subtitling, barely a sentence can be understood of the heavily accented drawl. Not that Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hugh Glass has much to say; most of the time he is grunting or grimacing. Other than that he also bites into live fish, eats raw bison liver and sleeps inside a dead horse. It is definitely not an Oscar winning performance.While the snowscape is exquisitely photographed, it can hurt your eyes. There are some stunning sequences, among them the bear attack. Despite the film being so long, not much footage has been devoted to Glass's miraculous recovery. It defies belief, even if based on a true incident. The director has tried to inject some doses of mysticism, but it comes across as a pompous exercise in film-making. What linger at the end are not the travails of Hugh Glass, but the sad eyes of the native Indian chief searching for his abducted daughter.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A spectacular revenge,"Great movie. Glass just crawls to revenge Fitzgerald. He has few foods but he just lives on to revenge Fitzgerald. That's all he can do.

Great acting by DiCaprio & Wonderful Cinematography,"If you wonder why DiCaprio won the Oscar, then you need to watch the movie. We all know his talent in his other films but he shows us again.

The perils of Pauline with bears,"With a token appeal to our interest in the main character this film invites us to share with him a series of catastrophes which would have killed not only lesser men but any man who lives in any kind of believable world. Mauled by a bear, choked by the 'villain', nearly drowned in a rushing torrent, left to crawl across miles of frozen wasteland, plunged over a precipice, our hero survives it all. He eats raw fish caught with a method defying all logic, he gnaws on and is sickened by raw buffalo, ignoring the opportunity to teach the art of barbecue to a random native on the fire burning invitingly behind them, he grimaces, he growls, her bleeds - he survives despite the odds, despite the elements, despite the siren call of credibility. There is nothing wrong with the performances. Di Caprio emotes his suffering by recreating a hangover in scene after scene, Tom Hardy does his impressive best with a cliché from any number of westerns, Will Poulter does well with his ingénue role. The photography is exquisite. Overall, however, I kept expecting Mazi stormtroopers, the Alien or Freddie Krueger to pop out of a frozen bush and add to our hero's trials, such was the almost comic overloading of the dice cast against poor Leo. The Indian attack and the bear attack are well done - after that repair to the bear - sorry, the bar.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Visually compelling, but empty inside","So my idea of a good movie is quite simple,- I'm just asking myself, whether I'm willing to watch it again or not.

But it feels more like a kaleidoscope of beautiful imagery with no emotional or intellectual filling. Of course, there are the hackneyed 'bear' and 'horse' scenes, but all in all, there is nothing to feel or worry about. To get a general feeling for the Revenant, just read through its 'Quotes' (which are accessible from the main page),- this is almost all the dialogue you hear in the entire movie.

Not your average bear,"One has to respect Leonardo DiCaprio, whose career could have gone the way of Ryan Reynolds or Mathew McConaughey--since repented-- cashing in on his boyish looks with hollow romantic-comedies for half-wits. Instead, he chooses to work with Spielberg, Mann, Mendes, Nolan, Tarantino, and, of course, Scorsese--narrowing in on challenging, often unlikable characters.In an astounding turn-around from last year's ""Birdman,"" Alejandro Inarritu takes a by-the-numbers folk song about one man's thirst for revenge and strips it naked of all barroom romanticism. With ""The Revenant,"" he holds up his thumb to unrelenting nature, sees the beauty within and begins the shaping process.The film's first victory was the decision to shoot on-location, with natural light. While the concept might seem somewhat pretentious at first--considering the luxuries computers afford--it pays off, creating one of the more immersive film experiences in recent memory--and no 3D, what do you know? No matter how advanced computer generation becomes, you can't beat the real thing--that works with movies, Coca-Cola and nearly everything else.I'm normally not a huge proponent for realism in films--I already know it's fake, so just have fun with it--but ""The Revenant"" is the rare case where I can't imagine the film any other way. Perhaps, it's because much of it isn't fake. Or perhaps, it's because the story is so naturally thin, and the realism puts a magnifying glass to the cinematic fine print--delicate human moments--that would otherwise go unnoticed. Yes, I think that's it.The action sequences--and they are that--are leagues above anything seen in any superhero film, placing the audience amongst the gun- smoke, zipping arrows and the horses who move like heavy machinery. No better is this accomplishment signified than the already notorious ""bear scene,"" in which Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is eviscerated by a grizzly. The scene is unrelenting in its brutality, the bear acting as the physical manifestation of cruel Nature, and Glass as helpless Man, always on the defensive. And unlike most blockbuster films, the action has purpose and repercussions; it doesn't feel like a child playing nonsensically with his toys--not that I don't occasionally enjoy such a thing.One would be remiss to fail to mention DiCaprio's performance as Glass--if ever there was a man less suited to his name. He's the kind of actor who never goes for the admirable base hit, but spits in both hands and points to the rafters each and every time; here is no different. He's as raw and inexorable as the film itself. Same goes for Tom Hardy, the villain of the piece, a man so detestable, the Indian who scalped him changed his mind half-way through. The character had be worried for a bit, as he comes off a tad mustache- twirling, but he rounds out in the end.""The Revenant,"" is a film that unfolds rather than unveils; that reveals rather than relates; a film of driving, raw emotion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Is this much Violence Necessary,"While my review of the Hateful Eight gave it some latitude since the violence was, at least, directly tied to the plot, The Revenent is a movie whose violence is over the top. We cannot fault Leonardo DiCaprio for his excellent acting, not the special effects that allowed much of this movie to be filmed.But, how long ago do you think it was that this movie would have been X-Rated? We have become inured to violence and that is a bad thing for all of us but especially the younger generation. Seeing extremely violent movies is NOT the same as the imaginary characters of comic books 50 years ago. The movies are SO real that the line between violence in the real world and violence in the movies has blurred.Have we inadvertently caused the more violent culture around us. I think we have and we should be afraid of the consequences.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Beautiful and Savage Storytelling That Needs to Be Seen To Be Believed,"The Revenant is a really good achievement in cinema that I enjoyed. Don't think the 6 is meant to be as a diss, I just reserve the higher numbers for rewatchable films. It is a straight-forward story of revenge in which Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is after John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). I feel like the way this movie was pitched was what all can we do to Leo to finally get him an Oscar. I mean his character goes through so many setbacks on his quest for revenge which is very entertaining to watch if at sometimes pushing the unbelievable mark. WARNING - This is a very, very brutal film with lots of blood, intense and violent images. I cannot use the word intense enough to describe the film.THE MAJOR PLAYERS (5 Best):Director - Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Best 3 Credits - 21 Grams, Babel, and Birdman)Cinematographer - Emmanuel Lubeski (Best 3 Credits - Gravity, Children of Men, and Sleepy Hollow)Leonardo DiCaprio - The Departed, Django Unchained, and InceptionTom Hardy - Bronson, The Dark Knight Rises, and LegendDomhnall Gleeson - Ex Machina, About Time, and True GritHONORABLE MENTION - After his horrible acting in Maze Runner, Will Poulter totally redeemed himself. His dramatic acting in this movie gives me hope. I new he had good comedic timing in We're the Millers. I totally believed his inner turmoil in this movie.MVP - Sorry Leo but Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar for his performance. So brutal and unforgiving. He must be a real A-Hole in real life cause he was perfect at playing a horrible character with no redeeming qualities.THE VERDICT - I would recommend seeing the film in Theaters but I don't think I will see the film again.If you liked the film The Grey, you will like this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Bear Grylls circa 1823,"I love this period of history, and this movie gives us a feel for what it must have been like.There is something awe inspiring about that push out from the eastern seaboard of America just before and after the War of Independence. It took amazing characters to enter that vast wilderness and face its dangers including some of the most formidable warriors ever to twang a bowstring.To be honest I enjoy this aspect of American history more than Westerns, which are usually set at a later period. ""The Revenant"" captures the harshness of the times and is simply an amazing looking film. The actors and the crew suffered for this one and it shows.Now with that said, there are a couple of things that did bother me. When you have watched thousands of movies over more than 60 years, your ears become attuned to language that suits the times. As Somerset Maugham once said, it has to sound right. There are a number of phrases in ""The Revenant"" that jar the ear because I know they only date from a few decades back. ""The kid's been beating himself up"", just doesn't sound very James Fenimore Cooper. I put this down to the fact that none of the key filmmakers were born before 1960 including the guy who wrote the book.Does it wreck the movie? Well no, but it is a point worth bearing in mind when you go to make your historical movie - maybe you need a bleary-eyed old film buff to give your script the once over.The other thing that bothers me a little is that this is based on a true story and it didn't end quite like it does in the movie. In fact it seems that the real Hugh Glass was a little more forgiving than Leo's character - but then we wouldn't have had that epic MMA fight with blades at the end.The film has plenty of wince-inducing scenes that make you wonder how they were done; the bear attack in particular. And I'll certainly take that tip about gutting and crawling into an animal carcass if I ever lock myself out of my car on a cold night.Despite the occasional anachronism, ""The Revenant"" is one of those movies I will enjoy watching more than once, no doubt discovering rewarding new elements each time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Objectively Perfect,"The Revenant is objectively a wonderful movie - especially the acting and the cinematography. But it is just not my kind of movie so I only gave it a 8/10. The violence and gore was a bit too much for my liking. I saw people complaining of the runtime but I think the pacing was solid and the length of the movie helped us to somewhat go through the entire ordeal alongside Glass. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was simply phenomenal, as was Tom Hardy's. I also thoroughly enjoyed the good characters of Hikuc, the Captain and Bridgers which felt like a breath of fresh air.

"Starts good, middle is way too long and boring, ends reasonably well.","Well I watched The Revenant earlier and to be brutally honest it was boring as hell.The opening and the ending were good, but the middle just dragged. I was bored for a good 2/3rds of the film and kept wanting it to get on with it and tell a story already. It is at least an hour too long.Does Leonardo deserve an Oscar for this role? Most definitely not. It definitely wouldn't make my top 5 DiCaprio films, hell it struggles to make it into the top 10.Doesn't deserve best movie either, in fact it doesn't even deserve a nomination.It could win Oscar's for Cinematography, Makeup and Hairstyling and for Costume Design. Those were all outstanding. As was Tom Hardy he out acted Leo in every scene he had, so did Domhnall Gleeson to be honest.I gave this a 6 on IMDb, purely for the cinematography and costume/makeup and supporting cast.

I love it,"""The Revenant"" is a mixture of an art-house western and a revenge flick, and although it's an excellent film, it's not suitable for everyone. The movie is somber and violent, with realistic and gritty violence that makes it an engrossing drama.The story follows Hugh Glass, a fur trapper from the early 1800s, who is mauled by a grizzly bear and abandoned to die by his comrades. The movie revolves around his journey to survive and take revenge on those who betrayed him.Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Glass is a brilliant performance that captures the character's agony and misery in a genuine manner. Tom Hardy also gives a remarkable performance as the antagonist. Domhnall Gleeson's depiction of Captain Henry brings a sense of benevolence and empathy to the film, while Will Poulter's acting is exceptional in his role.Alejandro G. Iñárritu, the director, deserves praise for choosing to use live performances and natural light instead of green screens. The visual effects are extraordinary, making the bear attack scene horrifyingly realistic. The cinematography is also remarkable, with some breathtaking tracking shots.The music is the only aspect where the movie falls short. It's intrusive, melancholic, and irritating, with some whiny ""Ligeti-style"" elements that do not improve the experience.Overall, ""The Revenant"" is a magnificent film, but it's not a movie that leaves you feeling good. It's intense and violent, with a final confrontation that is one of the most visceral fight scenes in recent years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One long bad day,"In some ways this feels like Mike Leigh does a western. It is unremittingly grim. DiCaprio is definitely not having a good day, good week or even possibly a good month. It goes bad from day one with an attack in the opening scenes and doesn't get much better for him. Especially after the famed bear attack! However this hard-to-kill man takes us on an epic journey through some wonderful mountain scenery and the story, plainly told, develops to a suitable climax. DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for shear bloody endurance in the face of some incredibly harsh conditions alone! It did not look like a very comfortable acting job and he bore it with great fortitude. It had a great frontier feel and I felt for the hard lives of those who lived through those times. If I have one quibble it felt over long and a bit more editing would have produced a tighter film.

However, Leo is an absolute genius in this picture. As my friend quipped, ""I couldn't even make my leg look that dead; how does he do it?"" I can't even describe for you how great DiCaprio's performance is in this film. I honestly have never been on the Leo bandwagon. I think he's a great actor who has turned in many Oscar worthy performances, however, I do not worship the ground upon which he walks. This is not a Leo groupie lauding unnecessary and bloated praises. This performance is genuinely one of the best I've seen.This film generally has a small plot, which includes a lot of violence. Frankly, I have never been accepting of these terms, but this movie makes up for it else where. The cinematography of this is flawless. The cut to shots are beyond genius, the camera work is brilliant, the colors are rich, the costumes are great, the makeup is greater, and the technicalities are perfection. Every t is crossed and every i dotted. The film won't wow you with an incredible plot but it dives deep into what it has and let's the visuals speak for themselves. It is an instant masterpiece of filmmaking which turns in great performances from two of today's top actors. I don't know whether it will pull down a Best Picture Award from the Academy, but it doesn't need accolades for longevity. It is genius. Innaritu has proved himself one of the best filmmakers in the industry today. There isn't much more to say about this movie. Go see it and you will see exactly what I mean.

A Let Down,"I thought the first 40mins was excellent! The cinematography was excellent, such beautiful shots. Unfortunately the cinematography greatly supports my 7 rating, which might tell you what I think of the story. One can easily watch the first 40mins and the last 20mins and not really miss anything. Aside from the disaster, ""The Lone Ranger"", I've never complained about a movie's length... but here it is, ""The Revenant"" is an hour too long - the good thing is there's plenty of opportunity to go to the bathroom and grab popcorn without missing anything. I'm not sure why the movie has all the hype, unless you're into 90mins of a guy limping along finding shelter and something to eat. Best Actor? Really? I love DiCaprio, but this was far from his best role to date. The character didn't have the foundation for an Oscar nod in my opinion, and it would have been relatively easy for MANY actors to turn in a similar performance. I suspect there once was a compelling script here that was greatly tarnished my another writer or director's theme emphasis which resulted in numerous scenes that didn't add to the story, thus causing it to drag - like DiCaprio through the snow.Sorry. It only deserved one Oscar nod. Having said that, there are phenomenal individual scenes, and the cinematography is worthy of the big screen - so go see it.

Visceral and Visually Stunning.....,"A highly anticipated contender for Oscars, ""The Revenant"" landed with winning the coveted awards for Best Director and Best Actor, giving Leonardo Di Caprio his much awaited Oscars and losing Best Picture to ""The Spotlight."" The film deserves a heavy applause for two very strong reasons. The first for the superb cinematography it uses which gives the depiction of the 18th century America and an expedition of the hunters in the snow capped mountains of North America. The landscapes and the camera angle chill your spines and frightens for the force of nature and isolation it can bring. For most of the part, the film uses the natural landscape than computer generated images which has dominated film making for quite a time which makes it a visual treat. The second reason to admire the film is the superb performance of Leonardo Di Caprio, who appears away from his Titanic fame boyish performances which he has been giving most of the time. Without much of the dialogues, he somewhat gets into the skin of the character sparkling the screen in his presence.Undoubtedly, the film is flawless technically and sets a benchmark in the cinematographic achievement in movies. But regarding the story and script, the film lacks a tightness and fails to grip at times. The tightness of Alejandro's earlier movies ""Amorres Perros"" and ""Babel"" is somewhat missing in this one. The film becomes a survival game in the wilderness of American landscape, somewhat familiar from Tom Hank's ""Cast Away."" Then the film draws to a revenge story where the protagonist avenges for the desolation from his friend who attempts to kill him and his son, which seems pretty obvious. There isn't much substance in the story and it somewhat drags and is interested in holding the viewers for the star power of Di Caprio with scars and anticipation to be free from the desolation rather than the story. Had the story been tighter and the length been trimmed a bit, the film could have been much memorable.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A stunning film,"THE REVENANT is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Domhall Gleeson.Set in the 1820s we follow the members of a fur trading group who operate under incredibly dangerous conditions. Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is simply plying his trade with the help of his son, and is clearly an individual who is scarred by the events of his past, something we are alluded to throughout the film.One of his expedition partners John Fitzgerald (Hardy) is a passionate man, one who simply wants to be paid his way, no matter what the cost. They are both lead by Captain Andrew Henry (Gleeson) who tries his best to keep order and stability in the group as they attempt to return home.Each actor in this film gives a stellar performance, particularly DiCaprio and Hardy who play two very different but incredibly intense characters which you are unable to take your eyes off. Hardy is menacing, brooding and unforgiving, whilst DiCaprio is passionate and intense in equal measure. If both of these actors don't win an Oscar for their efforts they will no doubt feel hard done by, especially DiCaprio, who gives one of the best performances of his career.Will Poulter also gives an engaging performance as the character of Bridger and Domhall Gleeson, an actor I admire greatly, does well here too. There is also a strong showing from the unknown entity Forrest Goodluck, who plays Hawk, the son of DiCaprio's character. A muted but incredibly polished performance will surely lead to great things for this young actor.Iñárritu directs each of these actors incredibly well and professionally pulls us into this dog eat dog world where no one can be trusted. The cinematography is gorgeous, offering us sweeping, intense shots of the desolate and unforgiving landscape we find our characters within. The decision to film using only natural light was an incredibly admirable choice and one which pays off massively, lending the film an intense realism that is hard to pull away from.My criticisms of this film are few, however I do have some gripes. Mainly with the pacing of the film which at times can be incredibly slow and measured, allowing the tension to build up, which may put off some viewers who are hoping for an action packed DiCaprio romp. The opening is a cataclysm of spectacle, but this slows down very quickly and we move along at a canter until the dramatic moments of the final act. The score on the other hand was a very muted but hauntingly beautiful work which punctuated and complimented every single scene it featured, making up for the somewhat snail pace and long, drawn out shots of the landscape which while beautiful, offered little to the flow of the story except as filler between story beats.The most intense and incredible moment of this film is without doubt the infamous bear scene, which involves DiCaprio coming face to face with the brutal beast in what is a harrowing five minutes for the viewer, one which is both intensely realistic and fiercely brilliant. Without spoiling anything it is one of the most enthralling scenes you'll see this year and the execution of it is fantastic. DiCaprio really showing his incredible acting range in this film, particularly here.The Revenant while slow, is an excellent piece of film making with a stand out performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, which should win him the Oscar he has been striving for all these years come and gone.For more reviews go to www.filmathon.co.uk",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Tom Hardy is equally powerful as Fitzgerald, the antagonist whose actions drive the story's tension. Alejandro G. Iñárritu's direction immerses viewers in the wilderness and the dangers lurking within. This film is not just about revenge, but the struggle for life itself.

One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen,"I was overall thrilled by this movie. I loved the premise and for the most part, the way they structured it. I thought the performances were all earnest and believable. I never really found anyone to be inadvertently calling attention to their performances nor under-performing. Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson especially stood out to me despite Hardy's usual over-mumbles in the beginning. Here it's more appropriate than anything he's done before, so I won't discount him for that.The cinematography was, as you'd expect, stunning. I loved almost every shot. Every time I would see an opportunity to do something cool with the camera, I'd be delighted to see them do exactly that, or more often than not, surprise me with something much cooler than I could have thought of. I felt that they weren't quite able to make some of the longer sequences as seamless as in Birdman, but I was never especially bothered by it - just thought it noteworthy.Beyond the technical wizardry behind the awesome cinematography, I loved how purposeful everything was in juxtaposing the unrelenting consistency of nature against the seemingly important struggles of a few men. While clearly the Alexa 65 and Lubezki's committal to natural light yielded some wonderful colors within his extremely precise frames, I think as usual he excelled most with movement - both of the camera and the subjects within the shot. Everything has purpose and heightens the emotions of the moment. The opening sequence was my favorite part in terms of how it was shot. It may have been a tad flashy, but it worked for me.The action was dope.The CGI bear was dope.The pacing was effective for me. The first act just thrusts you into their world and all of its chaos, whereas the middle of the film is quite drawn out and moves slowly, despite its incessant tension. The third act felt a little inconsistent, perhaps just as a result of the exhausting preceding events...but only just so.On to my problems with The Revenant. I thought the editing was at a few moments just a little too pushy; specifically, the long holds on nearby nature at the end of many sequences. I think some of them overstayed their welcome by a second or two, and maybe they could have pulled out one. That's a nitpick, though, and I might change my mind upon second viewing.Hugh Glass. Like many others have stated, his character is a bit underdeveloped, as is his relationship with his son. I was actually surprised at how late in the movie his son was killed - a pleasant surprise, at that, as I really did feel for their relationship despite their minimal dialogue. I do wish the trailer had omitted that plot point, as it would have been interesting to see as a surprise instead of dreading it for the first hour. This is also a rather minor qualm.The expression of Glass's hunger for revenge just didn't seem quite there for me throughout his struggles to survive. This makes sense, as it works with his focus on surviving since that is what matters in the moment. However, I just didn't quite feel that he was motivated by revenge to survive. Sure, he wrote ""Fitzgerald killed my son"" a few times when he thought he might die, but I never saw that emotion in his performance, the camera-work, or much else.Like many others, my biggest problem with this film is its attempts to reach for something surreal and metaphorical in a very direct, hamfisted manner. I'm referring, of course, to the dream sequences of Glass's wife and son, and the melodramatic manner in which they're delivered.This entire sequence is redundant and out of place in a film that already says so much through more subtle imagery. Everything that is conveyed through these dreams could have illustrated through editing and camera-work - and it largely is, making this even more disappointing. These sequences don't bring anything good to the film, and they are even used to wrap up the conclusion, when in reality the focus of his struggle was regarding his son and himself. His wife didn't need to be excluded entirely, but she should not have been this strange motif boasting references to films like The Holy Mountain.Most of this film's elements seemed to ride the border of trying too hard to create a masterpiece, yet they push just far enough to wow audiences in the right way. Unfortunately, the random absurdity included here disrupts that by wow-ing audiences in the wrong way.Overall, I'd probably give this a 9.4/10. It's one of my favorites of the year and I had a blast watching it. I understand its mixed reviews, but I'm not bothered much by it's few flaws. For me, it lived up to the hype.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Protracted plot and violent floundering exalted by direction, camera-work and 2 fine performances","I tend to appreciate Alejandro G. Iñárritu and I have begun to notice Leonardo DiCaprio's strengths, but I am pretty sure that without vast advertising and multiple wins and nominations I would have postponed The Revenant for much later. But now I have seen it and I cannot say it was boring or disappointing... but no wow! either.Apparently there are still more elements I liked: direction, cinematography, magnificently created scenes (e.g. fighting with bear, riding into the ravine), two eminent performances (DiCaprio and Mother Nature - yes, nature here was no supporting actor, but a leading one), wide use of non-US actors (seemed that US ones were in minority), but its sparse plot stretched into almost 2.5 hours and long staying on violent scenes diminished the total value for me, I felt sometimes that I was watching Discovery channel... Plus the thing that some actors were so ""defaced"" that they were difficult to recognize, Thomas Hardy included; well, the latter is a good actor, but I am a bit hesitant regarding his Oscar nomination for his John Fitzgerald.All in all, Mr. Iñárritu and others knew how and managed to do well, but it is hardly a movie you would multiple times, unless you masochistically try to feel ""abandoned but wild"" while sitting in the warmth on the sofa and ponder on and over how one could survive in the 1st half of 19th century when eating raw fish was not eating sushi and raw meat was no Boeuf a la tartar...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Stunning visuals, tense action","""The Revenant"" is a visual and visceral triumph. There are magnificent landscapes, rushing rivers, raging waterfalls, brilliant skies. You truly feel enveloped by nature and sense the constant struggle that the main character, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), endures as he battles the harsh elements. Nature puts Glass, an experienced fur trapper, through a lot, but his fellow man turns out to be far more vicious. DiCaprio's performance as Glass is truly grueling; he has relatively little dialogue (mostly because he's struggling to survive), but he transmits every emotion in the book as he endures agonizing physical and emotional pain, and ultimately, spiritual enlightenment. ""The Revenant"" has some tense, well-staged action scenes amid spectacular scenery and set to a lush symphonic score. Tom Hardy is pure evil as vicious trapper Fitzgerald, Glass' enemy and the object of his vengeance. Hardy's and DiCaprio's scenes together fairly crackle as these two characters battle it out in some epic fight scenes. Some of the dialogue and plot is hard to follow, perhaps because the film goes for authenticity over clarity in some aspects. However, it offers stark beauty and at times, dreadful terror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Graphically brutal from start to finish, this story is not for the faint hearted!","Graphically brutal from start to finish, this story is not for the faint hearted! If you can't handle blood, graphic killings –of both people and animals–, this film is NOT for you! I didn't actually keep track of the time, but the brutality and bloodshed started at about 3 or 4 minutes in, with the first person to die receiving an arrow to the forehead from Indians invading their camp.Astonishingly good acting from Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, The Wolf of Wall Street) who plays Hugh Glass! Granted, during part of the film all he does is lying down, but even then, the acting he does with only his facial expressions is immensely powerful. Portraying both the physical and emotional pain he's going through with such a gripping performance, I am not at all surprised that he received an Oscar (Finally – he's waited long enough!).Without revealing too many spoilers, I'll try and tell you a bit more! After being attacked by a wild bear, Glass' luck turns from bad to worse, as his crew leaves him for dead. Left with a broken body, and having lost his reason for living, his strength comes in the form of vengeance, the strongest force that pulls him through every obstacle in his path. I don't want to tell you much more, in case I ruin it for you! But if you're into survival films, this one is definitely one you need to watch!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not your average Oscars movie,"The Revenant is, for the most of it, DiCaprio crawling and moaning. Of course, that gets tiring at some point. The movie could, easily, be half an hour shorter, and that would perhaps make it more enjoyable. But also The Revenant is a very ambitious movie. On the technical side, it is flawless, and it uses the natural scenarios, the lights and the sound perfectly. It is even more impressive when you know that it was only shot with natural light! At some points it seems like the plot (which isn't precisely noteworthy) is just an excuse for Iñárritu to shoot a wildlife documentary, because the landscapes are truly breathtaking, and they take a considerable amount of screen time.What is most memorable from this film is, I think, the camera techniques. From extensively long shots depicting intense battle scenes, to clever, smooth transitions between scenes, the use of the camera has become something of Iñárritu's trademark. What I found most interesting was the ways in which he breaks the fourth wall at different points of the movie; from DiCaprio's final closeup to the staining of the camera with the actor's breath/blood. Acting-wise, Hardy's performance is definitely Oscar-worthy, unlike, in my opinion, DiCaprio's (not that he is a bad actor; I just wouldn't give an Oscar to a performance that is mostly, as I said before, moaning and crawling).With its length, lack of dialogue, and somewhat experimental directing, this is not the most usual Hollywood's awards season blockbuster. One would expect the Academy to prefer more discreet dramas in the lines of The King's Speech or Million Dollar Baby, but, who knows, maybe I'm mistaken.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A better title is ""Blood and Snow""","This film should have been edited down by forty minutes. We got the message of man vs. man vs. nature very quickly. Nature is beautiful but cruel, and man in his natural, lawless state is more cruel than that. Sure, the photography is beautiful, and the actors are props, not much different than the CG bear. The only character shown in closeup was Glass/DiCaprio; all the others are blurry, bearded faces given sparse, barely articulate dialogue. The Indian-language words are accompanied by subtitles, but so should have been the words spoken in English. And you could hardly write a spoiler, because there is a resolution to only part of the main character's adventure.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Stunning visuals.,"A film like this is more about the journey. Following along the harrowing struggle of Hugh Glass the Trapper, the outstanding visuals and technical merits of the film are it's strengths. However it did have a decent ending, albeit with a bit of an overly-twisty plot. Inaccuracies and embellishments to the original story of Hugh Glass do not matter too much because the original tale was most likely marked embellished over time anyway. While it was a bit overlong, it is ultimately a very enjoyable epic saga of misfortune, tragedy, and revenge.Tom Hardy, who played the role of Fitzgerald, played the role superbly. The viewer can truly feel a loathing towards him and his actions. Truly a despicable character. Cinematography and the scenes of the surrounding landscapes are magnificent, so much so that it feels as if the landscape is a integral character in the story. It also gives you a sense of how much more frightening the wilderness was back then versus modern day. No one to call and no one for miles. There is no one to trust, and you can be hunted down at any time. You can feel the bitter cold and the wet--as well as the agony of what Glass goes through.The bear attack seemed realistic enough, although a real bear attack is probably even more visceral and gruesome than was on display.Considering the run time of about two and a half hours, I never once started to doze and lose focus, which is an important factor when sitting down to watch a longer movie such as this. Another important factor is the ""rewatchability"" factor if one is considering owning the movie. I would say it has a decent ""rewatchability"" due to the engaging journey and landscapes/visuals. These are the strengths of the film. Not so much the conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Tight,"I can see why Mr DeCaprio got the gig as best actor in this unsettling movie. It is long and torturous/punishing/painful/cutting from the start up. Photog work first class.

Is as good as it gets. Trained bear I don't think so. Extreme CGI most likely. The firearm flintlock weapons are accurate except for Leonardo getting off a few rounds on horseback ( reload skill)?? Now Mr Tom Hardy. He prefers not good guy gigs. Those penetrative steely eyes spooky. His monster chap Bane viz Batman growl is as usual difficult to decipher.

Tom Hardy is indecipherable !,This movie would score higher if it wasn't for the fact that one of the key characters did not appear to be speaking English throughout the film (ironic given his heritage). Someone please give Tom Hardy a voice coach - he rivals the eternally mumbling Casey Affleck in this otherwise overly long but worthwhile film. The cinematography is excellent throughout and the special effects (with the notable exception of the infamous dead horse scene) are extremely well done. It looks quite seamless when the hero hears a rumbling sound and we see from his perspective a distant avalanche that helps create the sense of place and isolation in the film. It is fair criticism that some of the scenes are basically unbelievable but that misses the point of cinema - it is about taking you somewhere interesting but necessarily believing it!,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Brutally beautiful,"'The Revenant' is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and it is a true story set in the 1820s about a man named Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The movie is about how Glass gets abandoned by his partners in the middle of the woods, severely injured, and how he throughout the entire movie, seeks revenge on the people who were responsible for abandoning him. That's about as much as I can say without spoiling too much.This movie was absolutely brutal, there were fight scenes that got me clenching to my seat in suspense, especially the climax of the movie. This movie was also extremely harrowing and emotional, and even more so when you know that it is based on a true story. There were rarely any happy moments or nicer moments where you could pause and relax because Glass' journey was not an easy one, it felt like nature was almost constantly against him.The acting in this movie was incredible, and it is also the movie where DiCaprio finally wins an Oscar, and he truly deserves it. His character is a man with few words, but the acting really shines with his body movement and facial expressions. Tom Hardy plays the antagonist, John Fitzgerald, and, though this isn't the best performance he has given, he does a great job here.Now let's talk about the cinematography. I'm immensely impressed by how beautiful this movie is. There were shots from this movie that I couldn't stop staring at, I was perplexed by how amazing everything looked. And the score for this movie also really emphasized the brilliance of the visuals. The moving camera and long shots that were frequently used were also impressive, and it really makes you feel like your running around with everybody else during the battle scenes. The CGI used in this movie was also incredible, at one point the movie features a bear, and it looks absolutely photorealistic.The only problem that I have with this movie is that the flashback scenes feel a bit confusing and messy, and sometimes the movie can feel a little boring, also due to its long runtime. But otherwise, this movie was superb and definitely worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Emperor Has No Clothes SPOILER ALERT,"Maybe I am the first one to say this but this movie is god awful. If I could give it a negative rating I would. I don't know when directors got the notion that a long movie makes for a good movie. Whatever became of good editing? I fell asleep watching Leo DiCaprio limp through the snow for 2.5 hours. Sure it's a tale of fierce determination, but really, it could have been told in 90 minutes with no loss in quality or character development. I feel that the movie was horrifically bad and would present a strong cure for insomnia. Out of mercy's sake, I would volunteer to jump into the movie and shoot him dead; to put him out AND the audience out of misery. Please note this is not a death threat but only an improvement to the waning plot. The movie is incredibly Hollywood-predictable to make me laugh out loud, even if it's based on a true story.SPOILER ALERT: In retrospect, if I saw this movie again, I would root for the bear. Hopefully the academy has some sense and realizes that they should not agree that this is good cinema just because that's what everyone else is saying...I say that the emperor has no clothes!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Awe-inspiring, but not a masterpiece; a hard to love work of a master, with questions to answer.","I've heard tell of children in the urban West who don't know that milk comes from cows. They've never seen a cow; they just can't see the connection. I don't know if it's an (urban) myth, but it makes a point about the increasingly urbanised nature of our lives. We're cut loose from our roots and rhythms; we have established new ones in the urban contexts, but we're no longer creatures of the earth and dust.The Revenant is a counterpoint to this, a film more in touch with the nature of ... nature ... you could not expect to see. From Alejandro González Iñárritu, the Oscar winning director of Birdman and staring Leo DiCaprio, it tells the story of an 1820s American frontiersman left for dead by his colleagues as he struggles to recover from a bear mauling. It's a brutal, visceral tale of survival and, though this only really comes to the fore in the film's final act, a quest for revenge.Many have said it's brutal - and it is. The Revenant's portrayal of the natural world is of one red in tooth and claw; physical, weighty and oppressive. There are very few concessions to CGI - apart from in the bear attack itself, which is understandable, but doesn't detract from the sequence's extraordinary impact. DiCaprio's character - and the actor himself, presumably - really suffer here. Bones crack, joints grind; winds sweep and howl; cold seeps into every crevice; food is gleaned from the land and from dead animals. The cinematography is nothing short of extraordinary; the cold colours gleam with a tangible frozen bite; the takes are long and fluid, following the movie's central character to emphasise that he's stalked as much by the forces of the land as by his own mortality or people who would do him harm.There's a spirituality here. It's a spirituality of the Native American cultures, one wedded deeply to the earth from which the people draw their life. Tellingly the only reference to Western spirituality is a ruined church being overrun by the elements; the only way DiCaprio's character is going to survive his trial by snowbound fire is abandoning everything he knows - including any semblance of familiar faith - and embrace a mode of being that's at once hostile and essential for survival.Contemporary Christianity has much to learn here. As our planet becomes increasingly urbanised we lose our connection to the rhythms of the pastoral life from which we have drawn our roots. That's not a bad thing - nor a good thing - in itself. It necessitates a reinvention, though; a rediscovery of theology, spirituality and worship that connects to the way we live and is true to who we are and who we find ourselves to be. Sections of the church are wrestling with this; but some still run, crying about heresy or lost tradition. All the while, people thirst for lack of vision.Back to the movie. DiCaprio - for me one of the most underrated actors of his generation - is magnificent here. He's as physical here as he was to very different ends in The Wolf Of Wall Street; long stretches of this film pass wordless, his body and face speaking volumes. He can be a remarkable actor, and his lack of major awards recognition demonstrates how conservative awards judges like to be. They do like their talent to suffer for their art, though, and that alone will probably ensure trophies on this occasion.It's a good, remarkable film. It's not - I suspect - a great one. My sense is that it will not translate so powerfully to the myriad smaller screens on which films are now viewed post cinema release. I may be wrong, but it feels as if the film relies so much for its power on overwhelming you with the beauty and hardness of the environment that the small screen will shrink it in more ways than one. In this era, a great film needs to be great on screens big and small; I suppose we'll all just have to watch it on our phones to answer that one. There are other problems with this film - and the director's work in general. The biggest of these is his treatment of women. Here the women are off-stage, in memory, or a victim of violent rape. They have precious few lines. In the context of a career thus far where his films largely focus on the masculine in different expressions, this gives cause for concern. The director has questions to answer, and they can't simply be answered by saying that what he produces is very good in its own terms. It is; but in the era he's working, he needs to do more with half the human race.The Revenant is remarkable, thrilling, stimulating - and ultimately hard to love. For all that's impressive and awe-inspiring about it (and I use the word awe in its religious context), it's not going to lodge in the heart; it fed my soul, but if I tried to live on it I'd be in trouble.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
'On est tous des sauvages' ('We are all savages'),"Oscar winner for best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), best director (Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and best cinematography (Emmanual Lubezki), THE REVENANT is an epic production and in truth Nature is the leading character. The film is a visual spectacle, the themes of survival and for love between a father and son are moving, but this is a long song and requires endurance on the part of the viewer for sitting through 156 minutes of repetitious gore and raw natural elements. The film is based in part on a novel by Michael Punke, and the screenplay is by Mark L Smith and Alejandro G. Iñárritu.The film may be excessively long but the story can be quickly summarized: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved family (his son Hawk - Forrest Goodluck – dies on the same trip). Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.The hunting troops are well portrayed by Tom Hardy (very difficult to understand his mumbling accent), Domhnall Gleeson. Will Pouster (a very talented young actor), Forrest Goodluck et al. But the overwhelming power of the film is the depiction of man in Nature and the concept of survival against all odds.

"Game of thrones meets "" the good, the bad and the ugly"" ....","The scenes in this movie are breathtaking, when you see Hugh Glass crawling in the wilderness, you tend to ignore Hugh for a moment and look at the picture perfect scene.

I am not sure why Leo was casted, any other actor would have been as great since there were not much of dialogues. But then again, actors like Leo can help give a movie good opening but the rest of course depends on the movie itself. Anyways, coming to the movie, i did not find anything great in the movie except the scenes which were of course natural. The pace is slow may be too slow, the story is okay but nothing great. Flashbacks failed to elicit any emotions other than again slowing down the movie. Leo will finally win an Oscar for the movie i think but personally i would have imagined him winning an Oscar for a movie like Aviator or The departed which were based on the actors and without the actors those movies become weak.

A Cinematic Tour de force,"The Revenant really is a cinematic tour de force. The landscapes and vistas in this film are just gorgeous to look at but at the same time it's a very raw, gritty and gruesome experience. I think the Revenant puts a final stop to pointless arguments that 35mm film is better than digital cameras. Originally planned to be shot on film they decided to shoot 60% on Arri Alexa XT's and 40% on Alexa 65 (65mm size 6.5K sensor). The colors are vibrant but natural, and the play of light and darkness is sublime. Also the absence of film grain (an advantage of shooting digital) removes the veil between the audience and the captured images. I bet when this comes out on Ultra-HD in HDR that this will be a reference disc often used to demo the capabilities of those OLED flatscreens. Soundwise we're in for a treat as well. The rumbling of waterfalls, the roars of the bear and rustling of the wind through the trees is brilliantly mixed and mastered. There are 630 VFX shots in this film and I can tell you, you might spot a few but most are perfectly executed and absolutely invisible. The scene with the bear, might god...looks so real. As for the acting, an Oscar well deserved for Leo. And Tom Hardy is quite excellent as well. So a movie I very highly recommend, though it is as harsh as it is beautiful, it surely is one to put on the bucket list.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A revengeful survivor story set in a terrific landscape.,"A revengeful survivor story set in a terrific landscape.It's beautiful to look at from the word go but it's a painful to see the protagonist coping with adversities and becoming a hero. It's a story set in the 19th century so there are horses for commuting and stones for making fire. Yet, the theme is universal and so it can be considered a contemporary story with a couple of centuries old backdrop.I went to see the film for two reasons, the director Alejandro Inarittu and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and both seemed to in good form although not in their prime form. Nevertheless, that's enough to make a good film.Technically, the cinematography is top notch and the production design is terrific. The whole crew has to be complimented for working a whole film in such a drastic and unpredictable weather and landscape. The editing could have been more precise. Too many frames of nature, I felt and I hoped for more characters than nature. Makeup is amazing and I suppose it's makeup and costume design is one of the finest I saw in recent times. What disappointed me was the screenplay. This film seemed a bit stretched out and predictability killed the fun. When you know, the path and also the destiny, there is no fun anymore and this film showed me both after few minutes into it.Leonardo has invested a lot of his time and his physical transformation and fearless acting tells why he is one of the finest actors ever. I got my money worth, solely by his performance. Though for me his Aviator, Blood Diamond, and The Departed are his best, this performance stands tall too.Overall, it's a well-written film but 20 minutes short, this would be a great film. As it is, it's fine for me.A 3/5 for a good film, but once again full marks to Leonardo DiCaprio. Respect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not your typical movie,"--There are no spoilers in this review--Im writing this review for one specific reason: I want viewers to know what they're getting into. Im gonna start this off by saying if you haven't already watched the trailer, do yourself a favor and don't watch it. I feel like the trailer is kind of misleading. At least it was for me. The trailer made the movie seem like a very action packed movie. If someone explains this movie to you as an epic revenge tale, don't listen to them. Yes, there are some very good (and beautifully shot) fight/action scenes in here, but it's not what drives the movie. This movie is a very realistic survivor story. Probably the best survivor story i've ever seen. It is full of great performances. Leonardo DiCaprio was great in the movie. He doesn't have very much dialogue, his acting is very physical. But that actually just made his performance even more impressive. Will Poulter was also good in the movie, but for me Tom Hardy was the scene stealer. Evey scene Tom Hardy was in was in my opinion great. And I also think he was the best and most interesting character in the movie.This movie is also one of the, if not the best shot movie I have ever seen. You may have heard by now that the director shot this movie in entirely in natural light. And it really payed off. Also the shots in this movie goes on for a long time. There aren't very many cuts which was very cool and impressive to see. Like I said: this is probably the best shot and one of the best looking movies I've ever seen.If you're a lover of cinema you've probably already seen this movie, if not why are you still reading this review? Go see it! And if you're just a casual movie viewer you'll probably also like this movie. You just have to know what you're getting into which is: A very realistic survivor story with great acting and great visuals.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

I don't see how this movie is so appealing to the masses. There is little acting, other than the portrayal of pain.

"Horrible, awful, boring, ""movie""","*warning may contain spoilers*I really do not understand the good reviews. I had to stop 3 quarters into this joke of a movie. No story. Bunch of killings. The star character (Dicaprio) has more souls than a cat. He gets mauled by a bear yet can walk, talk, and survive. He survives with drenched clothes in the freezing wilderness. He Flys off a cliff, and you guessed it, still lives.I love Leo, and no words can describe my utter disappointment. The story is non existent, only killing and killing and killing. One native American looking for his daughter, one white man looking for revenge maybe? Or just trying to survive, and another white crook who killed his son.Spare yourself, unless nice shots and graphics is all you care about !",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A visually stunning movie,"Though I love historical and period epics as well as westerns, for some reason I had never gotten around to watching this movie until now.Finally putting it on I was treated to quite a visual feast with some superb performances, notably DiCaprio's as the lead.We are forced right from the outset to feel the nature of the elements in this extremely harsh environment as well as a bleak and unforgiving period in time. A superb fight sequence takes us through a kind of 'single shot' story as the camera pans and twists though the bloody violence unfolding in front of us.This carries through the movie, and in each subsequent scene you are kept on edge wondering who will come out on top (as we have a number of groups in pursuit of each other).Yes the movie is bleak, but if you want dancing and fun go to see Barbie. Here we have an animalistic fight for survival and a story of pure revenge undertaken in stunning surroundings.One question for me is how does the protagonist survive and even start to recover from the horrific wounds (suffered early in a 'famous' scene), without any modern medication or treatments. But that's a small gripe.For me the time flew by, from what should be a long film. Enjoy this rollercoaster on a big screen for best results.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Masterpiece.,"Prepare to be transported into the raw and unforgiving wilderness with ""The Revenant,"" a cinematic triumph that will leave you awestruck and breathless. Emmanuel Lubezki's mastery of cinematography is on full display, capturing the rugged beauty and brutal challenges of the frontier with a realism that is both haunting and hypnotic.From the opening sequence to the final frame, every shot is a testament to the power of visual storytelling. The use of natural lighting creates an atmosphere so authentic you can almost feel the chill of the snow and the warmth of the campfire. The camera movements are deliberate and immersive, pulling you into the heart of the action as if you're a silent witness to every struggle and triumph.The visual effects and CGI seamlessly blend into the landscape, enhancing rather than distracting from the narrative. The editing is sharp and purposeful, propelling the story forward with a relentless pace. And the color grading, oh, the color grading-each frame is a painting, evoking emotions that words alone cannot convey.But it's not just the technical aspects that shine; the story itself is a masterclass in tension and human resilience. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Hugh Glass is nothing short of mesmerizing, conveying a depth of emotion through silence and expression. Tom Hardy is equally compelling as the antagonist, bringing a complexity to his character that lingers long after the credits roll.And let's not forget the score, which serves as the heartbeat of the film-haunting and evocative, it weaves its way through the narrative, amplifying the emotional highs and lows.In summary, ""The Revenant"" is more than a movie; it's an experience-a visceral journey that challenges the senses and stirs the soul. Prepare to be captivated, moved, and utterly spellbound by this modern masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An Instant Classic,"I will start by saying that this is possibly the most AMAZING looking film I have ever seen, every shot/scene is perfection, all the work put into this to shoot in natural lighting etc. really paid off.I saw it on the big screen and my wife and I were engrossed from beginning to end. After seeing what Glass goes through in the first third of the film you really feel his struggle and determination.The story is good, although a fairly simple one and is based on real life events. There is nothing complex here just a good survival/revenge tale which I think is all is needed here.A lot of reviews I've read say that nothing much happens in this film, but I have to disagree. It is a long film and a good portion is spent watching a man struggle, but it never becomes boring as you feel you are right there with him thanks to the amazing camera work. You also meet new characters along the way and there are a few tense action scenes littered through to break it up.Since the cinema I have watched it 4 more times and my opinion hasn't changed. It looks amazing, sounds incredible (you need a good home theater to appreciate it) and is very well acted and told.The soundtrack is awesome as wellThe Revenent will stick in my mind as a classic filmDo yourself a favor and watch it if you haven't already",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Thecnically good... but noting more,"The performances were excellent (Di Caprio does deserves the Oscar this time), the pictures and filming were awesome and everything in general about this movie was ""correct"". But the plot just wasn't for me. In the second this movie started, I wanted it to end; and since I was watching it online, I watched it at 20-minutes intervals. Boring is not the right word, and I feel like this movie wasn't exactly slow. I think my problem with The Revenant is that I didn't care. I didn't care about what was going on or what was going to happen, because I simply didn't feel attached neither to the story or to the characters. I like action movies, but not when the only thing that happens is basically our main character struggling in the edge of the death for TWO HOURS. I just needed more plot, something interesting going on, and not just Di Caprio making pain faces and surviving in un-human, impossible and almost ridiculous ways. I couldn't relax or actually get into the story during the hole movie. ¿Awesome performances? Yes! Good pictures and scenarios? Of course! It deserves the Oscar's nominations? I guess so. It was ""correct"", and I actually don't regret even for a second watching this movie, it's obvious all the hard work that is behind The Revenent and the watching is worth it just for that.But yeah... like I said before: not my kind of movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Stunning cinematography but with some weaker elements,"Superb filmmaking involving long takes, lots of ground level action, close ups, characters as grisly as the bear they encounter.The story features themes of solitude, family, survival, loss and rebirth. The story plays out against a backdrop of greed, savagery plunder and violence as a spiral of destruction sweeps across the film.The film favours natural lighting as well as great set and costume design transporting you back in time. The landscape is stark, bleak yet beautiful, the cinematography is gorgeous, pretty as it is though the message is that the winter wilderness is deadly and our protagonist must battle against exposure and the elements throughout the film. The only time the relentless winter really lets up is in the dream sequences. The film features a subplot too about some French baddies who kidnap an native American woman.If I'd say anything negative about the film then it would be our hero is implausibly lucky throughout which begins to shatter your suspension of disbelief at a few points, especially the part of him falling off the cliff into the tree. The overall story also becomes fairly predictable with it's fair share of tropes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"The most mind-bogglingly overrated film in a long, long time","The Revenant exists only as Oscar-bait, and I have no doubt that DiCaprio deserves the award for such a brutal role in tough conditions. However, the rest of the film serves absolutely zero purpose, has no deeper meaning, barely any story beyond the struggle for survival, and almost collapses under the weight of its own self- importance. This is not the first time that the story of Hugh Glass has been brought to life, but its certainly the most alienating and depressing.We've seen this struggle done before. Tom Hanks in Cast Away is a lasting example of an actor putting their body through hell and going full-on cave man. Cast Away also dealt with the themes of loneliness, sanity, and the need for direction. In the Revenant I knew almost nothing of the inner workings of Glass or Fitzgerald (a rather over-rated Tom Hardy performance). Glass seems to cope just fine with being alone (the pretentious hallucinations of his family only puzzled me), but I have a feeling that this was not the intention. As for direction (within the movie, I mean) it is noble that all of it was shot on location but there is no sense of space or place. We never know where any of these characters are in relation to each other. Every new location looks different from the last but we never have any orientation or a grasp of the greater landscape. All it would have taken is a five second shot of a map with any random character saying ""here we are, and this is where we are going"".Alejandro González Iñárritu's pompous style of long, long takes is completely inappropriate for this material and it took me out of the movie every time he tried to pull it off. I don't want to believe I am watching a documentary. I want to be excited and feel tension. The bear attack scene was brutal, but I would have felt more fear and anxiety had it actually be edited than done in one long shot. This kind of direction is not the antidote to Michael Bay's 1000 cuts in a minute nonsense. It was a mistake to shoot the film like this. Totally unnecessary.As for the cinematography, a lot of people are praising it but it left me unimpressed. I admire the fact that they fought to shoot it all under natural light but almost every shot was wide and flat, wide and flat, wide and flat, wide and flat. Not once was I in awe of any spectacle or breathtaking natural beauty. Attenborough documentaries are shot better than this and spend less time on indulgent cutaways. Perhaps the grain and texture of 35mm could have fixed this.If you want a one man against nature story of survival then watch Cast Away. If a grisly tale of genocide against a new world backdrop is what you are after then Apocalypto is much better. The Revenant bored me and I walked out of the cinema immensely disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
directing and cinematography,"Same guy who directed Birdman -- so the directing is superb, with great camera angles and shots. Very realistic film. I felt like I was watching an excerpt from this Hugh Glass's life, with nice sweeping orchestral music in the background.Also a good look at the bad history between the white men and native Indians of the west back in the day in America.But in terms of the plot -- this is one of those rare films whose plot isn't really the main aspect.

And while there is not that much actual dialogue throughout the movie it does not need it because the events that happen in this movie speak more than dialogue ever could.Another thing I would like to say is that Leo definitely earned his Oscar win for his performance in this movie, his win was long overdue.

"Unremitting, implausible, impressive","Leonardo wins an Oscar, finally, but for what?Endurance, probably. And that goes for the audience too, in this long, unremitting tale of implausible survivable in a hugely impressive setting.This film is an oddity. The Cinematography is peculiar in several respects. Many of the panning shots are notably using a wide angled lens which shows as distortion at the edges. (IMAX?) The camera is seen several times as participating in the action. For example - blood and breath appearing on the lens, the actors actually crashing into the camera during the last fight sequence and Leonardo breaking the fourth wall at the conclusion. There are additional sound-track artefacts that serve no other purpose than to irritate.Then there is the plot. This, disappointingly, is utterly implausible. The idea that anyone would have survived such a Grizzly Bear attack at all, never mind in the freezing conditions and without medical intervention is pushing its credibility beyond limits. The ability of the lead to survive and recover requires an impossible suspension of disbelief. So, as you are you are watching it, you are constantly saying, ""not feasible"", ""oh come on"" and ""you must be friggin' joking""...And why, BTW, did the Director insist on Tom Hardy's character's dialogue be utterly impenetrable? We should have had the foreign language subtitles for his character too.The whole premise of the film, revenge, was left lacking as we neither cared whether any of the protagonists lived or died (except one death, which occurred fairly early).You were, while watching, thinking, ""Wow, di Caprio suffered for his art while filming this"". Of course that was a problem, as you should have been thinking, ""Wow, 'lead character' managed to survive all that!""

Freeze and Oscars go together!,"The Revenant is mostly known as the film that gave Leonardo Dicaprio his long waited Oscar after a career filled with one awesome performance after the other, but it is great and by itself ,even though as for accuracy falls a bit out, however the rest are spotless.The film follows Hugh Glass and his team as they venture out to the eighteen hundreds West in order to get furs and during their travel they get in to a lot of trouble and he is badly injured (you know how) a member of his team will play dirty for the group to leave him to die in this cold and inhospitable place.

The Revenant-User review,"The Revenant, directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful epic that tells the true story of Hugh Glass, a fur trapper who survived a brutal bear attack and treacherous journey through the wilderness in the early 19th century.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a tour-de-force performance as Glass, bringing a depth and nuance to the character that's both captivating and heartbreaking. His physical transformation is equally impressive, with DiCaprio enduring extreme conditions and performing many of his own stunts to bring authenticity to the role.One of the standout aspects of The Revenant is its breathtaking cinematography. Emmanuel Lubezki's camerawork is stunning, capturing the harsh beauty of the wilderness and the brutality of the bear attack in a way that's both visceral and awe-inspiring.The film's themes of survival, redemption, and the human spirit are equally powerful, with Iñárritu and his co-writer, Mark L. Smith, crafting a narrative that's both epic in scope and intimate in its character studies. The supporting cast, including Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, and Will Poulter, deliver strong performances that add depth and complexity to the story.The Revenant is also a technical marvel, with impressive production design, costumes, and sound design that transport the viewer to the early 19th century. The film's use of natural light and practical effects adds to the sense of realism, making the viewer feel like they're experiencing the events of the film firsthand.Overall, The Revenant is a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling that's both visually stunning and emotionally powerful. With its outstanding performances, breathtaking cinematography, and epic scope, it's a must-see for fans of historical dramas and adventure films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The one who came back from the dead to avenge.,"The movie was inspired by the real event that sets in the year 1823, United States. When one of the crew members of the hunters left behind after he was severely hurt from a bear attack, he desperately looks for a way to get back to the camp alive, especially to avenge for the death of his close one. The whole film was about survival in the wilderness and to avoid the native Americans. But the introduction in the opening was very brief and in the final act, it was another brief man hunt. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie for adults with some gruesome scenes.The movie was made on a grand scale. Well written screenplay, good direction, the cast, music and the locations, but it would have been even awesome if it was true to the original occurrence. I felt it was cinematically overdosed, especially for the commercial purpose. The fans of Leonardo Dicaprio's overwhelming celebration created a huge buzz. In fact, it looks like the entire Hollywood is his fan and the Oscars given to him out of sympathy, because I have seen his best performances better than this in the past.The length of the movie was a big concern, should have been at least 15 minutes shorter. But the visuals were fantastic, the CGI bear was almost flawless. There are plenty of reasons why this should not be missed, at a time the narration lacks the realism. Otherwise, it would have made a wonderful semi-documentary film. So don't have high hope on this, especially if you're no ones fans, but just love watching movies like me. A little bit overrated everywhere, but still this movie is good, just good, that's it, not a masterpiece.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Brutal and raw,"There has been a lot of hype about this film with much talk of Leonardo DiCaprio's dedication to his performance, and the brilliant Tom Hardy lined up next to him it certainly sounded like it was going to be an epic and epic it was, in a few different ways.The moment the film starts you're taken back to the early 1800's in the cold and desolate landscape of Montana and South Dakota with breathtakingly gorgeous scenery and an almost endless vista. You can literally feel the coldness oozing out of the screen. Long lingering shots are plentiful, with a slow and powerful soundtrack combining to make the films overall pace seem somewhat sluggish at times (with a 2hr 36min running time it could have been comfortably shorter). Putting that aside the story does tick along and there are plenty of tense scenes which keep you on edge and focused.The gore though, wow there is a LOT of gore in this film. Whilst I'm sure it's very realistic it can't be described as anything other than brutal. Some scenes are literally a brutal onslaught and are often difficult to stomach, not what I was expecting. The cast were first class, DiCaprio immersing himself in the role to an incredible level whilst Hardy playing his slightly crazed character in that incredibly satisfying way only Hardy can. The two of them work together perfectly.Up for many Oscars this film is certainly worth of the nominations, this is one well worth seeing but just be aware of its stark brutality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It should have been between 4,5 and 5,5 stars without any doubts.How can people be excited about it? Seriously, I have never written any reviews ever before all these years I have this account in IMDb but l just couldn't stand it. I had to say it and warn others.

"Strong, but too brutal for my taste","Most are already written by reviews of this movie here. Most words are already used, and many good reviews as well. Therefore will I do this review short about what I experienced as negative with this in many ways very great movie. The story is good and the action is intense. Lenoardo Di Caprio make an amazing effort. My objection to this movie is the brutality. For my part, it was all too much violence and brutality. This violence lasts throughout the film, and makes one gets tired of watching it. I think that this story fine could have managed without the explicit violence scene, even the famous scene with the bear that attack. That makes this movie difficult to watch, and I think that it may be too violent for many. There is not anyone who can stand or withstand to see such things, and this review is therefore a reminder to these, and the film should be considered carefully. Beyond that'll probably be many awards at this forward, and it will maybe be considered a classic in the years to come. The environment this film takes place is in is beautiful filmed.

Not deep but beautifully crafted,"As I anticipated this film had me filled with worry I didn't believe it could live up to the greatness of Birdman, Alejandro G. Iñárritu's previous film. Could the hype of this movie crush it since it's production problems were so publicized? Thankfully The Revenant is one of the best movies of 2015. I was floored by how amazing everything in the film was. It's the one of the most immaculate films to ever be released.The Revenant stars Leonardo DiCaprio who plays frontiersman Hugh Glass who is left for dead by the crazy Tom Hardy after being mauled by a bear. He goes on a trek to find Hardy and get his revenge. It's no shocker that The Revenant is one of the most beautifully shot films my eyes have witnessed. Everything felt vibrant and pristine from the Woodlands to the Snow that covered the entire frame. Emmanuel Lubezki always brings his A game when it comes to creating beautiful images, even when it's for trash like The Cat in the Hat. This is by far the best work from him I've seen and the man has done Gravity and Birdman! He keeps stepping up and makes every frame a painting.The story is a gritty revenge tale that holds no punches. I haven't been this tense in a theater since Mad Max Fury Road. It made me perspire at some of the scenes, especially the bear mauling scene. That scene could have been ruined for the fact that the bear was CGI but given that the rest of the film was practical gives the bear realism to it. Iñárritu's direction is flawless in this movie. You feel Leo's struggle and you have his blood lust as he tracks him down. He's the 2nd best actor of 2015 (Sam Jackson is still the best in his amazing role as Marquis Warren in The Hateful Eight, another brutal movie set in the snow.)While it has all these amazing things there are some minor problems with the movie. There'd be times where a character's mouth wasn't synced up to their lips. You could say that's a nitpick and it kind of is. The rest of the film is a technical marvel that impressed me a lot. I wouldn't be extremely mad if this movie won Best Picture at the Oscars. (I am actually kind of mad because Carol wasn't nominated!)The Revenant is the most tense film I've seen in 2016. This film won't be for everyone but it's shot so beautifully and told so tensely that I can't recommend it enough. While Leo's performance isn't his best it's definitely a performance of anguish and perseverance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Zero for originality,"OK..... where to start.... If you know nothing about movies and have no prior history of film history, then you'll think this is an awesome, gripping and original movie.... But.... if you've seen Jeremiah Johnson, A Man Called Horse, Dances with Wolves, .... and can place them in context/their time you can cleary see this script is a total ripoff of those movies (eventhough it seems to be based on a book) and only has the great camera-work going for it. Those other movies were groundbreaking and had phenomenal actors. This one is not, but young moviegoers will probably be fooled. DiCaprio really tries to prove himself as a great actor in this movie, I'll give him that.... but he fails miserably.... proving he doesn't come close to the likes of Robert Redford, Newman, Brando,.... not by a long shot... Christian Bale might have kicked ass in this role though....

However, the survival aspect and the setting make this movie stand out from others. The performances of dicaprio and hardy are amazing and the oscar was definitely deserved. If there is one thing i did dislike though, it is the fact that the movie kind of drags on. I think it could have been shorter and that the runtime was a bit too long.

With a winning cast and a beautiful setting, this movie had a lot going for it from the start. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are a couple of the best in the business. I'll watch almost anything these legends are in. This historical western is about survival in a time when fur-trappers and Indians had confrontational encounters in the wild. We see Hugh Glass battling to survive winter's harshness, Indians, other fur trappers, and even some among his own men. But most of all, in one of the most gruesome animal attack scenes I've seen, we see Glass get tangled up with a grizzly who leaves him almost as good as dead.

Everything's good but it doesn't work so much!,"It's hard to evaluate a film where I liked a lot of aspects but still it did not convince me in its entirety.It's not the first time a thing like that happens with Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.Trying to perform an ''objective'' analysis I can say:1) The photography is simply amazing. 2) The direction is always a high level one when it comes to Iñárritu. Here he does not propose a (fake) global sequence-shot like in Birdman but he alternates masterful long-takes with intense close-ups, confirming his great talent 3) The editing is remarkable 4) The acting (which hardly ever interests me) is excellent, especially the antagonist (Tom Hardy) works fine, so when you have a good antagonist and a protagonist as DiCaprio (at his best) the job can't help being good 5) The plot proposes many issues, all meaningful (father-son relationship, racism, violated rights of Native Americans, the struggle for survival, Nature, solidarity between ethnic groups in conflict, revenge), perhaps too many to be condensed into a two and a half hour film.I think what works the least is that Iñárritu's directing style does not go hand in hand with the narration: they are not symbiotic and you can perceive the dystonia.To give an example in order to understand you can think of Audioslave: an extraordinary guitarist (Tom Morello) and a terrific singer (Chris Cornell) have never really worked out as a group, never reaching the level of RATM or Soundgarden anyway.It is therefore a missed masterpiece, but it works just fine at a movie theatre",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"A tough and raw story of adventure, survival and desire for revenge, being inspired by real events.","In the early 19th century, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), his explorer High Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), and the rest of the fur trapping expedition are attacked by a group of Indians. The few members of the group who manage to survive flee with the skins on a boat. Abandoned by the crew, Glass attempts to cross the desolate wasteland with only one idea in mind: revenge; and especially against a damned enemy, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). They left him for dead, he wouldn't forget it !. They just couldn't find the time to bury him. They should have done it. The savagery of nature against the will of a man. He is dead, they thought. He is dead, they hoped. The man who was left for dead. Join his wild fight. He could make it out alive. Left alone to die. . . His only thought was to stay alive. One who has returned, as from the dead. Lost blood. Found life.Relentless revenge and a crude fight for survival are the main pillars of this interesting film. Loosely based on the book of the same name by Michael Punke, it narrates the difficult days on the brink of death of a real person, Hugh Glass, a trapper and explorer from the early 19th century about whom there is very little verified data, thus there is no record of whether or not this prominent historic figure had a wife and children. DiCaprio's character is based on real mountain man Hugh Glass, and one of the two men left to await Glass's death was a very young Jim Bridger. This story was also previously adapted into another good film: ¨The Man in the wilderness (1971)¨ by Richard T. Heffron with Richard Harris. Due to the success of The Revenant (2015), which sparked growing interest in this film, Warner Brothers released The Man in the Wilderness on Blu-ray on August 16, 2016, as part of its Warner Archive Collection. And the central theme 'one man's fight against the natural environment across a dangerous snowy landscape' was also dealt with in other films, such as: 'Jeremiah Johnson (by Sidney Pollack)', 'The Man Called Horse (by Eliott Silverstein and also starring Richard Harris)¨ and ¨The Return of a Man Called Horse (by Irwin Keshner)¨. In Revenant 2015 there are many strong scenes and lots of cold-blooded deaths, and despite some bloody images and various acts of violence, the film is rated PG-16. Stunning performance stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a brave fur trapper, left for dead after a bear attack, who recovers and pursues his former companions through risky Indian territory. His portrayal of Hugh Glass earned him numerous awards, in addition to the Oscar and the Golden Globe. He personally performed the stunts, doing his perilous own stunts, without stand-in. Another great protagonist is Tom Hardy, nominated for an Oscar for his role as the evil John Fitzgerald, giving an adequate performance as the hateful Fitzgerald. DiCaprio and Hardy are well accompanied by excellent supporting actors, including the following: Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck, Paul Anderson and Kristoffer Joner.This The Revenant (2015) was the winner of three Oscars (director, lead actor and photography) and three Golden Globes (dramatic film, director in a dramatic film and actor) in addition to many other prizes. Also noteworthy is the excellent soundtrack by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto, as well as the spectacular and multi-award-winning photography by Mexican Emmanuel Lubezki. Well directed and co-written (along with Mark L. Smith) by Alejandro G. Iñarritu (Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful, Birdman), who offers an impressive and colorful story. Rating: 7.5/10. Leonardo DiCaprio fans will really like the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

That bear attack scene was truly horrifying!,"From a narrative standpoint, this may not be Iñárritu's strongest showing to date, but that does not make the film any less compelling. The stunning visuals, combined with incredible soundscape, propelled the story to a befitting finale.While the journey had a few ups & downs along the way, the director's vision and the overall tone remained intact and they seemed to propagated quite an intriguing tale of vengeance/survival that foreshadows oppression, the cruelties of colonial powers, and ultimately their unpreventable consequences.As for the performances, Leo is phenomenal, which did not come as a surprise; I could see it coming from a mile away since I have yet to see a bad act from him; he gets into the skin of his character, as he always does, and like always he's absolutely fantastic in his part and he plays it with utmost passion and dedication.But it was Tom Hardy who wowed me the most! I know he's a capable actor with a wide range, but what he's done here is nothing less than exceptional, and I believe he ought to be acknowledged as well.P. S.

Confused with feelings about this film,"From one side the movie made with very close-to-real picture that showed how thing where at that times. The way the camera shows nature, like dirt, snow, rain and the way that camera shows people, how thy live - simply amazing. Very good job for camera and realistic picture. Very nice Dolby Atmos sound effects.From other side story is very simple, old and bored: pain from loosing close people then revenge from a ""superman"". Jesus. So boring. Only camera, picture and costumes made me watch it till the end.Regarding the play of main actor - Expressing physical and psychic pain with the same face mimic almost all time of the movie ...That can do almost every person in the world. You don't need to go study to be actor for that.Verdict: Worth to watch it. Worth Oscar for picture, camera work and production. Worth Oscar for the main role - if it goes to the bear, but not to Di Caprio",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Very long movie,"Hardy the best, DiCaprio second, the rest of the cast not nearly strong enough to match their performances. It seems that all the money was spent on two of them and no more was left to hire other decent actors. Storyline very, very hard to believe. Director clearly loves nature and delivers many beautiful scenes. He seems to be much more comfortable shooting nature than human scenes. The mindset is very modern and director is not even trying to take us back two hundred years ago to the life of American fur trades, but presents more or less present day understanding of how the things should be from the moral point of view. Beautiful, but not very engaging.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A Boring, One-Note Slog","Revenge may be a primal human drive, especially in the setting and time period in which ""The Revenant"" is set, but it makes for a very boring narrative hook if you don't give a hoot about the person seeking revenge or the person that person is seeking revenge against.Alejandro G. Innarritu's latest exercise in human misery is two and a half hours of Leonardo DiCaprio suffering capped off by a showdown that finds him getting what he wants -- the death of the man who left him for dead after being mauled by a bear and then killed his son. Does Innarritu use this story to bring any insight into the human condition? Are we given any reason to care about DiCaprio's character other than a couple of obligatory flashbacks that use narrative shortcuts to tell us that he had a wife who was killed? Could the villain, played by Tom Hardy without a hint of nuance or subtlety, be any more of a caricature? Innaritu directs every single shot with a self-conscious sense of self- importance, as if he's pausing to say to the audience, ""Just wait and see how impressed you are going to be with my directorial skill."" Too bad it all adds up to such a boring, one-note slog.DiCaprio will win what everyone seems to think is a long overdue Oscar for this performance, despite the fact that he's given the same performance in his last ten movies and he's asked to do no more in this one than grunt, moan, and grimace his way through it. Every time I hear anyone talk about how brilliant he is in ""The Revenant,"" the focus is on how difficult the shoot was, not how well he acted the part. Honestly, the brilliant makeup work is 95% of his performance.""Birdman"" was the first Innarritu movie I've really liked, and it looks like that was an anomaly. His philosophy seems to be predicated on the belief that human existence is something to suffer through until one finds a reward in the afterlife. Since I don't believe that at all, his movies have nothing to say to me.Grade: C",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Better still, if you can forget that this is supposed to be based on true life (which I think was a mistake, this movie works better as a purely fictional story) and suspend your sense of what is possible - you will most likely enjoy this film.It is a beautiful movie to look at if nothing else.I say watch it and make up your own mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Leonardo DiCaprio at his best,"I can see why The Revenant got nominated for the Oscars. It's beautifully shot with top class actors. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy both stand out in this adventure movie. It's for sure one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best acting performances. Even though for a movie that long there is not excessive much talking you never get bored. Au contrary there are a lot of silent passages that add to the feeling of loneliness in those winter scenery's. There's a lot of grunting from the diverse almost deadly wounds. It all works perfectly well to tell this story of revenge and vengeance. There are some graphic scenes that could make your stomach turn, but that also makes this movie stand out from the rest. You can almost feel the frostbite just by watching it. Tom Hardy plays a stone-cold heartless son of a bitch and those roles fits him the best.

50/50,"It's hard to say exactly what went wrong with The Revenant.On the one hand, excellent camera work, beautiful views, the picture pleases the eye. Great acting, Leo and Tom are amazing! And the soundtrack complements well, and the whisper scenes come through.But on the other hand, all this is just boring to look at. 2.5 hours pass very slowly. The main character is open enough to worry about him every time he is in danger, but not enough to not get bored for the entire time.It is not clear what the director wanted to do, this is not an art house, not a movie with a deep meaning, and even the attraction from 'The Revenant' is weak.About Oscar DiCaprio - he rightfully deserved it! In this film, you can especially see how he literally goes out of his way to play Glass believably.The biggest problem is that I have no idea how this movie could have been made more interesting. I strongly disagree that the movie should be more believable. The plot revolves around the fact that the hero must survive in terrible conditions. I think the only right way out is to shorten the timing.All in all, a very uneven film. When compared with the same Robinson Crusoe - the story is very poor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Revenant is a gruesome gore blended with the right dose of beauty.,"Grisly and grizzly is written all over it. The biopic that carefully walks on the edges of jaws of death that Glass managed to return from, couldn't have possibly ended up being more complete and perfect.""My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands.""Aforesaid escapes Hikuc's mouth, a Pawnee who happens to the protagonist amidst complete chaos. He walks in and out of his life like a savior whose only intent seemed to resuscitate his dead and pass on the above rad message.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a genius behind the lens. Right from the very beginning you can't help but notice how he walks you amongst the characters. With clean close up shots taken right next to individuals he lets you stay with them, feel the angst, the immediate pain and empathize. His famous long uncut shots are persistent here as well as they complete big takes without breaking the flow. His genius can be seen in parts where the camera swifts gorgeously between pumped-up killing characters on the battle ground and stays on the ones living till their death knell resounds. He even captures breath-gasps on screen by giving a proper follow up to its characters for emphasis.Leonardo DiCaprio is downright exceptional. To say he ate real bison liver and slept in animal carcass would be to say the least. He wears the skin of Hugh Glass like a pro. There is a constant tension he carries throughout the movie where his brows barely relax and rarely speak of relief. The bear mauling bit is one jaw dropping memorable scene that will forever haunt us in our dreams. To fight right to the moment of being incapacitated was something he aced to perfection. The aftermath of the attack where he loses his vocals, speaks with a wheezing sound, hisses and coughs whilst talking, drinking and eating, are all marvelously mastered.The Revenant reeks of heart-melting pathos. One of the saddest bits in the flick is when Glass crawls his way to his son's cadaver. He stops twice whilst doing so taken aback by the sight of the blood and the corpse as he puts his head on his chest, and says:""I am not leaving you, son. I am right here.""If you wish to see pain personified, behold Leo's eyes! Period. To watch him gnaw on that Bison liver whilst knowing it was the real one, couldn't help you feel sorry for him. To see him get under the quilts of horse flesh naked to beat the cold and all odds, was how you would have wanted the Glass story to be like.Watching The Revenant is like watching the enthralling head of Emmanuel Lubezki. Tranquil frames visit one by one amidst the crawling story, engaging you with its magnificence. Shots of winter ridden trees, capped mountains, frozen leaves, dewed branches, bubbles of water sluggishly moving 'neath the river, cloudy moon shots are all badass results of Lubezki grandeur.The Revenant is an intriguing affair with nature. You behold the might of nature in the biting cold, the hailing storm, big slaps of relentless water that take the protagonist down (water-shot was brilliantly taken as well) and animal savagery in the punishing snow and feel them tingling your bones. It celebrates gore fights where fingers get chopped off, ears plucked off, heads lanced with arrows. Downright brutality! In all that barbarity, there is beauty lurking in its originality. The way things happened has been given precedence. That's what makes it special and unique. It is a cold blooded biopic, played outrageously well by its ingenious actors.Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy can't be ignored either. He isn't all evil, but with one knee in perversion, he could have been anyone put in a dire situation. But he was the one insinuating trouble from the very beginning, trying to justify his act by pointing ""you blinked"" and attempting to put justice to his killing act. Tom Hardy plays John extremely well with his brilliant accent, and thoughtful eyes that he carries whilst giving explanations.Bridger is a character that could have been any one. So Poulter plays him with perfection. A little kind to begin with, yet overpowered by power. Not exactly wimpy either but a stone trampled down by Fitzgerald, left without a choice.The music of the flick is apt. Complements the sadistic theme the flick runs on. It is uplifting in a way, always suggestive of the imminent revenge lurking in the corner. Screenplay is confined, but is no doubt great.There are brilliant well-thought of parts strewn all across the movie. Hugh's dreams are quite poetic. They are well supported by whispers and a majestic backdrop that impart meaning. The music there too supplements it. Little things like, a bird escaping from the heart of Glass' wife signifies her soul leaving the body. One time when Glass is hungry as hell, he sees a herd of deer crossing the river. He imagines he has a rifle, points the stick at them and signals shooting them. Such games of despair! As the movie concludes, we see the wife of Glass conjuring him, ultimately leaving him alone yet again. It was a perfect way to end it. A typical Inarritu finish that leaves you with questions! The aforementioned is suggestive of how eager Glass was to visit his wife, but he is bereft of death once again. Sheer amazeballs!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Visually Awesome! Mundane Storyline! Bear Scene is Epic! Overall Worth Watching!,"The one thing that really got me thinking upon completing this film is, how did DiCaprio know that this was going to be a good movie? I can't imagine anything about the script would cause an A list actor to jump on the role. It's essentially a vengeance type film (someone wronged/killed you or your family)... this film adds the extra element that the hero has to achieve this while being on deaths door and has to drudge through insanely beautiful terrain to do it. Also to note, the bear attack scene is unbelievable! It's the best CGI I've ever seen. Anyways, did DiCaprio go to a psychic, or maybe I'm just missing something? I would love to know what caused him to choose this role? I can imagine he wanted the challenge of doing something different from anything he had ever done before. With one of the big challenges in this role being very little dialogue and having to rely on facial expressions etc. Very difficult role and he was excellent as always (I'm not sure if this will get him the best actor nomination, but it may). I can imagine one of the motivating factors was, Dicaprio had just completed Wolf of Wall street, which I wouldn't be surprised if it holds the record for the most dialogue for a character in the history of cinema. So DiCaprio now jumps completely on the opposite side of the spectrum in this film.Overall this movie is worth the watch for most people. As I said, the plot is very simple, but the visuals are perfect.Some nit picks, which has spoilers. Watching the hero of the film drudge around in constant pain gets to be kind of draining. I can take it for a little bit, but dude! And when Hugh (Dicaprio) eventually catches up to the villain dude... I understand they want to make it suspenseful, but to me it comes across really lame and cheesy when everything for the most part had taken the straight arrow realistic movie style to that point only for it to result in your typical hero meets villain final fight scene, with back and forths with both people getting stabbed and beat etc. Hugh had been spot on with the gun up until the final scene where he grazes the villain at point blank range. Now we get to watch Hugh take more abuse...oye very!!! I would have rather the suspense revolve around the villain breaking away from Hugh to were it seems as though he just might be home free only for Hugh to do something drastic in order to find him and/or catch up with him. No need for corny back and forths.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Heart Racing Extravaganza,"I don't know if I've ever wished for a movie to end so many times that I enjoyed as much as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's newest outing The Revenant (2015). Fresh off an Oscar with Birdman (2014), Inarritu continues his trend of a natural unstoppable force constantly pressing throughout his films. A force so strong that it won't even allow us to breathe. It is also worth mentioning the progression from Birdman, a dark comedy mostly centered around the ways which we present ourselves to others, and The Revenant, which replaces all of the dialogue in Birdman with brutal moment after brutal moment.The films structure calls to mind thoughts of Gravity (Cuaron, 2013) lying mostly on its protagonist dealing with just about every single thing that could go wrong going wrong, initiating with the now infamous bear scene. While Gravity seemed to replace interesting story telling with these humongous set pieces, The Revenant uses these constant natural disasters to help supplement the spiritual journey that Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) endeavors. In an interview with Variety, the film's director spoke heavily about the two tiers that the story revolves around.Being both beautiful and completely brutal, this film will rip into your mind and leave you with mental and emotional scars all too similar to that of the main character. Inarritu collaborates again with Birdman cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who once again has proved he is an absolute geniuses with the camera. Whether he is a 'mad' genius is up for debate. The themes of the unbreakable human spirit in the film seem to mirror the production perfectly. Shot in entirely natural light, sometimes only shooting for an hour a day to find the perfect light, the film went through tremendous difficulties to perfect Lubezki and Inarritu's vision, and it pays off marvelously .While the image is completely breathtaking, The Revenant seems to have its weakest aspect lying within the screenplay itself. I by no means am saying that having little dialogue hurts the film in any way, in fact it enhances it, but when there is so little dialogue when it arrives it needs to be cutting and important, and most importantly interesting. Now the dialogue by no means is boring, but it does not reach the same peaks as the technical aspects of this film.As relentless as this film is, it seems as if this was an earlier cut of the film. By that, I mean that it seemed as though there was still needless moments that only heightened tension for a moment but ended up not contributing to the overall necessity of the movie. I never got bored, but there were certainly moments where I thought to myself 'alright, this needs to pick up the pace!' When every minute feels like three, because the pain is so real, it's hard to sit through any moments that seem redundant.The Revenant is brutal, gut wrenching, and painful, yet beautiful and endearing. It was probably the most visceral film of the 2015 season.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

If you like a movie that can put you to sleep watch this movie.,"This movie is only good for the scenery. If you want two and a half hours of scenery and seeing a man grunting and crawling, you should watch this movie. If you value your time and want to watch something worth watching in your two and a half hours avoid this movie. After one and a half hours the same person is still crawling and groaning and breathing heavy. I edited it as so many scenes take so much time and there is nothing but scenery. Then you get back to groaning and crawling. This movie should have been a 45 minute movie but it is a painstaking two and a half hours. Go to the last 30 minutes after the first 30 minutes and maybe it is a redeemable movie. This movie is so boring that an insomniac will fall asleep with all of the groaning and snoozing and grunts. I could easily edit this movie to 30 minutes and nothing would be lost and at 30 minutes it would be interesting.

Add to this hypnotizing music of Ryuichi Sakamoto and you have a perfect movie.I suppose DiCaprio will again lose the Oscar, taken into account his opinion on the ""members of the Academy"" (yes, bunch of moldy mummies that lost the touch with common sense, taste and reality long time ago), and he deserves one for every role he's taken by now.

Beautiful but Emotionless,"Gorgeous, for sure. The natural lighting and the camera's ability to seemingly reach unreachable locations is continually breathtaking. But dammit, I didn't really care one bit about this. I've always found it difficult to connect with the characters Inarritu creates. There's a sense of detachment with every single one of his films, as if I'm being told a story by someone who I don't really want to hear a story from.As a survival story, it's fun. I enjoyed all the various obstacles placed in Leo's way on his journey back home. It became a perverse sort of enjoyment after a while. And the action scenes all have a thrilling quality to them that felt visceral and real and painful. If it took itself a little less seriously and just embraced its greatest qualities it could have been a wild ride akin to Mad Max.For me, in the end, I think it fails completely with the father/son relationship, the relationship upon which the whole movie relies. His desire for revenge made logical sense to me, but not emotional, and the finale felt anti- climatic as a result.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Stunning to look and boring to watch,"Let me first start off with the technical skills, Leonardo's performance etc. are remarkable to say the least.IMO this was just a multi million, dollar, epic, revenge flick. Leo deserves an Oscar for this considering what he must have endured. However, what we are expected to believe in surviving , not just one, but two bear attacks.Another issue was distancing me from the reality of the film. There were far too many camera lens fogging up . Why they used such close lens's was a big mistake. When a bear gets right in front of the lens for it's close up , why would they think it a good idea for the image to fog up.Tom hardy still amazes me by his changing appearances in everything he does. But what the hell accent was he trying to do.For me, this was equivalent to ,THERE WILL BE BLOOD, which I found as boring as watching paint dry. It also suffers with the same lack of musicality which is Nonexistent. In short there is no way any human could survive such torture.AS bored as I was it will grab picture and actor which is deserving.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A story of survival triggered by the powerful desire for revenge.,"I must admit that going to see this movie, I was expecting prolonged boring scenes to serve the purpose of brutal loneliness in the wild. However, the opening scenes of mini battles between native tribes and the fur trapping squad, the theatrical method by which the director captures these moments drew me right in. Certainly the director with his cast and crew members spared no effort to depict man's merciless battle over the riches of one land, the rawness and brutality of how far a man would go to survive death even if it was on the expense of another man's life.Without a doubt the director's decision to shoot this movie in the hostile wilderness made the movie what it is and helped the actors rise to the state of mind of the real life characters who lived that same rawness and hostility.What intensifies this piece of great work are the two gravely talented actors, Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy, playing Hugh Glass and John Fitzegerald. These two continue to excel and prove that they are indeed the best in their generation. Leo with his amazing utilization of his body and face to portray the character's agony, despair and finally determination was behind yet another Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy,on the other hand, as John Fitzegerald shows off his humongous acting skills with the use of his eyes and voice, as the rest of his face is covered in this big beard, to create this unyielding, rugged and sometimes seemingly unstable character, that also won him the appraise of the academy with a nomination for best actor in a supporting role.The movie would not have been the same without those two men.The Revenant has been nominated for 12 Academy awards including best picture, best lead actor and best actor in a supporting role and I am rooting for this movie in all these categories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Brutal and Raw,"I have always been a fan of films featuring the American west in the 19th century but this movie was something else. The action takes place against a bleak wintery landscape. The violence between Indians and fur trappers is grim right from the beginning with quite a high death toll in the first 30 minutes of this excessively long film. The violence is probably one of the most realistic portrayals of this kind of conflict in cinema history. Sadly, the characters are rather one dimensional and we can't really warm to any of them.

One of the worst I have ever watched,"I heard of this movie before i went to see it.. and as everyone said it is a great film I where really looking forward to see it (especially as the trailer is quite good).Well after I have watched it now, I have to say this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen! It is unbelievable long (the boring way of long) and there are more logical errors than in all movies I have watched before combined. This features superhuman strengths, sudden changes in depletion level and more.Everyone who knows a little bit about survival and bush-crafting will have the strong desire to leave the cinema instantly.So from my side: Don't waste your time, don't watch this one",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
DiCaprio's best performance to date!,"This movie exceeded my expectations in just about every single area possible. The cinematography was visually stunning, the characters were very well thought out, and the directing technique was amazing and innovative. It was filmed in natural daylight to really make it feel as realistic as possible. During a few times in this movie, I just stopped and imagined how cold it must be on set. It was filmed on set in parts of Southern Argentina and British Columbia. I certainly think DiCaprio deserved the Oscar for this performance. The bear scene is a little bit hard to watch at times, but overall I would say this is a beautifully made film. It fully deserves all three Oscars it won, and I would recommend this movie to anyone likes an epic, captivating movie. it is by no means the best movie I've ever seen, but it is certainly going to be one to remember.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Alejandro G. Inarritu achieves an amazing feat in filmmaking with this stunning survival story,"Just as the protagonist in his latest film, Alejandro G. Inarritu had to struggle and will himself in finishing this ambitious project. The production experienced numerous setbacks with locations, switching of producers, cast and crew members suffering from hypothermia and an overblown budget. This had me worrying that the project was just impossible to make. Inarritu pushed through and the eventual end result is the complete vision of a genius creative mind displaying some of the best filmmaking I've seen in a while.The Revenant is an intense and visceral viewing experience based on the true story of Hugh Glass's survival story in the frontier of 1823. The screenplay of Inarritu is pretty straight forward: a group of fur trappers, including Glass, are finishing up their deployment when Hugh gets attacked and mauled by a grizzly bear, leaving him near dead. His fellow trappers see no use in trying to keep him alive and eventually leave him to die. Remarkably, Glass survives and vows to take revenge on the trappers that left him for dead. In the Revenant, you follow Hugh Glass on his incredible survival journey through the dangers of hostile natives and the forces of nature itself. The reason this movie works so well is because you truly care about its protagonist, played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio. He further displays his incredible range as an actor in playing a role with minimal dialogue, with parts in the native American language as well. This physically demanding role forced DiCaprio to show the internal rage and struggle of Glass mainly through his facial expressions and body movements, and he does so exquisitely. All of the acting performances were impeccable including Tom Hardy, who plays a fellow fur trapper John Fitzgerald and matches Leo's intensity in every scene. Domhnall Gleeson, who plays captain Henry, impressively holds his own alongside these two acting heavy weights in mediating some of their interactions. Another addition to his remarkable resume of 2015. I was surprised by Will Poulter's casting in the film, as his young career consisted mainly of comedic roles. However, he gave a solid performance as the young and earnest trapper Bridger. Credit Inarritu for getting great performances out of all his actors and achieving good chemistry between them.Another great achievement of the film is the unbelievable cinematography by Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki. Here, the man is on top of his game, showing that he is the best cinematographer working today. Throughout the movie, he only works with natural light created by sunlight and fire, and uses them beautifully. The movie looks stunning and features gorgeous landscapes, long takes to heighten intensity and meticulous camera-work. Noticeably in the opening battle scene, which is one long intense take where the camera point-of-view switches between different character perspectives. Some of his trademark low angle close-ups were even used during these scenes where water, spit and blood would find their way onto the camera lens. In addition, the composition of some nature images were reminiscent of his work in Terrence Malik's ""The Tree of Life"" and fitted nicely during the spiritual parts of the movie.The score by famous Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto is rather understated but used effectively to convey pain and despair. The sounds of the cold wind, snowfall, streaming rivers and mud are already sufficient to make us feel like we are suffering alongside the characters.All aspects of this film were done perfectly, whether it was the sound, visuals, the costumes, acting or editing. This all results in a unique film viewing experience I've never had before, transporting me to the ice cold frontier. This all was topped by the awe- inspiring bear attack scene, which is already turning iconic in the film industry.All in all, the Revenant is a great achievement in filmmaking, thanks to the passion and sacrifice of all the people involved. As Leo stated: ""Suffering is temporary, film is forever.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A masterpiece,"Amazing movie.The atmosphere and photography were amazing. Plot and suspense as devices to ""driven ""art are terribly overrated. A movie ( or a book) don't even need a plot to work ( in fact we have several examples of non plot driven director and writers, just out of my mind Cassavettes and Bunuel) atmosphere is much more important.The criticism of the movie saying it lacked suspense says more of the spectator than of the movie itself. If you are expecting suspense from every source of art you partake in soon enough you will be disappointed. There is a limited amount of stuff that can astound us. Great plot driven movies are very very very rare.In fact the modern audience is much too spoiled. They not only expect never ending entertainment (complaining that the movie is slow even if takes little breaks from action) but also have a high expectation of ""twists"" and meaningful endings.This movie goes directly into cinematic history greatness, it has a dash of everything.

a very intense visceral flm,"I'll avoid spoliers. I've spent nearly five decades studying western North American history and prehistory with stints teaching prehistory and native cultures at the university level. I sat to watch fully expecting the film to be the usual Hollywood historical sloop. Instead I found myself riveted to the screen. The cinematography was incredible, the soundtrack unforgettable, and the performances uniformly wonderful. There were a few historical inaccuracies but not many. Some reviews complain about the slow pace. I didn't find pacing remotely objectionable. Just be prepared to witness a story well told. Pacing in deliberate and the film is laced with symbolism that is apt to be missed by those unfamiliar with The Ashley Expedition, the intense rivalries between American, British, and French Canadian fur trapping companies; and the history of the wars among the northern plains tribes after the Sioux moved west from Minnesota after c. 1780. The Sioux, Arikara, and Pawnee hated each other, and their fighting is depicted in many films, notably Dances With Wolves. The film isn't hard to follow. It's intensity makes it unsuitable for those with squeamish stomachs. I think it's one the best films of the past 20 years.

Very weak story line,"I used to live in Northern Canada so I definitely enjoyed the visuals in the movie but even that pleasure was lessened by inconsistencies. One minute DiCaprio was walking on flat land with no mountains even in the distance and then boom he was in the mountains. Unless two weeks had passed that could not have happened. The story line was incredibly weak, just too many coincidences and inconsistencies. Even to the James Bond style of leaving the hero almost dead but without finishing the job. We have to be able to suspend disbelief to enjoy a movie but it was very difficult to do that with such a weak story line. It was nicely filmed and there was some stunning scenery but that could not compensate for the weak script.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not boring,"I love Leonardo DiCaprio, and after hearing how great this movie was & all the awards he won, of course I had to see it. I was not disappointed. I know some people said it was boring, but it kept my interest all the way to the end. I thought the bear scene was really well done, it didn't look like a cartoon like you see in a lot of movies with CGI. He didn't talk a lot throughout, but he was still amazing. I think it's movies like this, you really get to see just how good of an actor they really are. Kind of how Tom Hanks was great in Cast Away, even though the whole thing was just him on a stranded island by himself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A worthless film.,"Translated from 3rd January reviewExcellently acted, directed and filmed (especially filmed), The Revenant didn't however manage to captivate me once in its 150 minutes. Which means I had a lot of time to think about ""Why?"". It's because such a movie is useless to our world.The story isn't interesting, or new, there isn't a single theme that wasn't presented in the exact same way in a previous film. You won't see any new ideas or techniques that would justify the making of this film except that they wanted to make an Oscar film. The director wanted to show off his skill, the same for the actors and technicians. So, they found an old story that would let them shine AND which traditionally catches the eye of the Oscar crowd. It's true, they added a modern angle to the treatment of the indigenous population by the white invaders but, it's nothing special either. I don't want this review to be negative. Tom Hardy gets completely lost in the role of Fitzgerald. DiCaprio is again fantastic in a slightly unusual role compared to what he played in the last few years. Where he played more verbally than physically. (Screaming his way through half of those films. Hugh Glass is a tragic character, a survivor, beaten down by the world of 1820's, not one who pumps his chest, getting ready to take on any adversary in his way. (Yes I'm talking about The Wolf of Wall Street here). Directing is, again, excellent. Inarritu demonstrating that he can also direct calm, somber and atmospheric scenes without dialogue. But, if it weren't for Emmanuel Lubezki, the movie wouldn't look, or flow nearly as well. Those in the sound department also pull their weight marvelously. It's very difficult to capture that feeling of solitude in the wilderness, but they managed to do it in this film. You can really feel the cold, the dampness and the loneliness, wherever you are while watching The Revenant. I don't want to take away from The Revenant any one of these technical achievements but that's the problem: it's a lot more of a technical spectacle than a story worth telling than a great film. Sort of a Transformers for the Oscar crowd.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"A brutal, emotional, fantastically unique, and ultimately rewarding experience","There are many people in the world, and there are many films in the world. So, it only makes sense that everyone's definition of a good film would vary, and that everyone would watch a film for different reasons. Most people watch movies for fun. To kill a Friday, to be entertained, to laugh a little. Fewer watch films to experience the craft of it all. To follow the Oscars, to admire cinematography and direction, and to take in all the things that make films great. Until I saw ""The Revenant,"" I believed that those were the only two reasons worth discussing, as they were the two most prevalent in our society. But this film is not just for entertainment, nor is it something to watch just to feel smart. The Revenant is viscerally powerful and terrifyingly real, and something entirely new that I've rightfully heard called ""visual poetry.""Maybe it's the breathtaking, masterful cinematography - ambitiously and successfully crafted using only natural light - that categorizes this film as such. Perhaps it's the direction, which causes everything about the film to appear so seamlessly realistic that the audience is forced into the world as if we are experiencing its horrors right along with the characters (most unique and effective is Iñárritu's purposeful emphasis on the camera: at three points, Hugh Glass fogs the claustrophobic lens with his breath, and during the perfectly envisioned ending, Glass stares right into the camera, all the pain and suffering he has felt represented in his eyes as they stare, haunted but finally peaceful, straight at the audience). And maybe its the performances, so unbelievably nuanced and emotionally devastating by DiCaprio (gunning for an extremely deserved first Oscar in perhaps a career-best performance), Hardy (in the conversation for a very worthy first nomination in a wonderfully villainous but 3-dimensional role) and Gleeson (proving once again to the world that he's the next DiCarpio by appearing in four Oscar-worthy films in one year). Whatever heavenly combination of sheer craft, storytelling capabilities, and divine intervention brought this revolutionary film to the screen, I am eternally grateful. It is not simple entertainment, although its narrative is riveting. It is not your usual Oscar bait, although any and all Oscar wins would be monumentally deserving. The Revenant is what happens when every aspect of film is brought together perfectly and seamlessly constructed to create one horrifyingly real but astronomically memorable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great Movie,"Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. His part in this movie was very, very well played out, he made you feel that he was actually suffering from the pain that he received.Watching Leonardo go through things he did made you feel lucky that we don't need to live the way they did back then and fear that any moment, your life could end. Tom Hardy's role was also played well, watching his role, he made you feel that you need to jump through the screen to help Leonardo to seek his revenge.I will not say much, but I could watch this movie again. I know that this movie will be one of the best movies that will be out in 2016.This is a very must watch film. I will also give much of the credit to the Director for making this feel real.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Bleak, unrelenting and beautifully shot film about man against nature","""Man against nature"" reaches the ultimate boss fight with this bleak, unrelenting and beautifully shot film about real-life fur-trapper Hugh Glass and real-life acting show-off Leonardo DiCaprio. The direction is by Mexican virtuoso Alejandro Iñárritu, and he goes about the job with about the same single-mindedness and stubbornness that Mr. Glass himself ultimately displays. Iñárritu drives his film forward, often with more insistence than storytelling as his protagonist goes from mishap to mishap in the American frontier. Had the film not been completely humourless, it would have been very hard not to find Glass' amount of bad luck comical, which perhaps helps explain why the film is so drained for almost anything that isn't about Leonardo DiCaprio's immense and complete physical performance. That being said, there is a lot of merit in how Iñárritu is able to bring nature, and the interplay between it and Hugh Glass, to the forefront. Rarely on film has mother earth been rendered as more of a force than it is here. It's almost a character in its own right, and it's not the film's least accomplished one either. Because unlike the antagonist Fitzgerald, mother earth both giveth and mother earth taketh. And thank god for that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Best Film Of 2015,"I'm not one to call a movie a ""perfect 10"" but ""The Revenant"" turned out to be my favorite film of 2015, and my favorite film of at least the last two (if not three) years.Dark, violent, unrelenting, and disturbing, ""The Revenant"" is also staggeringly beautiful, hopeful, exhilarating, and deeply moving.And these seemingly conflicting emotional notes in fact go hand in hand. Only recently released (it's wide debut was last weekend, as of my writing this), the film is already underrated, and this is one of those rare movies I really expect to grow in stature over the years, not diminish.Despite mostly positive reviews, many critics are being way too hard on this one--I suppose that's not too surprising. It seems like something this great can't help but find critics looking for things to nitpick (not to mention totally misread and misinterpret) about.I'm sure you already know the general plot line, so I won't even bother recapping it. But there's so much more to The Revenant than meets the eye (and there's nonstop stunning imagery to meet said eye!) Beyond some of the most dazzling cinematography I've ever seen (Innaritu's previous Oscar-winner, Birdman, turned out to be only a warm-up for this one in that department), beyond a classic revenge story, and beyond the uniformly fine performances (DiCaprio's best to date) is a morally pertinent, narratively ambiguous, and spiritually uplifting vibe unlike any other film I have seen.Don't like seeing movies on the big screen? Make an exception for this one... Do yourself a favor and make an exception... The movie completely immerses you in it's world (bereft of cartoonish CGI or silly 3D glasses) and you are in the pioneering west for the cost of your ticket... The camera swoops and swirls and puts you in the middle of some truly spectacular action sequences. Every frame looks like a postcard. The most ambitious nature documentaries don't capture the beauty of nature as well as this film does (I suppose Emmanual Lubezki should probably start working as DP for nature documentaries) with it's use of real locations and natural lighting.The sticking point for critics seems to be that the film lacks subtlety. While it's true that The Revenant is rather blunt and uncompromising in its brutality, it's equally ambitious and ambiguous in it's spirituality... And goes further than the typical survival story in depicting man's perseverance in the face of adversity.Most survival stories depict people overcoming nature's cruelty... This one depicts man's own moral failings as part of nature's cruelty. It's not just a marauding bear or brutal weather Hugh Glass must overcome, but his own moral failing in desiring revenge. Glass' primary motivator for staying alive is also what could ultimately do him in. The same is true of his adversary Fitzgerald.It all adds up to a film that is visually astonishing, emotionally wrenching, and hits you on every level. A genuine must-see, and a truly great film, deserving to go down as a classic. It reminded me of Kubrick's best work, and that's no small compliment.A true epic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Cold, harsh and lonely tale of survival","In the frigid wilderness of the Dakotas, a band of frontiersmen who gather pelts (animal skins) for a living, are suddenly ambushed by a Native American tribe with many being brutally slaughtered while the rest escape on a boat. This opening sequence of Alejandro Iñárritu's adaptation of Michael Punke's 'The Revenant' is among the most thrilling since The Gladiator's opening. This tale of one animal trapper's horrifying experiences in the harshest of environments is as tedious and unforgiving as the surrounding environment and it forms the perfect allurement for juries of various award ceremonies who dig the silent, solitary performers. This might indeed be Leonardo DiCaprio's long awaited Oscar but certainly not the most deserving one.After narrowly escaping the ruthless onslaught from the natives, the frontiersmen decide to head to their outpost, Fort Kiowa. Unfortunately though, in a brutal encounter with a mother grizzly bear, Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is gravely injured, making the group's journey a laborious task. The Captain offers a reward to those who would take the responsibility to bring Glass to the Fort and so his son Hawk, Bridger (Will Poulter) and the ever confrontational Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) drag Glass over ice and hills until greed, apathy and selfishness within Fitzgerald leave Glass alone in the wilderness with barely the ability to walk. Apart from the bone chilling weather and lack of food, he must now desperately find shelter from the Arikara tribe. The fates of every character are linked. The tribe's chief is in pursuit of his kidnapped daughter Powaqa which leads to them crossing paths with Glass' company. Fitzgerald was once scalped by some natives and his undying hatred for them leads him to mercilessly murder Hawk. Glass, though helpless for much of the movie is driven by rage and the need for retribution which turns into a desperate hunt when his company discovers Fitzgerald's betrayal.The sun never shines with hope for anyone in the story. From diving into the icy river full of rapids to finding shelter inside a dead horse's carcass, Glass faces nature's harshness as he takes each step in perpetual agony resulting from his injuries. Being mauled by a ferocious bear can never lead to a speedy recovery but in 1823, being abandoned for the dead, it just makes things a bit more challenging.There is no doubt that Leo's performance showcases a solid commitment that anchors the film firmly. However, with fewer dialogues than any of his movies to-date, his silent performance strongly indicates all but one emotion; anguish. For over 2 hours, we are subjected to a helpless, abandoned and weak Hugh Glass who trudges along gradually, with barely the resolve to help overcome his pain. The depth of his coldness is second to that of his surroundings that are harsh and brutal to any survivor let alone one who was mauled by a grizzly. At times, his survival is aimless and desperate while there are subdued emotions portraying his desire for vengeance. Prolonged sequences of such dullness can be engaging for serious cinema enthusiasts but the rest will have to be satisfied with the stunning white backdrop of Canada and Argentina that are supposed to match Dakota and Montana back in the day. While this must've been an enormous challenge for Leo as an actor in those harsh environments, it certainly isn't his best show. Muttering, yelling and grunting lack the appeal of powerful dialogue delivery that Leo is renowned for. Tom Hardy is impressive as the cunning betrayer and with his thick accent and rough appearance, is even difficult to identify.Director Iñárritu's vision for The Revenant was very personal even though it drew inspiration from Michael Punke's novel. The opening sequence involving the raid by the natives, the grizzly attack, the sweeping shots of mountain ranges, blizzard conditions and even close ups of the actors emoting make for some powerful narrative. Filming during particular hours in the day just for a grim effect is the hallmark of a passionate filmmaker and Iñárritu deserves the nomination for his efforts. However, his overlong, tedious, cold and savage tale of survival and determined vengeance must rather make way for the survivor on another planet that offered more inspiration and entertainment.7.431 on a scale of 1-10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Wonderfully Crafted,"The Revenant is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. The opening scene alone will make you wonder how the hell they did this. There are so many creative shots with sweeping camera angles and beautiful vistas. For that alone I'd recommend seeing it.As the story goes, its based on true event. The real story of Hugh Glass is an incredible story about the will to survive and the need for revenge. The Revenant portrays that very well. At times it's brutal, savage, and unforgiving, like what frontier life was probably like in the early 19th century.The acting is all well done, from Dicaprio as the lead to Hardy as the villain; they were all convincing. The only knock I have about this movie is the pacing and length. I knew going in being familiar with the story that there were going to be slow parts, a wounded man clinging to life and traveling through the wilderness was bound to have slow parts.Visually alone, I think most cinemaphiles will have a lot to like about this movie as well for people who are interested in the the time period.

Reved up with this one!,"Acclaimed & Oscar-winning filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu went from a Birdman seeking redemption to a Frontiersman seeking revenge. His latest stellar work comes in the form of ""The Revenant"". It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the aforementioned 1800's frontiersman named Hugh Glass who seeks vengeance against his fellow frontiermen who left him for dead after a bear attack. I guess they could not bear seeing Glass in such pain or maybe not. Glass is made out of thick glass with his focused resiliency to get those who did him wrong. Let's just say that he has viable justification to be an angry man. Oh, and as far as his marital status: he once had a love and it was no gas, soon turned out it was the heart of Hugh Glass; sorry for that ""Blondie"" moment there. Anyways, Inarritu marveled with his courageous direction of ""The Revenant"". His script of the picture, which he co-wrote with Mark Smith, was a revelation on revenge; but this movie shines more with the physical than the verbose and that is its brilliant makeup. Two-time cinematography Oscar champ Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki presented what is probably one of the most breathtaking photography I have seen in a motion picture with his work in ""The Revenant""; y no estoy chivando! Now to Mr. DiCaprio! It is one of my favorite Leo performances and it is his most impressive physical thespian effort of his illustrious career with his Glassified offering.

A great movie,"Great movie. After a movie in my opinion overrated (Birdman), director Alejandro González Iñárritu last delivery in a decent prize work. The Revenant is not 100% plan sequence as the trailer could fail to understand, instead alternating between small parties in this style and in normal courts or with spotlights on the stage, which makes the experience of watching it much more dynamic, satisfying and without saturation. Long Photographic is excellent, with amazing scenery, and all featuring the characters be very good. Leonardo DiCaprio, even without a lot of lines, is once again amazing in the role of protagonist, giving all the emotional charge needed for a character so full of feeling, the largest being the rage. Moreover, it is not only DiCaprio worth mentioning, Tom Hardy is very good in his role as antagonist, and Will Poulter surprises in its performance, even with a character who is not very well worked during his screen time, he can add ( and) charisma and other elements on a solid, lucid performance. The whole concept of the story is engaging, not needing much time to the viewer Imerse completely in the narrative, but the way how it is developed further help in this regard. But nothing is perfect, on the one hand the construction of some characters is very good, the other is bad, Hawk (son of DiCaprio) is a character who just seems to be there to cause trouble in no time becomes very clear if there a motif defined for it, or if it is simply stupid. The film's soundtrack also does not please me, leaving much to be desired, and in some part to annoying.

A film that should win Oscars once award season is here especially DiCaprio.,"I tend to see him more on People Magazine while working at my local supermarket more so than I would like to but I have still always enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio since the early 90's when he started his career. He is an actor willing to put himself in the big spots and as he has worked with famous directors like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino or actors/actresses like Johnny Depp or Meryl Streep and Kate Winslet, it shows he is doing something right. His latest film The Revenant follows the same positives along with some similar themes of his previous work.Based off real events and set in 1823, Hugh Glass (Dicaprio) gets attacked by bear on a fur expedition. What follows is a survival story dealing with the themes of revenge, climate issues and the stylings of a western. A wilderness film trying to showcase life in the 1800's.DiCaprio is usually the dominant character in every movie that he is in and The Revenant is no different as this is all about DiCaprio. Using very little dialogue at times and coming from famed director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who uses these VERY impressive close ups and single shots, DiCaprio seems to be always in your face here. From the times his character is in pain to expressing emotions, DiCaprio is top notch and he can do it all. A type of personality that DiCaprio has never played before and being that's it's such an original storyline, it is one he will likely won't play again.DiCaprio is the main piece but this cast has more. John Fritzgerald (Tom Hardy) is Glass's enemy and a character that brings revenge into the story. Hardy plays the role so well he's almost as good as Dicaprio. Played by actor journeymen Domhnall Gleeson, Captain Andrew Murray is a character who is the next closest leader to Glass. Even in the smaller roles, there are recognizable names like Luckas Hass (so underused though) and upcoming star Will Poulter.The Revenant is so different from what we see every Friday. The type of style that I wish we saw more of. Something that just make us look forward to more Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu films.

After watching Mad Max: Fury Road, I thought no other film would be able to top it this year, but The Revenant is right up there with it.Let me start by saying that I have not been a fan of Iñárritu in particular. His films are generally not my cup of tea –even though his talent is undeniable. This time around, however, he truly outdid himself and actually showed that he can soar at the same heights as Kurosawa himself.The Revenant is a revolutionary piece of film-making in how they managed to use natural light, breath-taking camera angles, incredible action sequences, long shots, stunning locations and previously unseen special effects.The pace, length and rhythm of the movie are exactly what they need to be for an epic tale of this magnitude. The performances by the entire cast are memorable, and Lubezki's camera-work is peerless.In short, I find it hard to recall a movie as engaging, realistic and groundbreaking as The Revenant. Beyond its technical mastery, the cast, crew and writers managed to deliver a powerful message about the power of nature, human will and love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Reverence for The Revenant,"If like myself you have been desensitized over the years by watching countless movies with blood, gore and violence and can now watch the beach scene during Saving Private Ryan as though it was an episode of Sesame Street, then prepare yourself to feel your pulse quicken once more and that urge to raise your hand to cover your eyes from the horror.......the horror. Those moments that are hard to watch but even harder not to, are here, this time in the form of a very upset 300kg grizzly bear and Leonardo DiCaprio's face. The realism of this scene is incredible...I'm still trying to work out how they filmed it......maybe it really happened and they've patched Leonardo back up somehow. The Revenant, based on the TRUE yet unbelievable story of frontiersman Hugh Glass,(1780 – 1833) is a survival revenge flick. The camera work is some of the best I've seen om film, it flows effortlessly like a ghost on the breeze, taking you up and close and sometimes closer than you would like to be. These shots are often juxtaposed with some truly beautiful and hypnotic images the wilderness. A great cast of actors including Tom Hardy, who doesn't look like Tom Hardy again and has to be one of the best British actors of recent times. I knew he was in this movie and I still didn't recognize him at first. He plays the hillbilly you'll love to hate and is excellent throughout this epic odyssey. Leonardo DiCaprio does some of his best work in this movie and also eats some truly disgusting food ( even Rambo wouldn't touch ) in order to portray the realism of his character. As he crawls over 200 miles towards his salvation spurred on by his revenge, you will feel every grunt and groan that his half dead corpse is capable of producing. Surely he deserves an Oscar, if not only for best actor but for best stomach. The Revenant is as uplifting as it is traumatic and like his previous movie Birdman, director Alejandro González Iñárritu has a gift for making it personal. A gift for transporting you from your arm chair into another world, which in my opinion is what we want a movie to do. Like Hugh Glass you will go through an ordeal in this film, one that I highly recommend you survive for 159 minutes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Is The Revenant the best movie of the year? Surely not and in fact it's doubtful if it's a great movie at all.,"Is The Revenant the best movie of the year? Surely not and in fact it's doubtful if it's a great movie at all. OK, so Alejandro Inarritu wanted to be realistic, moved to Argentina for more snow, had actors crawling naked in it and other bullshit like that, but seriously what is the point of the film? And what is so realistic about getting almost raped by a giant bear and attacked by uncountable Indians and elements of nature but still managing to survive to get revenge? Inarritu is a great director, perhaps the best (along with Christopher Nolan) of our time and the movie is technically and artistically perfect. If he hadn't already won the direction Oscar last year with Birdman, he would certainly get this one. DiCaprio's performance is brilliant but so is each and every of his performances. Still they'll finally grant him an Oscar for his crawling and growling in the Revenant but in reality it will be an Oscar for his entire career. Tom Hardy's performance is even better and he deserves it even more than DiCaprio but he is going to lose to ... Stallone (Jesus Christ Academy, you suck!). Nevertheless and despite some very impressive scenes (namely the entrance scene, the bear scene, the horse scene and the final revenge scene and that's it) and artistic beauty, a movie should have a ... script and this one has none. So it ends up being a Cast Away clone without the emotional touch of the last.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Reverent is so real looking it is almost scary,"Alejandro González Iñárritu is solidifying himself as one of the finest directors of his era. He has directed two aesthetically beauteous chefs-d'oeuvres in just a two-year span. The first was the 215 Oscar winner for best picture, Birdman, and now the The Revenant – another Oscar worthy movie.The Revenant is straightforward from a story perspective. The story is about a protagonist seeking revenge on an antagonist for his malevolent, self-indulgent and inhumane actions. However, Iñárritu evinces the story you tell does not matter. What matters is how you tell it. The story is brilliantly structured. Every scene amplified the suspense and intensity of the movie, and it was sprinkled with just enough plot twists to keep us guesstimating how it would all unravel. It was difficult to guess how it would end, yet the journey of how the character would will himself to get there and how the climax would play out made the movie keep its vigorousness. Behind the disheartening tone constantly following around the characters, is an inspirational story. A story that demonstrates how much drive and perseverance we as humans have. All we have to do is dig deep to discover it, and if we do it can make us dangerous beyond belief.The directing, however, is what makes this movie stand out the most. It is so natural and so realistic that it blurs the line between reality and fiction. It is almost as you are in a virtual ride or playing a video game as the protagonist, feeling every inner-emotion the protagonist feels.The Revenant takes its audience on an aesthetically stunning expedition with meticulously remarkable directing; beauteous cinematography; thought-provoking, ultra-philosophical and metaphorical dialogue; and an exquisite, way-too-realistic method acting-esque performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I see some similarities to Jedidiah Smith's story in this film...,"Fur trappers attacked at a river. Survivors escape. Extreme cold winters. Barely surviving. Mr. Glass (Mr Smith) survives a grizzly bear attack. His injuries are life threatening,with half his face, ear, and scalp stitched back as good as can be by the only willing associate. I'm surprised nobody else has noticed these similarities. This is not actually a review. It is just an observation. I get my facts from a documentary entitled, Taming the Wild West: The Legend of Jedediah Smith. It is very compelling story about an extremely brave and talented pioneer in the history of the wild west. I recommend watching the documentary as well as this movie.

"A true story, made original","Really, what a wonderful experience.I was daunted by the film's duration. But after the first scene, I was applauding the DOP for his innovation and relationship with his subjects.At the very least, this film should be recognized by its' effective use of optic technology. Wow It was like II was there - a true advancement in the craft.A hard call between Leo De Caprio and Tom Hardy for Best Actor or Supporting role.

Boring,"I personally found this movie to be boring. Definitely one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Yes, it looks good visually, but that's all it has going for it. Even when something was happening, nothing happened. They easily could have cut an hour out and it still would have been boring, but at least it would have been so long and drawn out. I feel that this is probably one of those movies that people will claim to like because it's the popular thing to do. But seriously, how many times can look at CG trees and still be amazed at how real they look?

Leonardo is great at his part, he keeps surprising with virility he has developed over the year as an actor, he is perfect for main role in this movie, cant imagine anyone else instead.

The Revenant,"The Academy Award winning Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu took Michael Punke's novel, and really turned it into something of his own. AGI captured countless breathtaking shots, utilizing a lot of long-wide takes, and some hand held shots. The premise is a little played out, but he did a BRILLIANT job putting a creative and unique twist to nature, and human nature. With AGI incorporating this tremendous act of risk at all times, it really helped to keep the audience engaged, and to not pay too much attention to the longer runtime. The opening scene made for such a crazy first act. With such a hard hitting opening, you have to keep that same energy throughout each act, but AGI slowed down the pace a little bit come the second act, incorporating some emotional notes, while being a little repetitive with his direction. The third act capitalized on the speed change prior, and became a very entertaining, high octane final act.With Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Hardy leading the charge, you know you're automatically in for a treat. After all of Leo's Academy Award performances, HE FINALLY RECEIVED HIS FIRST OSCAR, being so well deserved! His emotions felt so genuine, that you can truly feel his pain, and really connect with his character. Tom Hardy also put on such a fantastic performance, also being nominated for an Academy Award. His character had a very clear notion, and was a very big part of the way things unfold. The acting overall was very good, without anyone overshadowing one another. The tattered & dirty costume design by Jacqueline West was so articulate and well designed, with the makeup & hairstyles being the cherry on top to complete that rugid look.The Academy Award Winning Emmanuel Lubezki took over the photography, and my God, was it beautiful. He utilized the beautiful natural lighting, while also incorporating a lot of dark colors to embrace the gritty & cruel tone. Not only was the cinematography gorgeous, but the visual & practical effects absolutely stole the show.... and most of the budget. The visual effects added this level of grit to the film, making everything feel so real, from the action to the climate. AGI and the effects team did an amazing job making you feel like you were in the movie. I was cold when there was a bitter cold scene, I felt the pain with all the injuries; AGI really knows how to connect to the audience.Overall, the 3 awards & 12 nominations speak for themselves. This is an absolute must see, especially for the DiCaprio & Hardy fans out there!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Visually and Aurally Stunning - Those Carry This Film,"A visually and aurally stunning film that captured and held my attention from beginning to end - for those two reasons primarily. This is a familiar story - albeit in a rather unique setting of unrelenting cold and unforgiving wilderness - that has been told a multitude of times before: a man's loving family is killed needlessly, man then overcomes challenges to seek revenge and redemption. Therein, to me, lies this film's greatest weakness and the main reason I did not rate it higher - for all intents and purposes, we've seen the story before and pretty much know instinctively how it will turn out. The story really doesn't throw us much in the way of curves or unexpected turns. As noted, the film's greatest strength lies in the production and sound design and the stunning cinematography, both of which could be Oscar worthy. While I am not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, in my view he did an admirable job getting across the pain and desperation of the main character. I don't think I would go so far as to say that his performance is Oscar worthy; in my view an actor must rise above putting in a ""solid and admirable performance"" to get to the lofty heights of an Oscar. For me, the other weakness in the film - and some may not have found this the problem that I did - is Tom Hardy's performance. While his characterization was outstanding and properly menacing and nuanced, his accent was so thick at times that, despite a good sound system, I was often unable to understand what he was saying. This was unfortunately a major distraction for me as a viewer. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend viewing this film at least once primarily for the stunning visuals and sound design that makes you feel that you are right there in nature with the characters on the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Best thrilling movie I seen in years.,"This well created film. The Revenant is one of the most thrilling, breathtaking and worth watching. It is one of Leonardo DiCaprio's finest movies in years. I knew he will finally had that opportunity to win this year's Oscars.If you don't know what is The Revenant about. The Revenant is based on a true story about a fur trapper called Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who gets mauled and extremely injured by a bear. His team left him for dead because they thought Hugh Glass will never survive the severe injuries he suffered. Fortunately, Hugh Glass was still alive and really crippled. He goes on about a 200 mile journey to get revenge to the person who left him for dead.The film's soundtrack was beautiful and also liked where the film was set in. So that is my opinion on The Revenant. The story I thought was spine-chilling, the actors are unexpectedly great especially Leonardo DiCaprio and the film's soundtrack is so unimaginatively beautiful. I rate this movie a 10/10. -Ben",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Visually stunning but lethargic pace,"The Revenant is a treat to watch visually, for me the film fell flat when it came to the very slow pacing. The film throws a lot at you in a very short amount of time and nothing else important happens until the very end, I think the 2 and a half hour run time is far too long. Another problem I had with the film was the characters. I didn't find myself invested in any of them. Besides Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy's characters everyone else felt wooden. My favorite part of the movie was the visuals, all of the naturally lit scenes are beautiful and the CGI bear is so good it looks real.

"Unbelievable screenplay, slow pace and age old story","There is a scene in this movie where a rider and his horse fall off the cliff. A healthy horse. And a sick, bear mauled, hungry barely surviving rider. Surprise! the horse dies and the rider survives. A man is shown to catch fish with bare hands, eat raw buffalo, go hungry for days. And he still survive fairly strong and able. There is no emotional connect that the audience is able to develop with the characters. The key villain is the only realistic character. Also, annoyingly the protagonist keeps remembering a line by his dead wife all through the movie about how branches shake but not the stem. This line finds no meaning whatsoever in the drama. Still this line is repeated like 10 times. Its such a silent screenplay I fell asleep twice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Intimately powerful,"This movie was literally tailor made for me. The opening quote about keep breathing and don't give up resonates with me so much. My favorite theme to movies. Then the beautiful all natural lighting at the beginning when they shoot the moose. I absolutely love nature movies. Then we get to see Tom Hardy start complaining about the gunshot and see the primal nature of the fur traders. Being from Oklahoma, and remembering football camp, that's exactly like what a bunch of guys act like without women haha. As they're giving bridger crap, I could totally relate. I'm thinking they totally got this right, then the arrow goes through the dudes neck. Then the attack at the beginning. I absolutely love extended scenes. I love the gore. I love the realisticness of the battle. There wasn't any choreographed long sword fight. Glass swings his rifle and misses, next thing you know he's being choked to death and just gets lucky that someone saved him. literally the best opening a movie has ever had. I think it put such a positive attitude on the rest of the movie. When I walked out of the theater, I already knew it was my favorite movie of all time. I've watched it three times by myself in the theater, it's that good. And each time I understand Tom Hardy's accent better.

Tragically spoiled opportunity,"I was really looking forward to this movie after reading the well researched historically based novel. I saw the movie after the Oscars. No quibbling the Oscar for Cinematography for Lubezki. Mc Bride should have landed his nomination for visual effects too. Breath taking realistic action and panoramic landscape with underplayed natural sound effects. However, the grizzly itself was pitifully underwhelming. One cannot ever believe surviving two lengthy maulings, no matter how difficult it is to discard expensive left-over footage. I cannot however understand why Iñárritu had to deviate from the story with needless ornate sentimental flotsam, Inventing and predictably killing a son unforgivably destroyed the whole theme of the story. I really appreciated Tom Hardy's role as a hard boiled opportunist brute - without becoming just another stereotyped Western baddie. What I could not really fathom is how Leonardo even got nominated for leading role Oscar. His early lines were mostly in some remote N.American Indian tongue. His voice was then reduced to groaning for most of the rest of the film. With a face hidden with hoods,full facial body hair, grime and ice - what acting can possibly peep through? No amount of extreme survival tour de force stunts can ever be classified as acting. Perhaps Leonardo wanted us to know that he has graduated from dying within a few minutes of calm ice cold sea to surviving hours of freezing white water rivers. Oscar for effort at best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
DiCaprio's tour de force,"Revenant *rev–uh-nuh nt*nouna person who returns. a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost.There is a lot that can be said for the unfairness in Leonardo DiCaprio never receiving an Oscar, despite his tremendous performances in quite a number of movies. I have a sneaking suspicion that some people still think of him as the pretty-boy from Titanic and The Beach, and that is really a shame. Because DiCaprio is one of the hardest working actors today (he averages just over one film per year, ever since his breakthrough in What's Eating Gilbert Grape in 1993, and has as of today 36 projects listed as ""in development"" on IMDb 36!). And not only that – he is one of the best actors out there, the man seem able to play almost anything, and after seeing him in The Revenant, I have come to the conclusion that Leonardo DiCaprio will from now on be able to make me buy a movie ticket based on his involvement alone.The Revenant tells the (inspired by true events) story of Hugh Glass, an explorer leading a small team of surviving fur trappers through the vicious winter wilderness that is 1820's America, after they have been attacked – and most of them killed – by native Americans. On a scout tour in the forest, Glass finds himself standing between two grizzly bear cubs and their mother, and he is brutally attackedI will say no more, even though there is a LOT more that could be said, you will have to (and I encourage you to) see for yourself!Let's get a few things out straight away. This IS DiCaprios film, he plays Glass and it is his story we get to follow. The pain, misery, fear, frustration and anger are all very palpable for me as the viewer. I can see it in DiCaprios face and I can hear it in his voice – what little he has left of it, after the bear tore out his throat. He embodies all the emotions to such a degree that I actually felt the freezing cold water and the snow, sitting there in the theater – dressed in my thick sweater. The camera is right there, in his face His dirty, banged up, tired and determined face. This is a film about survival, about determination and about not succumbing to any sort of fate. It is also about revenge – but that is very much a secondary point. -This is DiCaprios tour de force, and there should be no hesitation about that.That being said, I would not be surprised if Tom Hardys performance as John Fitzgerald is mentioned in as equal high regard. Hardy has always been a fascinating actor, who seem able to play everything from the leading man in romantic comedies (This Means War, 2012) to super villains in superhero-movies (The Dark Knight Rises, 2012). But what he does best though is play lunatics The kind of trouble stirring lunatics that stand on the wall, screaming, banging their chest and rally everybody to get the revolution going! But if you look in their face, you can see that all they really want is chaos, violence and disorder. Tom Hardy is fantastic in this film, relishing in playing a character that you instinctively hate, already from the start! -It's in the eyesThe Revenant moves seamlessly between intimate (and sometimes painful) closeups, to sweeping landscape shots, showcasing not so much the beauty as the isolation and the relentlessness of nature, interspersed with Glass' dream like hallucinations of his wife and child. The movie is shot using real light (as in no stage lights) and it has a very gritty and real feel to it – a style not unknown to director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who's breakthrough was the fantastic Amores Perros (2000). Making my way through the movie, after the fact, I find it hard to imagine anyone else, other than Alejandro, directing it – and certainly no one else other than DiCaprio starring in it-Make no mistake about it, this movie is a MUST SEE!One last thing, because the scene where Glass is attacked by the grizzly bear absolutely needs to be mentioned! I have seen a ridiculous amount of movies where characters are attacked by large animals/creatures. Everything from acid spitting aliens, dinosaurs and toxic waste enhanced spiders to lions, tigers and bears – oh my. But the bear attack in The Revenant is the most horrific, panic filled and – for lack of a better word – REAL I have ever seen! I cannot remember blinking, or even breathing at all during that scene! When you go see this movie (and you REALLY should), it will grab you from the get go, and you will have forgotten all about the bear attack – until it happens, and then you will wish you could forget it.but you never will!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

This story is a very hard story where the desire for survival is even stronger than anything. It is also a story of danger and survival. The scene with the attack the bear to Leonardo's downright incredibly well done, it's crazy if we did not know that it is thanks to special effects that this has happened, you would swear that this is the real, not speak.

A film with Oscar written all over it,"If all you knew about a film was its title, then this one would be rivalled in obscurity only by ""Sicario"". In the latter case, the word was explained at the opening of the movie; in this case, the viewer is left to infer the meaning from the narrative. A revenant is a person who returns, especially from the dead, and the term comes from a French word for ghost. In this case, the eponymous returner is tracker Hugh Glass (a stunning performance from Leonard Di Caprio) and screenwriter Mark L Smith has worked partly from the true story of an early 19th century Wyoming mountain man and party from a 2002 novel by Michael Punke. In a minimalist script, there is no back story or exposition - we are straight into the action - and there are long periods of no dialogue at all.This is a genuinely international work. The lead star is American, of course, but the other three major roles are filled in accomplished style by actors from the British Isles - Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, and Will Poulter - although all four are barely recognisable under so much facial hair. Director Alejandro González Iñ árritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki - who worked together on ""Birdman"" - are both Mexican. And the outdoor locations themselves - breathtakingly shot in natural light with clever camera angles - were in Canada and Argentina.There is a rare physicality to this brilliant movie-making as the viewer goes through the life-threatening ordeals endured by Glass, whether the threat comes from native tribes, fellow fur trappers, wild animals, or 'just' the terrain and climate. The work has become best-known for the scene involving a bear attack but I was even more gripped by another sequence in which Glass is invited simply to blink.

A solo survival against all odds,"The name ""Leonardo Dicaprio"" has always attracted me towards movies and most of the time it has paid dividends. The Revenant was the same case however it did perform like my favourite soccer team scoring a goal in the opening 10 mins and then losing the game 1-2. Everything in the movie was a class itself except for the long long scenes which resulted in the very long airtime.As far as the cinematography is concerned, simply outstanding and the direction is superb. No recent movie that I saw shot such amazing scenes of nature which made me in love with natural beauty of snowy mountains.The acting by the whole cast is fantastic and hats off for Leo the way he worked up his character. I would have liked to see some more role of a girl in this story as her absence dried up the whole movie and all most of the girls rated this movie as a guy flick.On the whole, a good movie which could hAve done a lot more.

"Beautiful, Brutal and Indeed a Tale of Humanistic Quality","It hasn't been far already into 2016 and there's already a fantastic film that captivates your mind, body and even spirit to break or even open further; and that film to be labelled as a 'Top Film' is The Revenant.I won't go into much of the film's plot but I'll keep it brief; inspired around the famous Hugh Glass (who has been labelled as history's toughest survivor) it tells his deep and yet engaging adventure that see's him fighting not only for himself but his quest for justice when he is left for dead by an emotionless, careless and even cowardly member of his crew.What makes The Revenant so amazing is that it's directed by both award winning and critically acclaimed filmmaker Alejandro G Inarritu with his style of storytelling, themes and character that make the silver screen shine. There is so much to take away and grip from this so I'll try to give my best of it all without spoiling it for you; firstly the film's themes include 'Survival of the human spirit', 'revenge' 'God and spirituality' and they help to keep the audience not only intrigued to the plot but the way the characters are seen from our eyes. Importantly, with Leo's character (Hugh Glass) we are shown that he's not only a tough human but he's battling his own demons that push him to be as strong yet broken in his path for revenge. Leo has played many great roles in his acting career but I think that this role is his best and truly toughest to play, it's bound to get him award nominations again as like other years but this is indeed something that the Oscars should deeply consider for him to receive. Tom Hardy is fantastic as well; his character is truly a monster that is emotionless, heartless and really driven for the audience to despise.Cinematography was outstanding throughout and the locations where the film takes place are 100% real and really captures the realism of the story's setting from wet forests, raging rivers, snowy mountains and isolated trails. So much detail and thought has been put into this and the efforts from both the cast and the crew behind the camera make it seem so believably strong. Sound mixing and editing is strong too, with sounds of birds, winds and even breathing that makes it sound so beautiful but it's is composed soundtrack that makes it seem so emotional and yet captivating, from Glass's visions to even seeing him survive the harsh environment make these worthy candidates for Oscars and further awards in technical achievement in film. Again, we see camera shots that seem a 'one shot take' and even in one sequence we switch from one character to another. The violence is brutal, bloody and well executed and it can be confronting for some.Overall, The Renevant is a breathtaking, captivating, and brutal but beautifully shot film that has so much to grasp but it will take an open mind to get it's themes and character development. This is indeed on my list (and the first entry) of best films for 2016.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The RevenantWhen attacked by a bear remember to always roll into a ball so it doesn't have to chew you as much.The victim in this drama, unfortunately, chose to starfish.Hunting up north, a group of trappers (Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter) are engaged by natives and forced into the wilderness where a Grizzly mauls their guide, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio).Left for dead, Glass endures his injuries and pursues those who betrayed him. Along the way, he frees a native girl from her French-Canadian captors.One of the most gripping tales of wilderness survival, this fact-based account of frontier justice is beautifully shot and brutally told by director Alejandro G. Iñárritu.But its DiCaprio's performance, supplemented by Hardy's, which really brings the humanity to this indescribable tale.However, due to this incident European socialites had to wait an extra month to get their beaver felt top hats.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I'm at awe,"This is a remarkable and extraordinary film. It raises the filmmaking art to a different level. The direction, cinematography, editing, and sound are exceptional. From the astonishing opening sequence and throughout Inarritu's direction is fluid, surprising and alternately grand and intimate. Much has been made of the cinematography using only natural light, and rightly so. It is stunningly beautiful, and the harsh majesty of the wintertime Pacific Nothwest has never been captured like this. The sound editing was completely immersive and had the sharp clarity and snap of frozen timber. I didn't care that much for Birdman, although it too had some complex and mystifying sequences. But what Innaritu has done here is an whole other experience. Frankly, he and his crew deserve any and all accolades coming their way, even that bonfire of the vanities the Academy Awards. Yeah, he won the Oscar last year. Tough. Technically and artistically this film is peerless.A simple story of survival and revenge told in straightforward terms with incredible attention to detail and authenticity, it is brutal and direct, just like life in the early 19th Century was brutal and direct. Leonardo Dicaprio does a fine job, ably supported by an unrecognizable Tom Hardy, that brilliant chameleon who here has a different voice and a rural accent that feels exactly 1800's Americana. Hardy goes so deep into character only Daniel Day Lewis could find him.This movie won't be for everyone. It is harsh and graphic and it is exactly what it purports to be: the story of a man mauled by a grizzly and left for dead who survives and makes his way back hundreds of miles to safety and to exact his revenge; and, how he does that and who and what he meets on the way. Not a lot of story, transformed by the magic of Innaritu's camera moving from majestic long shots to closeups so intimately close they breathe on you. It is grueling, agonizing and harrowing, and it takes its time. Fine by me.Interestingly, this story has been filmed before as Man in the Wilderness (1971), starring Richard Harris and John Huston. That was a good film. This one is sublime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A suffocating realistic Western that follows the steps of ""Jeremiah Johnson""","What a great production! Cinematography is amazing, showing all the beauty and the danger of nature. Camera movements and editing are also very skillful. Leonardo DiCaprio in the main role, a trekker who knows both nature and Indians deeply, and Tom Hardy as despicable Fitzgerald lead the great cast. The brutal story has the same spirit of another snowy Western that depicts the fight for surviving, Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford's ""Jeremiah Johnson"", but with some very realistic scenes that probably could not be made in the 70's. The spectator feels suffocated. The only drawback of the fabulous production is that the unrealistic recovery of DiCaprio's character does not fit to the harsh and much more realistic tone of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
boom.. 10 out of 10.,"I am elated with this one.... Dicaprio rocks & hardy as well.DiCaprio is an extraordinary actor and a great film star. Indeed, villain or hero, comedy or drama, DiCaprio has done it all. A few films have faltered, such as ""J. Edgar"" and Ridley Scott's ""Body of Lies,"" but eight of his last 13 movies have topped $100 million at the Stateside box office. Leonardo can do it all when it comes to acting. He has once again out done his self with this new movie. He is rightfully due many awards this season. I am a movie buff of all types of movies, give him his due!

Best movie with 1 dimensional characters and 4 dimensional scenery 4/10,"I just got out of this movie. It was an experience, so I can give it that. But also it is pretty much a grittier version of the frontier cliché, sights, battles, cowboys and indians, rapes.The more I read and really find out about the frontier the less I think we know about it, and our movies don't really help us here.I am surprised that people rate this movie so highly. I think it has to be Leonardo Di Caprio because for some reason people seem to like him as a box office star. I like Di Caprio precisely because I don't really care about him or think he is that great, so that is what I want to see in an actor ... someone who is not that Hollywoodish.Leo and the cast did a great job. The think I had a problem with was that I could only hear about 10% of the dialog, which improved the movie because you follow what is going on more with your gut than with your mind.The white men were rotten, the Indians were rotten and noble. The land is the real beauty of this movie, our planet is just spectacular and we ought to pay a lot more attention to it than to just throw it in to make our crappy movies look better.The problem was that as I said, the characters were one-dimensional, they moved through the movie like the fake disembodied movie characters they were. The special effects were fantastic. I cannot imagine how they did some of the animal scenes. I am pretty sure the bear was CGI, but it looked and acted real, and should probably be the only thing that gets an Oscar in the movie, but Star War will win for that.Loved the movie, there was just not that much to it, and it had no real lasting impact or point. Bottom line it is a loss and revenge picture which puts it in the class with all the action movies that get made in a year, except that it is a beautiful Western.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Effective Film.,This movie opened on Christmas Day and was the perfect holiday movie. Leonard DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for his performance in this movie-it might be his best film ever I think. Tom Hardy played the arch enemy of LD's character-which TH also did very well. I have not seen a bad guy like that on screen for some time-maybe never. The historical aspect of the movie was handled well-you really got a sense they were back in the 1820's. The film was apparently based on a book but I have never come across the book they are talking about. I really cannot say anything negative about this movie because I think that so far it is the most accurate film dealing with the subject of pioneer America. Go see it-you won't be disappointed. I think it will do well in terms of long term sales if it isn't knocking them dead at the box office right now-it will probably sell a lot of DVD's over time and become a 'new classic movie.' It deserves to be one.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Only for Di Caprio and Hardy !!,"The Revenant is a difficult film to watch and buy the time the movie ended I was wondering how any man could survive in the mountains of US for a single day in the 1800s, forget weeks and months.Thats the power of film making and story telling Iñárritu has and it hit me multiple times while watching this film. Right from the 1st scene when Glass's contingent of men are attacked by the Indians to he being attacked by the grizzly bear to him surviving and finally extracting revenge, its unbelievable and I was awe struck.The story is simple..a tale of survival and revenge. The difference is Iñárritu and his two men...Di Caprio and Hardy.Hardy is virtually unrecognisable. After watching him in Madmax Fury Road earlier, he plays an opposite character of a brooding pessimist man who becomes the accidental villain. His make up that includes a half bald hair is superb and he puts on the perfect accent that I forget he is British. I was wondering how he missed receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.And Mr. Di Caprio. I hate to say this but it seems that Revenant is a tailor made role for an Oscar which he won with ease. Its an outstanding performance and you feel his pain and his struggle to survive. Like Hardy, he is unrecognisable under the huge beard and sinks his teeth into the role.Di Caprio has done better performances according to me in films like Wolf of Wall Street and Inception. But an Oscar is an Oscar.Another stand out in the film is the Cinematography. Forget the blood and pain and focus on the scenes, it seems like the scene is painted. Some of the shots are like from some American tourism brochure. Marvellous.Finally, I was wondering how Iñárritu could make two handsome men look so ugly and nasty and yet walk away with an Oscar...he he !",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Beautiful performances, but a very average story.","I am quite impressed with everyone in the cast. Let's say there's not a single actor which disappointed me in the film.Yeah I found the story to be vry average and there's nothing special to it except the Red Indians. I have never come across a movie where they were an integral part of the story. That is the only unique thing.Well it's not like you'd regret watching the movie, definitely not a must watch.

Even though things keep happening, with Indians and fighting and killing, I didn't give a darn about the movie or anyone anyone in it. I kept looking at the time. Which dragged on and on.This movie didn't have 5 minutes of story, let alone 2.5 hours. There's one cool scene, and it lasts 3 seconds. Coolish.Don't believe the trailer.

Raw Reality of the Past Illuminates the Conflict of the Present,"I watched this film at a time when the extraordinary political climate of the US seemed incomprehensible to many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, and at a time with the Covid Pandemic was at its height.The sheer raw, brutality of the reality depicted in this narrative, has illuminated to me the true nature of the frontier spirit which inhabited those early pioneers who lived in such a harsh, uncompromising and competitive world. But this spirit is still evident in the rebellion of those who fight against Covid restrictions, who believe that to be weak is to have failed, that life is about the ""survival of the fittest"". This spirit seems to me to have evolved from that drive which enabled the early settlers to survive.The cinematography is, of course, magnificent - cold, grey, bleak, as cold, grey and bleak as the story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Chivo's photography was breathtaking, making me want to visit the areas in Canada and the western United States in which the film was shot. The sound mixing and score were equally chilling. All around a numbing cinematic experience.

An experience of human bravery and cowardice to see before our eyes.,"The Revenant is not a common movie which you can watch for amusement. It has a deeper idea, a very reflective intention, than being a movie itself.Honestly, with the amazing visuals which bring this movie to life, made me question myself our very existence. This is so, due to the indirect importance of human-beings in harmony but also in chaos ( this is a paradox) with the astonishing wilderness.Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy vanish into the flesh and blood of Hugh Glass and John Fitgerald respectively, two rivals which develop their hatred throughout the movie.No need to say this because you may already have seen this in the trailer; stupendous sound effects, make-up and picture.The main plot points are survival and vengeance due to human ignorance and selfishness which lead to betrayal and take the downward spiral to death. It is more of a survival-themed movie because most of the running time you see Hugh Glass cling for his life. Vengeance is only emphasized here and there , and it is conquered at the end of the movie.Life; death, beauty; sorrow, self-indulgence; selflessness ... This movie, in a deep way is full of contradictory terms which make you think. The Revenant movie is like a metaphor - two unlike terms compared with each other - we see this every second in the movie : nature ; which is beautiful and is full of life but it is cruel/harsh and it can cause death.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Non-Traditional Western,"The Revenant isn't like most westerns that have very straightforward moral dilemmas and are fun tones, it is dark, and it is complicated. The Revenant is a movie with a lot of backstories that makes, it even more impressive than it already is, and it is impressive. The Revenant is brilliantly acted, features beautiful cinematography all the while showing deep narrative heft. The film is poised to receive major awards attention, and rightfully so.The first piece of back story surrounding this film is fairly well known, and that is that Leonardo DiCaprio is still fighting for his first Oscar. After seeing this film, it seems safe to say that his performance is Oscar worthy. DiCaprio carries the movie as long stretches of the film feature DiCaprio alone, acting in an isolated surrounding, which is even harder to do. DiCaprio often balances soft-hearted empathy and stone-cold revenge within small stretches, and every emotion is well accentuated. While the focus is on DiCaprio, because he's the cornerstone of the film, Tom Hardy and Domhall Gleeson are also brilliant in this film as well.Another piece of back story that may not be as well known is that Director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu and Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki decided to shoot the entire film with nothing but natural light. To go a little deeper, considering exposure and reciprocity this gave the filmmakers only a few hours to shoot per day in order to get a good exposure. Even more impressive is that the film is stunningly gorgeous, and by that I mean that the film looks professionally lit, despite the use of no lighting. This is Lubezki's third consecutive cinematography masterpiece, and he'll probably end up winning his third consecutive Oscar for cinematography.The other impressive aspect of the film is the story. Most westerns tell straightforward stories, with simple characters (good guy vs. bad guy), that's not bad it's just easier to follow. The Revenant mixes traditional western conventions such as the use sweeping panoramic vistas, and the typical setting, but has far more complicated and deeper characters. All of the characters in this film are relatable because their motivations are easy to follow, just not always pleasant. The end result of the realistic character development is that the story is far more realistic and thus thought provoking.In conclusion, The Revenant is brilliantly acted, and may be the film to finally get Leonardo DiCaprio his much awaited Oscar win. The film is beautifully shot and will, more than likely, win the Best Cinematography Oscar. The story is uncompromising, and graphic when it needs to be. For those who love artistic films, this is right up your alley, and for those who love westerns, you'll probably enjoy it too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Revenant,"A shaw, who are all the black and white film converts,the cinematography has merit, that is if you live in a colorless world but I personally enjoy movies that have some color. By watching the film you will learn some survival techniques but really, is this what you want? There is walking and more walking with some gore (the highlights) in a bleak environment. Kudos to DiCaprio to have survived the filming in these conditions, but it wasn't deserving of a Golden Globe and certainly will not be deserving of an Oscar, although he will probably win it. The dialogue is non-existent, but grimaces of the painful experience seem to be what the film underlines.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Revenant: A Master Class in Film,"After having seen The Revenant, I can truly say it is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Every element of this movie is handled expertly, with people who have a genuine love for their craft. Alejandro González Iñárritu has once again outdone himself, as he did with his excellent Birdman from last year. Of the movies that came out in 2015, only The Revenant and Mad Max: Fury Road truly blew my mind.The Revenant has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever laid eyes on. While most movies feature quick-cut editing and shaky cam in their action scenes, The Revenant blew my mind with single-take action scenes with fantastic choreography. Honestly, there are some huge action scenes in this movie with almost no cuts at all. It was truly breathtaking to see a film where the filmmakers just let you watch it, without having to squint and lean forward in your chair just to understand what is happening on screen. In The Revenant, you just stare in awe and soak in the things happening on screen.Now, let's talk about the acting. Leonardo Dicaprio has proved time and time again that he is one of the greatest actors working today. This may have been his best performance yet. It's a much different performance from The Departed, The Wolf Of Wall Street, and many others. Dicaprio's performance in The Revenant is almost entirely physical. From the incredible stunt work to the insane method acting used to get into character, this was the point where I didn't see Leonardo Dicaprio, the pretty boy. I saw Hugh Glass in this movie. When an actor does such a good job that you no longer see the character they are portraying as that actor, that actor should be commended. In fact, all of the acting in this movie is superb. Tom Hardy gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him, selling every word out of his mouth. Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson are also very compelling, the former giving the best performance of his career.When I left the theatre, I was shaking. The atmosphere in The Revenant is so present and strong that I was shivering in my seat, and for the next half hour after the movie ended. Now, this movie doesn't have much to say about society or anything like that. It isn't some profound metaphor. It's a film about both the beauty and horror of nature. Every scene in the film feels gritty and real. The Revenant is the first movie I have gone to in a very long time that I can call an experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A cold movie.,"The highly appraised and one of the Oscars' favorite left me as cold as the landscape you see throughout. The big question that everyone will be asking themselves is: will Leonardo Di Caprio finally win an Oscar? On the evidence of this performance he shouldn't. For the second year in succession, Eddie Redmayne has to be the favorite to win the statue.As for the movie, I think it will fall short of an Oscar too, but it's hard to see which one deserves it more than the Revenant. The bridge of spies would be the other favorite in my eyes, but it does not feel like an Oscar worthy movie. It's hard to tell really, and maybe irrelevant anyway.The point is that The Revenant is a magnificent movie from the point of view of the photography, and I can only imagine the nightmare it must have been to record such a movie in absolute freezing conditions. But in the end, what matters is the emotions you feel when you watch it, and in that department it left completely uninspired. I understand that some people will like it a lot, but to me, it lacks punch and substance. Leonardo Di Caprio was probably crippled a little too long to make it really entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Inarritu has created another masterpiece. Oscar for Dicaprio.,"Inarritu, award-winning director for ""Birdman"" has returned this year to direct another masterpiece. The Revenant could easily return to win awards for best motion picture of the year, best achievement in directing, and best achievement in cinematography. Hardy performed exceptionally well as the villainous Fitzgerald but Dicaprio stole the screen as the protagonist Hugh Glass. Dicaprio deserves to win this year for best performance by an actor in a leading role.The Revenant, inspired by true events, is about fur trapper Hugh glass and his passion to live when all is lost. After being brutally attacked, betrayed, and left for dead, Glass has two motives: survival and revenge.The Revenant is gripping throughout the whole two and a half hour runtime and will leave you breathless by the time you leave the theater. With a mixture of exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, and rare directing, you cannot afford to miss this movie. This is one of the most remarkable movies I have ever seen PERIOD. Do yourself a favor, fork out the $10.00 to see this unique film, you will not regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
More or less an extreme version of Cast Away.... The plot isn't much though!!,It is no doubt a wonderful movie for those who like how human body is so well adapted to survive in extreme conditions if you have a willingness to live. The plot isn't much but the picturization of the conditions in which the main character is shown to survive is really good!!It shows beautifully how nature can be so harsh but still gives you those little pieces to survive that can make enough difference to take you to other end of the line between life and death.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Silly and painfully dull,"Okay, okay, it's not really a one out of ten, more like a three, but the overall score is way too high and needs compensating.As many other reviewers have noted the acting and cinematography are uniformly excellent.Otherwise, it's both boring and ludicrous. The first twenty minutes are pretty good, but after the bear attack it becomes both silly and tedious. Indeed it's sillier than the film where Liam Neeson gets chased around the wilderness by a pack of wolves, and at least that was quite exciting.The biggest problem by far was that the DiCaprio character continued to live. In sub zero temperatures if any human, but especially one that's been severely weakened, is plunged into freezing water and then is unable to get dry he will die of hypothermia. What he won't be able to do is go back into the freezing water in order to build a horseshoe of rocks under the water so he can trap fish. This was just one instance of many.A horse's chest cavity is simply not big enough to accommodate a fully grown man, Leo fires his barrel loading pistol twice in quick succession which is impossible.Then there were all the continuity problems. Leo gets washed downstream but appears to arrive at a location which is at a higher altitude. Sometimes there's lots of snow on the trees, then in the next shot barely any snow at all. It's just a mess.But the worst thing was how long it took to achieve relatively little. Just lots of suffering for DiCaprio and boredom for me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Shattered Glass,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: Some action scenes do impress, but the filmgoing experience becomes more arduous than needed.GRADE: BVengeance is a sweet and powerful impulse that keeps our protagonist alive in Alejandro G. Iñárritu's sprawling Western saga, The Revenant. Based on a true account of frontiersman Hugh Glass (a superb Leonardo DiCaprio), the film shows his violent journey homeward. Faced with natural obstacles, man-made treachery, Native American hostilities, and a horrifying bear attack, our pioneer fights for his life every moment on his trek through the wilderness. Left for dead by members in his hunting party, his grueling endurance test becomes one for the moviegoer as well as we face hardship after hardship in bloody realistic fashion.￼The onslaught may not make for comfortable viewing, but the artistry and virtuoso filmmaking on display is exhilarating to behold, even if the screenplay by the director and Mark L. Smith is one long series of strung together perils with not much in the way of strong character development (other than Glass himself), memorable dialog, or detailed plotting. The story itself is a typical survival tale, rote and predictable, with more than a touch of Terrance Mallick's inspiration and spiritualism thrown in with some cloying (but lovely) ethereal dreamscapes and hallucinations marring the action. Also, the film takes some liberties with the historical facts, especially in the fictional climax of the film.But the artistry by the director, actors, and behind-the-scenes crew is remarkable in their achievements and dedication. Iñárritu is a visionary director, setting up the many action sequences and positioning his actors to get the maximum effect from his unique point of view. (The actual making of this film must have been demanding with his on-location filming in the mountainous regions of Canada.) Shot under frigid conditions, the film has an authenticity that makes the movie all the more riveting with images that truly astound and leave one gaping at its brutality and beauty. The film is a visceral experience but it never touches the mind or heart. It is technically astute and emotionally aloof. (One false note, literally: The dissonant music by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto, and Bryce Dessner, which has a mysterious and haunting quality, tends to telegraph the ominous approaching danger the minute any chord is sounded.)Still, one cannot gush enough about the glorious panoramic wintry vistas and fluid camera-work of the gifted Emmanuel Lubezki. His wide angle shots and striking close-ups are exceptional as is the brilliant editing by Steven Mirrione. The movie-going audience is placed directly in the line of fire as arrows fly, bullets whiz by, and blood flows. Whenever the action starts, we are swept away into its powerful spell.￼Mr. DiCaprio gives a consummate performance as Glass. The role is subtly portrayed, mostly silent and intrinsic in its character, as this man battles his way suffering one misfortune after another. The misery shows in the actor's facial expressions and stance most effectively. This physically demanding role should send many awards his way as compensation. Providing strong support are Tom Hardy as his rival, Fitzgerald, and Domhnall Gleeson as his dutiful friend.￼While not for those who have a low tolerance of pain and violence, The Revenant is must-see viewing for any serious film-goer for its technical expertise and the fully committed performance by Mr. Dicaprio. The awe and wander is there, just not the necessary wonder.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A Visual Masterpiece,"The Revenant is one of the most anticipated movies for me of 2015. From the first to the last trailer that was released i got more and more excited to see Leonardo back on the big screen. A lot of my excitement came from the fact that this movie looked ambitious and unique and i think Hollywood needs to take more risks like this film as.I'm just going to start by saying this is one of the most intense, riveting, and breathtaking movies I have ever seen. I can't think of a movie that made me sit at the edge of my seat as much as this one. From the beginning you are submersed into this brutal world that doesn't let you sit back and relax. This movie is man vs nature at its finest. Yes, it is a revenge tale, and yes people do die, but the environment that these people live in never gives them a break and no time to let their guard down. It's cold, it's harsh, and it's dangerous. The costumes and makeup are incredible. I was constantly cringing, while i looked at Leonardos characters wounds. They sure made all the characters in this film rough looking, and as they should for this time period.Some of the most incredible things about this film, is by far the cinematography and the sound design/mixing. Visually this movie is a masterpiece. I say this because i've never seen a movie with this style of filming. It's unique and refreshing to watch, especially because their is not a lot of innovation when it comes to unique style in cinematography. The sweeping, continuous shots that go on and on are a Emmanuel Lubezkis trademark and they work beautifully. The absence of music for a lot of the movie and the sound of the falling snow, or the wind rustling the trees, or water flowing down the river is absolutely beautiful. For some of the scenes, even if you close your eyes and listen, you get the sense of where this film takes place.This movie is one the greats, yes the bear looked a little weird, and it was a little long, but when you sit back a think about what these film makers have accomplished, it is truly amazing. They pulled me into this world didn't let me out until the final credits starting rolling. I got up, took a deep breath and said ""wow."" It's refreshing to watch a movie that takes risks and when it pays off it turns out to a movie to remember. I'll be looking out for this movie at the Oscars.Pros: -Beautiful cinematography -Amazing sound design -Simple yet compelling story -Man vs Nature -Strong Cast -SettingCons: -Could tell the bear was CGI -A little longRating: 9.3 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
At Least They *Did* Chuck A Camera Off A Cliff,"Is this a work of unparalleled realism? Is its camerawork as inventive and daring as Citizen Kane's? Does its loyalty to location shooting make Werner Herzog look like Tim Burton? Is it less compelling than A Brief History Of Drying Paint? The answer is yes. This may not even play right to Ron Swanson, as he sits there alone with his steak and bourbon. This is the movie that comes to mind when I have the flu. If LOTR were *nothing but* walking, it would still be a welcome relief from this literal crawl of a (true) sleeper. Not enough good can be said of this amazing vision, and not enough bad can be said about it either. In the end, it's not meant to be mainstream. That's the big truth here. It's an art film all the way, despite its subject matter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Strongly directed with a bravura lead  acting performance,"Just give Leonardo DiCaprio the Oscar now. That is how good he is in this film. The surprise for me was how good everything else was.I went to see THE REVENANT under the impression that it was a brutal, tough movie with a tour-de-force performance by Leo as a Mountain Man who seeks revenge after being left for dead following a Grizzly Bear attack...and I would be right...it had all that (the Grizzly Bear attack is pretty, well, grisly). But it has so much more going for it.If you recall, Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu won the Oscar last year for BIRDMAN, a picture that was a ""stunt"", in that he shot it to appear that it took place in one long take - a stunt that ultimately fell short for me. The good news here is that he tries the stunt, in smaller doses, in this film and succeeds mostly. The opening scene is a Native American attack on a group of Fur Trappers and is shot as one long take that gives the feeling of chaos and uncertainty that this sort of surprise attack would give. He also uses the long take technique in the Bear attack, to show the isolation and the feeling of ""no way out"" and, finally, he used it very well in the climactic fight scene to show the visceral nature of the Mountain Men who's main instinct is to just survive.There is sparse dialogue in this film and it that works well. These ""Mountain Men"" are used to being alone in the wilderness, so this sparseness of speech is apropro. The actors, then, need to use expressions, gestures and posture to convey what is going on inside their heads - and they do so. None more than DiCaprio who (literally) has to claw his way out of the wilderness to survive and gives the type of Award winning performance through action and expression that is necessary for this film to succeed without going ""over the top"".Tom Hardy, yet again, is a formidable antagonist. Domhall Gleeson continues to build on his resume with an impressive performance as the Captain who just might be in over his head. The 4th main protagonist in this film is a young Jim Bridger, played with strong naivete by Will Poulter, who gets better every time I see him.Is this a great film? I don't think so. I think it is a very good film. Innarritu has long stretches of ""pretty pictures"" that look STUNNING on the screen but doesn't add much to the story, so the 2 hour, 36 minute running time seems a bit bloated and there is a sub- plot about an aging Native American searching for his daughter that I saw how it would dovetail into main narrative a mile away.But these are quibbles in a very strong movie with strong direction and an exceptional leading turn.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Beautiful on the outside, rotten inside","There is no denying that the film itself is a work of art, and the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio was superb performance.A high caliber cinematic movie, but that s because the best photography master is present ""Emmanuel Lubezki"" this guy granted a good approval for the film passing a beautiful image and DiCaprio showed one of his best performances, but let's look at the basics:Storytelling is a complete crap, its boring and don't make you wonder whats going to happen next, its very cliché. I've seen close to 400 movies and at the beginning of the movie problem i already knew how it would end, the people who don't watch a lot of movies cant make this critic and that's why this movie is so well rated. People don t put emotions apart, ""Oh my god DiCaprio what a excellent performance yo u deserve an Oscar so i will say that the film is very very very good. attention don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the movie is a complete crap, I'm saying that DiCaprio and Emmanuel Lubezki masked this movie as the Best Movie of 2015.The Focus on DiCaprio: it seems that the film was made by and exclusively for Leonardo DiCaprio, the other characters were completely ignored, they were so focused on Leonardo they forgot to use the extreme potential of other actors, especially the potential of Tom Hardy, if they had worked more on his personage the film would be 3 times better. But they were more focused on making a beautiful film and highlight the Leonardo DiCaprio, again don't get me wrong Leonardo DiCaprio was without a doubt the worthy winner of the Oscar.I liked the movie as a cinematic piece of art but not as a Good Movie, because not always the good movies gain the deserved awards but they get the title of ""Good movies"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Simply Great,This is a great movie with a extraordinary and simply brilliant performance by Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy. We really feel the cold and the struggle of the nations to survive in this hard century.This is a must see to not only for the beauty of the images but for this story based on true events. The fact that in was film in part in Canada make me proud to see these amazing shots and the nature in that perspective.The Golden Gloden for best actor and the Golden Golden for the best movie were highly deserve.

Amazed by Iñarritu's style,"I must say it's refreshing to watch Alejandro González Iñarritu's style in an otherwise uncomplicated plot. The Revenant's story is simple, yet scenery, acting and overall pace of the movie is amazing. You feel lost and panicked when the group is under attack, distressed when attacked by the bear (AMAZING scene by the way) and hopeless but you can relate with Glass' motivation for vengeance. This movie immerses you in the story and keeps your attention. It's a great tale of survival and instinct, it achieves a very high level of realism with each take. It features long take scenes which are being mastered by Mexico's golden directors like Iñarritu and Cuarón, which always seem so fluent but must be so incredibly difficult to achieve. Kudos!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Extraordinary,"Excellent movie, excellent acting. Leo is superb. The scenes were so realistic and the topic was simple but effective. Normally I am not a big fan of Alejandro González Iñárritu movies although I believe that they are good but not my type of movies. However, he nailed this one and created a masterpiece. Overall, the movie is dark and deep. The scenery, script and the whole flow was flawless. Plus excellent cinematography. I have never watched a survivor movie like this with great amount of tension before. Seriously, 150 min went in the blink of an eye. GLeo was great too.

Outstanding work By DiCaprio-Alejandro,"I am a die-hard fan of Leonardo Dicaprio and was waiting long for this movie. The trailer had created strong hype for the movie. The movie is directed by 'Birdman' director Alejandro Inarritu who is known for magnificent direction. Leonardo was masterpiece as always and has not let down in this too. The story centers on Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who was left alone after bear attack and killed his son. Leo takes revenge to new style with its own survival style. This can be expected from Leo to be perfect in every condition and can do anything to draw into character. Leo's performance was outstanding and this time I hope Oscar gets to Leo. I go with 8/10 for this movie with Leo's extraordinary performance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"brilliant, just brilliant","Alejandro González Iñárritu's masterpiece. a tour de force, if I've ever seen one. from the amazing opening shot, this movie immediately hooks you. the movie is a brutal depiction of man against the wild. a survivalist story that can sometimes be difficult to watch or even stomach, as some of the scenes can be quite gruesome. the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are spectacular. Leonardo, who doesn't speak much threw out the movie, depicts Hugh Glass's pain and suffering with the skill of a true thespian grand master. Tom Hardy is chameleon. he is able to lose himself in a character in such a way that unless you know it's him acting the part, most people would never know it was him. all in all this was a great story. just prepare to lose yourself for about two and half hours. I assure you, it will be well worth the time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
cinematography doesn't make up for poor film,"I watched this on TV, so probably missed out on the hole cinema theatre experience to get the full effect, which I would imagine is quite something. However I can't even imagine that would make up for an overall lacklustre storyline with whole sections of the movie just showing a nice vista.It's a story of revenge in the face of adversity, which lends itself to good theme, however the movie takes too long to get there and meanders more than the river featured in many of the shots.This is my second time watching this and it most definitely won't be going on the recommendation list.If you've a long flight planned, I'd give it a whirl as it will pass nearly three hours, but not one to look forward to of a Saturday evening.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
visceral experience from beginning to end,"The Revenant is definitely one of the best shot films of the year. Some of the camera moves are just extraordinary. The story is simple, but that's fine because it's the overall experience that's unique, not the premise. It's basically a revenge western meets a survival story. Set in frosty Montana, Hugh Glass must overcome all odds to avenge the death of his son. All the acting is great- but it's the mood that really stands out. From icy mountains, to great plains, the oppressive and gloomy atmosphere will not be for everyone. It's a hard film to sit through. There are scenes of great violence and very very slow-paced scenes. Plus the runtime is over two and half hours. So it might not be for everyone- but it's still an excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Missed opportunity - not bad,"Apart from displaying the incredible mental & physical barriers that can be overcome, the story seems to focus on a circle of revenge, ultimately leaving the viewer with only a thought surrounding the futility of survival. Rather than emphasizing and using revenge as a driving force, the importance & value of truth could have been made the center piece.This is by no means a bad film and the cinematography is effective in communicating, and in some cases immersing the viewer into, the perils of the protagonist. It just seems that a great opportunity was missed to carry across the value of a time relevant and universal moral.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
REVENANT-confirms many instances of where the human ribcage can survive inhuman weights(car vehicle),"this was a terrific film that repeats often chronicled reports that people can survive a terrific amount of weight falling on them,for instance in a car crash,where the driver is pinned under a 3,000 lb.metal paperweight. Although,it is easy to believe you can kill a bear w/ one bullet,& several knife wounds(I read somewhere that Alaskan Kodiak bears can reach 8' tall standing);I never imagined a film would show a person almost getting killed from the dead carcass he killed landing on top of him,after collapsing & falling down a ravine(?).Despite all the long beard, I instantly recognized him as Leo diCaprio,but could not figure out who the villain was underneath all that makeup hair & the southern, pre -civil war speech vernacular(it was that same guy who plays those British gangsters,Tom Hardy!).THere were so many pithy, aphorisms he said(will have to return & see film a 2nd time to write them all down), I thought that Inarritu had hired Ralph Peters as a dialogue coach!(CAIN AT GETTYSBURG@2012); I also thought this is a very good film,in the model of many Hollywood westerns about ""Lewis & Clark Expedition"" type adventures about explorers tracking the western Frontier & confronting bloodthirsty indians,etc.,in showing the types of wardrobe that John Richardson & Glass wore,the typical long bore weapons, the type of diet,(it looked like diCaprio caught a live fish & bit into it?,i dunno,it sure looked like it!); Also, this is described as a revenge movie,so I impute that to mean,diCaprio is trying to find the ones(Hardy) that done him wrong. All in all,I rate this a 10 out of 10,the Bear should get an honorary Oscar for all the shaking he did of diCaprio's body, I thought he was going to eat him alive,but then the bear seemed to just walk on top of him to lick his face....?More civil war aphorisms(an aphorism is a concise way of describing a depressing truth?)>> '.that sounds like pissing in the whiskey jug'=(a used car salesman, or a tin horn politician speaking out of the side of his mouth,or similar 2-faced obtuse person)>>' a blessed person who hides behind a curse.....=not quite sure what this aphorism in the book meant)>> I would think that 10 minutes being devoured by a bear would easily substitute for 3 horrific days in the summer of 1863 (battle of Gettysburg); I cannot believe I live in the same country as where the battle of Gettysburg was fought,it makes me feel very insignificant,like diCaprio walking through the frozen tundra of this wonderful movie...>>",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Gripping but overlong,"Some of the best cinema of the year, but it goes on for too long and starts crumbling by the end. It's a simple revenge flick mixed with a survivalist tale. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a frontiersman with a half Indian son who has been hired to guide a group of trappers. After suffering an attack by Indians, DiCaprio is mauled by a bear. Unable to travel further, two men, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter, along with DiCaprio's son, stay behind to care for him until he dies, as they assume he will. Hardy doesn't really feel like it, though, so at the first opportunity he murders the son, tells Poulter (who didn't witness the murder) that the Indians are nearby, and buries DiCaprio in a shallow grave, still alive. DiCaprio eventually digs his way out and goes after Hardy to get his sweet, sweet revenge. The film is at its best when its in its you-are-there, in-the-actors'-faces phase, making you feel like part of the action. Its at its worst when it goes into flashbacks and DiCaprio's highly symbolic dreams. The final act is pretty silly, too. Domhnall Gleeson, who has really earned a vacation at this point, also co-stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wow!  A great movie to finish the year with.,"So when is DiCaprio going to win an Oscar already? This guy puts his heart and soul into every movie and he sure knows how to pick them. This is a movie that has a lot of heart and was terrific from start to finish. Tom Hardy also was terrific in this one. From the start I was riveted. If I didn't know this story was true I don't know how vested I would be in this, but knowing this story really happened it made the movie incredible. The camera work was brilliant and the CGI was tremendous in a great bear scene that will be talked about going forward. Don't miss this one if you can help it. This is about a man who overcomes adversity over and over again. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because 20 minutes could have been trimmed, but that about it. It is a must watch so get your popcorn and be amazed at the how this man lived in the 1830's and what he went through in a compelling story with great actors.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Best Picture.  Ever.,"It would be unfair to judge every movie which has ever been made before Alejandro G. Iñárritu's THE REVENANT in comparison to it. That said, THE REVENANT may indeed be the best.All of the actors have done exceptional work in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio's incredible performance truly deserves to be given the highest honors.The Cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. This film transports the viewer to the 19th century frontier. The natural landscape and lighting each play irreplaceable roles of their own.All of the intense suffering depicted in THE REVENANT has the affect of creating a deeply palpable thirst for hope.As there are no light moments or laughs in this film, relief comes only from characters who are in a position to be righteous choosing to be righteous. The characters are neither perfectly good or perfectly evil. They are perfectly human.The spirituality of the universe feels authentically depicted; absorbed into the heart it rings truthful.It is perhaps the Best Picture.

He did ...,"...tried to make this movie, his first Oscar winning movie. But I am afraid, you need to wait longer, Leonardo DiCaprio. Is not your fault. Actually, I rated this movie a 7 because of your brilliant performance, but I think the director wanted to .. ""recreate"" Interstellar , in terms of drama, feelings and such. He kinda failed. He wanted to show us the magnificent views he choose for this movie. He did that, but man! don't just throw us scenes just for the sake of showing X wonderful view. There were times when I was watching some random views and told myself ""why am I seeing this view? what this has to do with the whole scene?"" Yes! The scenes are beautiful, but still ..They should have focused more on the recovery of the character to make the audience to actually see the movie with normal eyes.

There are so many other great films where he deserved an Oscar for. This is not one of them.I still can't get over the incredibly unrealistic story portrayed here.

You Only Die Twice,"A year ago around this time I think everyone predicted that The Revenant would finally be the film to get Leonardo DiCaprio his Oscar. While I'm not sure his performance holds up against the other greats of 2015, particularly Fassbender as Steve Jobs, I will say that The Revenant is a cinematic achievement and one that should be recognized. It contains probably the most impressive cinematography of any film of this past year to go along with the jarring brutality this story brings to the table. While I don't think The Revenant is the best film of the year, it certainly deserves to be in the discussion.The Revenant is a far more artsy film than I expected. It's directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, director of last years' best picture winner Birdman, and done so brilliantly. The direction along with Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is some of the best of the year. I think the problem with the film lies more with the script, also co-written by Iñárritu. The film is centered on DiCaprio's character seeking revenge against the man who left him for dead and killed his son after getting mauled by a bear, but the film lacks balance in its storytelling. I love the brutal, raw, grittiness of the story and you certainly feel the intensity in those scenes. But the minimal dialogue and in Tom Hardy's case, sometimes inaudible dialogue, you sometimes lose the emotional connection to the characters.The gorgeous cinematography does tend to overtake the films other appealing aspects, such as the great performances from Hardy and DiCaprio. Knowing about the incredibly difficult shoot they went through behind the scenes attempting to make the film helps their Oscar case in my opinion now that I've seen it. But I somehow still expected more from both of them.One of the best parts about The Revenant, that The Hateful Eight also did extremely well, was set the tone of the film through its atmosphere. In both films you feel what the characters feel. When DiCaprio was hungry or thirsty, I was too. It helps that the film was shot entirely in natural light and real locations, which is unusual for a main stream feature. There are plenty of memorable scenes in The Revenant including an incredible opening long-take fight sequence, the now famous bear mauling, and the films brutally bloody climax. The Revenant is far from a let down, but I also don't think it reaches the heights that we expected when we heard about the film over a year ago.+DiCaprio's commitment+Legendary cinematography+Memorable scenes+Sets the atmosphere perfectly-Perhaps a little too artsy-Lacks balance in its storytelling8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Classic,"It never ceases to amaze me how very different people's views are regarding the same subject. Some of the reviews here regard this film as boring and a waste of nearly 3 hours. For me, I just looked on in awe from the first minute to last. Yes it is long with slow parts between the excitement, yet this for me adds to the overall structure of the film. The despair and anguish displayed during these periods were almost palpable, oozing from the screen, due to the superb job of cinematography employed.This review will not touch on the plot as it has been more than played out in these reviews. For me, although the plot was obvious by the title, what set it into orbit was the marriage of brilliant acting set within the harsh wilderness in which it was filmed.In my opinion this film will go down as a modern day classic. For generations to come it will be looked back on with admiration for the superb acting and sheer enormity of its production with great special effects. They will also look back and believe it was a worthy first Oscar for an actor named Leonardo DiCaprio.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A film that you either love or not, but will always appreciate it for the unbelievable achievements of its production and the incredible performances.","The revenant is by far one of the most beautiful films ever. Is poetic, grand, epic, mesmerizing, is a film that is in a completely new level. Inarritu did it again.One of the reasons i love inarritu films so much, is because they all are super original, have such a unique style and are always groundbreaking.. And the revenant is another showcase of this. The story while being about revenge, is unlike everything i've ever seen. Is so fresh, so unique, its like you are experiencing a poem coming to life. Is really well paced, and its highly climatic. You just want to see what happens next and how will it end keeping you at the edge of your seat.Is a highly immersive experience, where you feel you are right there with the characters. Part of the reason for this, is because the film is insanely realistic. it's like a documentary. You feel everything the characters feel just by watching. Its like they just traveled back in time and recorded everything. The attention to detail is astonishing. It can be very brutal, but its part of the why the film is so great. The most impressive scene, by far, is the bear scene, where you will refuse to admit that bear isn't real.The cast is just beyond perfect, and for actors clearly stand out: Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Tom hardy and Leonardo Dicaprio. But of course, Dicaprio and Hardy are the ones that steal the show. And in the end, the tour-de-force comes from Dicaprio. The fact that he did everything you see, for real, like the true character did, just says it all. His character doesn't have much dialogue, and this is his most physical performance yet, it's not my favorite, but its his most impressive one. With just a look, a move, an expression, he says everything. And the long due Oscar cant go to anyone but him.The film is just so beautiful is insane. There's a lot of breathtaking nature vistas, so beautifully shot that nature feels like a main character in the film, and it is. The cinematography is mesmerizing, the fact that the film was shot with natural light just makes this one of the most breathtaking visual experiences ever, and again, the Oscar cant go to anyone else but lubezky. The same goes for everyone else in the crew. The production values in this film are through the roof, so real that is like they don't exist. The make up is amazing. The score is brilliant, because it makes such an eerie atmosphere that is a huge part in the films identity. The camera moves are incredible, and the visual effects, well, what visual effects? i can't distinguish whats real or what's VFX.A case of both style and substance, this breathtaking journey of man vs nature, vs man, is really immersive, emotional, thrilling, awe inspiring, i could just go on and on. Its a film that you either love or not, but you will always appreciate it for the unbelievable achievements of its production and the incredible performances.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Dakota Legend,"Watching ""Birdman"" for the third time, I viewed it just to appreciate the cinematography. On first viewing I only wanted to immerse myself in what was promised to be a groundbreaking and highly enjoyable trip to the theater; it was, in no small measure. When you spend the entirety of the film looking for a ""cut,"" you aren't absorbing, you are monitoring. Knowing that Inarritu was using the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubeszki again for ""The Revenant,"" it was a chore not to measure cut lengths, camera movement, and blocking. This was not a distraction, just an affirmation that I would need to see this film again, and again simply for appreciation.The broad-strokes of this film's plot are centered in truth. Hugh Glass was a figure of legend in South Dakota where I was raised. His story wasn't introduced along with John Henry or Wild Bill Hickok; his was reserved for older students, so that gruesome details and exaggerations could be employed without censorship. I heard of ""The Toughest Man in History."" The basic story is widely known, Hugh Glass was a frontiersman in the early 19th century who fell victim to a vicious grizzly bear mauling. With cold weather setting in, the members of his hunting party were not keen on hefting a near-corpse 200 miles to their fort-base. Consensus was that he would not recover and he was left with 2 volunteers to see him through to a dignified passing. These volunteers waited in vain for his last stubborn breath, and left him half-buried in the wilderness. The facts of his survival and journey after the matter have been molded by time into something formulaic and unabashedly compelling. If this film takes liberties with the truth, how far off can they be?This story doesn't build to a finale so much as sustain a continued agony that is bearable to the viewer through character perseverance and beautiful filmmaker craft. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't demand pity for his situation, he doesn't relent in his drive long enough to evoke sympathetic emotions. From the first mechanically shot battle sequence, we are spectators to this man, and we don't want to leave him. The world that Glass resides in is beyond hostile, and there is very little reason why we should want him to survive so badly, but that feeling is sustained throughout. Revenge becomes a murky motivation until it needs a boost. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald gives us plenty of reason to see Glass through to the end and exact it.Fitzgerald is the soulless volunteer who callously leaves Hugh for dead and sees the world as carrying a debt that is owed to him. The pacing of Glass's survival juxtaposed to Fitzgerald's damnable existence back at base, fuel the audiences involvement in exquisite balance. Anytime you wonder ""What is Glass even fighting for anymore?"" Hardy steals a scene that demands retribution. Aside from Fitzgerald and the terrain, the local Native American Pawnee tribe are a continued threat, always fast on Glass's heals. As overwhelming as this may seem, there is never a moment where it doesn't feel authentic.Due to the sustained tension throughout this movie, the climax doesn't pack the punch we are accustomed to. There is an unnecessary use of Dues Ex Machina in the final moments that doesn't hurt the plot, but makes it feel needlessly formulaic. Long-takes blended in with seamless choreography of action make this a prime candidate for Best Picture and Cinematography. Leo's performance is second to none this year. And it should be noted that if Inarritu pulls off an Oscar for directing, it will be the third consecutive Mexican won award, his second in a row. This is a great year for film, and whatever the cast and crew of The Revenant walk away with in February, I begrudge them nothing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Little scenario and boring. Great photography,"6 stars to this movie I give because scenario is little. Films focus on the effort of Dicaprio to survive (who plays very well) Too long scenes with no meaning, that is the reason that film is 150 min.If Dicaprio wins an Oscar that will be for his effort to be honest. I read that more of the scenes are real and took place in real conditions. The truth is that we have seen him in better films. For one more time his face is very expressive and that is why Leo is one of the best actors. Now the for of the movie: I give 10 stars for photography with all of my heart.

Not many movies make me get emotional but this one makes it hard not to get like that at it a truly remarkable experience.Its no secret how much I love Leonardo DiCaprio, I've never seen a movie of his that I havent enjoyed and this is definately in the top 5 of his.

Speechless,"I have just watched the movie. I have marinated the movie in my laptop for a long time because the movie hadn't come to my theater so I had to wait for the Blu-Ray rip. Even after that I was afraid that I will end up not liking it. At long last I have watched the movie. It was amazing. Just amazing.I will start with the direction. Amazing. Excellent. Alejandro has shown how to use a basic plot and muscle it up with emotions, because it is a very emotion-driven plot. Most of the plot-lines in our real life are not that dynamic but they are important to us because our emotions are attached with it. Alejandro showed that.The cinematography. Amaze-balls. What should I say about it? It is indescribable. The flow of the movie is very smooth. The CGI is used very efficiently i.e. only where required. I have heard that there was no artificial lighting, so under that conditions putting up such a beautiful looking movie is no easy job.NOW, the acting. Domnhall Gleeson plays the weak and timid captain. I always thought of him as a timid guy until I saw Star Wars:The Force Awakens. He shows he is capable of everything. Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy. The guy shows so little but every emotion and dialogues are transcended through his eyes. Finally, Leonardo DiCaprio. WHOOOOF! The guy is his own competition. He just makes a movie and then tops that and keeps topping that. There is no stopping Leo. 90% of the movie, Leo is on screen and he shows what he is capable of. After the 1st half he rarely talks because he was mauled by a frigging bear. It's all expressions after that. I could go on and on. As there is a saying that better late than never so ya, he was awarded the Oscar at the right moment, for the right movie and for unparalleled acting.

Jeremiah Johnson on steroids -  astounding & beautiful picture,"Yes, The Revenant was nominated for Oscars ""Best Picture"" of 2015 and by all means should have won the Oscar hands down. While there are similarities with one of my personal film favorites of all time, Robert Redfords, Jeremiah Johnson (JJ), The Revenant is no JJ knockoff. Its totally original and mind grabbing. After Wolf of Wall Street came out, I swore I would never attend another DiCaprio movie. Well I had heard so many positive comments about Revenant I decided I would see it and DiCaprio did an admirable job as lead actor and deserved his Oscar for this performance. To sum up The Revenant is to say it pits a white man against nature, Indians, enemies, other white men, bears, starvation, cold, wind, rain, snow, dirt, and grime in the most realistic 2 hours of movie making ever produced. Thanks to the directors, actors, producers, writers and hundreds of others in this films crew for making whats sure to be a long lasting classic.

The Brilliant 'Revenant',"I am not sure why they portray it as a revenge saga.Revenge is definitely a part, a big part of it.But to call it a story of revenge only is like calling a sea just a pool of brackish water.There are so many interwoven philosophies, that when the revenge does take place, you are already taken away to a mystic world, world where vengeance means little, embarking on a journey which teaches you how to survive the worst, life has offered you and yet come up with a spirit to endure more, to invite more and to sustain till the last breath of life becomes everything.Since my teenage, I have always rooted for Leo to win an Oscar every time he gets a nomination since 'What's eating Gilbert Grape'.And every time, as Leo returned empty handed, my heart went down as if it was the last time.But he came back with a bang every time.And continued winning 4 more nominations.And continued returning bare handed.But this time, while I watched the masterpiece saga' The Revenant', something deep inside started saying' Yes, it's the time'.In every frame, in every moment, it makes you feel, this was just made for him to win an Oscar.Because what Leo delivered here, is something you can not look beyond in any acting dictionary to better.What a visual treat Alejandro González Iñárritu has given you in this epic tale of survival!Every frame becomes etched in your mind as if you are living in the world construed by him.When I had watched this movie, it was yet to win 12 Academy nominations.But I was certain that it was a sure entry for the cinematography.The mountains, the river, the water, the blood, the snow, the ridges- everything so vividly portrayed.Tom Hardy did an exceptional job as the villain.It must have been an extreme difficult job for an actor of his stature to portray second fiddle.But there lies his finesse.The background score is fabulous, too.Overall a movie you hardly affor to miss.Fantastic -'The Revenant'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
best oscar's survivalism historic movie,"This one is perfect, especially on topic or insight of survival. Similar toFirst Blood (1982),Man, Woman, Wild (2010),Man vs. Wild (2006). The camera, actors, nature, graphics all look professional and real. Topic is serious and reminds me of such cases as war, homelessness, accidents. Good insight into various cultures and history. Bit hot women. Inspirational, motivational, natural. Only I did not like a bit too old topic and bit lack of more modern action, so I think Rambo is better. And did not like bit too long movie.

"The ""Revenance"" of Time I Lost from Watching this Movie","I've gone camping. I've seen bears. I watched Backcountry and I'm sorry, but this film does not meet expectations. I don't believe the entire story is true. Realistically speaking, the injuries sustained by Leo D's character throughout the movie (let alone the bear attack), would have been fatal, especially in the 1830's! Leonardo DiCaprio is a decent actor, however he was not the right one for this character. It seemed the whole cast was off a bit; but then again, the character development was seriously lacking. I watched this movie without judgement, with an open mind. Unfortunately, it didn't pan up and I was genuinely disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
You're forgetting your place,"""The Revenant"" is an ambitious attempt at cinematic storytelling that unfortunately falls short of its lofty aspirations. Despite moments of intense action and a committed cast, the film ultimately suffers from a meandering narrative that overstays its welcome, leaving me feeling more bored than enthralled.From the outset, it's clear that Iñárritu aimed for a slow-burning epic, but what unfolds on screen often feels like an exercise in self-indulgence. The film's excessive length serves only to test my patience, with scenes dragging on endlessly without adding any significant depth to the story.While there are sporadic bursts of excitement in the form of intense fight scenes, these moments feel few and far between in a sea of monotony. Instead of punctuating the narrative with gripping action, they serve as fleeting distractions from an otherwise dull and plodding experience.Even the performances, including DiCaprio's much-lauded turn as Hugh Glass, fail to inject much-needed energy into the proceedings. While there's no denying DiCaprio's commitment to the role, his efforts are ultimately undermined by a lackluster script and uninspired direction.In the end, ""The Revenant"" is a film that squanders its potential at every turn. Despite its grand ambitions, it ultimately feels like little more than a tedious exercise in style over substance. This is one cinematic journey best left unexplored.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Revenant!,"First of all the description of ''The Revenant'' makes you all excited and ready for an adventure epic western drama thriller.Inarritu's decision to shoot the film chronologically was a good call telling the story from the beginning to the end. His ability and follow- up to Birdman does not disappoint. The amazing shots of every scene, every breath of Glass, every fight, struggle, survival on set makes him one of the greatest of all time. Definitely after this I'm going to watch more of his work.DiCaprio DiCaprio DiCaprio... where to begin? He has definitely proved once and for all who runs this. The pain that he reflects, the scene with the bear the screaming, the scars and hope to make it another day, horse scene where he sleeps on his carcass to the fight scenes and eating real bison liver he really committed to this performance. He wasn't playing Glass - HE WAS GLASS. There is not enough words from the training and prepare of mastering guns, western lifestyle, the look to the accent and rawness of his character he topped Wolf of Wall Street and that was some of his best work congrats man hats off to you.Tom Hardy's performance wasn't unnoticed. He showed us one more ti how well he can manage to play a supporting character and that he's good at it unfortunately Leo's performance I think it shadowed him but there's a great possibility he'll grab an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor.Will Poulter's performance as a scary trying to be honest but coward was just another point to making the film complete.I waited for this film almost 2 years to come out and see it ever since it was announced. Don't Miss it cause there's not enough space for me to write a well-deserved review for this . 10/10 and I'm sure it's gonna win at least 5 Oscars ;) .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Life lesson,"I've seen it three times and still I feel the need to watch it once more. ""The Revenant"" is teaching us a life lesson: ""As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe. Keep breathing. When there is a storm, and you stand in front of a tree, if you look at its branches, you swear it will fall. But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability.""

A meditative look into character expressions and beautifully detailed landscapes,"It's 1823 and a gang of hunters are searching for pelts in the wilderness of the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. The land is made even more treacherous with the presence of the Native American Arikara Indians, who have staged an ambush for the hunters, leaving only ten of the men with no other option but to take a raft deeper into the wilderness.Amidst the ambush, the team's most experienced hunter and guider Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) winds up being mauled by a mother grizzly bear in effort to protect her cubs. In the process, he is seriously injured, with his throat slit, his back mangled and bloodied, and his entire body left in a ravaged mess. The gang finds the mangled Glass and is uncertain what to do with him, despite the party's loudest voice, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), suggesting they simply put Glass out of his misery and move forward. Nonetheless, they do their best to care for him until two young boys, Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), Glass's son, offer to stay behind and care for Glass, with Fitzgerald keeping a watchful eye.When Bridger is gone gathering water, Fitzgerald winds up killing Hawk when he begins to weep for his father, leaving a helpless Glass to witness his boy be murdered right before his eyes. When Bridger finally returns, Fitzgerald claims to be unsure of Hawk's whereabouts and demands that the two leave quickly, claiming he saw Indians down by the creek, leaving Glass for dead. As the weather worsens, with blizzards and avalanches abound, Glass does his best to maintain his health and his safety as he finds his way back to camp to exact revenge on Fitzgerald for his son's death.It was only logical that, after giving us the terrific ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" a year ago, writer/director Alejandro G. Iñárritu would stun us all again with a film that is sure to grace the Academy Awards with plenty of nominations. Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki are the best director/cinematographer team of 2015, alongside Quentin Tarantino and Robert Richardson for ""The Hateful Eight,"" and Denis Villeneueve and Roger Deakins for ""Sicario."" With that, Iñárritu and Lubezki (also the cinematographer on ""Birdman"" and ""Gravity"") embellish uncommonly natural locational beauty to contrast with the downright evilness of the characters that inhabit the land.Iñárritu and Lubezki, similar to the Ultra Panavision 70 route that Tarantino and Richardson opted for with ""The Hateful Eight,"" capture the lavish land of Alaska with plenty of evocative wide-angle shots that do wonders in showcasing the facial details of the characters in addition to the details of the background. ""The Revenant"" is as much about the frigid conditions of the brutal wilderness as it is about character redemption, and Iñárritu and Lubezki do a tremendous job of keeping both in mind as the film progresses. These kinds of films really bring forth a meditative light, and I'll say some moments in the film make you become lost in the scenery and the land itself.The biggest battle with ""The Revenant"" isn't so much the unflinching sequence that shows Glass getting mauled by a grizzly bear, complete with blood-curdling screams, bone-crunching, and every other nasty auditory detail of a mauling, but its length and its simplicity. Coming off of ""Birdman,"" a film I still regard as pretty under-seen given its accolades and a truly fascinating tale of potential and struggling to live up to your own name, Iñárritu takes a complete one-eighty with this film, being that it's in a totally different setting and focuses on much clearer character motivations.Because of that, after seeing him tackle such lofty ideas in ""Birdman,"" ""The Revenant"" can't help but feel slight in comparison, or even on its own. Once you get through the extremely brutal sequences in the beginning of the film, the remainder of the film's weight rests on the shoulders of DiCaprio, a proved performer who even seems to struggle with the emptiness of his character. While I don't believe this should be the film to finally earn DiCaprio the Oscar, his performance in the film is much more physical than it was ever meant to be anything else. On that note, he succeeds incredibly, never appearing unbelievable or corny, but yet, there's not much to view Glass as other than a revenge-seeking man.And being that this film is one-hundred and fifty-six minutes, just eleven-minutes shy of the theatrical cut of ""The Hateful Eight,"" a film with far more dialog and character interest, ""The Revenant"" is sometimes a chore to sit through, despite all it does well for its simple story. Iñárritu and Lubezki's directorial and cinematographical work needs to be appreciated and praised, and DiCaprio's performance also needs to find its way to be commended for its physicality (also, don't sleep on Will Poulter, who shows some real emotional chops playing both conflicted and manipulated), yet that shouldn't excuse ""The Revenant"" for its slight nature overall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
It is not an usual Inarritu movie.,"In most of his movies Alejandro G Innaritu has emphasized on human behavior, relationship, conflicts between various characters and he represented his movies in a non linear, hyperlink format. Amores Perros, 21 grams and Babel are the three most prominent examples of his cinematic style. He always has liked to reveal the whole story with flashbacks, flashforwards and plot twists. But 'The Revenant' is an exception of his usual format. Here he created situations in absolute wilderness. It is a story of 'Struggle for existence' and survival with inner current of vengeance, love and human values. He depicted the survival strategies in one of the most hostile and extreme environments with impeccable detailing, that is what makes the film a great creation. Leonardo DiCaprio has done the best performance of his life. a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Oscar Worthy,"First off I'm a big Dicaprio fan and was hoping to see an Oscar-worthy performance out of him heading into this film. I expected the cinematography and directing to be excellent and I wasn't disappointed - I'd say this film is definitely worthy of an Oscar in both of those categories. Was Leo's performance strong enough to earn him his first win? I think so. It takes incredible artistry and talent to bring a character to life with very little dialogue. We the audience experience the character of Hugh Glass mostly through Dicaprio's facial expressions and body language as he navigates and endures the most brutal of realities. Dicaprio displays utter vulnerability and commitment to his craft in this film.I never really consider going to see a movie twice, however the sheer beauty of this film...we the viewers are literally sucked into this Arctic landscape right from the beginning...makes it an enjoyable experience in and of itself.One of my critiques though is that the movie does seem to drag in the second half. I'm also a little disappointed in how the revenge narrative played itself out in the movie...a little too straightforward and predictable for my liking. I think this movie showed it's strengths in other ways. Apart from its cinemagraphic brilliance, there were a lot of other side narratives that took place as Dicaprio's character journeyed along. These narratives seemed to have an intentional depth to them that made the movie so much more than just a revenge story and brought that entire place and time to life.I think the last shot of the movie was also appropriate. The movie had a certain cadence that carried on from beginning to end. Tempo seemed to be important, and it left me feeling somewhat calm upon its conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Brutal, Beautiful, and Amazing","I'd been excited to see The Revenant since I had first heard of it, and when I'd heard that Alejandro G. Inarritu was in the directing chair with the same cinematographer who did the marvelous camera work on my second favorite film of all time, I was understandably pretty excited. And while this wasn't better than that film, it was still a pretty fantastic film over all, and the one that I'll be pining for in all categories at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. Without spoiling the film, the cold, intense and frankly brutal atmosphere is held from start to finish, aided by every aspect of the film. The cinematography is as strong as ever, and the performances are absolutely amazing. As of now, DeCaprio's raw performance as Glass is my favorite over all performance in an Inarritu film. The soundtrack was intense, and the violence is some of the most brutal and challenging that I've ever seen in a theater, being more horrifying and endlessly more meaningful than much of the violence and scares that modern horror can deliver. If I had to make a few small nitpicks, some scenes could be cut out completely and the film wouldn't have been any worse. Some character motivations are a bit sketchy, and occasionally snow or breath will fog the camera up, but I'm not even sure if that last one is a criticism, because it is not very normal to see such raw camera work in such a high budget film. Over all, 9/10... go see this as soon as you can.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A great cinematic experience,"The Revenant could be just one more survival story, but Alejandro Iñárritu directed a movie that can be described as a great cinematic experience. I've really enjoyed its dark but beautiful atmosphere created by director Alejandro Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (both Oscar-winning). The soundtrack just emphasizes it perfectly. Outside of some brutal scenes, the movie is visually superb and will take you to the beautiful landscapes of the Far West. You should be ready for some extreme scenes of violence, though.Leonardo DiCaprio plays really great, but I'm afraid he won't win Oscar for this one. His character simply doesn't require much acting and resembles (to me at least) Tom Hardy's character in Mad Max (2015). No doubt it was extremely physically challenging role, but it's not an Oscar winning type. I would be glad to be proved wrong!Beside all of that, The Revenant remains an inspiring story of courage and the unswerving determination to survive. A desire for vengeance possibly shouldn't be the single reason to live, but in watching a movie all my sympathies lie with Hugh Glass. When I learned that movie is based on a real story from the 19th century, I was very impressed.Before The Revenant, I wasn't a huge fan of Iñárritu's, but now I'll wait for his next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

DiCaprio is mind blowing in his performance that looks so convincing, you'll believe he actually went through it.

"Emotional, good performances, and effective but over long, self indulgent, and frankly, a bit boring.","The title of this review sums it up almost perfectly. The film does have major strengths but also has major weaknesses. While intense at certain points, it gets as vague as hell in others which kills the narrative drive and tension of the film. Also, another problem with this is my age as in the I have lived long enough to have seen and remember films of similar stories and themes. With ""The Revenant"", I had felt like I was watching a variation of a theme that I had seen before. That is bad for a film because it jerks the viewer out of his enjoyment of the film. Every film should make you feel that you are seeing something new and unique even if it isn't. With me, I had thought I was watching a variation of ""The Naked Prey (1965). While the Naked Prey film was set in Africa, the historical event that it is based on, Colter's Run, happened in North America, in Yellowstone park, just like The Revenant. And both Colter and Glass were guides and experienced mountain men. The stories were too similar. And it didn't help that I had just finished reading a novel that had mentioned Colter's Run shortly before seeing this movie. Bad timing on that. As far as acting goes, I was not particularly empressed by Dicaprio's performance and felt it was the weakest of the major players of the film. I thought Will Poulter's was the best and stole the show. Gleason and former child star, Lukas Haas, gave strong performances. Hardy was good, but frankly, there was points where I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying because the accent he had used was so thick and he had mumbled some of his lines. But in the end, the strength of the story and the directing did pull me in and I did feel emotion at what was happening on screen which a good film should do. So therefore, I say this film has both good points and weaknesses. I will say that if you are looking for a fast action packed film, this not the film for you since this film takes it's time (aka, ""slow""), and builds towards it's ending that doesn't really pay out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great movie,"This movie was awesome it had everything you could want from it. Multiple themes from the plot, great acting from Leo but really tom hardy stole the show, thrill, intense action and battle scenes, and a ton of gore sometimes too much to watch but it was awesome either way. Multiple themes showing on what man is willing to do to survive the I humane things that they may do. It has the base story of revenue after being left for dead. And the multiple ""turf"" despite a between more than one Native American tribe and Europeans and white Americans. These disputes lead to gory intense battles that had some very disturbing and almost scary scenes. The key to the action sequences in this movie was the camera work. The camera angles were unbelievable making you feel as if you were freezing in those terrible conditions fighting brutally Native American tribes coming at you. This movie was very good and I highly recommend you go see it with warning that is disgustingly gory at times beyond your imagination.

The music is close to perfect and its timing and paste is unearthly good.The film left me with an uneasy feeling - hence the rating, which is not a 10. this movie is too perfect. The photography, the coloring and the light are too perfect for a story that in it itself exposes the roughness of nature and humankind. It does not fit; or you celebrate roughness in your whole production or you don't. But not half. It's like the director is not making a statement in one clear direction. He over-exposes nature, lighting, color and most of all the sound. It gives me the feeling he wants me to be dragged into that unforgiving side of pure nature. He wants me to be 'dirty' myself by boosting up all the parameters. But then....on the other side, he stays so....neat. So clean. The images are so decently, obsessively....beautiful.

Astonishing film making with hints of past films...,"The Revenant is most certainly one of the best films I have seen in my lifetime. It achieves what few if any this reviewer has enjoyed. All of the hoopla about natural light and crew abandonment seem quite credible. This achievement would not be for the timid, whether they are crew or cine enthusiasts. It is extremely realistic in it's brutality. And in that crush of reality of western yore you are also treated to some beautiful majestic and sometimes almost unbelievable captures of the landscape of the Northwestern American continent. There is ode to to past cinema styles and inferences, most notably the dream sequences. But the persistent theme is survival and justice. Not included in the trailer is how specific this film is about the plight of the indigenous people of Northwestern America. And they play a fascinating role in the story.

Man vs. Nature,"Only one year after his major Oscar win with ""Birdman"", Alejandro G. Inarritu delivers another awesome cinematic experience with his survival western drama ""The Revenant"". Most of the publicity surrounding this film is about whether or not this will finally gain Leo his first Oscar. But there's so much more to this film. And Leo is not even the star of this movie - even though he's terrific in it, I'll come to that - but the real star is sitting behind the camera. It's cinematographer Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki.I'd like to say that the art of cinematography has reached perfection with ""The Revenant"", at least it has reached its peak up to now. Chivo's images approach Nature as something elemental, terrifying, yet painfully beautiful. It does not comment on these images, it does not judge, it is rather something that is felt than intellectually explored. Of course we have the long uncut shots that Chivo is already famous for, but the dogmatic restriction to solemn use of natural lighting comes off as even more incredible here. The movie has been chided for its brutality, but it never uses that unnecessarily. It is rather a realistic approach to the hard life in the Northwestern parts of North America in the early 1800s.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a stellar performance as Hugh Glass, the protagonist who is trying to survive on his own in the wilderness although being severely wounded. It is rather a physical performance that he shows without any subtleness, but as an acting tour de force it is overall extremely respectable. Tom Hardy excels as his counterpart John Fitzgerald, a cold-hearted pragmatist who has his own methods for survival. To me, he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for that performance.The only issue I have with this movie is with some of the directorial choices made by Inarritu. In my opinion, it would have been the perfect film if it had been linear from beginning to end - just a straight, gritty western that is always in the moment and in the wilderness. Instead, Inarritu continuously breaks the scheme by integrating flashbacks and dream sequences, which come off as quite impressionistic. Those impressionistic elements bothered me, as they slowed down the pace of this (overall too long) movie and distracted from the movie's greatest strength: the Man vs. nature elements. But after all, this is an incredibly beautiful work with superb acting and the best camera work I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Good Movie, Great Visuals.","This is a beautifully set movie. The basic plot unfortunately was fairly formulaic.As a Canadian in the throws of winter I don't particularly enjoy watching a movie set in the cold of winter as well. I have enough of that when I step outside! My biggest problem with this movie is simple reality. You do not go fording across a stream in winter on foot or on a house without consequences. Mountain streams can be freezing cold in spring(I have panned for gold in the mountains), so you can imagine how cold they are during the winter. To most this would seem a trivial thing, but I would hate for any kids to think this was OK.I also really don't go in for this over the top superhuman effort stuff. This character never seems to get ten miles without taking some horrible physical damage.Unlike most of this genre of film, this movie is totally without humour which makes the unrelenting suffering particularly hard to watch. It reminds me of ""up"" which I couldn't watch to the end. The bottom line I guess is I did not ""enjoy"" watching this movie.That all said, this is a well acted and directed and worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Boring and lame but will get its Oscars,"Spit, dirt and painful faces. That was a first sentiment of mine about this movie. It surely is gritty picture of settler, but after tenth time when Leonardi Di Caprio rescues himself from certain death everything starts to feel too unbelievable. I am certain that many of you disagree, but for me this movie is boring and predictable. There is a lot of beautiful scenery, maybe even too much to handle. You could easily cut this movie under two hours length instead of over two and half an hour length without any suffering for the storytelling. Maybe this is what they call an artistic of a movie what it needs to take notice in Oscars. Probably it will get more than ten nominees, but is it really worth it? I am quite definite that Leonardo will pick an Oscar of best leading actor, because there are enough of spit, pus and painful faces and if that is all it needs. At the beginning of a movie is very realistic Indian attack scene, almost a racist. Attack of a bear is also very well done and it gives a strong start for a movie. Unfortunately magic vanish quite quickly. Somehow you just start to wait the end scene. Everything that happens in between star and the end starts to feel just vain. The Revenant is well produced drama, but at the same time it is boring and predictable. It is very patriotic and I'm sure the old members of actors guild will love it so much that many Oscars are pretty undisputed. To me it was just too lame and boring.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
DiCaprio's gritty performance and Iñárritu's incredible vision are at the helm in this story of survival.,"The Revenant is a story of survival at it's finest, showcasing the brutality of human nature in life or death situations. This is not a film for the faint of heart as director Alejandro G. Iñárritu takes this violent and unforgiving story head on and doesn't let up until the end credits roll. That's not to say this film doesn't have it's subtle moments. There's plenty of time to catch your breath and take in the beauty that surrounds the darkness. However, every time things look up for the story and our characters, the ground crumbles at their feet causing everything to come crashing back down.The film follows Hugh Glass, a frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the early 1800s. After an incredible opening battle sequence, the story takes off when Glass is brutally attacked by a grizzly bear while out on the hunt. One of the most realistically violent and jaw dropping scenes in recent memory, this attack sets in motion a series of events that cause great pain and anguish for the character, striking relentlessly at his spirit and will to survive. In arguably his best performance to date, Leonardo DiCaprio was the perfect actor to portray the character in all of his pain, loss and misery. His performance was so gritty and realistic that it was hard to watch at times giving the illusion that these things were really happening to a real human being. Combine that with the brilliant cinematography of Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki and you get an unforgettable experience rarely achieved in cinema.Throughout the film, you experience Glass' hardships hand in hand, feeling his pain. None of this made easier by Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald. Hardy plays the villain to perfection as Fitzgerald jumps on a chance to collect a payday by looking after the injured Glass. None too excited about sitting around in the freezing cold watching a man slowly die, he takes matters into his own hands to speed up the process. Using the phantom threat of hostile Native Americans to scare his partner Bridger (Will Poulter) into fleeing, the two of them leave Glass for dead and rejoin their group. This leaves Glass to overcome his dire situation on his own and face the unforgiving forces of nature that surround him. DiCaprio's performance and Iñárritu's vision are at the helm for the duration of the film and are also what will stay with you long after the experience is over.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Good movie; worth your money, But does not blow you away.","I did think the Revenant was a solid movie. The acting was phenomenal. The scenery was beautiful. Wow, that fight scene with the bear might go down in history. Outside of that the movie was pretty average. The movie had very little character build up. IT was a little drawn out at times as well. I do think some Oscars need to go to Leo and Tom Hardy, i can tell they put a lot into it, I just wish the writer put the same amount of effort in.Acting -10Scenery - 9story -5 rewatchability - 3",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Beauty is only skin deep,"Everybody loves this picture. They praise the looks of it. And indeed, it looks beyond awesome. From a technical point of view, it is nothing short of flawless. But unfortunately, beauty is only skin deep, and if one manages to look past the the cinematography, he/she will find that the story is nothing special, in fact, compared to the praise this movie is receiving, it feels like it is a fraud. Basically it is the journey of DiCaprios character from near death to a moment of revenge, but if you take into account what his character goes trough, he should be dead already from exposure or pneumonia half way trough, instead, amongst other things, he rides a horse off a cliff and falls hundreds of feet without getting a new scratch next to the scars made by a bear. Also, the plenitude of nature shots which are there to pound in the viewers the severity of the heroes situation, despite being beautiful, are so excessive that a good one hour of the 156 minutes runtime of this movie could have been cut out without any actual loss to the story. The director is also pushing the boundaries with the flashbacks and hallucination scenes just for the sake of back story and motivational exposition. Given the depth (or lack there of) of the story, the movie should have been around 90 minutes flat instead of an almost 3 hour long epic. Honestly, when I was not bored by the national geography shots, I was hating this movie with a passion. I found it to be pretentious, hollow, with badly written characters and way too long for its own good. Also, in about 2-3 years of time, nobody is going to talk about this movie unless the topic is not the fact that DiCaprio still did not received an Oscar yet. Quite frankly, I cannot imagine anybody to want to re-watch this movie again given its length unless he/she is glutton for punishment. I could go on and on about why I find this movie to be soo bad, but it would become a mindless rant and I do not like that. It is basically the posh version of Avatar.

Any aspiring cinematographers... take note.,"Very rarely do I feel compelled to write a review, however in this instance I feel I should.Recently many films have been hyped up, raising the bar for my expectations, only for them to limbo right beneath. The Revenant was truly an exception, taking the bar to new heights.From the outset the visuals are stunning - the spectacular scenery is married with a deep consideration for movement and cuts. Not so many cuts as to overwhelm the viewer, but enough to capture the enormity of the wilderness whilst also showcasing the cocktail of emotions portrayed by the characters. This is all achieved without missing a moment of the action.Any line-up with Di Caprio and Hardy is destined to please, but it was the additional support of upcoming actor Will Poulter which added new dimension to the movie. Whilst Di Caprio and Hardy sit on two opposite ends of the 'morally sound' spectrum (by 1800's standards), it is Poulter's character battling with his conscience between the action that keeps the pace of the movie going.I shall leave my review there - all I can say is, the scenes you've likely heard about WILL exceed your expectations, as will those you haven't. Go see the movie - enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"GMM: The Revenant Movie Review, A Truly Heart Pounding Experience","An experience that finds you shivering throughout the whole film, The Revenant will turn any theater into the cold harsh wilderness of 1823. This is a film that puts viewers on the edge of their seats through most of its two and a half hours. Taking place in a land where danger lurks around any corner, and sleeping with one eye open is key for survival, The Revenant is an adventure only fit for those with a strong heart. Left for dead, the fearless frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) must go toe to toe with Mother Nature herself as he struggles to survive the deadly winter elements of uncharted American territory.This was one of the few films of recent years that truly makes you believe you are there watching the story unfold. Next time you want to say you are having the worst day ever, just think about Hugh Glass and what he had to undergo. With very few items on hand, every breath of survival was fueled by nothing but revenge for the man who put him in such a situation. A truly great performance by DiCaprio, viewers can really believe the struggle that he endures throughout his treacherous journey. Achieving the Golden Globe for best actor in a motion picture-drama was well deserved. The primary antagonist (the human one) John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) is due credit for his performance as well. It is clear these two actors deliver on screen when you find yourself rooting for Hugh to prevail, and hating every second Fitzgerald is alive.Director Alejandro Iñárritu spends a good deal of time shooting the surrounding environment. In most cases, this could cause the film to seem as though it is dragging on, but not here. The Revenant is an incredible viewing experience, showing the wintry remote conditions of Canada and Southern Argentina. Part of this had to do with the film being shot in all natural light. This typically isn't done due to relying on the position of the sun and clouds, but it pays off as this is one of the most beautifully shot movies of 2015.There is absolutely no shortage of heart pounding moments. The biggest being the encounter with a grizzly bear (the primary non-human protagonist). An incredibly impactful scene, it demonstrates the raw power such a creature can have. This moment will induce your fight or flight response as you are sitting in your soft, safe, theater seat. What Iñárritu does so well in this, and other action sequences, is shoot them in one continuous shot. Most other films will cut back and forth between characters or movements, The Revenant does not. Viewers will find that this puts more focus on the event as a whole, versus just the few who are involved.The story was based on true events, which makes the movie inspiring, but runs the risk of reducing its impact as many viewers might know how the plot unfolds. However, even if you know how it concludes before entering the cinema, The Revenant is brilliant in showing how Glass struggles to reach that point. Though they partly explain why Glass is in a certain mind state during the film, the dream sequences he has do occur a little too much. Nearly every time Glass closes his eyes, he has obscure visions. So for those aren't particularly fond of this type of genre, it may seem somewhat boring, and these moments could highly contribute to that.A magnificent feast for the eyes, The Revenant is absolutely one of the best films of 2015. With stellar performances and cinematography, it depicts just how resilient the human spirit can be. As a recommendation, it is best to see this in the theater. So don't just wait for it to come out on digital or DVD, get the most from this movie by seeing it on the big screen. A strong Oscar contender in multiple categories (and winning a few golden globes), The Revenant receives a well deserved 8.5/10. (IMDB only allows whole numbers so between either an 8 or 9, it deserves a 9).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
perfect on all parts,"I wanted to see this flick for two reasons, the excellent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio which finally delivered him his Oscar and the cinematography.But after seen it this is just a classic to become. Can I say a negative thing about this flick, no I can't. All those long shots used or the extreme close-ups it do works out fine. The effects used, the attack and the bear of course are really gory as hell and the bear thing do looks real. But the natives used are so believable due the fact that they speak their language and do say what's it's all bout, taking the land back.Not a minute too long and for cinema geeks this is a must see.Gore 2,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Pushing pain's limits,"The bleak image from the trailer of Leonardo DiCaprio's face as he writhes uncomfortably on a cot, unable to speak or move, really sums up this film. Alejandro Iñárritu successfully contrasts the beauty of the American Western frontier with the ugliness of humanity, but forgoes embedding a solid narrative while doing so. Each piece of imagery is as striking as the last, but the narrative that drives these images forward made me wonder how many times Glass (DiCaprio) was going to be tortured before he accomplished his task. The audience at the theater around me cringed a little bit more with each new gash, contortion, and bone fracture, and rightfully so. The images of nature serve as brief respites between the intense pain that Leo must have actually physically gone through to act out this role.Throughout the entire film, it is evident that Iñárritu wanted to de-romanticize the American Western film genre. By setting the film in the dead of winter, viewers are given insight on how difficult battling both man and nature must have been at this point in time. Without giving away too many plot details, the movie is a classic revenge story, but does not stay focused on the revenge aspect for too long. In fact, at one point Iñárritu explicitly reminds his audience that the movie indeed is a revenge film, and not just a montage of DiCaprio getting the crap beaten out of him. Even with sparse dialogue, Iñárritu manages to convey the emotions of the characters brilliantly with the use of some clever camera work and the outstanding acting of the cast. Most of the credit has to be given to Leo here, he breathes life into Glass, with every pained facial expression, and eyes hungry for sweet vengeance.Though The Revenant manages to break new ground in visual storytelling, offering some of the most breathtaking shots I've ever seen in cinema, and yet something is lacking. The muddled flashback sequences did elucidate enough of the back story of Glass' character, and yet, we never feel the true extent of his plight. If the script was structured in such a way as to make the viewer care more about Glass and his son, I would have been doubly engrossed in this film, but the scenery and cinematography speak for themselves. I can only hope that Iñárritu returns to this style of film, because with a few tweaks to the screenplay, this movie could have been a must watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
DiCaprio shines but he owes much to some masterful craftsmen,"Before I address the question on everyones mind regarding the Oscar that DiCaprio craves I have to talk about the on form director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and his latest masterpiece. Last year he swept up completely with 3 personal nominations and 3 wins for Birdman and rightfully so. This year he is up for another 2 and if he was to win them both he would be only the 2nd person to win back to back Best Picture awards (The first was David O. Selznick in 1939 & '40) and the 3rd to win Best Director back to back (John Ford 1940 & '41 and Joseph L. Mankiewicz 1949 & '50). He would however be the very first to do both... But could it happen!?Well, firstly I have to say that any film that is able to put you in amongst the action as fluidly and emotionally as is exampled in the opening scene here is fully worthy of a best picture, the best film that I have seen do it was Children of Men in 2006; rather unsurprisingly a film by a friend of Iñárritu Mr Alfonso Cuaron and also the same man in charge of the cameras Emmanuel Lubezki (The second man to win best Cinematography back to back (He could win a 3rd) along side John Toll). Of course, doing it once in the film really isn't good enough but the fact that it is done more or less constantly throughout the film is exceptional in itself. The opening scene I mentioned is a surprise attack by the Indians on our protagonist and his party, which travels like its one take and has you jolting at every bullet and arrow that hits home. A fully deserved nomination for the above mentioned Cinematographer. But the stand out point for me in this scene was how brilliantly the sound accompanied the visuals and thats not the Score, its the sound effects that feel as though they are happening around you. Brilliant! The minimalistic score is used nicely to overpower the end of the scene and carry us into the next one. All of these elements are under the supervision of the director who I will now say has to make all of this seem seamless and he truly does so. With that in mind the Oscar could indeed be his (But i haven't seen all the other nominees yet).As soon as this scene was over I knew that I was in for a mesmerising experience similar to what I had with Birdman. Not that they are similar. In fact these films are in many ways mirror opposites. Where Birdman was fast, expressive and imaginative, this is patient, quiet and real. The scene that this film will be remembered for is the Grizzly Bear attack and it really is a shocking and very realistic watch as it happens, seemingly, in 1 take and goes on for at least 5 minutes. The fact that you are sat there at this point almost able to feel the pain he is in is something that must be seen to be believed. The story that follows is just about the mother of all revenge stories, as a true western should be, but also a survival film unlike any seen before it.Tom Hardy, once again playing the villain can proudly take his Oscar nomination to further springboard his already high flying career; Will he win? Maybe! He's had a fantastic year though, starring in 2 films in the best picture category playing the hero in one and the villain in the other shows his brilliance.Now... Leonardo DiCaprio... Will he win the Oscar this time? I honestly feel, just my opinion, that the argument suggesting that he should have won one by now is unreasonable because he had been up against some very formidable opposition over the years all of which were worthy winners that he simply wasn't able to outshine. The only one I feel he should have won for was Blood Diamond but was beaten by Forest Whitaker in a career defining performance. The same with Jamie Foxx as Ray. His other performances, albeit very good, weren't ground breaking or really in any films that merit the kind of Oscar best picture winners with weighty subject matter. But also he is the grounded actor in the room which allows for actors around him to experiment and test the water because they know Leo is there as the anchor. The other thing is that if he had have won previously would he have changed the kind of films that he makes? its not an unreasonable thought.However, this time he has a very physical performance that is given a silence and demands a visceral understanding but also he and all the actors are almost always right in the cameras face... I mean that very literally. There are a few times when Leo's heavy breathing causes condensation on the lens and it never spoils the effect. In fact it makes you realise that the camera was literally a few inches away from him whilst he's trying to perform and given that most of us find that terrifying, for him to achieve this level of performance with that kind of distraction deserves every kind of credit that can be bestowed. His main competition this year is Michael Fassbender for Steve Jobs, 2 very different performances and 2 contrasting acting styles but in my honest opinion DiCaprio will not walk away from the Oscars disappointed this year. Its his to win.As for the film... Its a masterpiece. Excellent and unforgettable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

You won't have much time to know the characters and there is very little time for story telling. The director spends the entirety of his time focusing on the realities of warfare and the natural brutality.You will know who to like - and who to hate. But that is about all you will figure out.

However, you simply cannot deny it is a work of pure legend by the director and is shot marvellously in natural light which would have been a tremendous ordeal to achieve.

Expresses a fierce determination and strength of will,"Set in 1823-24 in what is now South Dakota, Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Iñárritu's The Revenant is loosely based on the experience of American fur trapper Hugh Glass who miraculously survived a bear attack and sought revenge against a Texas mercenary who abandoned him and killed his son. Adapted from Michael Punke's book, ""The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge,"" and winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture, it is a story of the resilience and endurance of a man fighting for survival under extreme weather conditions. Shot with natural light in minus forty-degree temperatures in Alberta, Canada, the film is a testament not only to the skills of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski, but to Inarritu's commitment to the authenticity of his craft.In the film, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a scout for trappers employed by the Rocky Mountain Trading Company. In the opening sequence, we learn that Glass was married to a Pawnee woman who was killed by soldiers. The scene then shifts to the trader's campsite where the men are attacked by warring Arikara Indians. The tribe, whose numbers had been decimated by a smallpox epidemic, was eager to trade pelts for horses and rifles but bore the scars of the white man's encroachment on their land. In the attack, the trappers suffer heavy casualties and only a few are left alive besides Glass: Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), Glass' half-Pawnee son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), young hunter Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and frontiersman John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), all persuaded by Glass to attempt an overland route back to their Fort Kiowa headquarters.Out hunting for food, Glass is viciously attacked by a bear and, though clinging to life, is buried alive by Fitzgerald who also kills his son. Though the bear is a CGI construction, the attack is stomach-churning in its gruesomeness and brings the viewer into the middle of an animal attack that has a startling feeling of reality. Amazingly regaining consciousness, Glass crawls through freezing snow and chilling waters to find Fitzgerald and revenge his son's murder. Surviving on scraps of animal carcasses, he is sustained by mystical messages of encouragement from his dead wife and the help of a Pawnee Indian who ends up being hung from a tree by the French with a sign around his neck saying ""We are all savages.""The Revenant, though not as emotionally involving as it should be, meshes a powerful struggle for survival with elements of spiritual awareness. Unfortunately, however, its spiritual message does not include forgiveness and perpetuates the myth that wrongdoing can only be redeemed by superior force. It is nonetheless a physically stunning film whose natural beauty reminds us of the existence of a land with forests, rivers, and streams that has not yet been, as author Charles Eisenstein put it, ""destroyed by development: cordoned off, no-trespassed, filled in, cut down, paved over, and built up."" Though he has little dialogue, DiCaprio's performance is one of the best of his long career and worthy of an Oscar nomination, his eyes and body language expressing a fierce determination and strength of will. For Glass, there is only one way out of it and that's through it. It is a punishing test of endurance both for him and for the viewer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Not pretentious, not boring, not overlong, not lack of substance","The Revenant is an example of real cinema. It is not a pretentious, pseudo intellectual and pseudo artistic work, it is not a brainless blockbuster, it is not an example of ""style over substance"" film as it is not a story or dialog oriented bore-fest. Some people say that it was overlong. Why does everyone need short films nowadays? Because, they want to consume a movie as soon as possible, then go back their home or text messages by their precious cell phones? Another complaint for the movie is lack of story and depth. I have to disagree. The story in the film is not sophisticated maybe and maybe it is a conventional one for such an unconventional film (not a typical example of mainstream cinema though) However, this doesn't mean that the movie is shallow or it has nothing to say to the audience. There is no real character depth in the film, but do we really need ""Shakespearean"" characters for this film? This is not ""Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" As for realism of the movie, of course there are some parts that require suspension of disbelief, but it does not ruin your experience. As for the bear scene, I didn't see anything like this before. Period. The movie could have been boring if Inarritu would have tried to tell us the love story between our survivor and his wife, because then the movie would be another Pocahontas tale or a very similar film with Terrence Malick's ""The New World."" Also The Revenant is not this year's Dances with Wolves or something. If we don't consider ""Man in Wilderness"", this is a totally unique and distinctive film. Honestly, I hated ""Birdman"", because it was pretentious and no heart and soul in the delivery. The Revenant is natural and emotional, yet not overly sentimental or heartwarming. I don't enjoy ""cold"" movies personally, but The Revenant is not such a movie. You feel the film. You feel the scenery. You feel the situation of the characters. However, the most important, you feel the film. Birdman? It is hard to say. Leonardo Di Caprio delivers very well, even if still his greatest performance is in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape?"" Nobody, but nobody can be better than Leo in that film in cinema history! Leo deserves the Oscar this time maybe (also he should have won in ""The Departed"") but honestly, if there is someone better than him in the movie, he is Tom Hardy! He does it again. One more time, he proves that he is one of the best actors in this generation and he steals every scene he is in. A trenchant, brutal and stunning performance! Leo's great performance is based on physical difficulties and emotion. Inarritu's direction is perfect here. No need to say that the scenery is beautiful, the cinematography is mesmerizing, the shots are terrific, the editing is brilliant, visual effects are superb etc. Don't expect some clichés like Di Caprio's character befriends Indians, then fight back etc. No. This is a different film. That's why it is not boring. The Revenant has a gripping story. It has a story. It has substance. Yes, maybe, in the second half, the movie loses its intensity and agonizing tone and maybe the final act is not that unusual or unforgettable or surprising, but still it delivers. The Revenant is not a thought provoking film, the revenge story is not bitter, intense or powerful like ""Unforgiven, but it has enough words to say about life and death, revenge, human nature and God. And I am very glad that the characters don't speak too much so we enjoy the great scenery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Five-Word Review: Visceral, Harshly Beautiful, Overlong Odyssey","It's the 1820s in Frontier USA. Left for dead, and having watched his son die in front of him, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) begins an epic mission of survival. With Tom Hardy (Legend), 2015's sweetheart Domhnall Gleeson (Ex Machina) and Will Poulter (The Maze Runner), The Revenant is directed by Birdman's Oscar-winning Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarittu.The Revenant is a truly beautiful film. Having heard the horror stories of one of the most gruelling shoots ever, I was eagerly anticipating it. Particularly admirable, though possibly insane, was the director's decision to shoot in all-natural light, lending the film a stark, realistic feel that really includes the viewer in Glass's struggle. By the end, I felt cold and uncomfortable inside the stuffy cinema: a definite achievement. And talking of uncomfortable, this is one of those films you'd class as hard to watch. Evoking winces, groans, and shape intakes of breath aplenty, the extent of DiCaprio's plight is expertly depicted. Gruesome stand-outs include a scene of sleeping inside a dead horse to avoid the cold (the realistic side of Empire's famous Tauntaun scene), an jaw-dropping bear attack, Glass's final confrontation with Hardy's Fitzgerald, and the opening scene, an extraordinary fight scene between vengeful Native Americans and the fur- trappers Glass belongs to. In the latter Iñarritu gets to display his limitless propensity for tracking shots that he used to great effect in Birdman, with the camera following one person until their death, then following their killer similarly, and so on. Ultimately, a truly spectacular feast for the eyes, with credit to both the director and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, on course for a third consecutive Oscar following Gravity and Birdman.Further praise must go to the acting. Obviously DiCaprio deserves all the plaudits for a properly fantastic physical performance (though in terms of his greatest career performance one feels The Wolf of Wall Street should come more into play) yet at times he feels almost overshadowed by the fabulous Hardy. Following up a solid year of Mad Max: Fury Road and Kray biopic Legend (tragically unnoticed, like Johnny Depp for Black Mass, by major awards), Hardy gives a perfect villainous performance as the nihilistic, irreverent and self- interested Fitzgerald, even if, like Tommy Lee Jones in No Country for Old Men, his accent is thick enough to warrant subtitles. The two central performances, supported by more solid work from Gleeson and the increasingly respectable Poulter, in addition to the wonderful Duane Howard as a Native American searching for his lost daughter, provide the foundations for a properly epic film.Not that The Revenant is perfect; it's certainly overlong. Yet at the same time it should not have been shorter - in order to achieve the epic feel it had to be too long. There will always be redundant scenes, and watching any man trudge through the wilderness will drag, even with the beauty of the film and the class of acting. However, overall The Revenant is hardly harmed by its flaws, earning its place among the elite of 2015. 86/100 d",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The Revenant (Review),"After striking gold at the Academy Awards last year with 'Birdman', Alejandro González Iñárritu is back with 'The Revenant', a tale of revenge and suffering. 'The Revenant' has experienced a hard shoot, Iñárritu said it would be all well and good to film in a studio, but the film wouldn't have the same impact. Instead, the cast and crew shot on location and experienced extreme weather conditions. This film is particularly important for Leonardo DiCaprio who is overdue for an Academy Award and should probably finally win this year. 'The Revenant' has received 12 Oscar nominations and is expected to win a slew of them and possibly the big awards. I found 'Birdman' unengaging and pretentious at times and felt in a year where there were outstanding films such as 'Whiplash' and particularly, 'Boyhood', it was a very undeserving winner.'The Revenant' is a visually stunning film and it boasts many outstanding sequences. It has some excellent central performances and boasts original cinematography and an atmospheric score. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are both mesmerising here and Iñárritu has really developed as a director. The battle sequences are wonderfully crafted and there are some beautifully shot landscapes to create the film's atmosphere. My only gripes with 'The Revenant' are its pacing is a little stretched at parts and its story is a little simplistic for a 156 minute running time. But the execution is where 'The Revenant' wows and it really is a work of art.The acting is where 'The Revenant' is most likely to flourish at the Academy Awards and Leonardo DiCaprio is stunning here. DiCaprio is a fantastic actor anyway and deserved to win for 'The Wolf of Wall Street', only he faced some fierce competition in that year in the form of Chiwetel Ejiofor and Matthew McConaughey, the latter ultimately taking the gong. His performance in 'The Revenant' is a very physical one and he carries the film with just his mannerisms and pure torture that his character is put through. Tom Hardy is also very good here, perhaps not quite Oscar-worthy, but he makes for a very interesting villain. His performance too is a very physical one and his character is well-developed. The last time DiCaprio and Hardy met on-screen was in Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' and they gel just as well here as they did there. The ultimate showdown between both actors in this film is breathtaking and is edge-of-the-seat entertaining. Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are in supporting roles for this film and give sound performances.Whilst the story is a rather simplistic for its lengthy run time, it is developed well enough so that one connects with the characters. This film is well-and-truly a revenge thriller first and a Western second. The suffering that DiCaprio's character experiences is at times, shocking and he goes to any lengths to survive. The battle sequences are especially mesmerising, particularly at the very beginning and the mauling of DiCaprio by a bear is extremely well crafted and frightening.Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography here is stunning and he will most likely win his third Academy Award for this. Characters are generally kept to the left side of the frame to give the audience a feel for perspective and Lubezki's landscape shots are wonderful to behold and really bring a sense into the desperate and desolate world that one immerses themselves in. Although sadly illegible for the Academy Awards, the score by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto here is endlessly atmospheric and heartfelt. It is used sparingly, but whenever the score is used it heightens the events being portrayed on-screen. Sakamoto has recently been battling cancer so it's a welcome return to form here and this is his first film score for an American film in a long time.Overall, 'The Revenant' is a very impressive film and technically outstanding. It makes for a very satisfying watch and the combination of DiCaprio and Hardy is a match made in heaven. Iñárritu's direction is a lot more assured here and this is complimented by an atmospheric score and beautiful cinematography. This is a much better effort compared to 'Birdman' which very undeservedly took the top awards last year. If this went on to win Best Picture, I would be fairly happy. 'Room' is the best film of the pack but it does shut out some audiences who sadly won't appreciate it. 'The Revenant' is very impressive and satisfying for those who stick with it.

Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this film and the beginning is good and the grizzly bear scene is very impressive but thereafter it falls away somewhat. Leonardo dicaprio seems to survive above all logic - bear attack, nearly dead and frothing from the mouth, bit then can crawl, icy river in a animal skins and then appears to make an almost instant recovery and can then walk again, neatly guts a horse in a blizzard and sleeps in it to keep warm, despite the fact that he's slept out for the previous nights with massive ice crystals in his beard and survived. He then looks quite well but collapses when his employer finds him and then a short time later is fit and fine to pursue the baddie. On another point all the musket shots are amazingly accurate but almost everyone forgets to reload them so there are a lot of surprised clicks and no shot (if you owned and understood a musket wouldn't you reload immediately you'd fired it?). Then there is end where leonardo pursues the baddie and watches him fall in a heap at the bottom of as slope. What shall we do? The logical thing is to reload the musket and take a shot at presumably a dead cert range, given how accurate they have been, but no we fall down the slope in a sloppy manner( maybe the bear bites and tree fall injuries are kicking in at last) and then ensures fight where no weapon is reused. The baddie avoids a tomahawk strike but gets stabbed in the back of the knee but leonardo abandons the seemingly effective and we have the classic strangulation scene before finally the baddie is thrown in the river to the delight of the Indians. I had hoped to enjoy this movie and had previously watched the hateful eight which was fun but a bit overlong (fast forward the first 45mins) but I have to say that quentin Tarantinos film was much better. Okay it's different take but still a western",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Absolute trash,"People do not like this movie because it is good- they like it because other people tell them to like it. It is not a good film. It is one of the worst films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I spent two hours on a pile of trash- I was forced to watch it, really, I never wanted to- but I went ahead anyway, and I'm glad I watched it, because now I can warn you about it. Do not watch this movie.First of all, the movie is boring. But it's also too exciting at the same time. When I saw this film, I thought it had been made by a crazy person, because there was no plot as far as I could tell. All I saw was a neverending cavalcade of images- men running through the snow, getting bloodied up- shadows and lines and whispering, and big burly bearded pioneers. It was like the anti-violence therapy that Alex gets in A Clockwork Orange. I realized that this was a film that cared more about its visuals than its core message- it spent billions on renting and props and setting and cameras- but spent almost nothing on making the characters likable or having any lines. They could have made it a silent movie- nobody ever talks, except for a few seldom occasions. Some screaming, and a grizzled old pioneer tells a crazy story about a dead chipmunk or something- but that's it. The script mast have been three pages long.I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio- I had never seen a film with him in it before this one- so I didn't need to be confused about which grizzled old pioneer he was. But I was so confused. All the bearded mountain men looked identical- I couldn't even tell the protagonist from the villain. I didn't even know there was a villain until the very end, when they meet up with each other. I did not know what was going on. All I saw was snow and men and blood. Everything about it was unclear.It was disgusting- he falls off cliffs, gets eaten by a bear, swims in sub zero water, eats a stomach or something- this is a snuff film, not a historical drama. I do not want to watch a man come near death for two long hours. But even the most action packed scenes did not excite me- strangely, they bored me. I was bored by this movie. It's not a good movie.It was made by the same stupid idiot as Birdman- I should have guessed- and we can see, in the first scene, that it is made by the same idiot as Birdman. The first scene has a bunch of pioneers stumbling around, setting up camp- and it's all taken in ONE SHOT, and the perspective of the camera sways around the actors, zigzagging- and then they get attacked by some indians, and they run around, and the camera follows them, instead of just staying still- all just in ONE SHOT- and then we get some cuts, which are nice, because I hate that ""one shot"" business that the guy always gives us. He did it enough in Birdman- he didn't need to do it here.Also, they added Native Americans in- even though the guy in real life DIDN'T HAVE ANY INDIAN RELATIVES- in fact, the guy who made this movie was criticized for how historically inaccurate it was- how dramatized it was, all in the hopes of getting some more cash from gullible suckers- how much unnecessary violence there was in it- and how he just added some Indians in there to be politically correct. How sad. How sad. There do not need to be any Indians. Not racist, it's just that there shouldn't be any Indians if there WEREN'T any Indians. This film is absolute trash from the gutter. Do not watch it. It is a waste of money.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A One of a Kind Cinematic Experience,"The Revenant is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy. This is an INTENSE film. It is brutal, bloody, and grossly realistic as a film. The Revenant features probably the best cinematography I have ever seen. I don't get how they filmed half of the shots in this movie. And they only used natural light as a source of light. Almost every shot of The Revenant looks beautiful. The costumes were great and the gore and blood is vividly shown. This is an amazing achievement as a film.This is the story of a man who is left to face nature on his own, and he must survive in order to take revenge on his son's killer. Leonardo Dicaprio once again delivers an Oscar worthy performance. He was so good here. Half of his dialogue isn't even in English. You really see this guy's pain and anger in his journey for revenge. But just as good is Tom Hardy as Leo's enemy. Hardy was also so good because it almost seems like his character isn't even human. Hardy acts his character as if he is the Devil himself. The supporting cast is also very good, especially Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter.The action is amazing. The first 45 minutes is so riveting. I was on the edge of my seat because the movie moved at such a fast pace and there was so much action. And it was brutally violent. However, after that, the movie slows way down for the next about hour. This is really where we see Leo's journey in the wilderness. Also some subplots are introduced here and this takes away from the actual revenge plot. This was my only problem with the film. But the film gets going again by the last 45 minutes and it was a feast to watch.The Revenant is a film with amazing cinematography, excellent acting, and brutal violence. Leo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy were fantastic and the action is relentless. The slow second act is really the only flaw this film has. Overall, The Revenant is a cinematic experience.

The Revenant is relevant,"This is worth watching just to get a taste of what early settlers faced and how hard it was to earn a living sometimes at the cost of your own life too. No excuses are allowed for anyone that chooses to live off the land and take their chances. This is understood by those who do it. We get to see how being injured in the wild is not good. The weather never lets up and if you cannot hunt, you slowly starve to death. Its harsh to say the least. The rewards are there too. Collecting monies for doing this allows one to move up in the world to something better although risky and no guarantees because getting in and doing the work is one thing, getting out to collect is another. The local Indians just go nuts when they see a white man. Then, the competition is fierce as well. The laws that exist in civilization don't apply out there but men still use it as a guide on how far they are willing to go with each other. I thought that came in loud and clear. The star of the movie put in some good work but I don't see it as outstanding or Oscar worthy but what do I know? Politics and money may say different. Worth seeing but only once. Big screen does it justice but cable will do as well. No cold drinks during this movie as just watching it makes one cold. Good snack and popcorn for the taste not the tenseness.

"After a second thought, I'd rather rewatch ""The Martian""...","In 1823, in the wild Northern Plains of America, trapper Hugh Glass, played by never-Oscar-winning Leonardo Di Caprio, is savagely attacked by a bear, in a scene that became an instant buzz-maker and as far his (mis)adventures would go, only the starter. Indeed, he later witnesses the killing of his half-Native son by the bad guy, Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) and is left for dead in the freezing forest, with a body so severely mauled he can hardly breath, speak, or walk. Glass crawls his way out to the next river and then begins the harrowing journey of a man within an inch of life, but an eternity on the scale of his revenge. The only character I can recall who went through a worse situation in a film was a certain Jim Caviezl in a Mel Gibson's Biblical film.As hackneyed as it sounds, ""The Revenant"" is one of these films the expression 'cinematic experience' was invented for. It is a survival-into-wilderness tale that elevates the word 'pain' to unexplored territories, not even ""Cast Away"", and certainly not ""The Martian"". I complained about co-nominee Damon not having enough scenes to show the 'physical' struggle of a man trapped in a hopeless situation but if I had to rewatch a film, I guess I'd still go with ""The Martian"". I know no performance came close to Leo's and his Oscar win is as a mathematical certainty as the Titanic sinking. But there's a limit to how long a performance mostly made of suffering, grunting and agonizing can please you, no matter how good it is. François Truffaut said ""a movie should either show the joy or the agony of making the film"", now, talk about overkill.And Leo gets the lion share of recognition, and the awards... poor Caviezel didn't work with the right director. Speaking of whom, Inarritu and cinematographer Lubeski also deserve credit for overcoming the technical difficulties that undermined the shooting, from the weather to the lighting (even if it's not difficult to make beautiful cinematography out of beautiful landscapes). There's something in Inarritu's directing that literally made 'nature' alive and watching ""The Revenant"" was like penetrating the hostile wilderness, feeling like the pelt-trappers waiting for an arrow to erase one of us from life. Those were the unsettled days where men with greed by way of bravery, paved the way to the conquest of a yet unknown America. This 'unknown' feeling is conveyed in the opening sequence that reminds of the landing massacre in ""Saving Private Ryan"", where you know the quietness of nature is only the omen of an imminent violence.And from the graphicness, you know it's not a 'savage' vs. 'civilized world' thing, it's just men protecting their possessions, expressing their natural instinct, like Glass protecting his son from the suspicious eyes of the other trappers or the mother bear attacking Glass to protect her cubs. What I own, I protect. I liked that aspect. And this is why ""The Revenant"" didn't need the surreal moments, where Glass is haunted by the visions of his deceased wife, like in ""Gladiator"" (a part I didn't like either). A film of such sober ambitions on the field of storytelling shouldn't indulge to usual supernatural 'interludes', especially when they're so expected in Native-themed movies.Actually, I'm not even sure the film needed the revenge either, which was a first departure from the real story. Apparently, there was a need of a human antagonist, as the unscrupulous and manipulative Fitzgerald. So, for all its harrowing visuals, the film sticks with the classic ""good vs. evil"" thing. Still, Tom Hardy adds a lively touch to a rather introspective film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than his actions, so despite the verbal richness of his role, he still says more with his eyes, and looks like a ferocious beast who'd never hesitate to attack when smelling the danger. The final confrontation, although conventional, is like the recreation of the bear scene, proving that once you hit a man's deepest instincts, the beasts inside awakens. What I own, I protect, and for what I protect, I kill.And it's only when he remembers the words from a Native helper that Glass stops acting like an animal. And this is when you get the meaning of the title. ""The Revenant"" carries this come-back notion, but it also has to do with the French translation as 'revenant' is a 'soul' or a 'spirit'. Hugh Glass is much alive, as he carries the soul of a deceased family, and it's his connection to the world of the dead that keeps guiding him in his road for survival and his quest for justice. It's powerful, but did we need to have it said, on the nose?Now, what lies behind this last shot?Maybe the sadness of a man whose soul can rest now, but whose heart is still tormented. An end that is waiting for a new beginning? A sort of 'what now?' I'm still puzzled by that last shot, but I think there's an interesting correlation with Leo's role, so much has been said about it: he swam in cold waters, ate a raw buffalo liver, and went through the most painful extreme, he'll get his overdue Oscar, and he'll never have a more difficult role. So what can he do after?Well, I just want to conclude in a lighter tone and say 'give him the Oscar and give him a break, and a few fun roles in movies that express –this time- the joy of making a film.'",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Left me slightly disappointed,"I went into this film with high expectations - i love Di Caprio and with this being his oscar winning film i was excited! Unfortunately, these expectations were not met and the film left me deflated. The plot itself is okay but is overshadowed by the performances not being anything special. My main gripe is that i feel Di Caprio is criminally underused in the film and he is reduced to crawling around and grunting for the majority of the film. I feel Leo has 10 performances or more that outplay this one and the lack of dimensions within the character is not his fault whatsoever. In contrast, the action sequences within this were superb and balanced the gore with reality perfectly. This is nowhere near one of Leo's best but the visuals and action are superb.

Why is this movie such a disappointment?,"Could it be that you can let one miracle pass but not dozens? Is it because of all those great actors that don't make any difference at all (lots of grunting and mumbling beards)? Or the utter predictability of the story? Maybe I just can't take the never-ending hunger for revenge anymore, a subject Hollywood just keeps revisiting - over and over.Looks like all it takes to win prizes is some nice visuals, a few good names, professional production. Add a few scenes from American history (maybe some are actually a bit historically correct).During the movie I could not force myself to stop thinking about the terrible cold and hypothermia and how he makes these fires being fully soaked. There are so many miracles, I cannot just shake those off and believe what happens next.I feared it would be something like this, gave it the benefit of the doubt, no luck.

Hateful 2,"The Revenant is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and is written by Mark L. Smith and Alejandro González Iñárritu. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and Will Poulter along with Domhall Gleeson and Forrest Goodluck.A frontiersman named Hugh Glass on an fur trade expedition in the 1820s is on a quest for survival after being brutally mauled by a bear.The Revenant is a movie that really grew on me over the course of a week. When I initially saw it, Christmas Day, I hated this movie with a passion, but after a week of contemplation, I can officially say The Revenant is one of the best films of the year.If for nothing else, this movie is spectacular just on a visual level. With an astounding feat in cinematography,mastery of CGI, (especially in a scene with a huge bear) and the use of natural lighting, this movie transports you to the unforgiving and ill- tempered wilderness, Mister Hugh Glass had to trudge through.The direction by Iñárritu in this movie was a bit uneven. He made the active decision to use continuous shots which worked to some extent, but when the focus is placed on multiple moving subjects, it becomes rather disorienting. With that said, these continuous shots work at holding the intensity when the focus is placed directly on DiCaprio and/or Hardy.Moving past its visual style and into the depths of tits plot, this movie was met with a myriad of problems. The largest of these problems involved this movie's genre. Unsure if its a survival drama or a revenge thriller but sure it wants to be art-house, The Revenant, in turn, fails at all three. It flops as a art-house movie because there isn't enough in the story to be something mind bending. It fails as a revenge thriller because aside from three phenomenal confrontations, revenge is rarely mentioned. Finally, it fails as a survival drama because of the predictability behind Glass' character.Speaking of Mister Glass and switching back to the positives, Leonardo DiCaprio barely uttering a word in English, gives the single best physical performance, I think I've ever seen. DiCaprio masters his character to deliver a spectacle of absolute realism. Brooding, somber, and broken DiCaprio earns himself another Oscar nod.Tom Hardy is also absolutely astounding and does manage to out shine DiCaprio in some scenes nearing the end of the movie. I foresee a possible Oscar nod on his part as well. A major surprise for me was to see Will Poulter deliver a very nuanced performance, more than holding his own against the two seasoned actors.The Revenant is a deeply flawed but ultimately wholly entertaining movie with great performances all-round and a great deal of visual charm. The Revenant gets a B+ or a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Recipe for pretension,"Take one whole side of 'Inferno' (1953, Robert Ryan, Rhonda Fleming); add two cups of 'Grizzly Man' (Werner Herzog) and one of ''Apocalypto'; a sprig of 'Into the Wild' and a dash of 'There will be Blood'; season with a tablespoon of Tarantino. Let the whole mess half bake for 256 minutes at maximum carnage. The result is a film in which Iñarritù's undeniable talent succumbs to the public's insatiable appetite for screen violence for its own sake. James Bond on his best day could not take the sadistic punishment meted out to Leonardo di Caprio in this parable of 'vengeance is mine'. Somewhere along the line, amidst all the gore, punctuated by delicate and sometimes mawkish moments of dreamlike spirituality, the story loses sight of itself. Not to say that the hundred million budget wasn't well spent. The opening battle scene and the near-fatal encounter, early on, are superbly done. Some of the best CGI I've ever seen put to good use.

Disappointing and over-hyped,"This films exposes Leonardo DiCaprio as a mediocre actor. Never at any point is the viewer able to get past his awkward over-acting and be drawn into the film. DiCaprio was entirely miscast in this role. He still looks too young to have a teenage son and the makeup and hair in this film doesn't change that perception. None of it is convincing. He even manages to make the real stunts look fake. Aside from that, the film is terribly slow and isn't over when you want it to be. It's gratuitous to a comical level in its violence, which cheapens it and makes it gimmicky. I actually laughed during the film's climax because it was so absurd. Tom Hardy stole this movie however.

The Epic Western revisited,"As most IMDb.com contributors, I have seen my share of Western movies. Most of them tend to glorify the conquest of the American West and contribute to the romantic image a lot of people still have of the Wild West. This movie is both a Western and an anti-Western: it tells us some very profound things about the way the United States was shaped in those early years (the story is set in the 1820's), but at the same time it does so in a very unromantic way. Maybe that's one reason why this movie has done so well with the jury that decides on the Oscar nominations: it's an epic Western, a genre held in high esteem in Hollywood history, but it is very much a Western revisited. The improbable chain of events frontiersman Hugh Glass is involved in, can sometimes get quite improbable: some scenes were so unlikely it drew laughs from the audience. Surely it is not a spoiler to mention that Mr. Di Caprio sleeps inside a horse (after having disembowled it) or has a close encounter with a grizzly bear. But also minor elements seem unlikely: e.g., how do you keep your gunpowder dry after having been submerged and swept away for miles on end by a glacial river ? Hugh Glass is, in many respects, very much a one dimensional character: the lone hero, lusting for revenge. But is doesn't do the movie justice just to leave it at that easy criticism. At the same time it is a quite profound movie. What moved me most about it was the way nature, and life itself, is portrayed. It is unforbidding, starkly beautiful and harsh and goes it's own course, indifferent to mankind. The overwhelming beauty of nature, the mountains, the rivers, is, besides Mr. Hardy and Mr. DiCaprio, a main character in this movie. There are many moving scenes where director Alejandro Inarritu draws our attention to just that: sometimes he just lets us watch the river, the moon or the trees. The way Hugh Glass slightly touches the dead horse as a sign of respect for being his 'host' is strangely compelling, although it's a detail in a movie that grips you right from the start with its daredevil adventure and gruesome action... Oscar experts have correctly noticed that this movie is also expertly well edited - the action scenes, especially the one where Mr. Di Caprio meets a grizzly bear are very, very skillful. A special mention also for the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki: he makes the 1820's really come alive and adds reality to the scenes by using natural light and allowing his camera lens to be fogged or splattered with blood...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Well-Done.,"The Revenant is one of the greatest movies I've seen in my life everything in this film felt real and scenes in this film felt so intense especially the bear attack, Leonardo DiCaprio deserved that Oscar after being snubbed like 10 times throughout his career, I still think he should have won that Oscar in 2012 and 2013. This movie is about a guy who gets betrayed and left for dead by his own hunting team, but luckily he got up and went all the way to get his revenge on them, mostly to Tom Hardy's character.The main character barely had any dialogue and the film is 2 hours and 30 minutes long which is incredible, my favourite quote from Leo's character is ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I done it already."" it gives the character power and more strength even more than an average superhero gets.The entire film looked so real and it felt like we weren't even watching a movie and more like a documentary or a guy went back in time and shot all the stuff that happened, one of the reasons why the movie looked real was because of the lightings, the movie crew did not use one single studio light and only used natural light or fire which was really impressive and it this movie has one of the best cinematography ever put into a film. This is a movie that will be remembered for a very long time people in the next 10-20 years will go back and check this movie out and study it just like other great classic movies like 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Disappointing...pool of boredom,"Just to say a little, I watch a lot of movies. I know when a movie is technically sound and when a script is mediocre. I was excited about going to see this movie. Everything seemed interesting, DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Alejandro as director. However, this movie was not engaging throughout the movie. The first 35 minutes of the movie are good, then around the second act, it gets crucially dull, then the last 35 minutes are good, but the plot of the script of this movie is not intriguing. The movie could have been shorter and it would have been better in my opinion. The characters were very flat, however, Tom Hardy's character was by far the most multi-dimensional and characteristic. The cinematography was astonishing in every aspect, the acting was great, but the story was monotonous and slow paced. I would not recommend this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Outstanding Movie,"Screenplay and visuals of this movie are so beautiful that force to watch many of its scenes over again to absorb their wonderfulness. Many abstract scenes are very well put in The Revenant, such as those of the wildness, loyalty and unfaithfulness, toleration, war, gratitude and vengeance; all sewed in a continuous and beautiful harmony.It is a kind of movie that drives the audience from the start to the end, in an intensified focus about all its characters and events.If it wasn't the important role yet weak performance of the ""stupid kid"", I'd give it 10/10 without a second thought. Still, The Revenant is one of the best, and definitely worth to be watched again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Beautiful but exhausting,"""As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe... keep breathing.""It's only been a year since Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu delivered the award winning Birdman and somehow he managed to deliver another visual masterpiece in record time. To follow up such a groundbreaking film like Birdman, with an epic adventure film like The Revenant is mesmerizing. But Gonzalez doesn't deserve all the credit, his films have stood out because of Emmanuel Lubezki's groundbreaking cinematography. The best thing about The Revenant is without a doubt its visual style. And the same could be said about Lubezki's previous efforts: Gravity and Birdman. In three years Lubezki has delivered some of the most beautiful looking films of our decade (and I'm not even including The Tree of Life which he worked on in 2011). This man is pure genius and will without a doubt win his third Oscar in a row. I hope the two continue to work together and deliver more visually inspiring films.Leonardo DiCaprio deserves all the accolades he's received for his physically demanding performance here. From the very first scene we see him face one obstacle after another as the opening sequence takes place while he is being attacked by a group of indians during a fur trading expedition. It's not much later when the much commented bear mauling scene takes place, but that is only the beginning of his struggles. DiCaprio gives it his all and even though this isn't the best performance of his career, it will finally be the one that gives him the Oscar. Tom Hardy also delivers a fantastic supporting performance as John Fitzgerald, the man who wants to leave him behind. The film ends up feeling like one long chase in a similar way as Mad Max Fury Road, although at a much slower pace. A survival/revenge film like this has never looked so beautiful. The film is a bit too long and it eventually begins to wear down, but it's a constant feast to the eyes despite the exhaustion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One against an enraged nature,"I still remember rooting for Leonardo DiCaprio at the 2016 Oscars. Another great role of a really cool actor. And this time the statuette was finally in Leo's hands. He deserved it.But a great picture is not only the merit of the main actor. The film directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a grandiose result of the joint work of the entire film crew. In our era, it is rare to surprise someone with the high quality of filming, magnificent special effects and other similar characteristics. But Inarritu decided to take a risk by spending a lot of time preparing this project. And the result is worth it. A peculiar presentation, a non-trivial approach to work - all this gave us a picture with a memorable story and an unusual look at the story of the main character. This movie should definitely be watched on the big screen. And it's not about enjoying large-scale scenes. Such a format, in my opinion, will allow you to feel well how difficult it was for the entire film crew during work. Cold landscapes, boundless forests, suffocating frost, oppressive silence of trees - together they plunge deeper and deeper to the very bottom, where the hopelessness of loneliness awaits. And let the topic of survival is not new, but it is Inarritu's approach to this topic that makes viewing especially interesting.The viewer is presented with the tragic story of hunter Hugh Glass, who, helping the rest of the hunters to escape from the Indians and return to his group, finds himself in danger after being attacked by a bear. DiCaprio's game in the tense moment of a collision with a wild, angry beast inspires some kind of animal horror. The actor plays so cool. I still remember how, already knowing about the upcoming scene, I still squeezed the armrests of the chair, I was literally paralyzed for a minute while watching the fight. It looked so realistic thanks to Leo's game that I couldn't come to my senses for a long time. However, Glass decides to fight for his life to the end in order to survive and take revenge on the one who left him alone to die. And each subsequent step of the main character, which is given to him with unprecedented difficulty, seems to deprive him of humanity. Glass goes through a rebirth, becomes a new being that will surely survive and still reveal itself to the world. This story clearly shows that sometimes you need to become a beast, to suppress humanity in order to survive.Tom Hardy played well in the film. Already a famous and skillful actor, whose work has been appreciated, takes a new peak for himself. He's an antihero. He is neither good nor bad. He's just a man who did what he did because he thought it was the right thing to do. The motivation of the character is clear, and the attitude towards him is twofold. A great role for Hardy. He was remembered by dissolving into his character.The film tells about unshakable willpower, courage and faith, as well as how easy it is to lose humanity. He shows that it is necessary to go to the end without giving up in order to achieve the goal. In every breath of life you have to fight, otherwise death threatens. This film also demonstrates that it is at such moments that we begin to believe and hope. When you are on the verge of life and death, you need support. It is different for everyone, whether it is faith in God or the support of loved ones.The picture is really good. Heavy and bright, unusual and mundane, stringy and chopping. You can find a dozen more epithets. It is important that such a work was born. The film teaches a lot. The main thing is to fight for life until the very end. After all, sometimes we think that we are much weaker than we really are. And the example of Glass is a great opportunity to understand that there is a beast in each of us, that one day it will be able to break out to save a person in us.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"""Revenge is in God's hands...not mine.""","Leo's first-and as of yet, only-Oscar. And after watching this film, there is no question why. His performance throughout is impeccable. He was stellar in his ability to convey the brutality of the setting and scenario while speaking very little. Most of the feeling of his character comes from his facial expression and body movements. Amazing to say the least.There was also beautiful cinematography throughout. The barren mountainous setting in the depth of winter is enough to make you feel chilled throughout the movie... even under a warm blanket. I felt mildly uncomfortable the entire time while watching the hell that Leo and others endure.The plot is simple, yet powerful and inspiring. The story of a man, battered by loss, heartache, and misfortune but whose will to enact justice empowers his painstaking fight to live. ""As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight.

pretty good movie weighed down by pretensions,"To be sure, this is a gripping movie, which kept me engaged for the full, long ride. It's a showcase for Leo's acting. The setting is ruggedly gorgeous, only occasionally diminished by obvious CGI. A big screen movie for sure.The movie has two main flaws. First is plausibility. If you know what the word ""revenant"" means (I had to look it up), it's not a spoiler to say the alternative title could be ""The Cat with Nine Lives."" Which is to say the plot is a bit over the top and not plausible in ways that I couldn't specify without spoilers. It's a screenplay written by someone who watches movies, which belies its earnest desire to be realistic.The SAT word title is a clue to the bigger flaw, which is that this movie oozes with artistic pretension from the first frame to the last. Actually, that's not quite rigtht. It oozes with Oscar-contender pretensions. It's almost a parody of a movie built to be an Oscar contender. You can image scenes appearing in a screening room scene from a parody of Hollywood ambition. The final shot made me laugh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Leo will do anything for that Oscar!,"This is a good film, it's dark, gritty and brutal. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a great performance, he shows us how he'll do anything for that oscar.

The film is long and can feel slow at times, but it's entertaining watching Leo's character fight for survival on his pursuit for vengeance. If you can't handle violence and blood then this isn't for you, but if you enjoy survival, historical or any film with Leonardo than you'll like this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Leo definitely deserves it this time,"Leonardo DiCaprio probably made this film for the sole purpose of securing his first Oscar's, the man did the impossible this time, he fought with a wild bear, slept inside the corpse of a dead horse, he achieved a great job of performance this time so there's no excuse for not giving him the trophy. The movie itself is of course awesome, perfection and neatness clearly appear in every frame, every shot and every detail, in music, editing, costumes, makeup, in every tiny detail you can feel the hard work, however, and though its runtime is relatively long, I think the movie lacks a strong backbone of a story, it didn't focus enough on the romantic relationship between Leo and the native American girl, we didn't know how they met or what brought her in his way, it could dedicate a few minutes to the kidnapped tribal girl and how she was rescued, there's not even a female protagonist! I'd give Leo 9/10, the movie making 8/10 and the movie story 5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The Revenant (2015),"Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck, Paul Anderson, Duane Howard, Arthur Redcloud, Kristoffer Joner, Lukas Haas, Brendan Fletcher, Melaw Nakehk'o, Vincent Leclerc. (R)Story of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), real-life frontiersman guide who is horrifically mauled by a bear, witnesses the murder of his half-Pawnee son (Goodluck) at the hands of a trapper (Hardy), and is left for dead by the same man. The tenacity he uses to survive and persevere in the wilderness is rooted in an almost supernatural demand for vengeance--the title refers to someone who has come back from the dead with a dreadful purpose. A strikingly beautiful yet doggedly uncompromising film, dominated by Iñárritu's scorching but desolate vision, Emmanuel Lubezki's stunning photography (the untamed wild has rarely looked so gorgeous yet threatening at the same time), and DiCaprio's physical, mostly silent performance of a haggard obsessive who survives only for retribution (all three won Oscars for their work). A grueling experience at two-and-a-half hours where credibility is stretched at least one time too many for the sake of narrative convenience, but unforgettable no matter one's opinion. Loosely based on historical record, through the true story is even more amazing (if less dramatically satisfying) than the one on screen!87/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

However most of the story is actually true, Hugh Glass walked, crawled and swam, surviving on stuff that would make a billy goat puke to get back to Fort Kiowa, South Dakota.Leonardo DiCaprio gets the academy award for this performance and the film also gets best cinematography and best directing in the 2016 Oscars need I say more, watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Man vs wild and beauty vs cruelness,"The director Alejandro González Iñárritu is back with The Revenant. After the success of Birdman, he returns with the real life story about the frontiersman Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Glass is left for dead in the wild and is forced to fight for his survival and at the same time he swears revenge on those who left him for dead. The Revenant is a renowned film, partly due to the difficulties during the making of it, but also because many feels it is finally time for DiCaprio to get his well deserved Oscar.The Revenant is incredibly beautiful, shot with only natural light. The film crew practiced the takes during the day, and shot them later when the light was perfect with only a few hours to spare. Iñárritu's demanding style and the different weather conditions, caused according to the rumors, many to leave the film. Perhaps understandable but nevertheless the result is stunning. Iñárritu's long takes and tracking camera movements are consistent. He rather shows us the action with brutal realism, than enforce it with fast cutting. Brutal realism really is the right word for The Revenant. Our eyes are not spared of anything, even if a hand gets cut in half or a person shot through the stomach. It really feels as though we are right in the middle of the film, rather than an audience watching from a platform.The Revenant is to me a man vs wild film. Other films, such as Deliverence, Aguirre, the Wrath of God and Into the Wild comes to mind. Terrence Malick's nature influences are visible. At the same time as the film is incredibly beautiful, it is also extremely brutal. In one scene we watch enchanting landscape and northern lights, but in the next we also see how cruel nature can be. Next to DiCaprio, Tom Hardy plays an Oscar nominated supporting role as the bad John Fitzgerald. The Revenant is really worth your time and truly something out of the ordinary. Prepare yourselves for a dramatic movie about how man and natures, cruel and beautiful paths cross. I grade it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the best looking films i have ever seen.,"The Revenant stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson. Its about the story of Hugh Glass, and its road to revenge against Fitzgerald. As i previously said, this movie has one of the best cinematography I have ever seen. There are really long shots, and wide shots throughout the movie and its mind blowing. Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal, his performance its mainly physical, not really talkative. I think Leo really does deserve the Oscar this time. Tom Hardy is also great. All the actors make an amazing work in the movie, even that kid from the maze runner. The story its really riveting as you want Hugh Glass to succeed in his long and hard journey of revenge. There is a scene with a bear, and its really something. The scene looks gross, and bloody but in a really necessary way, and it is really realistic. The only real flaw that I have is that the film makes some weird scenery and it is understandable for the character, but it just came off as not necessary. It does come off as pretentious but it really did not take me out from the amazing journey of Glass. 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Its a big production with great costumes, great acting and great visuals... the problem is that nothing happens. Its not an art film like e..

This movie did not disappoint in that regard. It was gritty and believable (sort of--Hugh's legend received a couple embellishments) with beautiful cinematography and top-notch acting.It was also not a surprise. I first learned of Hugh Glass in junior high. When The Revenant came out, it instantly went to the top of my must-see list. Because Hugh's story is of one man's struggle for survival in the wilderness, I knew it had to have a lot of scenes with only one actor. And it did. But those scenes could have been tightened up a lot. Two and a half hours is a long time for a movie in which very few things actually happened and the things that do happen you mostly expect.

Hugh Glass has a bad day,"Released in late 2015, ""The Revenant"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass, a man who in real life survives a mauling by a grizzly bear and makes his way crawling and stumbling 200 miles to Fort Kiowa, in South Dakota, after being abandoned without supplies or weapons by fellow explorers and fur traders during General Ashley's expedition of 1823. Vengeful, Glass then sets out to confront his trapping partners who left him to die. The movie's loosely based on these events, but the locations are far removed from the Missouri River area of South Dakota, which makes for a more scenic experience in light of the locations being spectacular.The story was first made into a movie as 1971's ""Man in the Wilderness"" starring Richard Harris and John Huston. Whereas that movie has the better story ""The Revenant"" has the better filmmaking. It's not just that it's a more expensive production with outstanding location shooting and quality actors, but also the modern filmmaking technique is superlative. If you like wilderness survival/adventure movies then ""The Revenant"" is a must. While the film runs over two and a half hours it kept my attention throughout and didn't seem that long.

An existential tale of survival and revenge by the great Iñárritu,"Adapting the mostly true experiences of fur trapper Hugh Glass that took place in Montana and South Dakota in 1823, ""The Revenant"" is an amazing existential tale of survival and revenge that'll leave you feeling gutted and skinned, thanks to the remarkable vision and cinematic artistry of the great Alejandro G. Iñárritu, the director of last year's multi-Oscar-winning ""Birdman"", and who has just won his second Best Director Oscar for ""The Revenant"". He was also the Mexican genius who gave us three narrative-juggling films of great humanism: ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel"", the latter I consider his masterpiece.Forget the stories of its difficult production (being filmed in authentic remote and bitter cold locations), and how star Leonardo DiCaprio actually suffered throughout by being immersed in freezing water, stuffed into a horse carcass or actually consuming a bison liver, what you'll bear witness to on the screen will pull you completely into its stark, ruthless, primal world and hold you there, thanks to DiCaprio's career-best performance as the film's protagonist which justifiably earned him his first Best Actor Oscar. The film is long (arguably too long) and unrelentingly slow, but few viewers will find themselves bored due to its calculated hypnotic pull, completely enwrapping viewers in its frozen world almost as much as Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" put us in the desert. Above all, it has two sequences that will stay with you forever: the grizzly bear attack which occurs, as do many sequences, in one seemingly single long take -- but I found even more effective the first Indian assault. That scene delivers such brutal realism I actually felt terrified as never before in a movie theater due to the scene's directorial staging of the trappers' panicking while the Indians' arrows frenetically strike the men's flesh with the force of stinging missiles. This scene makes every other Indian attack I've ever seen in a film postured and artificial.Iñárritu is a Mexican genius, born in 1963, who managed to build up an extensive amount of cultural experiences through early travels, beginning at age 17 by crossing the Atlantic on a cargo ship then working his way across Europe and Africa. After his journeys, he returned to Mexico City, majored in communication, then began a career as a radio station host interviewing rock stars and hosting live concerts while single-handedly building WFM into the number one station in Mexico. All these experiences apparently became the source of his eclectic filmography, beginning with writing and directing a famous Mexican TV pilot, ""Behind the Money"", and making a few short films before beginning his feature career with ""Amores Perros"" in 2000. His best work conveys a cinematic exuberance close to a Mahler symphony in its scope, forming a synthesis of despair and joyfulness in rendering the human experience. ""The Revenant"" finds him at his most obsessive and committed during its long shoot in a way reminiscent of the epics of David Lean: an 80-day principal photographic schedule in the coldest weather at locations so remote it required more than nine months in unbearably torturous conditions, all due to Iñárritu's refusal to use computer-generated imagery (saving the few effects scenes that necessitated it). The director's monomania for realism became so intolerable that many crew members walked off the project (or were fired), and Tom Hardy wound up attacking the director, nearly strangling him. The efforts of Iñárritu (and his collaborators) can be seen in the final production.Cinematographer Emmaunuel Lubezki (whose nickname is 'Chivo' which means 'goat' in Spanish) has an affinity with this director (he won an Oscar for Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" before winning one for ""The Revenant""). After tests on 35mm and 65mm film stock, Lubezki and director Iñárritu decided to shoot ""The Revenant"" on 6K high-resolution digital to be able to schedule one more hour of shooting time per day, almost exclusively in natural light for authenticity. And since lensing Alfonso Cuarón's ""Children of Men"", Chivo has been justifiably famous for long unbroken takes (in fact, most of ""Birdman"" is constructed as if its entire drama is uninterrupted by a cut), and he continues that tradition, if in a less obvious fashion, with ""The Revenant"" in its Indian assault and grizzly bear attack..Though the film ultimately does not attain formal perfection, I left the theater carrying a new life experience unlike anything I'd seen before, achieved through Iñárritu's singular vision conveying a quintessential portrait of the American wilderness with great cinematic poetry. One of the year's most significant achievements in film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Survival and Vengeance in the Visceral Wilderness: A Cinematic Journey Through 'The Revenant',"In the frostbitten wilderness of ""The Revenant,"" director Alejandro González Iñárritu crafts a tale of survival and revenge that is as brutal as it is visually stunning. The film, a semi-biographical account of frontiersman Hugh Glass, is a relentless journey through the unforgiving American landscape of the 1820s, anchored by a performance from Leonardo DiCaprio that is nothing short of transformative.DiCaprio's portrayal of Glass is a raw and visceral tour de force. He communicates volumes with pained eyes and a body language that speaks to the sheer will to live. It's a role that requires physicality over verbosity, and DiCaprio delivers with an intensity that is palpable. The supporting cast, too, is commendable, with Tom Hardy's portrayal of John Fitzgerald providing a nuanced antagonist whose motivations are shaded with survivalist pragmatism rather than cartoon villainy.Iñárritu's direction is a masterclass in visual storytelling. The film's use of natural lighting and long, unbroken takes immerses the viewer in the environment, creating a sense of place that is almost tangible. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography captures the stark beauty of the wilderness with a palette that is both austere and mesmerizing. The camera moves with a fluidity that belies the harshness of the setting, creating a contrast that is jarring yet beautiful.The narrative, while simple in its core - man versus nature, man versus man - is elevated by its thematic undercurrents. The film explores the human spirit's resilience, the price of vengeance, and the indiscriminate cruelty of both man and nature. It's a story that resonates on a primal level, tapping into the universal fears and triumphs of survival.The film's pacing can feel glacial, mirroring the icy rivers and snowy plains that Glass traverses. At times, the movie's commitment to long takes and real-time storytelling results in scenes that linger longer than necessary, testing the viewer's patience. Additionally, while the film's commitment to historical authenticity is admirable, it occasionally veers into the realm of gratuitous brutality, which may alienate some audience members.The film's dialogue is sparse, and while this often adds to the immersive experience, there are moments where a few more words could have provided clearer context or deeper insight into the characters' psyche. The silence is powerful, but it sometimes borders on the enigmatic, leaving the viewer yearning for a verbal anchor.""The Revenant"" is a cinematic odyssey that is as punishing as it is poetic. It is a film that demands much from its audience but offers rich rewards in return. Its portrayal of the indomitable human spirit, juxtaposed against the indifferent majesty of nature, makes for a hauntingly beautiful film that lingers long after the credits roll. While it may tread slowly at times and revel in its own severity, it ultimately stands as a testament to the power of visual storytelling and the enduring allure of the wilderness narrative. It is a film that, much like its protagonist, refuses to be subdued, and therein lies its triumph.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Best in a long time.,"This is the best movie that I've seen in a long time. Of course, I love a true story, especially when it's so outrageous that it's too hard to believe! This is the story of Hugh Glass, a real mountain man. His buddy Jim Bridger is said to have been the original mountain man, but I don't think so. The movie left out a lot of Glass's story, like he was pursued by Indians along his way back to the fort, but proved himself almost invincible to the point that the Natives left him alone. The details of this event are convoluted, and the history can't be for certain, but the story is captivating, and the movie captures the drama. Acting, GREAT, script, GREAT, scenery, GREAT. I recommend it!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Surreal Cold Blood,"The Revenant tells the story of Hugh Glass in his survival after being mauled by a bear and betrayed by an arrogant fellow trapper. In this version, Glass has a son killed by Fitzgerald to turn this into a gritty revenge story. And it kind of works artistically, the movie paints the mood with absolute surrealism of grief and violence. Thematically, there was potential, but in the end it kind of shoehorns what could have been a painful realization. Either way, this is one of the most terrifically crafted films you may see in a while. The effort and ambition is shown at every imagery and that alone made The Revenant a pretty fascinating experience.The movie opens with Hugh Glass brooding over a tragedy of losing his wife, which made him protective to his son for being a reminder of her. Then it cuts to an expedition of trappers who are hunting for pelts, then attacked by a Native tribe and escaped; Glass is with his son, though having prejudice by Fitzgerald for being a half-Native. Then you get the story; I think the added elements is for the sake of giving Glass a colder motivation of hunting down the men who abandon him in his dying condition. It is also made to bring this journey a grander theme of spirituality and morality towards the force of nature, but it's kind of a stretch at times and it never becomes subtle either. What hurts more is the final part where Glass ends up verbalizing the theme of what he learned in his suffering. There should be pain on that sacrifice he had chosen, then yet he manages to witness that reward he was seeking for. The final note already feels a little unearned, but the last part just made it feel like a betrayal.Though what's perfect in this film is the filmmaking. There has been an interesting story behind the set where director Iñárritu pushes his craft, by even using natural light, and DiCaprio experiencing the dining struggle of the character. For the direction, it looks very magnificent, every shot of this film deserves to be seen in a big screen, it's just glorious to look at. But the most impacting are the images of death. The movie just pictures the coldness of the bodies like the loss of life is a big deal even in this image of fiction. This has been one of Leonardo DiCaprio's most committed performances, he had to actually eat a raw bison, if that's actually surprising to anyone, but the commitment is admirable and makes the performance compelling even with lesser words, we can see the sorrow and struggle in his eyes. The supporting are predictable great as well, Tom Hardy makes for an entertaining arrogant antagonist.The Revenant is all spectacle, but really priceless spectacle that you rarely see in a film this mainstream. The ambition is too enormous that it somehow drops the ball at the very end, it would have been thematically powerful if it was more subtle at that final few minutes. But it's the experience that made it brilliant. I wish it was only about Glass struggling to rise back avenging his son, the added spiritual theme just doesn't work as it wanted to be when it starts verbalizing it. Just let the action speak whatever it wanted to say, because the movie is really terrific at visual storytelling. It's just a small misstep for a movie already this grand, so The Revenant is definitely going to be the cinematic ride of your life.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Di Caprio is absolutely outstanding, and that says a lot about an actor who has proven his talent in many works. Hardy and Gleeson are not far behind.

The Revenant - Review,"The Revenant - an American biographical movie in western background in a wintry climate, which is also played as a character, happening in 1820's. Hugh Glass played by Leonardo DiCaprio is about a man who survived from a grizzly bear attack and survived to take revenge on his son's death. One of the recent films The Revenant is with a higher artistic level and strong effort of visual storytelling methods with least dialogues in the cold background with cold hearted characters. Mind blowing cinematography mention's the name of Emmanuel Lubezki's in wide through a zero lighting technique in the digital era.
At first, it's a peak for Alejandro González Iñárritu's directorial venture after giving a movie like Birdman. Here, this as a masterpiece of Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, which let him to bag him an Oscar. This film has Leo, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter as main characters to portray the novel with the same name. It starts with a hunter's point of view to hunt down preys and soon himself become a prey. Alejandro González Iñárritu and Mark Smith had done an applauded script to portray the life of Hugh Glass to expel the pain and sorrow of the lost of his only son who got saved once before by himself from a life threatening event. While talking about Leonardo's dedication he deserves more than awards as recognition for this movie.
As a director Alejandro's did justifiable work, in a scene like buried spot escape need some more explanation and information. Tom Hardy is always never given up on his roles; again this is a milestone for his performance as Fitsgerald. In climax as a convict he did a convincing performance and personally as a fan of Hardy, he and the entire team deserves a strong consideration and recognition for presenting such a movie with a high artistic level.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Cinematic masterpiece,"The Revenant is an incredible motion picture, with an emphasis on picture. This is a visual treat: Stunning scenery, incredible cinematography, poignant body language, perfectly crafted costumes, realistic grunge and gore, fantastic(al) fight scenes. This was an absolute treat to watch.The plot, which apparently is based on the life of a real human, is entirely unbelievably. But then, so are so many of America's tall tales, and that certainly doesn't make them any less entertaining. ... Unnecessary aside #1 There were a few jarring scenes, which is why I personally am rating it 9 instead of 10. Trim off 20ish minutes, and this is a near-perfect film. I appreciate wanting to be true to the source (which I assume happened here), but the director could have taken just a touch more artistic liberty.The acting was good, even very good. ... Unnecessary aside #2: I'm not certain why DiCaprio won Best Actor here. The acting just wasn't the focal point of the movie at all, and Tom Hardy stole every scene as the villain. He was by no means bad, but his performance didn't jump out at me as Oscar worthy.Finally, the soundtrack accented everything perfectly. Dark, dire, broody, staying away from western tropes (which this movie is certainly not, despite the genre labels).All in all, an absolutely great movie.

Leonardo DiCaprio Endures the Wilderness in Brutal Epic,"""The Revenant"" is a grueling, visually stunning, and immersive experience. Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki create a brutal and beautiful world that is both captivating and terrifying. The film follows Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fur trapper in the 1820s, who is left for dead in the wilderness after a bear attack and must fight for survival against both nature and his own group of fellow trappers.The performances in ""The Revenant"" are superb, particularly DiCaprio's. He brings a raw physicality to the role that is both captivating and visceral, conveying a sense of pain and desperation that is almost palpable. Tom Hardy is also outstanding as the ruthless trapper John Fitzgerald, delivering a performance that is both chilling and magnetic.However, the film's pacing can be uneven at times, and some of the characters feel underdeveloped. The film also has a tendency to indulge in its own brutality, at times feeling almost gratuitous in its violence.Despite these flaws, ""The Revenant"" is a powerful and unforgettable cinematic experience. The film's stunning visuals and expertly crafted atmosphere transport the viewer to another world entirely, one of harsh landscapes and brutal survival. It's a film that demands to be seen on the big screen and is an impressive showcase of filmmaking craft and talent.Overall, ""The Revenant"" is a visually stunning and expertly crafted film that is both intense and immersive, anchored by a powerful performance from Leonardo DiCaprio.

Should win best picture and rightly so.,"I've now seen all the films nominated for this years best picture Oscar bar one ( Spotlight ) and without a doubt , in my mind , The Revenant is the best of the lot . True , it's not a vintage year but this does have the feel of a film that will stand the test of time. Leonardo DiCaprio play Glass , a frontiersman who fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team , one of whom is particularly nasty , played by Tom Hardy. This is a classic survival/ revenge movie that looks fantastic ( especially the bear fight ) and despite being over two and a half hours , never flounders and that's mainly thanks to a career defining performance from DiCaprio.

Definitely go see this movie and look above the entertainment aspect and appreciate it for everything. The CGI in this film was great as well but what really made me admire this film a lot was the lack of using CGI. The landscapes were all real from the mountains to the forest. You do not see that a lot in movies these days so it was amazing to see this was REAL life shooting. Just thinking how they filmed in parts of Canada and Argentina with a crew of 100+ is amazing.

Just watching a man get the hell beat out of him at ever turn is surprisingly tiring to watch. The message of this movie is quite simple: The power of vengeance to fuel a man's will to survive. By the time you leave the theater, you just want to sit by a fire and sip some hot cocoa.The visuals are stunning. Panoramic nature shots, gripping close ups, computer graphics (The bear), and everything in between was fantastically done.

Breathtakingly Beautiful Scenery Backdropping The Worst That Humanity Can Do To Each Other,"The Revenant surprised me, and in more ways than one!I went along to a screening of this film today having a fairly good idea of what to expect after watching the trailer and reading a couple of non-spoiler reviews - a harrowing tale of survival set amongst a cold and desolate wilderness area somewhere in the north of America. Apart from a compelling story, what came as a wonderful surprise was the stunning cinematography captured by a brilliant team of cameramen under the very clever eye of a skilled director. Just the panning shots from ground level up into the magnificent tree canopies are enough to feed your spirit as one season gives way to another or daylight changes to a night sky - and as the tiny ice crystals coating their spindly branches then glimmer in the moonlight. Add into the mix those awe-inspiring Rocky Mountains, so often cut through by fast flowing rivers that forge their way down breathtaking gorges and canyons, and you have a panorama to rival those in other epics like Doctor Zhivago and Dances With Wolves. Every scene was breathtakingly beautiful, while many, and often at the same time, were grotesquely gory. The filmmakers incorporated a backdrop of the most stunning of scenery with the worst humanity can do to each other and both were played out in all of their fullness. Even in the most horrific of scenes, the background was a visual wonder. Based on a true story, this cinematic marvel was shot in the wilds of Alberta and British Columbia in Canada - and much to my delight, around many of the places my husband and I visited only 18 months earlier so it was easy to recognise a few, and make me long to go back for a longer visit. Then for one unforgettable scene where Leonardo DiCaprio had to brave a freezing cold river and subsequent waterfall, the location moved to Montana in the USA. Finally, the cast and crew had to be transported to the southernmost reaches of Argentina for the chilling - and yes, both meanings of the word - climax when the snow started melting in the north. With not only these eye-catching earthly wonders on display, audiences are also privy to two other phenomenal events - a spectacular meteor shower that comes to a watery grave, along with witnessing the power and destruction of a full- blown avalanche in all of its glory. The storyline is one of the most brutal anyone could ever imagine. Knowing it is what actually happened to a living being definitely makes your skin crawl, especially when you see the exceptional attention to detail the makeup artists put in to simulate the deep wounds from the hell on earth Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), along with many of his cast mates, are subjected to. As well as those cleverly delivered technical additions, the scenes move fast and furious, often taking you to places you're not expecting. Personally, I flinched visibly three times throughout the movie - two accompanied by very audible gasps with a hand covering my mouth as these scenes unfolded with either brute force or by taking an unexpected turn well, actually it was a very long plunge. I can only say I'm glad the director didn't decide to shoot them in 3D! This is definitely a film whose breathtaking landscapes should first be appreciated in a full cinema. For the screening I went along to today, much to my delight South Bank Cineplex delivered it on their huge Imax screen so each scene was absolutely captivating. And yet, this wasn't the only thing that held me captive or made me thankful I decided to discover why it was nominated so often, as well as won so many awards already, even before the Oscars have been held - a woman on her own watching a very blokey film. Mark L. Smith and Alejandro González Iñárritu have written a heartstopping screenplay based on fact that is definitely worth the telling in all of its gore and ruggedness. And if you really stop to think about it as the credits start to roll, the final few seconds contain a subtle but wonderful tie to the opening. I'm not going to tell you what it is you'll just have to go along to see for yourself, but don't forget to note those first few lines spoken by Hugh Glass in the Pawnee language so you can then reflect on them at the end, and maybe in a similar fashion to me. A very well-deserved 8 out of 10. P. S. Now I know why we were warned on our Canadian tour to talk loudly and make a lot of noise when wandering through the North American wilderness during bear season! I advise everyone else to remember as well after seeing this stunning film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
