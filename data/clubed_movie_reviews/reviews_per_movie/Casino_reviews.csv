"I enjoyed this more than ""Goodfellas"".","I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching ""Casino"" for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.The film is unusual in that it has two leading men with parallel stories. Sometimes Ace and Nicky (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) were in scenes together....often they were apart...each doing his own thing. As for Ace, he was a smart man who was in charge of one of Vegas' top casinos. He was tough...but basically honest for a mobster. As for Nicky, as you'd expect with a Joe Pesci character, he's a bit of a nut-job....often out of control and letting anger govern most of his decisions. Unlike Ace who had a veneer of honesty about him, Nicky was a hood...and didn't mind this. Eventually, the pair end up having a downfall. How and what happens to each you'll have to see for yourself.The parts of this film I enjoyed the most were when you learned about how Vegas operated. Seeing Ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting. And, in this sense, I enjoyed the film much more than ""Goodfellas""...also with the same stars and same director. This is because ""Goodfellas"" was mostly just about violence and crime...whereas ""Casino"" seemed to have more story and wasn't always about excessive violence and nastiness...not that the film is in any way a 'nice' picture. It's filled with obscenities, nasty folks and a few scenes of horrific violence. Think about this before you decide whether or not to see the movie.By the way, this is only a personal choice and doesn't really affect the movie much, but one thing I did not love about the film is the omnipresent pop music....which at times made the film seem like a music video. I think less of this would have been nice.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Robert De Niro, an icon of the contemporary Hollywood crime film...","Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese ""Casino"" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or nightDe Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tablesBut he had a fatal flaw 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and powerGinger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money 'Ace' knew that but he didn't careWhat he wanted was to marry herSharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desiresJoe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.)To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcerThe clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Typically fantastic Scorcese film,"I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the ""great film"" line, and Casino is certainly no exception.Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of ""Satisfaction"" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The most uncompromising studio picture of the 1990s.,"A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An underrated and undervalued Scorsese Classic,"If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Can't-Miss Story No Matter How Told,"As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a ""moneymaker"" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.If you are a gambler or know the ""wiseguy"" culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the ""old school"" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Scorsese classic,"While re-watching ""Casino"" just now I kept thinking of Spielberg's words re: Kubrick. ""Just try to stop watching one of Stanley's movies when you've already started,"" he said. ""It's impossible"".Perhaps, with Kubrick's passing, Scorsese became the greatest filmmaker on the planet. ""Casino"" is just an unbridled jolt of cinema, a three hour movie that feels like an hour and a half, a breakneck pace that still allows for rare depth in its performances and characterisations. It's the best performance Sharon Stone ever put in; after the ridiculous ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Sliver"", they could have written her off if not for this. Her character's arc is tremendous.More than anything, ""Casino"" is a showcase of what Pauline Kael called ""film sense"", that implacable quality that all great directors have. Like Spielberg and Kubrick, Scorsese has a gift for knowing exactly what shot should follow which, is an absolute master of camera movements, angles, framing such that the movie streaks across the screen like fast-moving water over rocks, never once stalling or slowing down.It's brilliant, but it's not up with the director's greatest work like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", or ""Hugo"", which is a truly underrated masterpiece. It's a notch below, but when Scorsese is a notch below his best, he's still streets ahead of everybody else.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not horrible, but a little overrated","It's pretty entertaining and all you know, well made, good acting, all that. But after seeing it, I'm still thinking.. It's not really that great. One thing is that it's too long. It's fun to see the empire growing, and there is a lot happening, but it is still just too damn long.I am no big fan of mafia-movies, really, but I had this mafia craze a little while back and I saw The Sopranos, and all the biggest mob-movies, but still I was a little meh about this one.The reason for the high rating is that it's Scorsese, and that it's mafia. Those two combined often equals overrating. It's not bad, that's not what I'm saying, but it's not a perfect movie. I want to be more entertained, and more sucked in by a movie like this, Casino didn't quite do it. I can't say exactly what it was, maybe it was just my expectations being too high.Maybe I'll see it again some time, and then like it better.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself.","The opening 30 minutes or so of ""Casino"" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist—nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero—providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film ""The Departed"" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece ""GoodFellas,"" are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of—I personally do not think she's untalented as an actress—but she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in ""Casino."" So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie—the middle in particularly—really begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.I wish that ""Casino"" had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from ""GoodFellas,"" seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.I admired the physical production values of ""Casino"" as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you. Whether it's representational or not, when you get the notion that the filmmaker lost interest in the story he was telling, it's all for nothing.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic Film,"Casino is by far my favourite film.

The acting is flawless, story flows at a great pace for the full all but 3 hours, great narration and a great soundtrackPesci and De Niro play their parts so well as does Stone. When watching this film I started to wonder what PEsci is really like in real life. Is he a crazed man like he so often plays?

Brilliant acting. Superb story based on events that happened in real life.,"Martin Scorcese's harsh and yet delicately balanced masterpiece rises above anything petty meaning that if one wishes and has the ability and means to create a Sicilian mafia movie he should do so with grandeur and put into it as much effort as possible for people remember those who take advantage of their talent and circumstances and are diligent in their undertakings. Casino is in my opinion an epic, but it's much more than that. This film speaks even to those who dislike the subject of organized crime. You have to be objective when judging this movie and those of us who criticize everything that stands out amongst the grey background of that which is mediocre are fools who envy others' accomplishments and view them as insults to their own personal uselessness. Casino is one of the best movies of the 90's. In fact, in my opinion, it's one of the best organized crime movies of all time. Its moral is that no matter how tough you think you are there's always someone you answer to and that you ultimately will, indeed, if you screw things up.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I never knew Sharon Stone was so talented,"What a fantastic movie, thanks to its cast, top heavy with stars and fine direction of the ""Oscar begging"" Martin Scorsese. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are great, as always, together. But, surprisingly, it's Sharon Stone that comes of with all the acting credit, she simply effervesces as the gold digging casino hustler. After witnessing her performance myself I couldn't agree more, and think she deserves a place above Susan Sarandon who ""stole"" the Academy Award from under Sharon's nose.  The photography is phenomenal and combined with great acting is a recipe for a classy film.  However occasional brilliant sequences, are often marred by the continuous commentary, which prevents any real, deep, emotional involvement with any of the characters.  Great stuff, just slightly flawed.9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Very good but not without flaws,"Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.But I don't think that Casino is at all a ""perfect"" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know that it's not that high of a score from me--it's closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I'm going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10's.Casino is based on the story of Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein ""secretly"" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It's roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.The film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi's book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It's remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.One of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.Eventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese's directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.This is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That's a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.Another unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I've owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded ""mix tape"" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin' tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.Presumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that's what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein's suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.That Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I'm not sure the final result exactly worked.Of course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that's how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it's a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we're shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.But the slight flaws shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hugely underrated and very compelling film,"I don't consider Casino Scorsese's very best film(Goodfellas is my personal favourite), but it is a fantastic film and definitely one to see. It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Narrated for the Blind,"Fueled by mob bosses, two long-time friends make it big in Las Vegas. Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in ""Goodfellas,"" but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their ""Goodfellas"" roles. Stone is alluring.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Bloody Trip Down Memory Lane,"Wow. Can't agree with most of the reviews for this one.Love DeNiro and Scorcese and Goodfellas and Raging Bull are two of my favorites, but I found Casino hard to sit through, despite the great performances. I think Scorcese went to the DeNiro/Pesci/gangster film well once too often. I found the aging and diminutive Joe Pesci a little hard to believe as a Mafia enforcer and his ""love"" scene with Sharon Stone is unintentionally comical.Brutally violent, overly long, and with few laughs to break the monotony, I actually found myself looking at my watch halfway through. Non-stop narration is distracting and an odd choice for Scorcese.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
How Others See Us,"Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying.This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Scorsese spell...,"During its first forty minutes, Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" is pure narration, except for little spoken moments. It's a risky move, but then Marty has always been risky, and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it. Closing in at three hours duration time, it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular Scorsese tragedy.That's cutting it short, because there's a lot in the middle, but without telling you 'what' exactly goes on in ""Casino"", I'll tell you how you can approach it as a film.When Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is put in charge of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, he sees it as the perfect chance to erase the obscure past we call carry with us. However, his best friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) is not fond of legitimacy; and when he settles in Vegas to protect him, it's not long until he starts doing some business of his own.As Nicky himself puts it: ""The dollarAlways the dollar"". But if we go back, Nicky also expresses at the beginning: ""It was perfect. Sam was the perfect guy to run the casino and he had me, his best friend, and Ginger, the woman he loved"". We see Ginger (a monumental Sharon Stone) at first as Sam sees her, a light in the middle of the room (there's one scene where this translates literally in images, with Robert Richardson's cinematography-that contains a wonderful use of light-putting the rest of the room in a mild darkness, while De Niro stands in awe as Stone walks and works the room accompanied by a constant light), but she is actually the most complex character of the film.If you approach ""Casino"" as a movie to see the inside movement of the casino business and its ups and downs (a subject the film manages perfectly), you may not notice the complexity of Stone's character and her performance. But then, if you view the film as the study of the consequences of an arranged marriage and life, you might miss the best element of the film: Joe Pesci's creation of Nicky; something that's indeed better than his work in ""Goodfellas"".Ultimately, you may choose to take ""Casino"" as the story of a long-time friendship and the betrayals that come with the years because people change and want different things from life. Again, this (as the marriage thing) is a subject that the film dominates. That's how brilliant Nicholas Pilleggi's-together with Scorsese-adaptation of his own book is; it covers everything with every detail. They did the same thing with ""Goodfellas"" and it was so rich that you could get lost in the 'mafia' universe.Here, as in ""Goodfelas"" (both film share many similarities, more than anything in the ongoing decay of certain characters and images that seem obvious copies from the 1990 film and speak by themselves, about how great both movies are and that these similarities don't change that fact at all), you have to try to follow every plot line in order to witness every scene exactly as what it means in the movie.It's the only way you'll enjoy the many conversations between Sam and Nick that lie between the best of the film and, besides showing that De Niro is the best when it comes to calming someone down and/or persuading him to make another decision; but Pesci is better because his stubbornness allows him to evade discussions and therefore cause the other more trouble (also that both know each other by heart so the work together is pure pleasure), are crucial to its development.The narration comes and goes during the film, in present or past time, generating more confusion for the viewer. This is all after the first hour and a half, and if you're not hypnotized by the film's spell at that point, something must be wrong. Is the movie too long? Yes, if the spell didn't work on you; but if you're already connected with the characters and don't want to get out, it makes no difference if it lasts three or five hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A captivating and brilliant movie with an all star cast that I still cherish to this day.,"I still remember watching Casino as a 12 year old on New Year's Day back in 1997 and being captivated from start to finish. I was lucky to be watching Casino at that age considering that the film is rated R 18+ in Australia for Medium Level Violence and Medium Level Coarse Language. Thankfully my Dad was lenient as long as we were sensible as myself, my Dad and my brother sat together and watched the movie. Casino was and still is a brilliant movie. Martin Scorsese directed another top notch film. The all star cast was perfect. Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese mark another collaboration after their success with the classics Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), New York, New York (1977), The King of Comedy (1983), and Cape Fear (1991). Also joining in the collaboration is Joe Pesci of whom the three actors united for Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990) and The Irishman (2019).Set in Las Vegas during the 1970's, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro in another brilliant role) is in charge of the mafia connected Tangiers Casino to oversee its day to day operations. Sam is successful in turning the casino into a legitimate profitable venture as well as skimming some of the profits to the mafia. His legitimate lifestyle is put in jeopardy after he marries former hustler and prostitute Ginger (Sharon Stone in an Academy Award nominated performance) who turns out to be unstable and dishonest as she leads a self destructive lifestyle with alcohol and drugs as Sam continues to shower her with diamonds, fur coats, money and other expensive gifts along with access to a safety disposit box. Another huge threat in Sam's life is Chicago mafia enforcer and childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci in another terrific performance) whose volatile behaviour earns him a ban from every casino in Las Vegas as he forms a crew and commits various crimes including robbery and burglary as well as beating, threatening and killing people. Nicky's actions bring a lot of unwanted attention to Sam due to their lifelong friendship. Ginger continues to see her ex boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods) who is a pimp and con artist yet is nothing more than a loser who is always asking Ginger for money. Though Sam organises to have Lester beaten up as a warning to stay away from his wife, Lester still pops up and continues to act as a leach. Marrying Ginger and bringing Nicky to Las Vegas would turn out to be Sam's downfall.The all star cast also includes Kevin Pollak, L. Q. Jones, Dick Smithers and the late actors Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, and Alan King.Director Martin Scorsese as always does an amazing job as he brought to life a classic movie based on Nicholas Pileggi's nonfiction novel Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.Casino is an extremely violent movie with several scenes that are quite unsettling and not for the faint hearted. The ""f"" is used 422 times throughout the whole movie.I loved Casino when I first saw it and to this day, it deserves a spot as one of my top 10 movies of all time. It is 178 minutes long, but is a movie that I still cherish.A well deserved 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese strikes again.,"When I saw Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" -which just so happens to be one of my all-time favorite films- I had an urge to see his other movies.I'll agree with pretty much everyone and say that ""Casino"" is no ""Goodfellas"".But who cares? This is a fascinating and powerfully dramatic film with great performances by Robert De Niro and the unforgettably talented Joe Pesci who won the Oscar for best supporting actor in ""Goodfellas"". No one can play a more dramatic role and act as dramatic as Pesci.He can blurt the F-word several times non-stop and go absolutely berserk on screen, which really captivated me in ""Goodfellas"" and now has done it again in ""Casino"".I'm kinda upset with the movies rating on Yahoo by the film critics.Why and how did this movie get a B- by the critics.Okay, I'm with Roger Ebert on this one and I'm gonna say that it's an absolutely great film.Everyone else can go chop their schlong off and die somewhere.Not as good as ""Goodfellas"", but like ""Goodfellas"", it's a four-star masterpiece by the legendary Martin Scorsese and I wonder if he'll ever make another mob movie.If he does, I'm there.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

No one stays at the top forever.,"""A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.""I learned three things from Casino: running a casino is a tough business, Las Vegas is a complicated town, and a terrible wife makes life much harder.Casino is a lengthy movie about the rise and fall of a couple of Vegas big-shots, and  the loss of the essence of old-school Vegas, itself. The story is told primarily from the points of view of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niero) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), two guys who have known each other for years, and come to make money in Vegas in very different ways.Sam is a genius at all aspects of gambling that's tapped by the mob bosses back east to run a casino for them, while Nicky is a muscle guy who's there to protect Sam's operation. We watch them make a lot of money, and get into a lot of trouble because of their respective weaknesses/excesses. It's an entertaining movie, and the 179 minute runtime will pass by pretty quickly.Both De Niro and Pesci were excellent, with many other great actors supporting their performances. A lot of your enjoyment of this movie will hinge on your preference for the genre. Casino is very much a mob-type movie, though it's not a Godfather Part II Las Vegas re-tread, by any means. If even someone like me who's not a particular fan of this kind of movie can enjoy it, then that's a promising sign that most others will enjoy it, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not a sequel to Goodfellas, but it does build on it...",".... Let me explain. 1990's Goodfellas was the story of Henry Hill's life in the mob, which, along the way, explained the culture of mob life and the rules of the game. In 1995, when Casino comes along, it is not necessary to re-explain these terms. The viewer is assumed to already know what a ""made man"" is and the implications of crossing one, and the tribute that is expected to be kicked upstairs.So Casino builds on Goodfellas by telling the story of gambler Sam ""Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a successful gambler turned manager of a casino in Las Vegas - The Tangiers - for the mob while doubling as a running documentary on old pre 80s Las Vegas and how things were done, including a fascinating and intense scene on casino cheaters - how they cheat and how they are dealt with if caught.For Ace to be such a systematic gambler, one who does his research on the material of which goal posts consist when betting on football, he is sloppy in love. He falls for a high class prostitute, Ginger (Sharon Stone) and marries her even though she honestly tells him she doesn't love him in that kind of way. Ace figures mutual respect will grow to love on her part, or enough feeling that he will be satisfied. What actually happens is that you can take the girl out of ""the life"", but you can't take ""the life"" out of the girl.Then there is Ace's friend. Nicky (Joe Pesci) a made man who is sent to Vegas to keep an eye on the mob's interests. Pesci's Nicky is every bit as explosive and volatile as Pesci's Tommy in Goodfellas. And when Nicky decides he wants to take over - Well just imagine Goodfellas if Tommy had decided he wanted to be Paulie!The undoing of the less disciplined characters is precipitated by two things - First, they get into drugs in the late 70s when cocaine becomes ubiquitous. Second, the FBI is freed up to investigate the mob more thoroughly after the death of J. Edgar Hoover.By the end I was nostalgic about a place I never lived in a time when I was not alive - at least as an adult -or maybe I did, through Scorsese's work.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Grim and depressing,"While I realize this is based (inspired?) (adapted?) from a true story, nonetheless the main characters are truly disgusting people. I find absolutely nothing redeeming in any of them. This makes the film itself quite difficult to endure.I think a documentary on the history of the Las Vegas casinos would be far more interesting than watching these people commit unspeakable acts of cruelty in the name of greed. I know there's suppose to be a social message in here somewhere, but its somehow lost in all the screaming and horrible beatings we have to witness along the way. The plot line of the unhealthy relationship between Sharon Stone's character and DeNiro's grows tiresome very quickly and I found myself wanting this film to be over with much much sooner. The one good thing I can say about it is that it makes me want to never visit Las Vegas again.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
In one word: overrated,"After telling a friend I enjoyed The Godfather trilogy, he recommended I watch this film. And I'm sorry to say I totally regret doing so.This film is the opposite of The Godfather. It has zero emotional content. The characters are intentionally one dimensional, idiotic and therefor impossible to identify with. Most of the movie feature narration, which at first feels welcome and classic, but soon grows tiring because instead of the movie just ""happening"", the narration disrupts the acting all throughout the 3 hours.Now I know many might consider this one a classic, but I will bet you right here and now, that non of the actors playing in ""Casino"" would willingly sit through this 3 hour torture.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese strikes again with this must-see classic.,"Martin Scorsese strikes again with this raunchy classic about the Italian mob taking over the city of Las Vegas. De Niro excels as he plays 'Ace' Rothstein, a classy business man, who throughout the movie gains success and popularity which soon leads to his downfall. Pesci plays tough guy Nicky Santoro, who has more of an old fashion way of solving problems, but none the less, gains power and succeeds throughout this film. Sharon Stone was a flawless gem in this film. Sharon stole every scene if it was with her laughing, crying, sobbing or living it up.

I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.,"I love Casino especially if I watch it from the beginning. Robert DeNiro should have won an Academy AWard for this performance along with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. The film is perfectly entertaining about casinos before it became Disneyland. There were other great performances by Don Rickles, Alan King, etc. The film is a Martin Scorsese film with two of his favorite actors--Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci giving Oscar performances. The script was fresh and entertaining. I also have to say that James Woods' performance as Ginger's pimp was worthy of being nominated for best supporting actor. THis film has several fabulous scenes and moments. By the end, you really don't want it to end because it's that good. I love how Ace and Nicky (Joe Pesci's character) narrate and explain the on-going activities between the Las Vegas Casino and it's connection to Kansas City, Missouri. I really enjoy watching the scenes of Ace being in control and the corruption that occurs. But it's that kind of film. You know what happens but you enjoy the ride anyway and I do enjoy this film. I always look forward to seeing it on the cable stations. Of course, Ace and Nicky's friendship is the crutch of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Very Good, not great","Taken alone, this was an excellent movie, very watchable, if a bit long. However, a lot of this movie obviously plays very close to what some of the people involved in it have played before.  De Niro's character is eerily similar to Al Pacino's in ""The Godfather II"", and Joe Pesci could easily be playing himself in ""Goodfellas"".  This is another solid effort from Scorcese and crew, but it lacks originality.There were some interesting points.  Sharon Stone was excellent, but once again, she seems to remind me of Talia Shire's Connie in ""The Godfather"". The same could be said of James Woods, who plays a Fredo-like scumbag (maybe Fredo wasn't that bad, but still....).  To top it all off, we've got De Niro AND Pesci doing Ray Liotta's over-voice shtick from ""Goodfellas"".All in all, I would recommend this movie, but I'd also recommend you see the other movies I've mentioned here first.  The acting here is good, the plot isn't lacking, the only negative side is that it does get a little violent. All the same, if you're familiar with Scorcese's work, at times you feel like this movie is basically Henry Hill narrating the Corleone family history.  It's hard to see this group be so good without quite reaching the greatness they've achieved in the past.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fabulous movie about greed and power 8/10,"Scorsese nailes it with this picture. Every time he comes up with a gangster movie you know it's going to be great. The script is genius and the story is eye catching. Really good characters: Robert DeNiro keeps proving us he is a revolutionary, Joe Pesci is amazing in one of his best roles ever, super funny. Sharon stone wasn't as good as I thought she would be, Didn't like her character. The music is nice and the editing too.

In my opinion this movie has the best personalities aside from sifi movies, each character is greedy but they get the things they want in different ways than the others.

I think this movie could have been edited down by about an hour and it wouldn't have missed much, and I think it would have helped to overall rating I gave. The last hour of the movie delivered but even with that felt rushed at times. At time it felt like they fell in love with character development instead of moving the plot forward. You could really see a lot of what was coming down the pipe right from the beginning. I actually thought the acting was sub par at times but there were some well acted scene. I wish movies like that that were based of a real life story had a meter on it to let us know how much of the movie was accurate.

Scorsese on autopilot,"Half history lesson and half drama, Casino feels like a film built from way too much material to pare down in the time Scorsese and Pileggi had to write the script. Recalling a lot from Goodfellas in terms of actors, characters, and overall structure of a story in the world of the mob, Casino is Scorsese using all of his tricks on familiar ground which feels like it should be fodder for me. I do find the movie an entertaining three hours, but there ends up feeling like there's little point in the end. The rise and fall of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and the rise and fall of mob controlled Las Vegas end up feeling disconnected to me, like they happened coincidentally rather than one feeding the other. There's just too much of Ace's problems that feel concentrated on his own personal life without touching larger Las Vegas issues.Ace is a gambler ""back home"" (apparently Chicago could never be mentioned directly for legal reasons) who always brings in money for the mob bosses and gets called up to run the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. He walks in, turns things around and increases profits for the mob almost instantly, running a tighter ship on cheats and operations. He also marries a female hustler, Ginger, when his childhood friend from back home, Nicky, a violent psychopath of a made man in the mob, comes to Las Vegas to offer muscle support to Ace and also set up his own street operation on the side.All of this takes about an hour to set up in a series of voiceover heavy vignettes that never really amount to individual scenes. Told by Ace and Nicky in alternating narration, almost like the words were taken from oral history accounts of the time and place, the movie flashes back and forth in time, around Las Vegas, back home and to Kansas City in a flurry of activity that ends up feeling dizzying. This is where, I think, the movie works least well. It's not that the storytelling here is inefficient, which it is, it's that it prevents any sort of emotional grounding with any character. Granted that they're kind of all terrible people, but Ace is made to be the straight shooter in a group of rule-breaking criminals. He understands the rules of gambling and casinos, and he wants to operate within those bounds to create the money for his bosses back home. He could have been someone to latch onto emotionally.He probably shouldn't have been best friends with a violent psychopath or married an unstable junkie with a very strong attachment to a pimp, though.As I mentioned, it takes about an hour for the movie to calm down and actually deliver scenes instead of snippets and vignettes. Once there, the movie gains a footing that it never loses, firmly and energetically telling its core story, but I think it also begins to disconnect Ace's personal story from Las Vegas as a whole making the connection incidental rather than having the two stories really inform each other. Nicky ends up getting kicked out of every casino in town and pissing off the cops so much that he has to operate outside of the city proper. Ace fires a connected good ole boy, insults him to his brother-in-law, and brings the wrath of the state down upon him when they refuse to issue him the gambling license he had filed for. Ginger can't let go of her pimp boyfriend, Lester, and keeps taking money from Ace to give to him. Ace just wants to run his casino, but the chaos that rises up around him ends up consuming everything.Joe Pesci essentially plays Nicky like he played Tommy in Goodfellas, but with less warmth. Tommy was a violent psychopath, but he could have some fun with friends that didn't involve murder and mayhem. Nicky seems to only get pleasure from violence. Pesci plays this well. De Niro plays Ace as a completely collected professional, the kind of person you would expect that the mob might hand over a casino to in order to guarantee profits. His attention to detail, most amusingly demonstrated when he demands equal numbers of blueberries in all muffins from his chef, is exacting and precise. Sharon Stone, though, is where I'm not sure of in terms of quality of performance. She's good through most of the film, playing an insecure woman with a well-worm façade of confidence, but by the end Ginger is a shrieking insane person for most of the film. I think the performance exists on a line between appropriate for the character and over the top, and I get the feeling that it leans towards over the top.As everything ends up falling apart, with Ace starting a talk show to maintain his voice in the public square in his fight with the gaming commission over his long applied for gambling license, Nicky going so far out of control that the mob back home has to exert some control, and Ginger nearly stealing her and Ace's daughter to Europe with Lester, the movie never really feels like it comes to anything in my mind. Goodfellas had a clear eye towards what it was trying to say about the appeal of the mob life, but in Casino, the mix of history and histrionics don't mesh as well to me. It feels like Ace is supposed to have learned a lesson as he sits in his home in San Diego, but he's pretty much the same guy he was at the beginning of the story. Is this a bemoaning for the lost era of Las Vegas, now taken over by corporations instead of wise guys? Ace does say that in the final voiceover, but the mob era was so violent and chaotic and led to Ace's professional downfall that it feels like a weird thing to miss. Sure, Ace misses the control he had, but he was a cog in a larger, more violent machine, and he doesn't seem to even see that.In the end, I find Casino to be a shallow adventure in another time and place. The intricate look at life in Las Vegas in the 70s through the eyes of some of the fictionalized most powerful people in the city is interesting, violent, and consistently entertaining, but that first hour feels amorphous and unstructured while the ending leaves me with little to chew on thematically. It's a fun movie, but little else.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't Be Fooled!,"This movie is entertaining, for sure, but just one attentive glance at the editing and you know Scorcese's struggling to make it work.  The voice-overs simply function to move the plot in places where the filmed action can't take it.  A film relying on voice-over for exposition is usually missing some pieces.  Plus as a movie about how relationships can dissolve there really isn't much to work from.  The Rothstein/Ginger connection is totally breezed over and you get no real sense of their relationship, other than ""he's controlling"" and ""she's nuts.""  Plus Joe Pesci is simply reprising his role from Goodfellas.  In fact it seems the entire movie is just a Goodfellas retread, but without the great pacing and script that kept that classic together.

Perhaps The Best Gangster Film I've Seen,"Just to give a bit of background, I thought I'd start by explaining what it actually takes for me to score a film 10/10, because at this point the top score on here has lost a lot of it's significance. Not that this is a serious issue obviously, but I thought I should open by stating exactly how good I think a film should be in order for it to justify a rating like that, and hopefully in doing so the point will be put across as to how highly I rate this film.For me, a 10/10 film is a film whereby not only each and every facet of is at least of a very high standard, but one that is so good that there is literally no single aspect of it that stands out as being even marginally weak, whether that be the acting performance of a character, a particular scene/section of the film, the dialogue or any other aspect that could be picked up on. Right from the off, the film must set a standard and a tone and keep on that course so as to at least remain within the same bracket of quality, whilst also excelling in every possible aspect along the way. Any deviation from this path represents an imperfection in terms of the way the film is balanced, and as such will prevent a perfect 10/10 score from being given.Given this criteria, take The Godfather as an example: a timeless masterpiece that is rightfully held up as one of the greatest films of all time. The acting is sublime, the plot is compelling and the characters are all well fashioned. Despite these strengths however, Michael's development at the start is not handled with the same precision and quality as the rest of the film in my opinion. It stands out as being more rushed and less carefully crafted when measured against the rest of the film, and I felt the opening stages were in need of a couple more scenes to bridge the early phases of the transformation with what followed. This stood out for me in context of the quality of the rest of the film, and I would therefore deduct half a point on that basis. The difference in quality here is enough for me to call it a sizable imperfection in a relative sense.Another example to use is Once Upon A Time In America, which is sometimes labelled 'the best gangster movie ever made', with people highlighting the exceptional plot and the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morrocone. These are, of course, valid points - the music is amongst some of the finest ever made for film, and the plot is as absorbing as it is complex. That being said, the acting is considerably lower across the board than in other classics in similar genres (Goodfellas, Godfather I and II, City of God, etc), and the score is often applied over-indulgently: the melodies of Deborah's theme and the main theme for example are destroyed by the end of the film, and scenes are sometimes made to seem exaggerated and jarring as a result. On top of that, there are occasions whereby these beautiful melodies are highly inappropriate, with one particular rendition actually making me laugh loud because of how bizarre it was (hint: the Cleopatra part of the film, after the...incident...in the car).For those reasons, despite it's strengths, that film is an 8/8/5 for me. Very good, but there are too many imperfections and imbalances.Anyway, I give that brief analysis of those two up there in order to illustrate my view that there are no literally no such relative imperfections and imbalances to point out with Casino. The film starts off well paced and sharp, and from the very offset it maintains an extremely high standard of acting, storytelling and pacing throughout.Even nitpicking, I cannot think of a single weakness, and on top of that the strengths are seriously strong. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, as usual, are fantastic in their roles, and I honestly can't remember ever seeing anyone play a character like Sharon Stone plays in this so well. For all the right reasons, she made me feel hateful, angry and unpleasant. I cowered and cringed because of how well it was acted, and I spent most of the time watching her thinking about how much I wanted her character to meet a horrible, yet just ending.Seriously... this film is a must-watch. There are a lot of unfair, unfavourable comparisons to Goodfellas in here, but I honestly think this is better. Does Goodfellas keep up the same standard of plot like this does throughout? I don't think so personally - the closing scenes are slower and weaker, where as Casino maintains an extremely high level, delivering accordingly right at the end. The ending is satisfying (for whatever reason - no spoilers here), and the tension that has been built up throughout is sufficiently capitalised on. Goodfellas, on the other hand, more peters out by comparison.That is obviously is not to criticise Goodfellas - as a film that's about as close to 10 as you can get without it being 10 in my opinion. It's just that Casino is better paced, more consistent and more complex and nuanced in its plot. As well as this, it gains from the greater emphasis on De Niro and Pesci, who both play superior, more fleshed out characters in this.The combination of these two and Sharon Stone in conjunction with this plot makes for an absolute masterpiece, and I highly recommend this film to anyone with even a passing interest in film and Scorsese. I was in awe of it throughout and think that, alongside Raging Bull, it's probably the most underrated film I've come across so far on IMDb.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The more I see the more I like it,"This film grows on the viewer, the first time I saw this film it reminded me of Goodfellas too much.  After, seeing the video a few times, I belong to a movie club, the movie rates as a classic.  Long movies usually become boring, however this story is easy to follow.  It is directed well, and acted well.  I read the book, and the film follows it closely, a few events changed because of time considerations and where shorting.  The film had to be long for it to reasonbly follow the book.  This is a interesting story, and the movie follows it accurately, and the viewer goes along the journey as he was there.

"Bloated, but there's some good mob stuff here","It's not ""Goodfellas"", but there are stretches when ""Casino"" is pretty great. That back-and-forth narration between De Niro and Pesci is a brilliant narrative trick and plays like a guided tour through this lavish empire the mob has carved out in Las Vegas (this, in spite of the town's gaudy trappings). Seductive, to say the least.It's in the second half that the narration vanishes and the movie starts to overstay its welcome. This criminal enterprising dream can't last forever, and when things start to come crashing down, they do so viciously (don't ever tell Scorsese he's timid on his violence). It's mostly when the '70s give way to the '80s and Sharon Stone's drama takes center stage that things become sour. ""Boogie Nights"" sprang to mind around this time, although that was a much more satisfying story.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too much.,"Is Casino a poor movie? Of course it is not. After all, the constituent elements are there and one can almost foretell a delectable piece on the dark underbelly of Vegas told through a true master's aesthetics. If the same breakneck verve that abounded in 'Goodfellas' was applied to the already radiant Las Vegas, is it not logical to think that something truly stunning should ensue?The opening title sequence is enough to make your mouth water as the significance and seriousness of the tale is immediately conveyed through the gracefully falling body of De Niro and a backdrop of Bach's fine choral piece. However, somewhere along the line the screws went undone and someone must have forgotten to carry the 2. Casino left me feeling like the proverbial s***. Though the violence cannot be deemed gratuitous, something about the film is so dark and depressing, the final product is little short of off-putting. The obvious fault is the length, but there is a myriad of other problems that force Casino to trudge along while Goodfellas flew by.All in all, definately not a waste of time, but have something cheerful lined up later.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Scorsese's most visually stunning film.,"Martin Scorsese has been hailed as one of the greatest modern directors ever to take on the Silver Screen and for good reason. With a unique style that involves strong themes of crime and redemption, virtuoso camera work, quick pacing, and violent imagery; Martin Scorsese has carved his name into the crime genre and the movie world as a whole.Now, many know Scorsese for his gritty and violent crime films like Goodfellas, Mean Streets, and The Departed, but I think the Scorsese style (at least the visual style) shows through best in his Crime epic, Casino.In Casino, Martin Scorsese uses some of his best camera work and his most stunning compositions to pantomime the feel and atmosphere of an actual casino. The quick movements, the flashing lights, the almost schizophrenic nature all comes together to form one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.IT doesn't just stop at the camera-work. The way the story is told also plays a big part in this subtle dance. The film almost seems like one gigantic vignette as Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci narrate for good chunks of the film as it lays out the story. It seamlessly glides between Vignettes, montages, and narrative story telling to almost make it like watching a novel.If there were ever films to come so close to being like paintings it would be The Seventh Seal and this.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a great movie! Another success by Martin Scor...,"What a great movie! Another success by Martin Scorsese. This story about Las Vegas, mafia, friends, drugs and betrayals couldn't have been filmed any better. The characters are perfect, you can love them or hate them as if they were real. De Niro and Pesci both do great jobs, but Sharon Stone is outstanding. I think that in Casino she has achieved her best performance ever. I'd recommend this film to everybody. Either you've seen it or not. If you 've not seen it, because you are missing a wonderful picture. And if you do have seen it, because each time you watch the film again, you can discover new things. I like it much more every time I see it. The story is perfect. One event leads to the other and there are no gaps or unexplained things once you've finished watching the movie. Dialogs are very real. The relationships between characters are very well developed. I think that if you like Scorsese's work, this one is a must-see film. At least, that's the way I see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese's underrated masterpiece,"Scorsese is my favorite director working today. From his first great film Mean Streets to Wolf of Wall Street, he's given the world some amazing movies. Some are better than others of course, but I would be hard pressed to say that's he's ever made a bad film. Casino, when first released, was unfavorably compared to Scorsese's Goodfellas, and it's easy to see why. Based on another Nicholas Pileggi crime novel, the returning cast members Robert DeNiro, Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci, a long running time and ""rise and fall of a gangster"" plot.But while Goodfellas is my number one Scorsese film (Followed closely by Raging Bull), Casino has slowly become one of my favorites. The violence is still sometimes hard to watch, two scenes come to mind that in my opinion, rival anything in Goodfellas in terms of visceral, shocking brutality. The infamous torture scene is still shocking, comparable to the ear amputation in Reservoir Dogs. Scorsese's eye for detail and use of narration serves him well, and the acting is across the board excellent. Sharon Stone deservedly won an Oscar for her role as hustler Ginger McKenna. And Joe Pesci is on fine form as hot tempered, coked-up muscle Nicky Santoro.The eclectic soundtrack is great, filled with 70s classics like Jeff Beck's ""I Ain't Superstitious"" and Boogaloo Down Broadway. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing, capturing the gaudy style of the era perfectly. And longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker edits the film beautifully and doesn't shy away from the sometimes brutal violence.There are a few flaws. You could trim about 10 minutes of Nicky Santoro and his gang (We get the point, they're bad guys). And Robert DeNiro looks about as Jewish as Vladimir Putin. But these are minor complaints. A great film that i'll watch over and over for years to come. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not quite an actually good movie,"Many people liken this movie to Goodfellas and The Godfather, etc. My personal opinion is that as a mafia movie, it is just a schlock fest. It's not as intriguing as Goodfellas was when I was rooting against the lead characters, and not as interesting and complex as the storyline of The Godfather. Even in comparison with the over-the-top Scarface, it lacks real value and true substance. Some scenes with Joe Pesci are memorable, but the rest of the movie seems like a waste of space. Scorsese's career revolved around mobster movies, and this was just too slow of a movie. The problem with mobster movies is that they are fantasy and yet ring in oodles of money because of the dumb average American who watches them and believes them to be true.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Las Vegas Movie ever made.,"Had me on the edge of my seat most of the time. Pesci is scary period. Dinero is possibly the greatest actor of my generation. Throw those two in a greatly scripted film and surround them with great supporting actors and you cant help but make a great movie.I don't consider this Goodfellas 2 but its close. Its a variant with two actors carried over. Don't get me wrong, This film stands very well on its own merit. If you never saw Goodfellas it wouldn't matter.You can always tell a great movie when you forget you are watching one.The violence is very scary and powerful. I grimaced several times the first time I saw it. The realism is there in every sense.A great rise and fall movie. In certain respects its sad the old days are over. There was an aura about it. But on the other hand, the Mafia was just to damned violent.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
GoodFellas in Vegas...it was better in New York,"Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.Casino starts quite literally with a bang with a rather shocking car bombing before the opening titles have even rolled. It's a fascinating and highly intriguing opening but Casino never is able to sustain that energy. The film slogs along for three hours with the pace so slow that at times the movie seems to come to a dead stop. Scorsese has, even in his most brilliant successes, been criticized for the pacing (or lack thereof) in his films. Casino is a prime example of a Scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if the action could have been pushed along just a little bit faster. There's a terrific story here, top-notch acting performances and the typically brilliant Scorsese visual touches. What's missing is the energy a film like GoodFellas had. For all that Casino has going for it, in the end it's simply not entertaining enough.After the shock of the opening sequence, Casino goes back in time ten years to tell the story of Ace Rothstein, as played by Robert De Niro. We see he is running, on behalf of Midwestern mob bosses, the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. Through use of voice-over narration (a la Goodfellas) Rothstein, and later Joe Pesci's Nicky Santoro, explain how the money moves through the casino and into the hands of the mafia kingpins. As the story begins everybody's getting paid, everything's running smoothly, everybody's happy. When mafia tough guy Santoro, played wonderfully by Pesci who could do this type of thing in his sleep, takes up residence in Vegas things start to unravel. Santoro's a hothead, out to make a quick buck for himself. Where Rothstein had been free to operate his casino in peace, when Santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention from the authorities. Rothstein's wife, Ginger, is not helping matters by being constantly drunk, stoned or drunk and stoned. Sharon Stone plays Ginger and the character is such a train wreck it's hard to really evaluate Stone's performance. She's certainly convincing as a glamorous call girl early on, perhaps less convincing when she's forced to be hysterically screaming all the time.Anyhow, Ace ends up having problems with the wife, problems with the authorities and problems with his onetime good friend Nicky. It's fascinating to see all the conflict swirl around him and De Niro is reliably brilliant in his performance as he deals with all the madness around him. Pesci is terrific and Stone is OK. Actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work. James Woods does well in a bit part as a man who is part of Ginger's past. Frank Vincent (GoodFellas parallel number 8,362 or thereabouts) settles into his mobster's role quite easily. And Don Rickles and Dick Smothers of all people have serious parts to play and each does a fine job. So, the acting certainly isn't the problem. The main characters, and some of the secondary ones, are wonderfully developed. Casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect from Scorsese. And the story is a good one, intriguing from beginning to end. It's in that long journey from beginning to end where Casino stumbles somewhat. It just takes too long to get where we're going and the film can't sustain the energy it opened with. A fascinating story, but in the end one that with a better pace could have been told in a much more entertaining way.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ossessione,"A reprise of Goodfellas, mostly, as has been pointed out, and although long, not as tired or boring as some have felt. How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad?People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors.But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women.Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they?Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a ""scumbag"" because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing.On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. And that opening scene -- a car explosion backed by the majestic sweep of Bach's Missa Solemnis!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Two Words: Staggeringly Overrated.,"It should be clear to anyone who has followed Scorsese's career that he continues to fall back on several crutches in the construction of this film: casting his cute lil' mama, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and a boat load of the other goombas who ended up on ""The Sopranos""; the utilization of character voiceovers (a totally lazy device employed by otherwise ineffective storytellers) and yet another boring and way-too-loud classic rock soundtrack handpicked by a guy still living in the 60's. We get it, Marty: you REALLY like The Stones.Take your pick, and I will show you several films for which Scorsese received well more credit than he deserves: the muddy, ponderous ""Mean Streets,"" the mediocre ""Taxi Driver,"" the execrable ""New York, New York"" and ""The Color of Money,"" and the predictable duo of ""Cape Fear"" and ""The Departed,"" the latter of which was utterly ruined by Mark Wahlberg's shrill, one-note performance. Additionally, Scorsese's overblown video to Michael Jackson's ""Bad"" was complete jive and gave the regrettable Wesley Snipes a stairway to stardom.Ultimately, ""Casino"" is poor relation to the superior ""Goodfellas,"" which, along with ""The King of Comedy,"" is Scorsese's only film worthy of the heaps of praise showered upon his overall body of work. I should also mention that Sharon Stone's performance in ""Casino"" is just plain embarrassing. Don't get me wrong, friends. I think Martin Scorsese is a decent filmmaker, but he sure ain't Cinema Jesus.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Hey, better here than, uh, up there, y'know what I mean?""","Casino shows that GoodFellas, the milieu if not the overall tenor as this is more of a full-blown epic in Las Vegas can still be well done when people like Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi do it right.For a long time this was among the top, top favorites from this director. I don't know if it's still one of THE bestest of the best, but it's still massively enjoyable and after all these years there's still things to love about it.

Scorsese's best,"I have always seen this movie with Ginger as a metaphor for Las Vegas, and Ace and Nicky being the personification of gambling and crime respectively. For me this is the tale of gambling and crime, coming together as sides of the same coin, and then progressively turning on each other.Ace is the ultimate gambler, because he his devoid of vice in a certain sense. He is not an addict or a con man, he represents a clean way to gamble. His method is not luck; it's math. It is not instinct; it is research and science. Of course, as the movie goes on you start to see the problem it brings which is the need for control. Repeatedly, Ace has a need for control. At first it is in gambling and that is how the becomes successful, but then you see the impulse towards his wife, towards Nicky and towards the government. Ace's story is the rise and fall of a man asking for complete control. For unlimited obedience.Nicky on the other hand is embodied passion. As cold and calculating is Ace, Nicky is instinctive and volatile. He is a gangster archetype of sorts. And, as he starts as Ace's sidekick you see that he progressively becomes bigger and bigger. Increasing in violence but also diversifying in crimes.The film tells the story of how these two guys turn against each other and metaphorically how these two concepts clash. The culmination of which, is the desert meeting.These elements would be enough to make a great film and a compelling drama. But then, there is Sharon Stone's Ginger who is a tragic femme fatale. A woman that starts smart and beautiful, with a negligible drug addiction and insatiable love of money. At the non-metaphor level, Ginger is the woman whose beauty will destroy these guys' paradise.Ginger's, and by extension the city's, undoing will be when she will give in to Ace. Believing that she can outsmart him and con-him like so many guys before him, e.g. Like all the casinos before Tangiers. The benefit for her is instant. She gets security and comfort, but also she is Sam Rothstein's wife, she gets a reputation. But, the price to pay is independence. She will then turn to Nicky. She will try to get the mob against the casino. And she'll loose everything.The final message is the following: The mob got pushed out, but the spirit of Las Vegas has died in the process.It is my personal interpretation of the film, but I think it is valid because the characterisation is very well done. The movie builds its characters as archetypes and then it pits them against each other, which allows the story to have mythological quality.Besides that, this is Scorsese at the peak of its art, which gives a film that is not only interesting and cool to look at but also with a lot of energy and dynamism that nobody else has.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Despite some bad reviews on release, ""Casino"" is closer to Scorsese's older work than any of his other recent films...","""Casino"" (1995), a visceral examination of the Mafia's influence on the casinos of Las Vegas in the 1970s, is also the so-called ""companion piece"" to Martin Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" (1990). Both films star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and were written by Nicholas Pileggi.Some even go so far as to claim ""Casino"" is a semi-remake of ""GoodFellas."" And many critics found flaws regardless of its connections to the earlier mob film. ""Go in interested and you may find your interest tested way past the limit,"" wrote Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle. ""'Casino' is not about people, just Vegas. It's an ambitious film -- but also a scattered, unfocused one."" Viewing the movie a decade after its release, it holds up well. The film's real strength lies in its narrative and unflinching examination of its characters. Sam Rothstein (played by Robert De Niro) isn't a nice guy, and never really gains our sympathy. Nicky (Pesci) occasionally exhibits acceptable behavior, but if the film has a villain, it's him. And Ginger (Sharon Stone in the best role of her career) is selfish, spoiled and depressing.Critics didn't get it. ""'Casino' runs a little under three hours, but (you) will feel like it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor Thelma Schoonmaker,"" wrote Internet critic Steve Rhodes. Rhodes, along with countless other reviewers, complained about the level of violence  suggesting an NC-17 rating would have been more appropriate.Whether you will like ""Casino"" or not depends entirely on your tolerance for character-driven films  and, of course, heavy violence. Ironically, despite its flaws, ""Casino"" is closer to Scorsese's older work than any of his other recent films  ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" did not feature likable people, either. Whereas we followed Henry Hill's journey from youth in ""GoodFellas"" and felt empathetic towards him, ""Casino"" drops us square in the middle of Sam's story and there's no connection  this will either alienate or enthrall you, depending entirely on your taste in cinema. I personally love studies of characters  especially ones that examine the evil inherent in man, and Scorsese is brilliant at revealing these things.His movie exhibits recognizable elements  a whiz-bang style with quick-cuts, rapid zooms, a diverse pop-and-classical music soundtrack (with no less than four or five Rolling Stones songs), and of course, his famous tracking shots (here, he stages an impressive three-minute examination of a casino without breaking until we exit the front door). But ""Casino"" doesn't confine itself to the restraints of Scorsese's styling. Here he goes hog wild with the visuals (more so than usual anyway), soaking up the vivid colors of Las Vegas, absorbing the dizzying array of flashing bulbs and tacky bright clothing.Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time collaborator, experiments with digital editing for the first time here  and employs some new techniques that are subtle but make a subliminal impact. The title sequence, designed by Elaine and Saul Bass, is simultaneously dazzling and haunting.The performances are almost flawless. De Niro is Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a legendary gambler who is chosen out of the blue to maintain a new casino for the Las Vegas Mafia. Sam explains the economics of the system  the mob take their cut of the profits, the rest goes where it should, and everyone remains happy  so long as nothing goes wrong.When Ace's old friend Nicky shows up in Vegas he begins to orchestrate a ring of violent robberies  becoming the new leader of a vicious gangster force that threatens to destroy Ace's chances at cutting it straight. Since Nicky is a made man, and Ace is Jewish, he can't stop him  but fears their new lifestyle will only lead to misery.In the meantime Ace falls for the beautiful call girl Ginger (Stone), who doesn't love Sam, but marries him for his wealth. Her heart really belongs to her ex-boyfriend/pimp (played by James Woods), and at first Ace believes he can tame her into submission; but her free spirit ruins their lives and destroys Ace's confidence.The movie does have its blunders, and is not on the same level as ""GoodFellas,"" but would at least make the list a few titles beneath it. Some scenes seem unnecessary, and Nicky's violent attack with a pen does seem a bit reminiscent of an almost identical sequence in ""GoodFellas"" when Pesci attacks someone at a bar. And as enthralling and entertaining as ""Casino"" is, it never really matches the overall energetic exuberance of ""GoodFellas""  they are, despite their close ties, very different films in a cinematic sense.Still, this is a great film, well made and daring. You'll probably either love it or hate it, but there's no denying its powerful impact on the viewer.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Odds are great you'll enjoy this,"This is based on 2-Disc Special Edition release. I have not read the book, nor did I know anything about the real people this was based(apart from what's on the Trivia page). And yes, in case you have heard... this is quite similar to Goodfellas. There's the obvious, such as Pileggi writing the novels behind both, and some of the same cast. Beyond that, though, the story-telling(such as the frequent and effective use of voice-over monologues, and multiple narrators, I could go on) and overall flavor are similar. And why not? It fits for one as well as the other and they're well-done and not the exact same film(having watched one does not mean you've already seen the other, I'll put it that way). The plot is engaging and interesting throughout. Characters are credible, well-developed and consistent. The acting is excellent, for everyone involved(including the kids). DeNiro and Pesci nail their roles, Stone gives what may be the most powerful performance of her career, and Woods is spot-on as always when given appropriate material. The dialog is impeccable, with countless memorable and well-delivered lines. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The music is great, the score well-composed, and they are used expertly throughout this. This has constant strong language, plenty of brutal, bloody violence, disturbing content and a bit of sexuality. The DVD holds deleted scenes(among them an outtake or two) and six featurettes, four of which are on this site, and that I will review individually, the last two being a documentary called Vegas and the Mob and an episode of a History Channel show entitled True Crime Authors, both of them well worth the time.

A Great Movie,"Martin Scorsese's Casino is in my opinion one of the best movies of the 90s. Every character in this movie is believable because of the great performances of the actors. Especially Stone's performance as the con-artist trophy wife is truly memorable.Scorsese never fails to amaze me. From Mean Streets to Goodfellas I loved every one of his movies. His movies are usually dark and gritty pieces but in Casino I experienced a new side of Scorsese. This movie has a big epic feeling to it unlike other of his movies. And it works so well. The film is very beautiful to watch because of the great cinematography and score. Scorsese seems to have an ability to make movies with very different kind of looks. And in this movie, I think he mixed his directing techniques of Age Of Innocence and Goodfellas. Like Age Of Innocence, it has a clean look, but the characters and dialog reminded me of Goodfellas (maybe also because of the topic of this movie).Like all the Scorsese movies, this one is also a great character driven, sometimes dark and tragic, sometimes wild and brutal piece of cinema art. Each character of this movie is well developed and deep. The movie is 3 hours long, but it had me hooked from the (great) starting scene up till the very ending shot.Must see movie",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Mediocrity à la Marty Scorsese,"If you are a discriminating movie buff and want to see Martin Scorsese at his most inspired, most enthralling, most engrossing, and most enrapturing, forget CASINO. Watch GOODFELLAS instead.CASINO pales in comparison in every respect. And while its characters and their interpersonal relationships are poorly developed, CASINO drags on and on for 3 hours and 2 minutes.Aesthetically, stylistically, in terms of many of the cast and crew, etc., CASINO looks too much like GOODFELLAS, leaving people to think that they've experienced déjà vu. The most glaring example of this is Joe Pesci, who basically reprises--and even parodies--his role from GOODFELLAS.Furthermore, the narration in CASINO is excessive while the depictions of violence are often gratuitous and stylistically weak.So rest assured that GOODFELLAS is the masterpiece.

One of the most under-rated movies ever.,"Most people I know haven't seen the true-story brutality that is Casino. Taking place in the early 1980s, two mob friends, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are put in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Their job? To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Spine Chilling. Blew me away,"I just started Martin Scorsese's movies one by one. By far this is the best movie ever. After I saw this movie, I read about the goofs in this site and to be frank I observed only two of them and I watch movies very closely.This is one of the best examples where director actually glues your bum to the seat.Absolutely no highs or lows in the movie, the tempo is carried from very first scene, continuing in every frame until the last one.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone gave amazing performance. I felt jealous and pitied at Sam, frightened at Nicky and hated Ginger. Amazing performers and superb action. I never ever felt that it was a movie and everything is screen-played.With the naive experience in watching Marin's movies, I guess camera becomes a slave to Martin ( of course right after Coppola). Beautiful angles and wonderful screenplay.And of course Nicholas Pileggi is genius to begin with and Martin Scorsese is another to go into Nicholas' head and produce the same.A beautiful movie which actually defines an R rated film without any gross scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The greatest film ever ...,"I am a modern movie buff (meaning my movie history starts with films like Scarface and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, not Casablanca or From Here to Eternity).  I have seen close to 500 movies in my day - everything from DC Cab to Fast Break to A Bronx Tale - and Casino is without a shadow of a doubt the best I have ever watched.  DeNiro is sublime, Stone gives the best performance of her career, and Pesci is at his obnoxious, menacing best. The costumes, the score, the dialogue.  My brother and I can have whole conversations with each other talking only in quotes from the flick: (""Mr. Clark I don't think you understand what it is I do.  ...  About the time I'm coming out of jail, hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.  And I'll bust your head wide open again.  Cause I'm f***in' stupid."")  There was a time when I thought nothing could touch The Godfather II as the ultimate mob drama with a real plot and authentic characters who make you care.  Then I saw Casino during my sophomore year in college, and, for me, nothing has come close cinematically.  If you loved the gore of The Untouchables, then this is for you.  If you loved the tragedy of Carlito's Way, then Casino is for you.  If you loved the authenbticity of Donnie Brasco then this flick is for.  Hell, if you loved the warped, anal retentive Melvin Udall in As Good As It Gets, then Sam Rothstein will blow you away.  Whatever you want in a movie, you got it here - with the notable exception of minority actors, save a few Japanese ""whales"" inserted only for storytelling purposes.  I challenge any true movie critic to name three movies with more depth, a better plot, a better narrarator, better actors than this epic.

From the images of slow rolling dice to the scintillating voice-overs of movie-legends Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, each second of ""Casino"" shines brilliantly. It is a glorious film.""Casino"" doesn't get the credit it deserves, unfortunately. It somehow takes a back-seat to gangster films such as ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"", two highly inferior films.

Many kudos Mr. Scorsese.It would be a mistake not to mention the tremendous cast...and they all bring their best work to the table. Sharon Stone, in particular, was tremendously impressive. Put it this way: When I originally seen ""Casino"" for the first time, Stone was one of my least-favorite actresses. After the movie, she was my favorite. She didn't just play ""Ginger"", she owned her! If I was asked my opinion on the ""Best Supporting Actress of all-time"", my vote would be Stone in ""Casino"". One of the best performances of all-time. Not to be overlooked is some of the all-time film greats in Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and James Woods.

"It's a Movie, not a Novel","If you can tolerate a movie with nearly as much voiceover narration as dialogue, then this is for you - granted, violent, profane, and complex tales are your thing.Casino has a good premise: the mob sends Sam (Robert DeNiro) to run a casino in Las Vegas, so it can receive kickbacks. In Vegas, he meets Ginger (Sharon Stone), and they begin a turbulent relationship. Frankly, the actors are mismatched here. It's nearly impossible to believe that these two people care for one another.Sam also has to contend with Nicky (Joe Pesci), a mob member from back home that stirs up trouble and tries to make Vegas his own.Scorsese does a wonderful job directing this time jumping saga. But the way the story is presented - specifically, the voiceover, stifles the action and makes what could be fascinating, bland.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The reward for those who overrated  *GoodFellas*.,"This might not be Scorsese's worst movie  (that would be  *Kundun*), but it may be his most negligible movie, given that it's very much a remake of the director's own  *GoodFellas*, which was a pretty empty affair to begin with. That makes  *Casino*  extremely empty -- call it a black hole.Once again, we get the nonstop soundtrack comprised of Bobby Vinton-esque oldies and 70's album rock.  Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone.  The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . an easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us.  And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration.  This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything.  As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here.Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence  (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more.  But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell.  What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob  (Robert DeNiro)  who wants to be a big player.  His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be  ""legit""  in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.In the meantime, he's got to deal with an old associate, the violent Joe Pesci, and a whory wife  (Sharon Stone)  who's addicted to drugs and, most laughably, a mullet-haired James Woods.  I can buy the whole wife thing, maybe . . . men WILL do stupid things when it comes to blondes.  But I absolutely cannot take Joe Pesci seriously as a fearsome, bloodthirsty mobster who blows into Vegas looking for his own action.  De Niro and Pesci should've portrayed each other's roles.  But what do I know.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Underrated Masterpiece,"Underrated MasterpieceI will admit, I have not seen Goodfellas yet so I'm not sure how it compares to Casino since it came out before and the two are often compared. But I have seen the Wolf of Wall Street (which is very similar) and I must say this was better by a mile. Casino feels important and high quality. The glitz and glamor of Vegas casinos has always been captivating to me.I really enjoyed Sharon Stone's character; she played the trophy wife trope flawlessly and Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci were amazing as usual. The fact that this is a true story makes this all the more interesting. Ace and Ginger's outfits are colorful and fun; this film captured 70s fashion perfectly! I especially love that Joe Pesci's character narrated the movie. Very unique and refreshing because it's usually the main character who narrates but in Casino's case it's not.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Critics have issues,"OK where do i begin, i'm flabbergasted! that Casino doesn't get the attention it deserves. Most critics will say ooo it's just a rehash of Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The film has similarities yes, he uses the same actors playing similar characters yes, but don't you think Scorsese realizes this, don't you think he casted them for this very reason! He not only uses the same actors, he uses the same songs on occasion, he even repeats shots, but in order to give the shot a different meaning. For me Casino is the third and probably final installment of his mob trilogy. With each film he climbs higher up the ranks! Mean Streets starts with local hoods, Goodfellas to the more organized gangsters and Casino to the very top of the chain. I think Casino is probably the finest out of the three, it is certainly the best to look at. The cinematography and use of sound in particular are almost unparalleled. He even uses music from Jean-Luc Godard's Le Mepris, which contrasts the two relationships that are falling apart. Do you really think Casino is just an overlong sequel, do you really think Scorsese would stoop that low. The editing alone is probably the best of his career. Critics are always afraid to pride new films over the classics (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull). Now they are great films don't get me wrong, but i believe Casino deserves to be up there with them, more so than Goodfellas. Some critics have gone on to the say the film fizzles out after the first act? What film were they watching, do they know nothing about narrative pacing. If the film were to continue the pace of the first act i think the majority of the audience would have heart attacks, if they don't anyway. Now get this, it's from the Rolling Stone review. OK, 'What trips up Casino is its straining toward art'. So what exactly do they think Scorsese should be straining for, it doesn't sound like they need a great deal of straining for their reviews. It's little comments like this that really get under my skin. OO Casino's too long, if you think you can put across that much information in a shorter time then you're welcome. OK, that's enough for one night, Casino is an epic gangster masterpiece. A landmark of the 90s. It's not Goodfellas no, in my opinion it's better. However, it does require the viewer to have seen Goodfellas to completely understand what Scorsese is trying to say. I hope time will give this film the recognition it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Goodfellas revisited ...,"Anyone seen Goodfellas? You know ... gangsters, violence, long story, Joe Pesci being a complete and utter maniac? Well, save your bucks. In a nutshell, CASINO is a total replica of a very good film. I'm not saying it's not good. It's just a replica.Sam Rothstein (De Niro) is the man; a gambling genius who (his Jewishness holding him back) becomes THE man in Las Vegas. The problem is that he isn't a made guy cosa-nostra-wise. Doh!! If only he had an Italian background, so many lives could have been spared. As it happens, the Vegas mob bosses insist on Mr. Pesci being there to 'take care' of business. In other words, sadistically maim any idiot who messes with our Sam's good business. Watch out particularly for the 'hammer from nowhere' and Joe's novel use of a Black and Decker workmate which will, guaranteed, bring water to the eyes.Much is made of Sharon Stone's tour de force in this movie as Ginger, Sam's moll. It's definitely a cut above her previous acting credits (who remembers Sliver? answers on a postcard) but at the end of the day, it comes down to her being given a decent script for once, and the chance to ham it up for all she's worth. If screaming and ranting on coke guarantees you plaudits, fair play. Worth a nomination? OK. The Oscar itself? Please.Scorsese is the best director around for this kind of film. You will come out of the cinema saying ""Wow"", ""Yipes"", ""Cool"" etc. Even after a good three hours. No arguments - it is hard hitting and scary. BUT Martin - it's been done before. By you. And with Goodfellas, it was so much more original and, basically, better. De Niro, Pesci and Liotta were seminal. Replace Liotta with Stone, and it's only semi-seminal.Casino will appeal to those who love a good shoot-up, blood and guts and plenty of actors yelling at each other. You will get value for your video rental, if that's what you're after.Let's face it - three hours! But if you want better value, hire out Goodfellas again.",,Anonymous,Crime
Classic That Needs Multiple Views to Be Fully Appreciated,"The first time I saw Casino, I like it and thought it was good, but the second time I saw it, it was even better. The first time through, it is a challenge to keep up with all the ""moving parts"" going on in this true story. Scorcese masterfully edits his scenes quickly and stylishly, sometimes making it hard to get the key details to understand the set up going on in Vegas. But on the second viewing, you know what to look and listen for, especially in the first half hour to an hour.Although the movie does lag at times with the James Woods character (Stone's ex boyfriend), the first hour of the movie is stupendously good. Of course, a movie this good will deliver iconic scenes, scenes that you will always remember and most people will have favorites, much like Goodfellas. Among several others, my favorite scenes include the intro of Sharon Stone's character and then the montage where DeNiro's voiceover is explaining how she works her illegal operation for the casino, the surprise twist at the end relating to the beginning, and I think the ending is my favorite when the voiceover explains how Vegas has changed so much from the old days. There are many other good or great scenes, but these were the best for me.The second time I watched it, I couldn't get out of it even though I didn't intend to watch the whole thing. I just couldn't stop watching it every time it came back from a commercial, and that just shows how good it is. There is a valid legit argument whether this is better than Goodfellas, but I'd give a slight edge to Goodfellas while still not being sure about it.The first time I saw it, I liked it, but I wasn't totally sure how much. The second time I saw it made it official- I love it10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Mobsters in Vegas, as filtered through the ice-cold sensibilities of Martin Scorsese...","From Nicholas Pileggi's factual book about a mobster's immorality and downfall in Las Vegas, NV from 1973 to 1983. Despite sweeping cinematography and palpable evil at nearly every plot-turn, ""Casino"" seems a ""Goodfellas"" retread. Robert De Niro is predictably good in the lead, but Joe Pesci, as De Niro's surly back-up, does nothing new and Sharon Stone, as De Niro's wife, is just the 'token woman', trying to build a character without much genuine material to work with (she's satisfactory). Director Martin Scorsese seems more interested in his characters' actions than their motivations, causing some confusion in the story and leaving many questions unanswered by the end. The film is fast-paced and entertaining, but it doesn't leave a heady imprint behind, and some of the violence verges on self-parody. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Tons of Atmosphere, Tons of Clichés","Martin Scorcese is a film legend. No matter what anyone might say about any of his films, his reputation is unimpeachable. Even his misfires have terrific scenes. ""Casino"" isn't a misfire - far from it - but only manages to be a good film weighed down by the ponderous style and overly didactic expressionism that is Scorcese at his worst.""Goodfellas"" was a Scorcese classic. This isn't ""Goodfellas,"" but it sure feels like a mediocre extension of it. For what it is, ""Casino"" is enjoyable. Unfortunately, one of the hurdles that lesser Scorcese films face is that they bring to mind his better work. This is especially a problem when one of his films uses similar themes and even actors from his classics. Here, we have Joe Pesci from ""Goodfellas"" doing his angry mobster shtick again, and Deniro also reprising his standard wise-guy turn. Further, we have crude hoodlums increasingly turning on each other, having mundane personal problems that cross over into their ""work,"" and exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior after starting out seemingly in complete control. Sound familiar? Well, it probably does if you've seen ""Goodfellas"" or many other, better Scorcese films.Robert Deniro, who at times is brilliant and at times seems to be suppressing a smirk in his ""love"" scenes, overall is fine as a middle-level mob boss who mistakenly begins to believe he is the top dog. So, we have the age-old theme of the inevitable mistake of taking your actual bosses for granted. Throw in Joe Pesci as his old friend who reaches the same conclusion about himself, and watch events unfold. Anyone who's seen mob films stretching at least back to ""The Godfather Part II"" on down the line has to see this train racing down the tracks. No real surprises, standard decline-and-fall stuff relieved by the usual Scorcese flourishes which, alas, went over much better elsewhere.Sharon Stone is the empty center of this film, despite the fact that it supposedly is about Deniro's character. As the antagonist out to smash Deniro's controlled world, she is set up as the biggest thing in Vegas. She has to be for her character to work. Unfortunately, but none of that comes across, at least it didn't to me. Not enough time was spent on her character to show why at first she was so popular (which is odd, considering how long this film goes on), so her inevitable decline doesn't strike the emotional chord it should. Reviewers like to say she deserved the Academy Award, but I don't see it. She does get numerous histrionic moments, but then leaves huge gaps in her devolution. Her character lacks continuity. Stone gives two performances, one as a reluctant bride (why?), and then one as an increasingly unhappy wife (again, why?). Admittedly, she does a good job of acting, but it all seems forced and like, well, acting. Her character didn't grab me.The single most annoying aspect of this film is a self-indulgent Scorcese trademark that reached its nadir here and in ""Gangs of New York."" You may find it charming, or helpful, or entertaining, but to me it is downright distracting and needless. That is a banal historical (this is ""semi-fictional"" in the worst way) explanation and constant narration by the Deniro and Pesci characters which continues right to the end. A little of that works, but it gets way out of hand. The characters repetitiously ""explain"" things that don't need to be explained. For example, the narrator will say, ""And then she hit bottom and blew her money on drugs and pimps,"" and we see Stone stumbling down a hallway, doing her mighty best to show herself ""hitting bottom."" ""And when they found her body...."" and she immediately falls down in the hallway, right on cue. Nice acting, Sharon! The technique is patronizing. It is as if Scorcese is directing the film toward people who are complete blank slates, and know nothing about people, or history, or motivations. But, in reality, the audience is not stupid. It can be trusted to draw the appropriate conclusions, given a story rather than a monologue with accompanying moving pictures. I think Scorcese forgets himself sometimes. I think most viewers would find thinking things through themselves more enjoyable.In other words, skip the quasi-documentary stuff, and this would be a far superior film.Despite my major quibbles, I enjoyed the film because it does transport you to another time and place, Vegas in the early '70s, before, as Deniro the narrator so unnecessarily (but characteristically) explains, ""It became Disneyland."" The fashions (Deniro sporting a gold lamé suit is a riot) alone are worth the time. Just try not to compare this film to true classics.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Scorsese tries to do a Goodfellas 2 but forgets to give substance to his style,"The rise (and fall) of casino boss Ace Rothstein in 1970's Las Vegas.  The film charts Ace's struggle in love with money hungry Ginger McKenna and his struggles to control his business with the violent influence of partner and friend Nicky Santoro.This is very much a rerun of Goodfellas - the running time, the heavy style of Scorsese, the cast, the soundtrack, the violence.  However here the story is so thin that it is really stretched to breaking point.  The first half is mainly just action, heavily stylised scenes with De Niro's voice over giving it a vague direction.  The plot kicks in in the second half with Rothstein's empire crumbling in parallel with his relationship with Ginger.  The action is pretty good, but the lack of narrative is a big problem.In Goodfellas, Scorsese's tricks seemed to be the icing on a very, very good cake.  Here they seem to be a end onto themselves.  Similarly Pesci's performance is very much a turned up version of his Tommy.  Scorsese's tricks, tracking shots and soundtrack all seem to be wasted here - as if he was looking for an excuse to do his visual stuff without needing a strong story.Overall this is an unfortunate version of Goodfellas.  Visually it is great but without a strong story it feels very empty and shallow - After Raging Bull and Goodfellas I didn't think Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci could do a bad movie.

An Underrated Classic,"I haven't seen too many Scorsese films. I've seen The Departed, The Aviator, and 'most' of GoodFellas. I just watched Casino last night and I think I can say it is one of the best, most involving and well-directed films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'. It not only fit's the scene, but the film as a whole.I think it's hard to actually say or write what this film is about, like any great film.

Often Extremely Underrated Due to Comparison and Excitement For Goodfellas,"Put simply, Casino is often completely underrated and discarded because people hold it right beside Goodfellas and compare it with Goodfellas. Most people love Goodfellas, and when they then move on to see Casino, get a bit disappointed that it didn't give them the same vibe or feeling as Goodfellas.I should know, because that's how I felt the first time I saw Casino. I was fresh into a discovering Scorsese films and watched Goodfellas first, a day later, Casino. And after listening to all the hype about Goodfellas and being in that type of mood, I thought Casino fell short.A few years later I watched Casino and loved it, absolutely loved it. It's a slower moving, riveting, slightly disturbing dive into the world of excess. Complete excess. As the characters dive deeper and deeper into their stories, we realize that the film is indeed NOT like Goodfellas in the sense that the characters are not clawing their way to the top with the audience sort of cheering them on and enjoying the cowboy show. No, in Casino the characters ARE at the top, and we have the uncomfortable experience of seeing how they deal with it. There are no REAL obstacles against these people, except for their own vices. What we are left with is a very disturbing and deep tale.I encourage anyone watching this movie for the first time to CLEAR the expectations and hype setup by Goodfellas and Scorsese's reputation overall, and really give this film the time to deliver what it delivers in an amazing way.I also encourage anyone watching this film again who is so decidedly against it (or definitely thinks that it is inferior to Goodfellas) to rethink their position and watch it again with a different mindset.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The things that happen are but it's obviously not so severe that it's too repulsive to bare or anything close (same goes for Goodfellas). That's nonsense, just like all the other excuses. I am still waiting for one reason to why Casino is not a 4-star, all-time classic movie. I can understand how some can watch it and perceive that it's boring, but you have to listen...there's so much going on. So much depth to the characters. And Scorsese is a genius with editing and directing a film. Casino is an unstoppable movie. It's easily cemented into my top 10. It is one of the most underrated movies with a 3 out of 4 star rating; that is an insult to this masterful film. What are you guys seeing? Nothing is wrong with it. Every scene is powerful. Way to go Scorcese. You give us another cinema classic, and get no love. This movie should be top 20 in the Top250 list, a perfect 10 outta 10.Brilliant depth in the acting and writing, great pace, great soundtrack, great storytelling, a superb attention to detail, natural dialogue, and top-notch directing.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good Film, But Nowhere Near Scorsese's Best Work","This is a very solid film, and I think that those who love Scorsese will get a lot of entertainment out of it. However, if you're a casual moviegoer and don't see that many flicks, know that there are a half dozen better Scorsese films out there for you to watch, and some of them even star the same people (""Goodfellas"", ""Raging Bull""). I found this film to be entertaining, and I may, someday, return to this, but I'm far more likely to revisit his other films before I come back to this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Arguably Scorsese's Greatest,"Any cinephile could easily place CASINO in their top 25 favorite movies ever. There have been countless times when I turned to the channel it was then being shown on - just to see what scene it's up to - and end up finishing the last two hours of the film. The way it arrests almost anyone's attention is one of the hallmarks of a Scorsese film, and it is in this aspect that movie-lovers find his genius.The casting is superb. Ace Rothstein - played by Robert DeNiro, a Scorsese regular - is probably the perfect model of what every aspiring gentleman wishes to one day become. The gorgeous Sharon Stone's performance is probably the best in her career as Ginger, but it is really Joe Pesci who shines most in this film. From his accent to his attitude, Pesci perfectly depicts the kind of criminal Nicky Santoro and his real- life persona were.Anyone who even casually likes movies should definitely invest the three hours and watch CASINO. The way Scorsese brings you into the world of the casino and shows you the then-criminal element of its inner workings will give every viewer that curious yearning to participate in the dangers and defiance that all great crime movies instill. While we watch, most of us know what is happening on the screen is wrong, yet somehow we all want to be a part of it - admittedly or not :)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the greatest stories to be underrated...,This movie deserves more then it is given a lot of people call it an under achievement for Scorsese but i think other wise. The story of this movie is beautiful and is portrayed by DeNiro and Pesci at there best. It could not have been any better then it was. The first time I seen this movie I was amazed at how good they captures the world of Vegas and the underworld of Vegas. It is told through the eyes of great performers to give you the great reality of the movie and a great feel to the concept of staying at the top and what people would do to keep that throne. I see this as another masterpiece and a classic that should go down in history as one of the greatest cinematic achievements yet. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"I liked more this film more than ""GOODFELLAS""","Martin Scorsese's ""Casino,"" released in 1995, is a sprawling epic that dives deep into the lurid world of organized crime, intertwining relationships, and the glitzy allure of Las Vegas during the 1970s and early 1980s. Based on the non-fiction book ""Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas"" by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese, the film serves as both a character study and a cautionary tale about greed and ambition.Scorsese's direction in ""Casino"" is nothing short of masterful. He captivates audiences with his signature style, marked by dynamic camera movements, quick cuts, and a meticulous attention to detail that immerses viewers in the vibrant chaos of Las Vegas. The film's visual opulence is matched by its pulsating soundtrack, featuring classic rock and pop songs that further evoke the period's atmosphere.At the heart of ""Casino"" are its complex characters, brought to life by a stellar cast. Robert De Niro plays Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a meticulous and calculating casino manager with mob ties. De Niro embodies Rothstein's internal struggle as he attempts to maintain control over the casino while navigating the turbulent waters of organized crime and betrayal.Sharon Stone delivers a powerful performance as Ginger McKenna, a high-maintenance hustler torn between love and ambition. Her character's evolution from the glamorous wife to a tragic figure caught in a downward spiral highlights the film's themes of desire and disillusionment. Stone's portrayal earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.Joe Pesci, in a riveting performance, portrays Nicky Santoro, a brutal enforcer and Rothstein's childhood friend. Pesci's portrayal is intense and unpredictable, making Nicky one of the film's most memorable characters. The trio of De Niro, Stone, and Pesci creates a dynamic that is both electric and fraught with tension.""Casino"" is, at its core, a narrative about power and the inevitability of corruption. The film explores how the initial allure of wealth and success in Las Vegas is ultimately undermined by greed and betrayal. As Rothstein attempts to eliminate the skimming and corruption in his casino, the reality is that he is also a player in the very game that fuels his existence.The relationships in the film are as much about power as they are about love. The tumultuous romance between Rothstein and McKenna serves as a poignant reflection of the film's broader commentary on the destructiveness of greed. The emotional highs and lows are accentuated by the film's brutal violence, which serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of ambition and betrayal.Though not as universally acclaimed as ""Goodfellas( but i personally like Casino more than Goodfellas)"", ""Casino"" stands as a significant entry in Scorsese's oeuvre and remains a cornerstone of crime cinema. It captures the essence of a tumultuous era in Las Vegas history, interlacing real events with captivating storytelling. The film's exploration of excess, morality, and the human condition resonates powerfully, making ""Casino"" a compelling and unforgettable experience.In conclusion, ""Casino"" is a visually stunning and complex film that delves into the dark side of the American Dream. With its rich performances, masterful direction, and an unflinching examination of power and corruption, it solidifies its place as a classic in the crime genre. Whether you're a fan of Scorsese or simply drawn to intense character-driven narratives, ""Casino"" is a must-see film that will leave a lasting impression.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nostalgia,"I'm not that old but I miss those days when Hollywood churned out these kind of masterpieces. Like everything else in America, greed has won over, even in moviemaking. All we get now are blockbuster, star-studded, silly superhero movies.

A Scorcese Masterpiece,"What else can be said about Martin Scorcese? In Casino he directs another incredible unforgettable film. Once again partnering with the incomparable Robert De Niro and another of his favorite collaborators, Joe Pesci, he once again elicits superb performances. He also gets Sharon Stone to give the best performance of her career. The fact that the very talented James Woods would sign on to be the fourth wheel is a testement to Scorcse's reputation. Even Don Rickles adds something. He has an expression that if you mess with Ace, dire consequences will ensue. Great story, great attention to detail (eg. the spy plane running out of fuel), incredible acting = Sorcese masterpiece, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"NNot as good as Scorsese's earlier Mafia film, ""Goodfellas""","It's a Mafia movie set from 1973 to 1983 in Las Vegas, Nevada. It's a fictional story inspired by the 1995 nonfiction book, ""Casino"" by Nicholas Pileggi. It follows the career of a gambling expert used by the Mob to run the Tangiers Casino from 1973 to 1982.As the three-hour movie opens, we see ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) survive a car bombing. The film then jumps back to his earlier career as a sports gambling handicapper who makes a lot of money for his Chicago-based Mafia bosses. His childhood friend, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), is an enforcer the Mob sends to Las Vegas as protection for Ace.Ace falls in love with a former prostitute and casino hustler, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). She finally agrees to marry Ace, though she still has a strong loyalty to her former boyfriend, a gambling loser named Lester Diamond (James Woods). The film follows the gradual collapse of relationships among the three primary characters, the over-extension of Nicky's reach into the Las Vegas crime world, and the FBI's pursuit of Ace and Nicky. Unusual casting has four comedians in significant secondary non-comedy roles in the film--Don Rickles, Alan King, Kevin Pollak, and Dick Smothers.""Casino"" is too long and too choppy for the first 45 minutes as Scorsese was trying to set up the characters and the Las Vegas setting. It was like whipping through the photos on your digital camera. After that, it settled down a bit, but the plot still wandered, leaving loose ends by its conclusion. Unfortunately, ""Casino"" was not as good as Scorsese's earlier Mafia film, ""Goodfellas.""",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese needs to get back to this kind of film.,"Casino was the last great film made by Martin Scorsese, who is certainly one of America's finest filmmakers. Despite the three hour running time, Scorsese tells us a powerful story filled with memorable characters. Although he seems to have moved on to big-budget extravaganzas like The Avator, and Gangs of New York, it's films like Casino and Goodfellas that properly showcase his incredible talent.The plot centers around Robert DeNiro's character named Ace Rothstein who has been sent by the mafia back east to manage the Tangiers Casino in Vegas. Ace knows everything there is to know about gaming, and he makes the place rather profitable. A good chunk of change is sent back to the mafia bosses each month. Things seem to be going fine until two things happen. First, Ace falls in love with a shady woman (Sharon Stone) who hangs around the casino and extorts money from unsuspecting high rollers. She has a sleazy pimp-like character (James Woods) brooding over her who complicates things further. In addition to all that, the mafia bosses send some muscle (Joe Pesci) into town to presumably watch Ace's back. But this ends up backfiring as Pesci tears the town apart and draws every cop in the city's attention to the Tangiers. Things continually spiral downward for Ace and the gang until the typically violent climax wipes most people out. There are plenty of other details that you will have to experience for yourself.The film introduces characters we care about, and the actors portraying them are exceptional. Stone, Pesci, and DeNiro are all terrific, and James Woods once again reminds us what a scene-stealer he can be. The film is very violent, but also funny at times. It uses many of the same production techniques that made Goodfellas such a wonderful experience. You also get a nice insider's view of how Vegas operated back before it became such a commercial city. The Vegas that Scorsese shows us is for adults, not families.At three hours, the film is indeed too long. There is a little too much time spent on detailing what a bitch Sharon Stone's character is. After she started fooling around with Pesci, we got the point. Still, we are treated to too many arguments between her and DeNiro. I cannot help but think that if Casino had the two hour and twenty minute running time of Goodfellas, it wouldn't have lost a thing. You won't daydream all that much, but you will find yourself wondering when the next scene with Pesci is coming.Casino was made on roughly a $50 million dollar budget. That's chicken feed compared to some of Scorsese's recent ventures. Though it didn't make that money back in theaters, it has since become profitable through the means of home-ownership. Most of the people I know seem to have the DVD in their collections, anyway.It's time to put DiCapprio on the shelf, and start making some more like Casino, Mr. Scorsese! The Hound thinks Casino is worth 9 of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Best Movie of 1995,"Casino(1995) is a fascinating and terrific behind the scenes look at the mob undergoings in Las Vegas during the 1970's and early 80's.  It deals with things that were hinted at in The Godfather(1972).  Casino(1995) received mixed reviews during its release which was due to ignorance from most film critics.  This film is one of the reasons why Martin Scorsese is the best film-maker of his generation.The opening credits are beautifully done using colors to a greater effect. Casino(1995) is a film that was most deserving of a Best Picture award in 1995.  It should be considered as one of the top films of the 1990's. This is an another example of Martin Scorsese being done in by the Academy Award voters as he should have at least five Best Director[Mean Streets(1973, Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)], and six Best Picture awards[Mean Streets(1973), Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), The Last Temptation of Christ(1988), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)].The infamous ""Batting Practice"" scene near the end of the film is one of the five most brutal and vicious sequences in a Scorsese Flick.  The first part of the film are a summary of events and the narrative does not begin until twenty minutes into the story.  Its filled with multiple voice overs from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent.  It was written by the same man who wrote Goodfellas(1990).Casino(1995) takes a look at the upper level mafia as Goodfellas(1990) looked into the lives of low to mid level hoods.  This film deals with the themes of excess, greed, power, and self-destruction.  Like in other Scorsese films, the violence here is sudden and comes out unexpectively. Robert De Niro as Sam is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.There are a few scenes that were really masterful.  One, the scene where Sam explains the different roles of the people working at the casino.  Two, the murders during the climax of the movie. Three, introductions of the main and minor characters in the story.One asset of this movie is Scorsese's Utilization of music used to fit many scenes and situations.  It deals with the end of an era when the mob controlled Las Vegas.  The camera is always on the move as well as being fluid and steady.  The difference between this film and Scorsese's early works is this film doesn't have the gritty of of his 1970s films.Casino(1995) is one of Martin Scorsese's three or four best films of the 1990's and that includes Goodfellas(1990), The Age of Innocence(1993), and Kundun(1998).  Casino was the eighth coraboration between Scorsese & De Niro.  Many scenes(gory ones) were cut from this feature in order to avoid an NC-17 rating.  Casino follows in the tradition of gangster epics ala, The Godfather(1972), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Scarface(1983), Once Upon A Time in America(1984), and Goodfellas(1990).One of the film's best lines is ""Before she could start counting her money, the bosses back home decided to settle the case out of court, so they sent me"".  Everyone contributes to the excellent acting in Casino.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her life.  In my opinion, Sam Rothstein represents Martin Scorsese and the mob bosses symbolizes the Hollywood execs.Casino is more a big budget lavish Independant film then it is a mainstream feature.  Robert De Niro as Sam plays him with unusual restraint espically for Robert De Niro.  Joe Pesci plays a more psychotic version of Tommy De Vito of Goodfellas(1990).  After getting brutally beaten by a Pesci character in Raging Bull(1980), and Goodfellas(1990), Frank Vincent finally gets a chance to return the favor.Scorsese directs with the craft of an experienced pro.  Sam Rothstein is based on career of professional bookie Frank""lefty"" Rosenthal.  This would be the final appearence of the mother of Martin Scorsese in one of his movies.  Casino(1995) as many years pass is a movie that will be acknowledged as one of the director's all time greats.",,Anonymous,Crime
Career-best for all involved. The three hours will just fly by,"Scorsese's follow-up to Goodfellas is a monstrously entertaining drama about a mafia run casino in Vegas. Robert De Niro plays the chain-smoking control freak Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of the Tangiers casino by his mob buddies, most notably Nicky Santoro. Santoro is played by the one and only Joe Pesci, who may very well have topped his performance in Goodfellas. Nicky is a killer, thief, gambler, and muscle-man, who wants the world and is willing to go over the heads of his bosses to get it. Sharon Stone completes the trifecta of immorality as Ginger, a hustler who Sam convinces to marry him even though he knows she doesn't love him. Though the movie is largely the story of the mob embezzlement of Vegas, and the inner-workings, dynamics and politics of running a casino, the relationship between the three main characters is key to the plot.The plot is told unconventionally, and as the story takes place over the span of ten years, many of its scenes feel like anecdotes. But each one adds something great to the whole story. Everything builds to something, there's not one wasted second in the entire 3 hours. It seems to go by very quickly because it is so entertaining. The three leads are absolutely flawless and the drama that unfolds is truly engrossing. All three change as the movie progresses. Ginger starts off as a happy, free-spirited woman, but when she marries Sam she starts a descent into darkness. Sam's controlling tendencies are largely to blame for her slide into drug abuse, greed and compulsive lying. She resents him controlling her, he doesn't trust her enough to give her any space. She spirals further by running away with their kid and Lester, then later tying the kid to the bed when she went out to drink. Sam is the kind of person who tries to do the right thing in all situations, but with Ginger he sometimes overreacts and escalates problems further. Their deteriorating relationship threatens to sink the whole casino scam.Meanwhile Sam's over-protectiveness of his own casino lands him in hot water with the gaming commission, and Nicky's own actions make him a target for the FBI. Both are unable to let go of the monster that they created, Nicky refusing to leave town to let the heat on him cool down, and Sam unable to step out of the limelight of running the casino. The relationship between Nicky and Ginger is interesting because for once we see a human side of Nicky. She ends up sleeping with him, complicating things further. When the house of cards quite literally comes down, the bullets fly in classic Scorsese style. Only Sam is left unscathed, somehow coming full circle, hopefully a much wiser man.Scorsese directs this movie at full-speed, tearing open the rotten underside of Vegas in the 1970s for all to see. From taking us into the inner workings of casinos, to mob shakedowns, husband and wife quarrels, political manoeuvring, and tying it all together, you're always involved. This is a must-see film and one of the best of the 90's.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I loved it! Captured the times well! And I'm in Australia!,"I've seen this about 7 times. What i liked was the disintegration of the relationship between Ace and Ginger. Although founded on shifting sand, it came as a shock to me when they were arguing at the restaurant, and Ace came out with - ""Listen you f---g c--t!"" That was the first time I had heard that combination of words used in a film, and was delivered with such venom that you knew right there there was no going back for them.And another scene i liked was when the sheriff held up a magazine, that had a story on Ace in it, and says -""Of course its true! Its right here!"" pointing to the article....Blueberry muffins, an EQUAL amount of blueberries in each muffin! And the chefs exasperated reply -""Do you know how long thats going to take!"" ha ha haAnd, a tip for life""be a man! and not a f---g pimp""Had a lot of laughs.

Robert the Niro, totally believable, and even Sharon Stone, someone I don't particularly like on screen does an excellent job transforming herself along the movie.One thing I absolutely love in movies is when they talk to you. This happened both in ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas"". I felt as if I was sitting with the characters and they were talking to me. And unlike ""Goodfellas"", where the main character is the one doing the talking, this time a few of the characters talk, and even give you reasons to why they do what they are doing.The plot is about a mafia-controlled casino and about the life and times of Sam Rothstein, professional gamble turned into casino manager and his trigger-happy friend, or about a perfect operation spiraling out of control.You don't want to miss this movie. In fact, I recommend you to own it instead of rent it because you will want to watch it again and again.Keyphrase: ""Why you have to get married is beyond me"".Is a long movie but it doesn't feel long.

Too violent and too long,"Well - Martin Scorsese likes to make very violent movies (Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Cape Fear, etc.) but does he need to do it for any purpose. Why can't he just cut out some of the violent scenes in Casino and reduce the movie to a 2 hour show. After all - I got the picture of a very violent environment after the tenth bullet in the head. I do not need to see every  killing (a lot) in the story - I do not need to see people getting tortured, burried alive and hit with baseball bats all the time. Even when characters of secondary importance to the story got wacked we saw it all.And the language is very abusive. I don't think Joe Pesci's character spoke a sentence in the whole movie without saying the f-word. Does it have to be that way.Not for me. I can tolerate violence and abusive language, but only if it is used to describe the environment or is important to the story. Martin Scorsese uses these two things in Casino only to amuse the audience.Guess what - I'm not amused.I rank this movie as 6 of 10.

Absolute classic - can rewatch again and again.,"""Casino"" stands as an unrivaled cinematic gem, providing an authentic glimpse into the pulsating heart of Las Vegas. Under the masterful direction of Martin Scorsese, the film unfolds as a visually captivating and emotionally immersive experience. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the glitzy casino floors to the gritty underbelly of organized crime.What sets ""Casino"" apart is the powerhouse trio of performances, with Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone delivering nothing short of brilliance. De Niro's portrayal of the ambitious and complex character adds layers to the narrative, while Stone's compelling performance breathes life into the screen. However, it's impossible to discuss the film without acknowledging the exceptional talent of Joe Pesci.Joe Pesci's portrayal of the volatile and unpredictable Nicky Santoro is nothing short of phenomenal. His intensity and charisma inject a palpable tension into every scene, earning him well-deserved acclaim. The chemistry among the lead actors creates a dynamic on-screen synergy that propels the story forward with unmatched energy.The film's soundtrack, featuring iconic hits, serves as a time capsule, transporting the audience to the glitz and glamor of the era. Scorsese's meticulous attention to detail in capturing the intricacies of the casino world is commendable, immersing viewers in the opulence and chaos.In the grand tapestry of crime dramas, ""Casino"" shines as a testament to Scorsese's directorial prowess and the stellar performances of its cast.

The film successfully pulls you right into their world and you will be immersed in it. Scorcese is the master of this genre, and rightly so.

pesci and de niro prove they are one of hollywoods great double -teams,"Robert de niro , joe pesci and even frank vincent turn out together in another movie following the highly under-publicised (though not underrated) raging bull, and goodfellas. They are put on the Las Vegas stage with beautiful precision by the best director never to win an Oscar, Marty Scorcese. This time Sharon Stone joins in this tough, violent and very foul-mouthed gangster movie, plotting the fortunes and eventual misfortunes of a Casino manager (de niro), his mob friend (pesci), and Ginger, a Vegas hustler (Stone).Despite being about forty minutes too long, this film is a superb mix of scorceses documentary style on how the casino never loses money (if only I'd known that before going to Vegas!!), and how Stone literally sent the two main men in Vegas (de niro and pesci)to failure.Although probably not as well flowing as Goodfellas, Casino has many of its own qualities. The music is superb, the subtleties in the script very impresive on about the third viewing, and the violence more bloody and horrific than I have seen in most Hollywood mainstream titles.As much as I love Scorcese gangster films having marvelled over this particular one, and of course Goodfellas (forgetting the slightly disappointing and amateurish Mean Streets) I hope this does not end the partnerships of the actors and director in movies. Note how without De Niro or Scorcese, Pesci has failed to play a very serious (main charachter) role in a blockbuster Hollywood movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Moments of greatness but overall a flawed gangster epic that is still great to watch though.,"""Casino"" is by no means a bad movie but it rather is a flawed one, which is mainly due to the story and its characters. The first two-thirds of the movie is certainly great but after that the movie takes some negative turns and it loses some of its credibility and I lost some of my interested.No question in my mind that Martin Scorsese is a great director but he however does push it at times with this movie. People compare this movie to ""Goodfellas"" for a good reason. Just like ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Bringing Out the Dead"" were similar in many ways to ""Taxi Driver"", ""Casino"" is on many ways similar to ""Goodfellas"". It's a tough gangster epic with lots of graphic violence, lot's of cursing and backstabbing characters. The main storyline is especially parallel to ""Goodfellas"". Yes, you can truly describe this movie as ""Goodfellas"" set in a Las Vegas casino in the '80's. Unfortunately the casino world is not as interesting to follow as the gangster world as portrayed in ""Goodfellas"", at least that's my opinion of it. The movie is too often about 'nothing' really. Style over substance you may say.But also when you judge the movie on its own good you have to come to the conclusion that there are flaws in it. Sharon Stone is great in this movie but her character is distracting from the movie at times, especially towards the ending when almost the entire movie evolves around her character. It gets tiresome at times after a while and the movie loses some of its credibility because of that. There also are way too many characters introduced in the movie, which makes it hard to follow at times. I also never really got in to the character, not even the main characters. I couldn't really care for any of them and it was hard to understand and follow them at time. The movie is also too violent and graphic, even for my taste. It's a bit too much and some scene's are unbearable. Scorsese really pushed it there and should had hold back a little.There's nothing wrong with the style of the movie. It's fast paced and wonderfully looking, also mainly thanks to the director of photography Robert Richardson but also of course to Martin Scorsese's stylish and unique way of directing and storytelling. Yes, there are some memorable sequences present in this movie, which certainly helps to make this movie a better one than most of the others in the same genre.Also of course the presence of some well known good actors make this movie a good one to watch. Robert De Niro is never disappointing in the main lead and Joe Pesci yet again plays a typically hot tempered Joe Pesci role in which he always is just great to watch.

Epic Crime Drama,"I'm a first time viewer of Casino, and it was nothing short of amazing. Where do you even begin?First of all, I've never seen 3 hours of a movie go by so quick. There is literally never a dull moment, and I was truly shocked that the rapid pace of the movie never let up for a moment; it's like a deep breath with no time to exhale. Ironically, however, it doesn't feel rushed. I wanted to take a restroom break, but if you miss one minute of the movie at any point, you can miss a lot, if only a great piece of dialogue or acting performance, in addition to plot developments.Secondly, from Pesci to Stone to Deniro, Oscar worthy performances were all across the board from the leads. These were very difficult roles to play as well as they did, and much credit for that has to go the Scorcese for directing.Next, going into viewing this for the first time, I feared its resemblance to Goodfellas (Deniro, Pesci playing very similar roles) may make me think less of it because originality is one of my biggest factors in rating/scoring, but other than a few similar scenes, it really did actually feel fresh and unique. Pesci in this one is actually far more vicious than in Goodfellas as hard as it is to believe, and I actually preferred his acting in this as the better performance, which I wasn't expecting. It's hard for Deniro in this genre to top Goodfellas' Jimmy Conway, but I would have to say his performance was at least equal to that, if not slightly better due to more emotional range in certain moments.The themes of this movie stretch all across the board, from loyalty to betrayal to marriage fidelity, trust, corruption, and the list goes on, but the one that I liked the most was at the very end, when a main character concludes, ""Why ruin a good thing"" regarding a certain talent. This matched a theme that had just preceded it, which showed how as time goes on, situations evolve, and things change, but the narrator adapts to that by sticking with what he is good at despite that.I'm sure some people will find a few things they didn't like, but this is based on a true story, and the realism was very good. It didn't feel too embellished. The style Scorcese used to film and edit, along with the music, was classic Scorcese, and as of now, I think it may be a little bit better overall than Goodfellas in creativity, except for a couple of scenes in Goodfellas that are better. It's not about comparing or debating which film is better, but pointing out that Casino is right up there very close to, if not on par.Finally, this is just great overall filmmaking as a whole. It is a true ""epic"" crime drama. When watching it, you really get that magical feel that you are watching a classic story and movie. It's the kind of movie that makes you enjoy your popcorn or snacks while watching even more, as you are confident from the start to the middle to the end that it will continue to deliver top notch entertaining scenes. And does it ever..8.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Explosive and underrated,"You can sum this movie up in one word: explosive. Excellent directing by Martin Scorsese. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci once again deliver. The voice-overs work perfectly on De Niro, while Pesci gives the most explosive performance of the film, even better than he is in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone is perfect and should have won the Oscar. Amazingly, this film is the telling of a true story, based on Nick Pilleggi's novel. Great storytelling and the supporting cast is good,too. Scorsese doesn't use score, he uses source music, just like in Goodfellas. The use of source music fits in this story as it covers the 60's to the 80's. Underrated movie, although Stone was nominated, but nobody else, give me a break. Another thing I like, none of the acting is over-dramatic, they deal with the issues as they are.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wonderful,"The natural companion to Goodfellas, Casino is among Marty's finest films. A blistering first hour of exposition about how Vegas works, followed by a mob melodrama that is even more violent and emotionally disturbing than his 1990 masterpiece. DeNiro is wonderful as Sam Rothstein, a very different character than Jimmy Conway, while Pesci successfully tweaks Tommy Devito into a Chicago based nutcase instead of New York. Stone wins the movie, proving she is far more than raw beauty and charisma in a powerhouse performance. Wonderful 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Casino was the greatest movie of all time  for me,"Robert Deniro deliveries his greatest performance of all time in this movie. I became a fan of Sharon stone after this movie. Joe pesci displays his ability to act. Casino is a realistic look at what las vegas was like back in seventies and eighties. Everything from the card sharks, the money laundering, the pimping and murder. Casino takes you into the dark underworld of vegas while delivering a storyline that is based on real events.

Basic mob movie with Deniro and Pesci playing same characters,This movie is as predictable as DeNiro and Pesci get playing mobster type roles.

It had impeccable performances from the lead actors, especially from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, who once again proved how brilliant actors they are.The background score was excellent. It was etched beautifully with the magnificent visuals of the movie.

Jealousy. Greed. Ego. Desire.,"Casino is currently the last film in the legendary De Niro-Scorsese pair-up, and has aged incredibly well, after being underrated and dismissed as a clone of Goodfellas upon release. Indeed, the film sometimes might seem a remake. De Niro is the coolheaded professional, Pesci is the crazed psychopath, as the audience are again taken on a trip into the criminal underworld that predictably falls from paradise to hell.Yet, it would be more accurate to call Casino a comparison piece to Goodfellas, as they match well while going off in satisfying tangents. The first hour of both is essentially the same setup. A glamorous exposition of their current gangster high-life, setting up the game and the players. Its quintessential Scorsese, with tracking shots, voice over exposition and a brilliant, catchy soundtrack. But here they diverge, as Goodfellas, the much shorter film, continues to deal with the work and its consequences, while Casino really delves into its characters as they lose themselves. Casino is certainly a character driven narrative (one could argue Goodfellas is instead a plot driven narrative made perfect by its characters). Our leading trio, the aforementioned males and Sharon Stone in a masterful portrayal of an enigmatic, destructive hustler, all inflate their egos with a deluded conviction of the correctness of their respective visions. In part because of being the lead, and in part as the least destructive character, De Niro's 'Ace' comes off best to the audience, but all are afflicted by delusions of grandeur and greed.The film juggles the character's conflicts and growths well within the three hour film, which is itself a gorgeous depiction of the 'classical' period of Vegas' history, lamented as a relic today. The design, the visuals, the mood feels a different time, and is arguably Scorsese's most well-realised world. The soundtrack adds further to that. And Scorsese's direction is on top form, as is expected, and one finds it difficult to forget Scorsese's masterful hand guiding the film.In terms of the performances of the leads, while De Niro is undeniably excellent, he is really the base from which the other two launch. Joe Pesci is at his very best here, surpassing Raging Bull and Goodfellas, and while the role is essentially a retread of the latter, it's expanded, deeper, and thematically goes with the film; the character is still a wild-card, but not nearly as much as a black sheep. His ego, his desire, they fuel him. Sharon Stone rounds it off, deserving of her Academy Award nom, providing a physical manifestation of Vegas: the money, the excess, the greed, the lure of self-destruction. Her relationship with De Niro is the core of the film.The film is certainly excellent. And one tries not to compare it too much to other Scorsese films, especially Goodfellas. Yet its unavoidable when considering their similarity in theme, style and even cast & crew. Casino basks in its own excesses more than necessary- the length particularly. And it does many things right, but nothing much new. It's Scorsese at his most derivative of self, with the possible exception of being one of the few of his notable films to portray a strong leading woman (who is an independent character of herself) alongside the many men. The film is almost lazy in its unoriginality. And unfortunately it never matches the memorability of, say, Goodfellas.Nonetheless, Scorsese is on top form, with a fantastic setting and cast, and worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ultimately, a mafia film about mafia men's attempts to colonize an unfamiliar environment","Casino is less of a film about casinos and gambling and more of a film about two mafia men's very different attempts to build a new life in Las Vegas or build a foothold mafia colony in Nevada.The casino and the gambling industry is simply a backdrop to the story - the film could've been about any other industry with little changes to the main story, which is the two men, almost completely disconnected from the mafia bosses, who run things their own way in a bizarro-land.It is a bizarro-land in that what's illegal is legal (gambling and bookies are legal), the businesses (casino houses) are very powerful and have their own muscle, there is no mafia presence (other than themselves), no street crime, no rival families or gangs, law enforcement is not as organized, a different kind of government/way of doing things/getting permits and licenses that they're used to, and how they adjust to this completely different environment.If one were to group mafia films into categories: beginnings of an organized crime family, rise/decline of a family, rise/decline of an individual member/boss of the family, wars between established families, and so on, this would be its own category of mafiosos in a completely unfamiliar environment.The film is long, but doesn't feel long. It's packed with story - the scenes are short, dialogue is to the point, it is filled with events. It is a long story condensed and cut down to almost 3 hours rather than a short story stretched with long panoramas, filler, story threads that go nowhere, mood scenes and such. There is no fat in the film and the story to footage ratio is almost 1:1 - you can't cut anything without affecting the story.It's a great film, not just for its time, but for all time. It's not the most original film, but how original can a mafia film be nowadays? It's not high on originality, but it's high on quality.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best mob/gambling movie in modern film,"I rated Casino a 9 because of it's appeal on many levels.  It has the mafioso saga story that The Godfather mastered, but is combined with the setting and story of early 1970's Las Vegas.  This unique combination is what appealed to me the most, not to mention the all-star cast.  It is a terrific story that, like most great films, is dramatic, funny and thought-provoking all at the same time.  Any male in the 20-35 year-old demographic would probably enjoy this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A tad too violent and not interesting for those who don't gamble in Casinos,"Once again, we get the nonstop soundtrack comprised of Bobby Vinton-esque oldies and 70's album rock. Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone. The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . An easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us. And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration. This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything. As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here. Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more. But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell. What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob (Robert DeNiro) who wants to be a big player. His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be ""legit"" in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Heard about it, but haven't seen it yet? Lose a man card.","The first half of the 1990s was a glorious, competitive time for mob films. Okay, so we started off with the disappointing (but far from terrible) The Godfather: Part 3, but later that year Martin Scorsese released GoodFellas, which many people consider to be the definitive gangster film. In that same year came Miller's Crossing, and Quentin Tarantino added to the palette with both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. In 1995, Marty hit back with Casino, redefining the blockbuster genre in a way that wasn't emulated until some twelve years later, when Nolan got his hands on the Batman franchise.Comprising of an all-star cast headed by the incomparable Robert De Niro, Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, America's finest bookmaker in the 1970s and 80s, whose knowledge of the industry lures him to Las Vegas. At the behest of the Mafia, he becomes the executive manager of the fictional Tangiers casino. Childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes along for the ride, and all seems to run smoothly until a desire for women, wealth and the very essence of Vegas sends the gambling empire into a tailspin.Expect nothing less than utter professionalism in the direction department. Scorsese gives the audience an excellent look into the luxury, excess and emotion that defined Las Vegas for so long. The visuals are striking, displaying the bright lights of the city in external scenes, and giving the film a glossy undertone during internal scenes; a highly unconventional technique, but one that reflects the tone perfectly.As with most of Marty's masterpieces, Casino is unique in the way that it dosen't follow a structured plot. Rather, the film is, for lack of a better phrase, a whole bunch of 'things' that happen, and how they impact on (or are caused by) the main characters. In fact, a positive aspect of the movie that isn't recognised by most is just how much influence the characters have on the story.The first half of the film is concerned with how Ace and Nicky run the casino: turning over profits, keeping customers happy and dealing with cheaters. The second half deals solely with each character's personal issues, and how they destroyed something so valuable from the inside out. We see how Ace's hustling wife Ginger (Sharon Stone, in a career-best performance) turns two former friends against each other, while slowly killing herself as well. There is no doubt that the events of the second half are on a smaller scale to those of the first, but so much more emphasis is placed on the former because of the magnetism and excellent performance of each actor.Drama is on high supply for the film's entire three-hour run time, but allows for some well- written comedy to complement the pace. For all the excellent younger actors Scorsese has worked with in the past decade, none of them convey the effortless on-screen chemistry of De Niro and Pesci, whether they are joking with each other, or wishing death upon one another.At its simplest, this can be called the ultimate guy's movie. It features shooting, swearing, suits, money, fast cars and even faster women. Delve a little deeper, and you'll appreciate the practically flawless acting, indulgent cinematography and a cautionary tale just as critical of greed and the flaws of human beings as Wall Street or Scarface. I take issue with this film's tagline: 'You don't stay at the top forever', because it will take one hell of an effort to knock Casino off this movie-lover's list of top 20 films.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

The movie is decent, but certainly not as good as Goodfelllas, taxi Driver or Raging Bull.The movie starts out very strong - I like the first half a lot better than the second half of the movie. The last half kinda tails off, the plot becomes a little ridiculous and it is hardly about a casino at all.The movie as usual with Scorsese movies is shot very well, and the acting is great even if DeNiro and Pesci are playing roles they've played before - especially Pesci who is virtually playing the same character he played in Goodfellas. Its always a treat to watch DeNiro act in these types of movies - even if he is rehashing old ground.The movie kind of felt like Scorsese was trying to top Goodfellas but I think he ended up a little short. i give it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Too Much Expository Narration and ""F"" Bombs","This movie could have been a very interesting drama about Las Vegas gangsters, but Martin Scorsese ruins it with the film-making technique he used in ""Goodfellas"": expository narration. It was annoying in ""Goodfellas,"" but is very heavily used here. Instead of letting the action guide the plot, he has characters give background narration for every single point of action in the damned film. You're TOLD rather than SHOWN what happened. If I wanted to be told something, I'd read a book. Movies a re more interesting when character dialogue and action move the plot. Narration slows the movie down to a grinding halt.Oh, and there's ""Casino's"" claim to fame: the most uses of the ""F"" word in an English-language non-documentary film. Every other word is ""F"" this and ""F"" that. I know gangsters are tough, macho men who love to speak dirty, but this is way too much. Again, this is where action may have helped to convey the characterization of tough gangsters, rather than the ""F"" word every second. This film needed better dialogue. ""The Godfather"" has excellent dialogue, and though there are dirty words, it's balanced out by intelligent writing. ""Casino"" doesn't have going for it in terms of good writing, unless it's to show that the Vegas mob was run by a bunch of unintelligent morons who can't form a complete sentence without the ""F"" word.The acting is extreme and over-the-top. Sharon Stone is less than spectacular as a drug-addled, high-strung moll. She's either laughing or screaming, and nothing more. She chews the scenery like a starving pit bull. De Niro does little but blend into the background. Joe Pesci seems like his SNL caricature, screaming and squeezing heads into vices.Granted, I'm interested in the history of the Las Vegas mob, and this movie is based on a nonfiction book; but the writing was bad, and the narration device distracted from my enjoyment of the action. I didn't like ""Goodfellas,"" but it was leaps and bounds superior to this dreck. I do not recommend this, except maybe for a rental. Watch the DVD extras that feature an A&E documentary on the real Las Vegas mafia.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why should you watch this movie?,"I grew up in the nineties and the most worn out movies in my VHS collection was Casino and Resivior Dogs. The consensus was Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction were the better of the two and I thought I agreed. Although, after 25 years my opinion is a lot more constructive. Goodfellas is not good, it's great but Casino is different. Yes it is a mob movie and it's within 5 years of the great Goodfellas but it takes what was innovative in GF and it improves it. The colours, the set design, the costumes and the music really leaves an impression, almost like Scorcese was showing off his one of kind, unique style and finally perfected it. I love Goodfellas but Casino is something else, it's rich and long, the characters are almost too much, but it works. It is well worth the almost 3hr commitment ,it captures a mob story set in 1970s Las Vegas, a Las Vegas that will never be seen again. I High recommend this.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

SCORCESE AT HIS FINEST HOUR!,"I have never been a Martin Scorcese fan. I did not like TAXI DRIVER. Even as much as I love mob films, I didn't care all that much for GOODFELLAS.

It is strange because I didn't like GOODFELLAS, but I love DeNiro and Pesci. In CASINO, DeNiro and Pesci made the movie as great as it was.Robert DeNiro is Ace Rothstein, who is an expert gambler. He is asked by the Midwest Mob to take control of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. He immediately cleans up the casino of crooks (in one scene, a man who is caught cheating has his hand beat with a hammer) and brings in a lot of money for the bosses. During this time, Ace meets Ginger (Sharon Stone), who is one of the most notorious hustlers in Vegas. He falls in love with her and they marry, even though she is still faithful to her ex-pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods.)

Gangster Tragedy,"In the 90's, Martin Scorsese directed two great rags to riches to rags again gangster movies. The first was 1990's ""Goodfellas"". The second was 1995's ""Casino"". Both movies are based on books by Nicolas Pileggi, and screenplays written both by Pileggi and Scorsese. The movie takes an excellent look inside the old Las Vegas when gangsters ran it. Robert De Niro is in top form as Ace, the main character that works his way up in Vegas. Joe Pesci is also excellent as Nicky, who seems to be a somewhat toned down version of his character Tommy from ""Goodfellas"". This is Pesci's best work to date. Sharon Stone, James Woods, Kevin Pollack, Alan King, Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, L.Q. Jones, and Dick Smothers round up the excellent support cast. The soundtrack to the movie is one of the best assembled. Robert Richardson, who did a majority of Oliver Stone films, does an excellent job at cinematography in his first Scorsese film. Scorsese regular Thelma Schoonmaker does another excellent job of film editing.This film, along with ""Goodfellas"" and ""Blow"" deliver the time old theme of becoming powerful, and then losing it all. I've always believed these movies are excellent at showing this theme way better than some films, especially Brian De Palma's version of ""Scarface"" (even though Al Pacino is excellent).

Really a super movie.,"This film is one of the best films i have ever seen. All the movie- script- and actor- performances are outstanding. I give this film 12 of 10 . ;-) I think that Martin Scorsese is one of the best director's and I hope that he get a Oscar for one of his next movies. The most interesting roll in that movie are the roll of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Ginger McKenna/Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, Lester Diamond, Billy Sherbert ,Andy Stone, Phillip Green, Pat Webb, Senator and Frank Marino. The light in the film is very much excellent. And the camera has fine attitudes. The movie is a big masterpiece. It's really a super film experience.

Classic,"Really liked the pace of the movie,you never get bored or feel that it doesn't go anywhere, you really feel what was like in Las Vegas in the 70s the feeling that you could do everything because of the corruption, the first 30 minutes of the movie are excellent, you get to know everything about what the main characters are and want, the costumes are incredible , de Niro in every scene he's presence really gets you to want to see what he is gonna do next, but the highlight of the movie is Joe Pesci you feel that he would do pretty much everything to get what he wants, power, money, and the desire to be someone in this life and what might happen if you get too far, that's why it is an all time

"Eh, not the best...",Mafia Movies are my thing so I know and seen them all. It was alright. I thought it could have been a much better movie. The effects were too fake and not enough action. As for the effects... One part Joe Pesci kills a lady by shooting her in the head three times at close range. No blood whatsoever. Joe Pesci tilts the head and blood comes from the mouth. No too fake. Anothing I didn't like was that Joe Pesci. He can act but he isn't all that good in the bad guy role. I dunno it just wasn't that good. It isn't worth the buy.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"CASINO is long on local color and short on narrative drive. CASINO is also just plain long, clocking in at an excessive 182 minutes.","Martin Scorsese does deliver a vivid, pulsating look at what goes on behind the scenes in the temples of gambling out west, but fails at the human drama. Robert De Niro stars as Sam Rothstein, a Midwestern bookie with mob connections who is sent to Vegas in the '70s to run the Tangiers Casino. Sam is a hard worker and keeps his bosses in Kansas City happy with regular deliveries of cash-filled suitcases. Things start to go awry when his childhood buddy Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes to town. Nicky is a psychotic gangster/lowlife whose strong-arm enforcement techniques eventually do him in. Sam has also fallen for blonde bombshell Ginger (Sharon Stone), a gold-digging hustler. For some unknown reason, Ginger can't seem to give up her former pimp, the slimeball Lester Diamond (James Woods). Maybe she's just attracted to his name. The jewelry collecting Ginger would certainly find ""Mrs. Diamond"" more her style than ""Mrs. Rothstein."" We unfortunately remain passive observers of the downward spiral that consumes these characters. As the third hour dragged on, I just got more and more impatient for the whole thing to be over. I want to be leaving Las Vegas. De Niro does De Niro as usual, but the character's emotional revelations are small potatoes. Pesci does a veritable reprise of his GOODFELLAS part. Funny at first, with his ""F""ing vocabulary, Nicky soon starts to grate on the nerves. Quick, bring out the baseball bats. Sharon Stone does a respectable job as Ginger, but a Golden Globe win over Susan Sarandon (not to mention the ignored Kathy Bates) is a bit tough to swallow. The non-stop soundtrack of 70's hits is distracting at times, but the costumes and set designs are just right. Frankie Avalon, Jayne Meadows, Steve Allen and Jerry Vale play themselves.

An unmissable but brutal experience,"A glimpse into the gritty underworld of organised crime and the people who inhabit that world. The Characters are all complex individuals with various hang ups, drug addiction. Gluttony. Rage issues. Which all make it fun to try and decide if you like/dislike each of them. Some of the behaviours are deplorable but you are forced to ask yourself if the actions of an individual are due to their circumstance and relationship to others or are they simply just terrible human beings. This is what makes Casino so good. The acting is great and the story is well thought out and the fact that it is based on true to life events really brings home the authenticity of the content. Real life gangsters were completely ruthless and merciless. And some of the graphic depictions are brutal but are believable and this makes them even more intense to watch. De Niro. Pesci and Stone are all excellent. Especially Sharon Stone, she plays an outstanding part and definitely falls into that realm of not being able to decide if you are rooting for her or not. Overall a complete movie. Only small gripe is that it's very much of a similar vein to a number of Movies in this Genre that were massively popular at the time of release, So It's sticking to a successful formula. Without doing anything revolutionary. But this doesn't mean it isn't excellent. A very strong 8.5+.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unbelievably underrated. As good as GoodFellas. A true Scorese classic.,"This is a movie that I have watched 50 times. And all I want to do is watch it again.Let me start of by saying, a lot of people keep saying 'This is not as good as GoodFellas'. Well that's simply not true. The movie is based on the real story of the upbringing of Las Vegas as we know it today and the main people behind it. This in itself is one the most fascinating mob stories of one of the most fascinating places on Earth and Martin Scorsese and all the actors have really brought this story on screen so incredibly well.The movie will keep you glued to the screen and it's incredible detail,acting, voice overs and sets are nothing short of the work of a true genius of film making.Robert DeNiro plays the role of Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal and he portrays the character to perfection (seriously, it's inch perfect) along with Joe Pesci who scares the life out of you when you watch him in this movie. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci's character) is the real muscle of the mob gang at that time in Vegas, and boy we can see that through Joe Pesci's incredible portrayal of the real life character.It is important to mention the incredible performance by Sharon Stone as well. She pushed herself to the limit with this role and this role really needed someone at the limit, so they way she carried herself through this role is incredible.Martin Scorsese, your detail in this movie is out of this world. There is not a second of the 2 hours and 50 minutes that is off key. It is perfect to the dot.Phenomenal movie. A must watch. One of the all time greats.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best movies I've ever seen,"Great cast. Great costumes. Great dialogs. Great scenes.

One of the Ten Best Movies Ever Made !!,"this is a rare gem of a film which is based on the true story of Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal and Anthony ""The Ant"" Splitoro renamed Sam Rothstein and Nicky Santoro for the film.Playing Sam Rothstein is none other than Robert De Niro, supported by Sharon Stone as Ginger Rothstein, Sam's wife, and Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro, Sam's friend. There are many other familiar faces from Scorsese's film Goodfellas his prior mafia epic. Like Goodfellas this film is filled with the violence and seedy, yet classy environment of the underworld.The basic plot is that Sam is a good handicapper who is given control of a new casino, the Tangiers, which is bankrolled by the Kansas City mafia. He moves out to Las Vegas to run the place, and he runs it very well, keeping out scam artists and cheaters. After a while, he becomes romantically involved with Ginger, a respected hustler who makes her rounds in Vegas, but has a troubled personality and history. He is later joined by his gangster pal Nicky Santoro, who moves out to Vegas with the intentions of conquering the city's criminal rackets.Another good thing about the film is its soundtrack. Since the film takes place in the 1960s and 1970s, we are treated to all sorts of great music from classic artists. The soundtrack occupies two compact discs, giving you an idea of how much of a role the music plays in this movie.This film also features what I consider one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The camera rolls over waves of flashing lights, which represent the flashiness that Vegas is all about. The only complaint that I have about the beginning of the movie is the scene where a car explodes and a dummy is painfully visible in the front seat. Marty, how on earth could you have missed this?! De Niro really carries his role well. He plays a real tough guy, but at the same time we see how vulnerable he is to women. Despite his questionable background, he wants to play the casino straight and not get involved in any activities that could get him removed by the gaming board this is arguably one of De Niro's finest performances This is also Sharon Stone's best performances, She plays the role of the drugged up wife very convincingly, with very real emotion. We watch with horror as she goes from being a classy hustler to a bored housewife with a severe drug problem with a certain horror Stone surprises in this film and was fully deserving of the Oscar nom But im afraid the real show stealer here is Joe Pesci who gives out an amazing and hilarious, yet disturbing performance as Nicky Santoro. At the beginning of the film, he is a lowly gangster, but by the end of the film he has created his own criminal empire and exhibits a lot of power in a scary way. His performance in this film is very similar to the one he gave in Goodfellas, with essentially the same explosive personality, although quite a bit darker he should have won the Oscar that year without a doubt his best performance.The set locations are perfect for this film since all of the casino shots were taken inside of an actual Vegas casino. At the same time, the casino was convincingly reverted to the film's era, making us feel like we are in the early days of Vegas. It is definitely not the modern commercialized Las Vegas, but the older, frightening, yet classy Vegas where you don't try to rip off the casinos out of fear.Scorsese uses a lot of shots with an interesting light effect, where bright light is shone brightly onto one or more actors in the shot. This creates a surreal appearance and makes the person look superior or even godlike. He also pulls some very interesting camera angles and uses special effects sparingly.One of the things that Scorsese does really well is to explain everything the viewer without making it boring. Right at the beginning of the movie, he explains who everyone is and how the casino was started. Throughout the movie, characters engage in narration to reveal their thoughts where we might otherwise be left guessing. I think this adds a nice touch and we feel as though we are inside the character's head as they give the narration.Overall, this is one of my favorite films of all time and definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films. It is a true shame that he did not win an Academy Award for this achievement, since he clearly deserved it. I regard it as a must-see film, valuing it has one of the ten best movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worth Experiencing,"It is unfortunate that 'Casino' is usually perceived merely as a critique of the Mafia. Much more than a cliché condemnation of the criminal underworld, the film delivers a mordant 'j'accuse' against the degradation of the self-destructive socioeconomic system (including cops, government bureaucrats, politicians) that generated and institutionalized the Mafia's role in contemporary Americana.Upon relocating to Las Vegas, childhood friends Sam Rothstein and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) submit their gangster experience to the disposal of the local mob network, which controls the gambling industry. Rothstein rapidly excels as a Mafia-sanctioned casino manager luxuriating in a Roman lifestyle, while Santoro successfully commands the rougher, more violent aspects of the underworld business. Soon, however, their virulent lifestyles and incessant greed leads them to a downward spiral of confrontation and deceit, accentuated by their common lust for femme fatale Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).This fascinating Franco-American co-production ought to be commended for its caustic inquiry into the rotten economic foundations of the American dream. Moreover, it achieves this without seriously compromising its solid cinematic components (storytelling, cinematography and overall cohesion), while also giving prominence to Stone's extremely well-acted, visible female character, amid all the Mafiosi male chauvinism.On the downside, the screenplay is often vaporous, and some of the inevitable violence is truly stomach churning. Yet these deficiencies should not discourage hardened fans from taking a look. Worth experiencing, 6.5 stars out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Low Life in the High Life,"I worked for a Mississippi casino at the time this film hit the big screen. Obviously, there are tremendous differences between Las Vegas casinos of the 1970s and Biloxi casinos of the 1990s--but even so I was stunned by the accuracy with which Scorsese's CASINO nailed the industry and the personalities that inhabit it. From the slick hair and pin stripe suits to the endless profanity to the count room to the surveillance room, CASINO is uncomfortably close to the truth.Based on the life of 'Lefty' Rosenthal, CASINO offers the story of Las Vegas' last gasp of mob domination before the big corporations began to move in. Robert De Niro is ""Ace"" Rothstein, a mob-connected gambler who rises to control of one the biggest mob-owned casinos in town--and then sees his control slips away through his misplaced love for beautiful and brazen Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and his association with gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci.) And when their various activities begin to draw heat on the mob bosses, can murder be far behind? The cast is really top notch. De Niro and Pesci offer memorable performances, as does a superior supporting cast that includes James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, and Melissa Prophet, to name but a few--but the real laurels go to Sharon Stone, who plays out the rise and fall of the glamorous Ginger with surprising skill. But even so, and in spite of its memorable cast, dialogue, plot, and production values, CASINO has a slightly awkward feel to it. Part of the problem is the film's inconsistent reliance on voice-over narration that shifts uneasily between De Niro and Pesci; part of the problem is the film's uneasy shifting between love story and gangster movie. And in the final analysis the film seems overlong.For all its flaws, CASINO is an extremely watchable, very memorable movie that stands up very well on its own in spite of inevitable comparisons to GOODFELLAS. In passing, I note the DVD package has few extras, and most viewers will be as happy with the VHS version as with the DVD. But be it DVD or VHS, the film is strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
odds in favor of Marty fans....,"""Goodfellas"" takes Vegas sees Scorsese's usual players meandering their way through the expected labyrinth that is Lost Wages, Nevada. The mob portion is kept very brief near the front end, with DeNiro then heading West to man a mob-run casino. There's your basic dealings with skimming, teamsters, the feds, cheats, and whatnot. Pesci is then thrown into the mix as an enforcer to keep everybody who threatens DeNiro, in line. For good measure Stone arrives as an all-flash bimbette who placates well-to-do men with her wiles.My main problem with the film lied mostly in the Scorsese going shockingly against type. First, we have one of the most passive DeNiro performances of his Marty career, as a (Jewish??) guy I kept screaming at to take some freaking action. He allows those who pose a threat to his world to just walk all over him at an alarmingly high rate. Namely, Stone, whom he inexplicably has some undying love for, despite her personality not going beyond a hot blonde of opportunity. That he could be so incessantly forgiving, made me nuts. I kept praying for the explosive Bobby D. we all know and love to show up, but he never arrived.Then you have Pesci, basically aping his own ""Goodfellas"" character, as a leprechaun-esque tough guy whose main fear-striking device is drop F-bombs at top volume. Or kicking the sheeyit out of guys as long as he (Pesci) has others there to watch his back. At least his character takes an unexpected turn that we're told is a huge no-no in the mob culture.People have always been vastly divided on Stone; some hated her, some were surprised and vaunted high praise. I was pretty much on the fence with her, as her two-note (sexy or drunk) offering had your standard indifference to it.James Woods is wasted (and realizing who his co-stars were, seemed to go into Pesci mode for the one scene he was allotted), Rickles and Smothers are thrown in for some Vegas flair, with your usual assembly line of reliable Scorsese Italianos rounding out the supporting roles.Then there's Scorsese himself as they guy at the helm. I've never really been a fan of forced or tortuous violence in a film (the Freddys and Jasons were always quick about it), but where was it here??? Where's the Marty Scorsese of old who covered his filmstock in off-putting gore? The fact that he (finally) shoehorns in some toward the last reel was a real let-down.The film hardly drags, and the narration was an acceptable technique, but in the end I couldn't have cared less whatever happened to any of these people. Unlike ""Goodfellas,"" where, though the main characters were ""villians,"" I felt so awash in their journey by film's end, that you feel you've really been taken to another place by the actors.

"Casino, at cut above most","Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese collide in their eighth and final (to date) film in their partnership in this true story about gangster who get it all wrong. Based on the true story of Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro this was bound to be good and by geez it delivered. Voiceovers, constant background music and also constant swearing (423 f-bombs!) result to make a very powerful film that is very well acted and also is told brilliantly. Scorsese uses a method which he also used in Raging Bull where he begins from near the end. The first voice-over really gets you interested, as soon as Robert De Niro's character says this you know the film is going to be good: 'When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had'. This first line got me interested immediately and I am sure it will make most viewers want to watch for the whole three hour period. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci come together in a film for the third time and once again they click instantly, De Niro the successful guy who runs the casino, Pesci the man who stops anyone get in De Niro's way, it really is great stuff and you really start to believe that they are the characters and are not just acting. Sharon Stone showcased her talent like no one thought she could in this film and certainly deserved her Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast are also brilliant and get you into the film with such ease it seems like you can't see or hear all the carnage that is going down on screen. Music plays a huge part in the film and in fact there are 61 different songs used in this film, most of them actually being proper songs that are not soundtrack songs. The one criticism for the film is that sometimes the music was on at unnecessary times and you could occasionally not hear as well as you might. To compare this to other Robert De Niro-Martin Scorsese films would (in my opinion) put it third on the list and this was certainly an amazing film. Comparing it to other gangster films is a bit different but I would still say it it up there with such masterpieces as The Godfather, if not possibly better.

Casino ~ a crime drama from 1995...none other than Martin Scorsese could create this masterpiece,"Martin Scorsese's directorial masterpiece. With quasi-documentary accuracy, he sheds light on the criminal power structures behind the red carpets, the green poker tables and the chinchilla fur coats in Las Vegas in the 1970s and 1980s.When the city of sin was still the vicious extension of the Wild West and not, as it is today, a kind of Disneyland for narrow-gauge racketeers.The effervescent, multi-perspective information jumble is accompanied by an almost virtuoso rhythmic stylistic confidence that is still unparalleled today.It feels like not a minute goes by without a song accompaniment, voice over or a tear drop. ""Casino"" is bold excess and yet detailed analysis, hysterical and yet completely to the point. What is also incredibly impressive is that Scorsese's mafia deconstruction reaches a disturbing climax in terms of violence.The master has never been more cruel or more virtuoso in showing the bestial logic of self-preservation and self-destruction that gradually spirals out of control.Conclusion: Despite the long running time, I didn't find ""Casino"" tedious.

Truly A Sparkling Diamond!,"""When you love someone, you've got to trust her, there's no other way. Otherwise what's the point? For a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had...."" just then, Sam Rothstein was thrown into the bonfire caused by the explosion of his car. As the extremely sorrowful melody of Bach's St. Matthews Passion slowly brought us into the fanscinating world, where it's the paradise for gamblers, drug dealers, prostitutes, gangsters and killers - Les Vages, 1973, the story unveils...This film is not just a crime drama, but indeed a tragedy as well. I know that De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese have made crime films together, ""Goodfellas"" for example. However, I don't really have anything to say about De Niro and Pesci, since I'm not their fan and haven't really watched a lot of their films. I only know that they both are pretty serious actors and have played killers or leaders of the underworld. But I do admire the talent of Martin Scorsese. This one and art film ""The Age of Innocence"", which he directed and made uncredited cameo appearance. He skillfully directed both films with different styles, and has made both of them wonderful!I remember I was still pretty young when this film was released. And I couldn't stay in the theater to finish it because of all the dirty languages and cruel shooting and violence. But years later, when I found this film in the local video store, I rent it and this time, I could appreciate and understand this film much better. I was amazed by the flawless, perfect direction of Martin Scorsese, and especially by the powerful, excellent performance of Sharon Stone! This is undoubtedly the best performance of her career! And a must-see for her fans! Golden Globe and The Academy Award nomination that she won for this is the best proof of her success!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not comparable to goodfellas,"Goodfellas is a lot better. This is a clone but worse. The colors of the movie is also a lot uglier. There were parts of the movie that was just too boring.

"Scorsese, DeNiro, Pesci, gangsters. Enough said.","A near flawless film. Many probably don't agree, but I do place this one, 1 notch above Goodfellas. Don't get me wrong, Goodfellas is a great film in it's own right, but for me Casino takes the cake. For a 3 hour film it passes quickly and is wholly entertaining. One of my favorite aspects is the performances. I am not a huge Sharon Stone fan, but Martin manages to get a full out dramatic performance out of her, definitely her best role in her entire film career to date. I can watch this film once a year and never get bored and I always watch from beginning to end. I believe this is his most underrated mob movies, which is unfortunate, because it is definitely my favorite.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
I liked it a lot.,"Casino was a cool movie. I liked it because it didn't follow traditional lines of storytelling. It's almost like director Martin Scorsese keeps wanting to make ""non-poetic"" gangster movies as a rebuke to the Godfather. perhaps not. But his gangster movies are always ""realer"". And less likable. All the more reason as to why I enjoyed this movie very much.Dinero as usual gives and outstanding performance. As do Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone and James Woods. Don Rickles steals the movie. There is great tragedy on this comic's face. The Voice Over narration works well in this movie and I was interested in it all the way through. The songs also kept me interested. Where do they get all of these old songs? it was really great. The editing and pacing kept it moving very fast, but not so fast that you couldn't easily follow the story line.It's violent, sou you would want to warn any youngsters before you watch it with them.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Seriously overrated, dreadfully bloated","Quality production value and a fine cast, but too bloated and too violent. Scorsese is revered as a filmmaker but personally I have a problem with how he revels in and glamorizes violence, and there are several scenes of sadistic cruelty here. His protagonists (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) are full of toxic masculinity and while they pay in the story line for their choices, there is also a degree of admiration for them on display, and no real examination of the impact of their violence on others. They are men among men who know the score, know how the corrupt system works and are just better at playing it than others. The annoying soundtrack and overused narration just amplify this. I liked the arc of the relationship between these old friends who gradually become enemies and found Pesci's profanity (and accent) funny even though it wasn't meant to be, but the interminable melodrama with the wife (Sharon Stone) and all her ridiculousness (tying her daughter to a bed, snorting coke in front of her daughter, etc) dragged the film out far too long. Really hard to see how this one is rated as highly as it is.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Damn cool movie,"Once again Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Pileggi, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci unite for another epic mob movie, based on a true story. Casino tells the story of Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of a mob controlled casino. Joe Pesci plays his friend, Nicky Santoro, from back home years ago who comes out to A) Protect Sam and the casino and B) make some cash for himself. He does just that. Along the way, Sam begins a relationship with Ginger, a hustler at the casino played by Sharon Stone. It tells the story of how the mob controlled casinos, and how people like these helped mess it up. From the opening scenes, one can see that Scorsese is following the Goodfellas format of flashback/voiceover work, but this benefits the movie. DeNiro and Pesci are on top form again, as is Sharon Stone surprisingly. Over all, a very well written, acted and directed film, the only drawback being it's length. Word of warning, this film is very violent at times. You would have heard of the vice scene by now as it helped garner this film some notorority, but it isn't the only one. If you can handle the violence and language, then this is a very rewarding film experience.Best scene: DeNiro busts some yokels trying to cheat at the casino, and proves that a hammer and a kind word work better than just a kind word.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
When You're a Victim of Your Own Success,"'Casino' is a great movie, but it's almost impossible to watch it objectively if you've seen 'The Godfather', 'Goodfellas', or anything involving Martin Scorsese, or Robert DeNero since this is basically all of the same people running the next chapter of the mafia history movie franchise; and of all the mafia movies/tv shows, this one feels the most commercial.There are little things in this movie that lead me to believe studio execs were a heavier influence, as if someone said, ""The audience might not understand what they're saying in mob-speak, so can we add some English subtitles over people speaking English?"" I was more confused about why there were suddenly subtitles, like 'am I supposed to not understand them?', or 'did my tv start playing a different movie?'In that same vein I thought the voiceover narration was like playing the movie in video game Demo Mode- I have eyes, I can see they're counting money. That stuff didn't need narration. On the other hand, the narrator trope was so common in the 90's that it's more forgivable; but the cast and crew are legendary, so how did they let it happen?That's why it's difficult to judge this movie in isolation. If you've never seen a Scorsese mafia movie you'll be blown away, 9/10. Otherwise it's a relatively mid entry in the careers of giants, and a 7/10 is generous.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Casino,"You know, I think this might be my favourite Scorsese movie. He re-assembles his regular cast, adds a soupçon of Sharon Stone and proceeds to make three hours of cinema fly by. It all centres around the aspirational ""Sam Rothstein"" (Robert De Niro) who realises that there is a great deal of money to be made in Las Vegas in the 1970s. To that end, he is sent by his mafia bosses to run the ""Tangiers"" casino, hotel and general den of iniquity. Initially, though ruthless enough, he has a degree of decency to him, and when he falls in love with hustler ""Ginger"" (Sharon Stone) things seem to suggest that maybe he could be destined for the straight(-ish) and narrow. The same can not be said for his friend ""Santoro"" (Joe Pesci) who comes out to join him - ostensibly to make sure he stays safe - and is soon up to no good fleecing whatever and whoever to pay for his hedonistic lifestyle. It'd have been dull if all had gone to plan, and of course it doesn't - ""Rothstein"" has to deal with crooks, authorities (not that they are mutually exclusive), his increasingly rogue wife and his downright liability of a friend. Things come to an head when his wife and her former beau/pimp ""Diamond"" (James Woods) force his hand, the gaming commission wants his licence and ""Santoro"" - well, he is just toxic. Pesci only ever really has one style of acting, and this is perfect for that. He adds a distinctly plausible nastiness to his frankly rather odious character. Stone features a bit too sparingly perhaps, but she certainly steals the scenes she shares with a measured and confident De Niro very much at the top of his game. A nice little twist at the end works very well, too! It's stylishly photographed and has a great look to it - good stuff, this.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorcese repeats many ideas of GOODFELLAS... CASINO is a far cry!,"The only thing that kept me watching this movie was to learn what happened to the character played by de Niro, apparently blown up by a car bomb at the beginning.As in GOOODFELLAS, there is voice-over narration, this time by de Niro and Pesci (Ray Liotta was the narrator in the former film), but it is nowhere near as effective, and often provides unnecessary, even distracting asides, that only further lengthen a film that could easily have done with 30 minutes less.Curiously enough, GOODFELLAS also had de Niro and Pesci in the cast, led by a highly inspired Liotta, but the only performance in CASINO worthy of any mention is that of Sharon Stone, who portrays a truly repellent character (the incident where she binds up her daughter and confines her to a cupboard is a bolt from the blue and struck me as unconvincing, perhaps because nothing in her actions toward her child suggest anything so excessive). She is very convincing, however, in her descent into drugs and her relationship with her pimp, the ""real"" love in her life, as opposed to the source of wealth that de Niro represents to her.Pesci reprises his exceedingly violent character of GOODFELLAS and kills people as routinely as one would flies. This time, however, he is less credible because he is reportedly clever enough to take over the running of murky business from other ruthless criminals, but then commits excesses so stupid as to make suspension of disbelief impossible. His affair with Stone is also difficult to swallow. I could accept a blow job or one-off sex because she is too drugged up to reason it out, but surely he knows that de Niro will not tolerate it, and he is just too flippant about it. Ultimately, his character is just not rounded enough to stand, and so wayward as to become confusing, annoying, and ultimately lose the viewer's interest.The character played by de Niro is a very odd customer indeed, and the actor's talent is sadly wasted in a part much too ambiguous for me to enjoy. He wants to go clean but stupidly allows ultra-violent chum, Pesci, to join his casino and childishly believes Pesci's promises of good behavior and compliance with the ""legit"" nature of the casino operation. Even harder to swallow is that he should entrust the key to his fortune to Stone, even after he finds her cuddling her up to her pimp again. De Niro seems rather unsure about the role, too. I spent the whole movie waiting for the character to do something but ultimately he accepts everything like the Good Samaritan: he takes in dangerman Pesci, marries pimp Woods-infatuated Stone, has a distant relationship with his daughter that unexpectedly turns into something closer, loses half of his fortune without a whimper when he has seemed money-driven from the start, and is just too polite and quiet to convince me that I haven't wasted close on three hours watching purposeless characters going nowhere.Photography is competent, somewhat reminiscent of GOODFELLAS but less inspired.Direction is very disappointing, especially in light of the standards set by Scorcese in TAXI DRIVER and GOODFELLAS.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Goodfellas remake????,"Now I've seen a lot of films.  And I have seen a lot of gangster films. But Casino...what can I say.  I've heard people say that this was simply Scorcese's attempt to remake Goodfellas in a different part of America.  I would say that while the idea behind it is the same, this has a very different feel to it.  Goodfellas was pure gangster stuff.  It was Liotta's ""Hey, this is a cool life"" description of how everything happened.  Casino was more ""How we f***ed everything up"" from the view of the cool De Niro. Scorcese simply used a winning formula, his usual winning cast and his usual classy soundtrack technique to put together what is the most absorbing film I have ever seen.  It may be very complicated to understand how the 'skims' work and which boss is which, but that's unnecessary.  The harrowing scenes with Pesci remain in the mind and De Niro's ice cold reactions as Stone falls apart make this a brilliant film.  Watch it.  Watch it again.

Sweeping epic about a couple of households in Las Vegas,"A sweeping epic of nuanced history, resolutely focused on DeNiro, his wife Sharon Stone, and his childhood friend Pesci.

I found it amusing that DeNiro plays a casino boss with all-encompassing power, just like Tony Curtis' character in ""Forty Pounds of Trouble,"" a distinctly different movie in countless ways. Also amusing is Don Rickles' stone-faced portrayal of the casino manager--he hardly says a word, let alone a wisecrack.The film is extremely violent from the opening minutes. It is also rather long (nearly three hours), but the cinematography is so beautiful--and one is always flinching, preparing for the next gruesome confrontation--that the time moves quickly.

Interesting character study,"The obvious is obvious: gambling is not as great an evil as once thought, gangsters make for good entertainment, and Scorsese is a master of keeping a yarn from getting tangled.

The star of the film was De Niro's talent and sensitivity in portraying a man who is never sensitive himself. Rothstein is fascinating, and as a character should stand Hamlet's modern equivalent in complexity. This movie draws a lot on the noir classic ""Gilda,"" except without the indulgence of a good guy.

See Goodfellas first,"Casino is nowhere near as enthralling as Goodfellas.  It has many high points though.  For example the acting all around was flawless.  Bobby was brilliant as ACE, Sharon stone deserved that golden globe and Joe Pesci as Tommy...oops I'm sorry I mean Nicky...he was very scary.  I felt in Goodfellas the characters reached a point where they had it all and then they went down but in Casino they kinda had it all at the beginning then went completely downhill from there. I've always enjoyed Scorsese's use of violence.  Sudden and brutal.  But the ""Head in a Vice"" and the beating with bats left a bad taste.

Stone, Pesci and Deniro were all good enough to be nominated--too bad Sharon didn't win. Even James Woods was good as Sharon's old boyfriend.

The rise and fall of the Vegas I knew and loved,"If nothing else, this film answers the question of what happened to the Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s that most of us experienced and loved. Ace makes the correct statement that now Vegas is the another DisneyWorld where you can take the whole family to be entertained. I remember when it was a little more adult entertainment - a great floor show, 99 cent T-bone dinners, and reasonably priced rooms - all subsidized by gambling.But what about the movie itself?... While watching the movie, I was reminded of a Saturday Night Live skit called ""Low Class Italian Theater"" presumably based on the film Raging Bull. The skit satirized movies with Italian men using the f-- word and accusing each other of sleeping with each other's wives. While I think this is one of Martin Scorsese's best films with superb acting by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone, I can't help but feel it is a little flawed by the constant verbal assault which is not totally germane to the movie. In fact, I heard more anti-Semitic remarks in this one movie than in my entire life. Furthermore, while Sharon Stone's acting was nothing short of brilliant, I think the pace of the movie could have progressed faster and the movie shortened if they had cut out much of her neurotic screwed-up wife routine. I also feel there was an audio assault with the excessive soundtracks. The acting and story line really spoke for itself and did not need every song that was added for dramatic emphasis. Nevertheless, in spite of these alleged shortcomings, I loved the movie and felt I was actually looking at a newsreel from 1973; it seemed that realistic. As mentioned before, the acting was superb and I can't believe there were not more Oscars won here. The fact that it was based on a true story only adds to its aura of a great film.

"""For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.""","The main role in Scorsese's film ""Casino"" from 1995 is played (what a surprise) by Robert De Niro. Ace is a gambler with a murky past, who, with the help of mafia connections, becomes the commander-in-chief of a successful casino in Vegas. Except for regular payments to the bosses who brought him there, he tries to live and work as legally as possible.On the other hand, his childhood friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) follows him to Vegas and takes over the underground, unscrupulously removing everyone in his path, which jeopardizes Ace's reputation, as well as the business itself.This gradually leads to a split and even rivalry between the two friends, and things get even worse when Ace marries a well-known local 'gold digger', played by Sharon Stone.De Niro's character is capable, ambitious, calculated, maybe a bit cold, but within the framework of the mafia film, Ace is something closest to a good guy. Pesci's character and performance are the same as in many other films where he plays a mobster. Maybe similar roles don't make a great actor, but this type definitely suits him and he is among the best movie mobsters. Sharon has a doctorate in femme fatale, but the way Ginger is in the second half of the film makes her one of the most strikingly disgusting female characters I can remember. Towards the end, every scene with her made me sick.The technical aspects of the film are at a high level and the general atmosphere bears a strong stamp of Scorsese's style, but the overall impression it left on me is quite weak. I experienced it as just another in a sea of similar mafia stories, which I was not bored with, but which I could also stop at any moment and never wonder where it led.However, the dose of the author's subjective taste is something from which even the most objective and competent analyzes and reviews cannot completely distance themselves, let alone the amateur reviews of the ordinary viewer. As even the legendary ""The Godfather"" did not amaze me and, although it is very good, I do not rank it even close to the best films of all time, I must take into account that probably this whole film genre is 'not my cup of tea' and that it is questionable how much my subjective impressions weigh.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"As good as, but quite different from Goodfellas.","I watched Goodfellas yesterday. A great film, but not quite as good as I remembered. I'm wondering if time has confused it with Casino in my mind. Let's see. I'd certainly forgotten this was 3 hours long! Like Goodfellas, it's another true story adaptation and it also starts with a preview of something horrific happening in a car. There are a lot of similarities in fact. Another tryptic lead cast, Sam (or Ace) (Robert De Niro) is the Casino boss in question, Ginger (Sharon Stone) his wife and Nicky (Joe Pesci) the right hand man nasty bloke muscle. They are all destined to fail. The Casino is legit, but what's behind it is as corrupt as you'd expect for a Scorsese picture. Sam and Nicky's narration leads us through the exposition. Introducing themselves and their world. How it all works, skimming a little money off the top of the take to line their pockets and their mafia bosses. They control the Casino, they control Vegas and Sam is their man. Sam's meticulous... and a gambler, but most important, he reads people as well as cards. Keeping everyone including the politicians and the law on side, keeping the big machine humming. I love the way Scorsese sets this up. It's again a heady mix of characters, connections and camera. Always on the move, scenes are tightly crafted. It's 3 hours, but nothing ever overstays its welcome. Sam is flying high, smoking cigarettes in sharp suits. A lone wolf type, in control of the pack. Enter, Ginger. She's the wildcard. A hustler. The hustler. She's what makes Casino tick. She makes sense in Vegas. Sam makes sense in Vegas. They have control. Nicky, he does not make sense in Vegas. He's a loose canon. Perfect for a gripping story that although on the surface seems complicated, is actually very simple. Sam makes a gamble marrying Ginger. He knows it. He probably knows it's a bad call, but he makes it. He's unaware of the power that Lester (James Woods), Gingers low life pimp like ex has over her. This is one pillar of Casino, everything revolves on this call he makes to trust his new wife. That's only one side of it of course. Ginger finds herself now controlled, rather than controlling. That isn't going to end well. The other pillar is Nicky, his temper and his sideline stealing after he's blacklisted by the FBI from the casinos. It's not really a gangster film until Nicky puts someone's head in a vice. Sam's once simple world slowly unravels. That's what Scorsese does best isn't it. Hold your hand while the world spins out of control. It's a wild ride packed with colourful characters, but you never feel lost. Ginger drinking, Sam making enemies with the yokel locals, Nicky providing the splatter. It wraps its way around you, immersing you it its world. Scorsese's that is. It's not Sam and Nicky's world. They refer to Vegas, as ""out here"" and ""the dessert"", it's not home and maybe that's the biggest problem. My one criticism if there is one, is Stone's Ginger is almost forgotten in the second act as Sam and Nicky begin to feud. It feels like a more well rounded film with her in it. Even when she's back in the picture, she's reduced to a pawn by the male characters around her. Pecsi and De Niro do what they do. These are the characters they're born to play. Pretty much the only character Pesci plays, but Stone, she's magnificent. Her story arc is the most extreme and she's delivers it masterfully. As great as it is, the journey is more satisfying than the destination... but there's really no excuse for getting it mixed up with Goodfellas.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent,"Casino can be considered as one of the best entertaining movies ever made. Martin Scorcessee keeps you tied to the seat throughout the movie. Usually, I don't like Joe Pesci's work, but the role he played in this one can be considered as the performance of his life. No other actor has scared the sh*t out of me as Joe Pesci does here. In real life, I'd never like to come across someone like Nicky (Joe Pesci). Not to forget Sharon Stone. I am pretty sure that no other actress could have played Ginger.

Gory but good.,"Being a great fan of mob-movies, I have seen a lot of them. Casino ranks right up to the top-list along with Godfather and Goodfellas.Yes, the movie is long.. It lasts for about three hours, which might be a bit too long for a movie to last. How to keep one's interest up? Casino involves a lot of talking and only brief glimpses of action. Fortunately, the plot is interesting, yet easy to follow. This does not mean that the plot is stupid, though..And the action.. Well, don't come looking for any of that ""Bam, your dead"" -kinda action. Be set up for some really gory executions. This movie is not for the fainthearted..Sharon Stone was really surprisingly good, she was really annoying.. which is just what she should be. Every actor did his/her role accordingly, it is kind of hard to say anything about De Niro.. His character does not show that many feelings, but De Niro is still one of my favorite actors.Excellent movie, just takes some time to watch. If you are into mob-things, you will surely like this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Looking back,"I saw this movie 20 years after its initial release. Yes, I know, that is late. But it gave me the opportunity to look at it from a perspective where movie styles have changed. Did it stand the test of time? It is safe to say that this movie more or less concluded the typical mafia movie era, movies with overactive swearing gangster-types, Italian lingo, violence, extortion, addiction. I must say, watching this film gave me the feeling that I had seen it all before. This is a template movie, a template for the style, a template for the characters, a template for the violence, templates for practically everything. As a result everybody is behaving one-dimensional, behaving as expected, no character development. Joe Pesci is really a caricature of himself, Robert De Niro is flat. Sharon Stone's part is at times interesting to watch. All in all, this movie gets 6 out of 10 from me, mainly because the pace is okay.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Happy Birthday...BJ-19, Third Base.""","Did anyone think this could be anything but a great movie when you have Scorcese, Pesci and DeNiro in the same 3-hour film?  If so, they should be arrested.I recall hearing Scorcese describe this movie a year before it was released.  It made me want to buy tickets then.  I ended up seeing it 4 times in the theatres when it came out.  12 hours of amazement.Granted, I am a huge fan of all of the main actors and have a great interest in the Las Vegas scene, Mob films and the Mob's involvement in Vegas.  So, really, I could not lose.The photography was fantastic.  There are many, many scenes that I can watch over and over with the TV on mute and still be amazed.Scorcese is a master at capturing the body language and facial expressions that are so crucial for this type of movie.

A movie team to die for.,"What could go wrong with a Martin Scorsese picture, with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.  Casino demonstrates that with great awe.

One of Scorsese's few misses.,"Another painfully dull, formulaic, rise-and-fall story. It really adds nothing new or original to the genre and featured the most disgustingly overacted performance I've seen my entire life in the form of Sharon Stone. Also, any time a film relies 90% on narration just annoys me. If I wanted that much narration, I'd get a book. You should be able to convey your story through images and character dialogue, not a constant narration with little clips of what they're talking about scattered throughout. I give it some credit for completely kicking it up six notches in the final third of the film, though. It became so much more engaging and entertaining, and Pesci and De Niro both fine tuned their performances. James Woods was also very fun to watch, but was criminally underused.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Underrated Scorsese Mafia Flick,"Casino tells the life of a Mafia Operator in Las Vegas and how his life will be turned around when a new guy in town decides to get his hand on the loot himself AND a showgirl who had him like a fiddle spirals out of control.Shockingly, One of the more subdued film of Scorsese. Casino really relishes on development and take a less exuberant flash that hounds his more famous films of the same genre. This is practically a solid historical fiction (it was in the end, fictionalized version of a real crime) that takes a shockingly nostalgic approach to present the Vegas of the past without the much colorful characters of Goodfellas.Here, the character are distractingly desperate and bottom of the barrel. Everyone here is settling for what is the best they could. This make the arc much darker by nature and much more affecting. I always found the flamboyance in both Goodfellas and Wolf Street, distracting to a point. Here, they are trying to survive each other AND that is Vegas baby. The views takes the distraction.Performance wise, Pesci, De Niro and Stone was 5/5. They really went the ups and down. Stone specifically shows a new level of vulnerability and emotion in her work here. Its insane the range she showed in this film. Pesci is pretty much his Goodfellas character. Annoying little guy who is mighty intimidating. De Niro, again, is just pitch perfect. A less is more performance.

Sharon Stone also plays a great part but makes herself very unlikeable (at least that's what i found).Overall, it was a very enjoyable film with strong storyline, great acting, perfect directing and also made in the year I was born.

A gangster movie for the ages,"""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"", ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas""... Which is the better film?  This may never be decided.  Both chronicle the lives of gangsters throughout their years, both good and bad, leading up to their eventual demises.  ""Casino"" is an unforgettable tale of people caught up in the Las Vegas lifestyle.  The overindulgence and excess of the town is explicitly portrayed in this movie.  DeNiro plays a well-meaning odds-maker who is placed in charge of a casino, while Pesci acts in a perfect role as DeNiro's protective but jealous keeper.  Sharon Stone turns in the role of a lifetime as the mentally-instable, paranoid, and jealous (ex-hooker) wife of Stone (DeNiro's character).  The movie comes to a head in a frenetic battle between DeNiro and Stone, and the results are delicious.  This movie, along with ""The Godfather"" and ""Casino"" must surely rank as the top three gangster movies of all time.  Which one is first depends on one's own tastes.

Martin Scorsese really is the master of gangster movies, no doubt about it, yet the novelist Nicholas Pileggi deserves kudos too.  People say this movie tries to hard to be like Goodfellas and I think thats a terrible description.  The reason for this I think is that Joe Pesci's Nicky is too much the same character as his Tommy in Goodfellas.  If they had of put someone else in that role, possibly Benicio DelToro or an Edward Norton with an Italian makeover, then Casino would have gotten more individual praise.  To me, this film is on equal par with Goodfellas.  Well done again Scorsese & Pileggi.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Should be in the top 100.  Scorsese does it yet again.,"I must say I am a lover of gangsta films and casino is one of my favourites just behind goodfellas. In my opinion better than The Godfather. Casino is a mob story about a multi billion dollar casino operation that Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) owns. He is joined in Vegas by a mad mob boss; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) to make sure no one messed with Ace. Both De Niro and Pesci give fine performances. Joe Pesci as usual plays the mad man absolutely brilliantly. Even though these two were on top form, Sharon Stone gives a unforgettable performance. Stone was robbed of an Oscar and this film also deserved an Oscar. If someone can tell me a better film in 1995 I'd like to know what it is because it would take something special to over shine this masterpiece.This film, even though so brilliant and watchable was rated 18 for a good reason. There is about 400 f-words mostly used by Joe pesci and the c-word is used once by Robert De Niro. Also this film has some of the most disturbing violence I have ever seen. In one scene the mad Joe Pesci puts a guys head in a vice and squeezes it until the mans eye pops out. Thats just to name one violent scene, believe me there are many more.Besides that the film is amazing . The acting is brilliant and the film is highly recommended to any gangsta movie fan, or even if you don't like gangsta movies you will enjoy it.

In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has ""hired"" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her.

I'm not protecting you anymore!"", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours.

"Excellent Scorsese movie, so good","Released in 1995, Casino is a Martin Scorsese film about a team of mobsters (loosely based on real people) who attempt to run a highly corrupt casino in 1970's Last Vegas. Everything seems to be on the right track, they even have a prominent politician in their pocket, until some key personal relationships in the mix start crumbling.Robert De Niro is Sam Rothstein, who runs the Tangiers casino in Vegas for the Chicago mob and he does so as professionally as one could under the circumstances, even going as far as to micro-manage matters on the casino floor. When an old colleague, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) arrives in town with the hope of making a name for himself in the city, Sam becomes nervous since Nicky's way of operating is known to make a lot of noise.Indeed, the bodies quickly start piling up and the FBI starts paying closer and closer attention to the Tangiers and the people running it. Sam's messy marriage to hustler Ginger (Sharon Stone) also makes waves due to her ongoing relationship with con-artist, pimp and ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Between Nicky's over-the-top violent ways and Ginger's clashes with Sam, the latter finds it increasingly difficult to manage his operation quietly and this prompts the mob bosses to make some big changes in the business.We're in very familiar territory with Casino. The film instantly feels like a companion piece to Goodfellas in many ways and it's easy to see why critics weren't quite as excited about Casino seeing as Goodfellas was released only a few years prior and made a huge impact. In terms of their presentation, both films rely on very fast-paced storytelling, mostly driven by voice-over, with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci playing similar kinds of roles (Sam is more level-headed while Nicky is a loose canon). It is a shame that Goodfellas would always overshadow Casino because the latter is very close to being just as good in every way.One of the big things that differentiates Casino from Goodfellas is the even sleazier vibe established by the Vegas setting: James Woods is a natural at playing the slimeball pimp and Robert De Niro's colorful suits are a tacky delight. Sharon Stone's Ginger is the film's most valuable wild card as, through her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, her obsession with money and constant hysterical outbursts she is always one step away from total self-implosion. It's a great performance and it earned Sharon Stone an Academy Award but one would argue that Joe Pesci would have deserved one too as he is especially diabolical as Nicky.There's really not much wrong with Casino: it's another effortless masterpiece from Martin Scorsese. It just feels too much like Goodfellas for its own good. The performances are all top notch, the film looks fantastic and the writing is as sharp as ever. There are just not many surprises here, and that hurts what is otherwise a must-see quite a bit.Good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
All Bets Are In.,"'Casino' is probably the last of the real epic mob dramas. Martin Scorsese's stylish tale of power, greed, and deception is based on real-life organized crime associate, Lefty Rosenthal. The screenplay is penned by Scorsese and his collaborator from 'Goodfellas', Nicholas Pileggi. The movie is three hours long, and it might feel like it drags on places, but the writing is perfect. And what fantastic performances by the actors. The main cast (Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Don Rickles, and Sharon Stone in one of her best roles) is supported by magnificent mob movie heavyweights like Vinny Vella and Frank Vincent. Nearly half of the movie is told through narrations that are quite descriptive, so it almost feels like you are watching (listening) visual audiobook. But the narrations are spot on and contains some of the best lines from the movie. Especially the ones from Joe Pesci whose narration is so smooth and calm compared to his hot-tempered character Nicky Santoro.A pure, classic mob movie in the best Martin Scorsese style.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A great, great movie","Casino is one of my all time favorite movies. The narration is great, the music is wonderful, everything is just great. The movie always gets back to the point. Goodfellas showed us that real gangsters weren't about ""whacking"" everyone; it's about making money. Casino shows us the same thing, all the lights, all the comps, it's all been arranged just for us to get YOUR money. Even much later in the movie Nicky remarks, ""The f*%ckn' bottom line here is, cash"". The music in the movie is so fantastically placed that the movie begins to resemble a musical in some points.A few things I have always wondered: 1) Why oh why isn't this movie on the top 250 list??? 2) Why are the names changed form the book?In goodfellas, the names are the same. Henry Hill is Henry Hill. In Casino (the book) Sam ""Ace"" is actually Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal (If I remember correctly).This is such a great movie. The pace is so fast and the dialogue and narration are so tight that all 3 hours just roll by without notice.Probably my favorite thing about this movie is that it has major replay value. It isn't a rental. I can watch this movie a few times a month or even in a week. Some movies get stale after one or a few viewings. I feel that all of M Knight's (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) movies fall into that category. They're great movies, but you just can't watch them over and over.

"Overall, thoroughly underwhelmed. I feel Casino didn't age well.","Scorcese is known to make long movies, and this one felt painfully drawn out. This is yet another Scorcese mafia movie bringing nothing new, and felt stale. Pesci doing his ultra violent midget thing. Deniro doing his business like lead guy. Old fat Italian guys playing mafia bosses being cardboard cutouts. Random executions with 2 dollars worth of special effects.The narration should have been unnecessary in a 3h movie given how thin the plot really is.In multiple wide shots, there's a halo highlighting the protagonist, as if we're not smart enough to follow the plot.Fun fact, Sharon Stone has pretty terrible side teeth.The casino part of the movie was great, with Deniro being a stellar overseer, taking immense pride in his work. But the movie is about the decay of the relationship between Deniro & Stone. Unfortunately, I don't think Deniro is the right actor to play the husband in this story. I could not understand why he fell for her, or loved her that much for that long. He only narrates that he loves her. Stone, on the other hand, shines in the role of the increasingly crazy wife.A key plot element is her co-dependent relationship with her pimp, but i could not understand it; we're just told, not shown why, that she can't shake him off.Essentially, my guess is that Scorcese isn't the right writer / director to explore & portray intricate human relationships and emotions, as what he does best is filming Pesci yelling & stabbing people in the neck.Overall, very little happens over 3h, and we learn even less.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

This Movie Is a Cut Above Good Fellas,"This movie is really the only other Scorsese movie where fans can directly compare this film to Goodfellas. I must say that this film is superior to Goodfellas in many ways. Goodfellas is too campy (the beginning scene when Henry Hill says, ""As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster"" and then the camera zooms in and Rags to Riches comes on immediately). I also know that GF had issues (with folks that actually knew the real Henry Hill) with how many of the characters were inaccurately portrayed especially Henry Hill and how Scorsese made this character way more charismatic and sophisticated than he truly was. Many other aspects of that film were too over the top.Okay onto writing about Casino. This film is truly a dark cinematic master piece. The tone and overall delivery of this film is more polished and was given a lot of thought. Here Scorsese uses a robust original score and contemporary songs to truly complement the film in scenes that were energetic and or dramatic. Scorsese's ability to show his viewers that while the mob operated best in secrecy and in the streets of cities, they ironically could not function in a town such as Las Vegas where a lot of mob activity was legal and their activities were basically shown in the light and in the public eye; there was no hiding here.When you have a strong cast of De Niro, Pesci, and Sharon Stone you know they are going to deliver and that the supporting cast around them will elevate their performance and be inspired to work hard with season actors that I have mentioned. While most will knock the movie for its length, I truly believe that the length of the film was justified due to excellent screen writing and overall presentation of what mob life was like in the 80's era of Las Vegas. This movie truly deserves the watch if you've never seen it and it definitely deserves a top 3 ranking of films that Scorsese has ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Much To Appreciate, But Ultimately Not In Scorsese's Top Tier","I don't know why it took me quote so long to get around to watching this, but in the end it was pretty much as I anticipated it might be. All of Scorsese's trademark brilliance is on display, but too much of it feels like a return to the well of gangster crime dramas once too often (even if for me The Irishman is a better film). The arc of Sharon Stone's character feels a little queasy and too much like a version of a hysterical woman trope. There is too much narration, and at times the collection of needle drops on the soundtrack gets in the way. Though it's undoubtedly kinetic and gripping, it never feels surprising, and it doesn't quite achieve the greater depth of his major films. It's not a bad film, of course; but we do know that given the heights that Scorsese can and has hot so often, it just feels like a little bit of a let-down, despite all that there is to appreciate and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

But the movie, although quite similar to GoodFellas in many respects, stands on it's own. A most fast-paced 3 hour movie containing no unnecessary tedious scenes to slow it down, never failing at any opportunity to fascinate and entertain the viewer.Enter Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a brilliant sports handicapper who takes his talents to Vegas. Ace's uncommon expertise and success with making the world of gambling pay off naturally attracts the wrong type of people in the likes of old hometown buddy now heavily connected with the Mob Nicky (Joe Pesci), and the romantic object of his affection Ginger (Sharon Stone). Sam unfortunately takes a gamble on these two and the results don't pay off as well as he would have liked. Neither Ace or Nicky are a match for Ginger, who gets in between them and ultimately plays them both for a couple of tricks.One of the film's remarkable achievements is how expertly the story is told, and Scorsese's ability to cram so many rich details into such a short amount of screen time frequently throughout. An example of this is where DeNiro's character catches on to a couple of card players using a sophisticated cheating technique so they can communicate with one another morse code style to inform each other of their opponents' playing cards which they can see from opposing tables. The way Scorsese can illustrate such rich details during a brief montage showing how the players are able to incorporate this scam to the beat of the Jeff Beck Group's ""I Ain't Superstitious"" is like watching a master teaching a free class to show how it's done for other director-wannabes.Casino also of course features fine performances from the cast - many of whom also actually happened to appear in GoodFellas. Watch for a clever nod to Frank Vincent's ""Billy Batts"" role in GoodFellas towards the film's conclusion.A masterpiece in direction, film editing, and storytelling, Casino contains scenes which may be considered by some as excessively violent, and must also hold some sort of record for the amount of ""F"" words ever said in a film. Literally every line of dialog contains the word or variations on it. The easily offended may want to steer clear.Certainly one of the great films in the Scorsese canon which makes for a fine companion piece for his groundbreaking classic GoodFellas. I hope Scorsese makes one final mobster film with DeNiro and Pesci. Casino proves that, as far these three are concerned, you can't get much better of a combination as far as movies go. Should my wish come true, hopefully Mr. Scorsese can find another classic rock song to put on the soundtrack to fit the mood of the story besides ""Gimme Shelter"" - also featured prominently in GoodFellas and The Departed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

No One Stays at the Top Forever,"It's not an easy task making my list of ten best films ever. In fact, the list is rarely altered. Martin Scorsese now holds three of those spots. His 1995 film, ""Casino,"" is cinematic poetry and heart-wrenching tragedy rolled up into one. It is one of the best films ever made.Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is a professional gambler, and one of the best of his time. The setting is 1973. Rothstein is connected with the Mafia, who wish to open a casino in Las Vegas. They realize Rothstein knows the business and they put him in charge. His boyhood friend, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) wants to give Vegas a try, and Rothstein has no objections. Eventually, the De Niro character falls in love with Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who may or may not have the same feelings towards him. As time passes, Nicky starts taking over the town of Las Vegas through murder and extortion. He is labeled the local mob boss, and this begins to cause trouble for Rothstein. The public exposes him and the casino of being mob-lead, and this movie is about how something so glamorous, can be turned so ugly, simply by the actions one decides to partake in.I don't think there's any question; Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors who ever lived. He manages to piece together perfection each time he makes a film. They are entertaining and magical, but remain harrowing and relevant. All film students should watch his technique carefully. No one, however, could impersonate his genius.The acting here is beyond great. Robert De Niro is absolutely fantastic as Ace Rothstein. He is one of the best actors who ever breathed, and he gives another example as to why. Sharon Stone does a wonderful job as the emotionally disrupt and confused wife of Rothstein. Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro is superb. He is nothing short of brilliant in Scorsese pictures, and here, his streak continues. Great supporting performances from James Woods, Frank Vincent, and Kevin Pollak.One of the greatest things about this movie is the story. It all started brilliantly, and then it all turned around, simply because these people choose to live their life as they do. They're in it for the money, but what's the point of money when you lose everything because of the life you chose? The story is all the more fascinating knowing it's based on fact.The screenplay by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese is without flaw, and the dialogue is stunning.When you wrap everything together; the directing, the screenplay, the acting, and editing, you are reminded on the film's tag-line: ""No One Stays at the Top Forevor."" That may be, but this film might be at the top forever. Magnificent.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Class act in the art of film making,"Casino, is one of the slickest & best put together films I have ever seen. The direction is confident, fast paced & the photography outstanding.Despite almost a three hour length, the film does not waste any time or words, and grip from the beginning.  I have no personal knowledge of Vegas at the time this film depicts it, but could fully believe it to be as shown.De Niro is on top form, and Joe Pesci turns in another menacing & completely believable performance.

My All Time Favorite Movie.,"I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's one of those rare films where you can watch it a dozen times, and it's just as thrilling as it was the first time around.Considering it preceded Martin's successful GoodFellas: a film regarded as a classic gangster film (and rightfully so), the format has a bit of the same style going, with a narrative to guide us through the story, and featuring powerhouse duo of Pesci & DiNero, but with this film, so as a result it gets overshadowed, but to me, it qualifies as a film on its own, MY favorite film mind you.There's a certain feel that this movie carries and it's nothing short of perfect. 3 hours in length and not a single minute wasted, it's a masterpiece. Compared to GoodFellas, it's just felt more solid, more nuanced, detailed, technical shots better executed, sound, light, every actor giving 100 % to make you feel immersed in the story.The violence is there too, and naturally it's a ruthless world, but instead the violence has more of a conscience. GoodFellas was hit after hit, sometimes leaving you feeling like you're watching a slasher, so it becomes ineffective. Throughout Casino, the violence is less common, but VERY real, sometimes comically shocking like Friedkin's Killer Joe, to bleak like what you see in American History X.Sharon Stone who plays Ginger plays the alpha HBIC perfectly, and as we learn later on, downplays what chaos she is capable of.DeNior, who plays Ace, is strictly business but he has a heart of gold. He's the narrator and the mediator, and more the more screen time he gets, the more you really like the guy. Comedia Kingpin Don Rickles is even in this movie! Just perfect!

Scorsese on Scorsese,"""Casino"" explodes onto the screen like Martin Scorsese doing an overblown riff of a Martin Scorsese film. All of his hallmarks are here in spades as he weaves his epic and vividly detailed saga of organized crime in Las Vegas. Much of the style here is over-the-top, and when you combine that with three brand-name movie stars (DeNiro almost hilariously subdued here, Sharon Stone at the pinnacle of her appeal and showing an amazing range here as DeNiro's gold digging drug addicted wife, and an insane Joe Pesci doing a gonzo take on an insane Joe Pesci) acting to within inches of their lives, you get a wildly entertaining albeit over long three hour ride. Toss in some scenery chewing from Don Rickles, James Woods, and that hilarious Italian grandmother (Scorsese's real life mother) in the butcher shop, and you can't lose. However, when the central conceit of the movie is to explore the criminal underbelly of a city that legally peddles crime and sleaze as entertainment, ""Casino"" ultimately seems a bit redundant.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brutally Profane,"Can you say the ""f-word??""They can here - 353 times, according to Entertainment Weekly. This movie, as few others, will assault your senses and make you numb by the time it's over.Constant bickering, yelling, and Sharon Stone's out-of-control character the last hour will have you uttering a few expletives yourself after this Martin Scorcese sleaze-fest mercifully ends.As bad a character as Stone plays, the all-time champion profaner is - no surprise - the one played by Joe Pecsi, who must use the f-word every other sentence. Robert De Niro comes across as a choir boy compared to these other two jokers.The sad thing is, this could have been a decent movie, if Scorcese wasn't just so preoccupied with being so verbally degenerate (see ""Goodfellas,"" ""Raging Bull,"" etc). If the film had been cut down 45 minutes from 3 hours (too much of it dwells on the marital problems involving Stone) and cut back on the profanity, you might have had an interesting crime story with some very colorful cinematography and good narration. However, Scorcese can't seem to make a crime film without all the excess.""Brutal"" might be a good word to describe this movie. It's too much for anyone above trailer trash morals to endure.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
"DeNiro, Scorsese, Pesci and Stone. How Can You Go Wrong ?","The name DeNiro alone automatically guarantees the movie to be a classic, add the name Scorsese and well, you have instant gold on screen.The most recent teaming of the masters of film has produced a very entertaining and thought provoking story of life in Las Vegas when it was at the mercy of the mob.DeNiro turns in a flawless performance as Sam Rothstein, a professional gambler who was like a cash register, he was put in charge of a large CASINO bye the mob. His performance as a perfectionist gambler who tries to run a casino and make an honest woman of his wife (played perfectly by Sharon Stone), was worthy of an Oscar (As has every other performance he has done).Pesci once again joins his Italian friends DeNiro and Scorsese to turn in a performance as a psychotic maniac who has an obsession with inflicting pain. The genius of Pesci is that he can play a clumsy funny annoying character, such as Leo Getz (Lethal Weapon 2 3 and 4) and then flip the script and play a truly scary maniac such as Nicki in Casino.The next time DeNiro and Scorsese work together will once again undoubtably be another movie great.Truly a great movie, not to be mistaken as another Goodfellas, but to have it's own place upon the mountain of movie masterpieces.",,Anonymous,Crime
"No Gamble Needed, Casino Wins the Bet of Favorite Scorsese Picture","Every scene, a thrill. Every shot, a beauty. Every line, a breath-taker. Scorsese's films are masterpieces and Casino is too. I've called Casino a masterpiece since I was seven hard to believe because I saw about half of it when I was younger and loved the look and feel of it all. Now seeing the whole thing again seven years later I love it and call it my favorite Scorsese film. A lot of people choose Goodfellas over this, but Im the opposite, I think Goodfellas was a great mobster movie and a real life look at the 50s Mafia, but I just love Casino for everything it is.The three main actors De Niro, Pesci, and Stone have all outdone themselves here. This is the best work for all three of them individually. They play their roles with power and serve a unique purpose. Without De Niro, the narrations wouldn't have the same effect and be less powerful. Without Pesci, there would be no Italian to swear as good as him. He swears with meaning and makes you fear him when he steps on screen. His cutthroat, no BS attitude is what stands out on screen. Just like the quote said by Robert Di Nero.Having heard that I repeated it to myself numerous times to get the full effect. It was one of the most powerful quotes in movie history to me. Last, but far from least, is Sharron Stone's portrayal of Ginger McKenna Rothstein. She takes the role in full effect by strutting her gorgeous self in front of the camera with every shot of her being a slick one. Her attitude the whole movie really sticks with you and the fights her and De Niro have are very shocking, yet powerful at the same time. Its a feeling, I've only got from this film.The plot is true and is about Sam ""Aces"" Rothstein (De Niro) working as a bookie at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. He takes his job beyond seriously and is usually caught in the minx of everything. His goal is to double Casino profits which is then skimmed by the Mafia which is then reported to the tax agencies. Whatever he bets on, he wins, thats that. He has never made a bet he wasn't sure he was going to win. Hes a smart guy and has never done a bet wrong. He is constantly bothered and put at risk when his buddy Nicky Santoro (Pesci, character based on the real life Anthony Spilotro) is sent to Vegas to assist Same, but winds up antagonizing all the casino members and his brash language and overall personality gets his name in a Black Book which lead to him banned from every casino in Vegas.Sam falls for the hooker and hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone) who he winds up having a child with and marrying. He gives Ginger his trust and puts her jewelry, and $2,000,000 cash money in a bank in which she can only access. Sam regrets it deeply when Ginger is still sneaking around with her ex con boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Their marriage soon crumbles, leading her to a strict and pervasive drug addiction with only Nicky to to.I don't want to go in full detail because the movie does have various surprises including the end, which I saw when I was seven and has traumatized me since. Seeing it again didn't have the same effect, but still scared me for life. This time, I cant say it's just a movie. This honestly happened. The events in this movie really happened and thanks to Scorsese is taken in a serious approach with characters that are in depth and to the point. Nobody but Scorsese could have done this movie. It is a true beauty and shouldn't be taken for granted.I play poker with my friend Mike using fake chips and having no real money involved. It something we do to pass the time. After seeing this movie it almost makes me not want to touch a card or chip again. Sure just playing slots, poker, Blackjack, Roulette, or any poker game wont put you in the position of Nicky, but it makes you think how much hot water these guys really sunk in. This is a job that depends on life or death and is not something I'd ever think to do. Money is one thing, risk is another.The movie is often shown on networks like Bravo and much of it has to be cut out because the f word is said exactly 422 times in three hours. Also because of the drugs and violence about thirty minutes is trimmed out too. My opinion is if this isn't shown in the raw, it shouldn't be shown at all. Profanity is common in this movie, but it shows you how strict Italians got. Various racial terms toward Muslims and Jewish people were brought up. Without the feeling or tense and frustration inside these people the movie is bland. It needs to have profanity to be true to the story of mobsters and gamblers. As well as the violence. Its jam packed with violence, but it needs to be there to show the full aspect. Without it, its tame and false.Casino is a genuine film that maybe overshadowed by Goodfellas and Raging Bull, but to me it's a one of a kind, gambling masterpiece with a four star cast, a four star plot, and a four star feeling after watching it. It has the rare effect of after watching it you feel like you lived it. A true masterpiece in the film industry and Scorsese's best film.Starring: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharron Stone, James Woods,, Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, and Alan King.

One of the best gangster films out there,"I haven't rewatched this one in a long time. This is a great mobster movie, up there with Goodfellas and GodFather. The acting is great, although I found Joe Pesci as a lady's man a little hard to believe and doubt he would have been cast in todays Hollywood (you know if he was still young that is, but he was on fire in the 90's). I am not a fan of Sharon Stone but she is excellent in this movie as well.For a movie that is just under 3hrs it moves pretty fast, has lots of action gets pretty tense near the end and there are some brutally violent scenes. It also takes place in the 70's and 80's so everything looks dated and it's supposed to so this movie ages really well.I am adding this to my list of movies I will or would recommend to rewatch over the years.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

But with that said, the story (which is almost 3 darn hours long) moves in such a brilliant pace that you can put up with them. As expected, the acting by Pesci, De Niro, Stone, & Woods is great, but unbelievably every minor character in the film is also on the ball. But, alas, this is a Scorcese film, and as usual it is done to perfection. The camera angles and the cinematography of old Vegas is awesome.

"Committed to details, incessantly told story and superb acting","I find it strange how few people mentioned love and marriage when writing about this movie. I think mixing these two with criminals running the business is a combination which makes Casino what it is - a movie with unbelievably smoothly told story which covers many aspects of running the business but personal life as well. That is important since it's not sheer incompetence which brought this guys down; it's lust and dishonest in their personal sphere, especially Sam's unhappy marriage. That's why this is the very first line in the movie: ""When you love someone, you've gotta trust them."" That, and other few lines, immediately set the tone and give us the key for proper understanding of the movie.On to the acting. De Niro performing Ace has now become my favorite performance. He's totally convincing in distancing himself from mob guys and positioning as someone how knows the ""know-how"". He isn't a street gangster but a handicapper given a casino to run. That's also important because Casino is, in contrast to Goodfellas, a movie about guys higher in mafia hierarchy. It's sad to see De Niro now starring in movies ""Dirty Grandpa"" alike. Joe Pesci in funny and intimidating, almost psychotic. Sharon Stone really did deliver once in a lifetime execution. Accompanied with other great cast members, Casino feels and runs like a quasi-documentary; it's convincing and realistic.To make it short, Scorsese managed to re-tell a multiply layered story based on actual events and give a good insight on how Las Vegas works. I'd recommend you to check out real characters and actual events after you see the movie to broaden your scope and realize with what commitment to details was Casino made.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sharon Stone won a Golden Globe but really did not get the attention she *or* the character deserved. we see more DeNiro's legs than hers.another issue is that the two leads are somewhat schizophrenic to the point we wonder if there was not enough story conferences before the shoot. in CASINO, Henry Hill is the shall we say reluctant accessory to murder, a guy with a good heart. DeNiro here is a Jewish guy, schooled in 1950s hoodlumism, but his ""Jewishness"" is confined unfortunately to the stereotype who lets others fight for him and is actually worried that his best fiend Pesci won't stop filandering with his wife. ""what if he doesn't stop?"" he whispers to Stone, in a very bizarre scene.Stone's character is also a mite mixed-up: she can work the system down to carpet fibers in the lounge, is a lying thief like all her friends and clients, but is initially shy on the idea of marrying a multi millionaire who can secure her future 500 times over? think I'll toss my VHS in, one more time, you know, just to review.........................",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Gritty and Engrossing Tale of Power and Corruption,"""Casino,"" directed by Martin Scorsese, is a masterful exploration of the rise and fall of a gambling empire in the neon-lit world of Las Vegas. The film, based on true events, delves deep into the glamour and corruption of the casino industry in the 1970s and 80s, offering a riveting and detailed portrayal of its inner workings.Robert De Niro delivers a stellar performance as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a gambling expert tasked with running the Tangiers Casino. De Niro brings a controlled intensity to the role, portraying Rothstein as a man of intelligence and precision, yet unable to escape the pitfalls of power and greed. His nuanced performance anchors the film, bringing depth to his character's journey.Joe Pesci is equally impressive as Nicky Santoro, Rothstein's childhood friend and a violent enforcer. Pesci's portrayal is both terrifying and captivating, embodying the volatile and unpredictable nature of the criminal underworld. The dynamic between De Niro and Pesci is electric, showcasing their characters' complex relationship fraught with loyalty, tension, and eventual betrayal.Sharon Stone gives a career-defining performance as Ginger McKenna, Rothstein's wife. Stone's Ginger is glamorous, manipulative, and tragically flawed, adding an emotional layer to the narrative. Her portrayal earned her an Academy Award nomination, and rightfully so; she brings a raw and powerful energy to every scene she's in.Scorsese's direction is impeccable, creating a visually stunning and stylistically bold film. His use of long tracking shots, meticulous set design, and a vibrant soundtrack captures the essence of Las Vegas during this era. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold in a way that is both detailed and absorbing.The screenplay, co-written by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi, is sharp and engaging. The dialogue crackles with authenticity, and the narrative structure, which uses multiple narrators, provides various perspectives on the story, adding to its complexity.""Casino"" is not without its flaws. The film's lengthy runtime and the sheer amount of detail can be overwhelming at times, and some subplots feel less developed compared to the central narrative. However, these are minor issues in an otherwise compelling film.The film's exploration of themes such as power, greed, loyalty, and the corrupting nature of the American dream is both insightful and thought-provoking. ""Casino"" offers a gritty, unglamorized look at the casino industry, contrasting its glittering surface with the dark underbelly of organized crime.In conclusion, ""Casino"" is a gripping and masterfully crafted film that offers an in-depth look at the complexities of the casino world. With its strong performances, expert direction, and engaging narrative, it earns a solid 8 out of 10. It's a testament to Scorsese's skill as a filmmaker and remains a standout entry in the genre of crime and gangster films.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overlooked Scorsese Crime Drama,"Martin Scorsese certainly has shown an interest in crime stories. He explores the gritty details of the worlds and the players involved in the games. This particular story focuses on a particular gaming world-the one found in the gambling mecca of the United States, Vegas.Appropriately, the movie is called 'Casino.' Throughout its three-hour runtime, it unpacks a great deal. The first 45 minutes or so lay the foundation. We're exposed to thorough details of how the gaming world in Vegas operates and what it takes to succeed in the business. It's fascinating. For a while.My philosophy is if a movie is three hours long, it better have great reasons for being three hours long. This one felt like it could have been trimmed in a few places, but that didn't happen. Scorsese likes to make long films, so we're left with this monstrously long creation.He takes his time, cuing up one Rolling Stones song after another, letting events play out at a leisurely pace. It's all interesting and well-crafted (because its Scorsese), but it takes nearly two full hours before the pivotal conflict arises. Before then, the characters' lives are bit too peachy, too easy.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci play childhood friends who take different business avenues in life, each finding success and power that they find appealing. De Niro wants to play it straight and run a legitimate casino, and he should-he's great at it. Pesci seeks the illegal angle, becoming one of the most infamous mobsters in the world of Vegas.As I said, their lives run smoothly (for the most part) for too much of the story. Everything goes downhill when Pesci steps on one of the wrong gangster's toes, De Niro deals with legal issues over a gambling license, and the biggest doozy of all-De Niro's wife loses her mind.In a force of nature performance from Sharon Stone, De Niro's screen wife Ginger becomes the most compelling and despicable character over the film's final hour-this is when Stone really starts to go for it. No spoilers here, so I'll just say that her reputation as one of the worst movie wives of all time is well-deserved.As circumstances spiral out of control, Scorsese blasts a couple more Rolling Stones songs and opens up his bag of mesmerizing camera tricks. His catalog of film techniques can fill an entire book shelf on its own. His application choices don't always appear to make sense, but they certainly catch the eye, which may be the primary intention.I'm a big fan of Marty's work, so I'll see anything he has made. While this isn't his best, it's still an entertaining and worthwhile film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Criminally Under-acknowledged! Definitely one of Scorsese's best.,"""Casino"" is not even on the top 250. It's a pity, what with so many lame movies getting much higher ratings.Wonderfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this epic tale (based on real life incidents) unfolds with the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) a mob-backed guy who is brought in to Las Vegas to operate the Tangiers Casino, owing to his expertise in the same. His boyhood pal, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) also moves to Vegas with criminal plans of his own. Sam does his job really well, exposing cheats, disposing of the weaker employees, making sure he isn't robbed of money, and ends up making big bucks for his mob bosses ""back home"". However, things change when Sam falls for Ginger (Sharon Stone), a hustler. She already has a no-good boyfriend Lester (James Woods, in a small albeit important role). Inspite of his knowledge about her manipulative nature, he marries her. She is an alcoholic, and all she ever wants is money and security. Meanwhile, Nicky continues his criminal activities.""Casino"" is, without doubt one of the best films by Scorsese. The film runs for almost three hours and events take their time to unravel, and rightly so.The performances: Robert De Niro is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and that's a universal fact! In this movie, he delivers a performance that qualifies as one his best after 'Raging Bull'. He appears super-cool as the Casino operator and you cannot help but sympathize with him in some later parts of the movie when he is having a bad time because of various reasons. Trust him to play an all-in-one character: a mob-connected Casino guy, a friend and a loving father all at the same time! His powerful performance in this movie has to be seen to be believed. It is nothing short of mind-blowing!Joe Pesci..what can one say about this guy! Delivering sharp dialogs and firing those F-words with a one-of-a-kind punch is something only he can do! He plays a wicked, wicked character who also cares for his boy-hood friend, Sam. Another brilliant performance after GoodFellas, he is the finest choice for his role.Sharon Stone: Superb!! I never thought I would feel that about her performance, but indeed, she gets a hell of a chance to act here..and she does it exceedingly well! The drunk hustler who cannot find happiness is played to perfection by Sharon...I guess it is also kudos to the director for bringing out the actor in her.Then there are some wonderful, but small supporting performances by James Woods as Lester Diamond, Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Alan King as Andy Stone and Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects) as Phillip Green. Special mention here, of Pasquale Cajano, who is superb as the mob boss, Remo Gaggi.The soundtrack is very much like that in GoodFellas. And much in the same manner, there is some playful rock'n'roll music playing in the background during any violent scene of crime!The dialog is brilliant. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing. The wonderful screenplay for the film is co-written by Nicolas Pileggi who is also the author of the book.As mentioned before, the film runs for about 3 hours but there is not a single moment when you'd want to take your eyes off the screen.An under-rated classic, this one deserves a rightful place up there along with Scorsese's other acclaimed classics.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The eye in the sky watches them all,"Casino, is an ambitious project from Scorsese, but the backbone to this story is reinforced by exemplary performances from De Niro, Pesci and Stone. He then glosses their inner-relationships with magical camera work, and a soundtrack which captures the essence, and emotion of the era. Although, essentially a mob-drama, this film is about the relationships of the main players, and their relationship with the mechanics of the mob. What people think about the mob is that they go around killing people indiscriminately. However, the intrinsic reason is the money, they want to continue seeing the kickbacks, the green. I think De Niro gives an honest portrayal of a Casino boss who just wants things to run smoothly; the casino, his marriage to Ginger, and most importantly the machinations of the mob.  He is outshone here though by both Stone and Pesci, who's captivating, repulsive characters, makes for a sympathetic viewpoint of De Niro's character. My only fault here is the ending, which in its entirety resolves the fates of the other characters, but with De Niro's it ends so matter-of-factly that it compromises the outcome of the film.A veritable feast of film. 9/10  7/10 if you don't like swearing.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Scorsese, Deniro, and Pesci score again.","Casino (1995) Though Casino is not my favorite Martin Scorsese film, it is still one of his best films and of the best films ever made. Casino is intriguing, entertaining, and brutal.Casino is a somewhat long film but very easy to watch. It stays interesting the entire time and never really slows. It's a bit different than your average gangster film, concentrating somewhat more on the characters themselves than their business.To pick a favorite part of the film is kind of hard. Martin Scorsese's directing, and both Robert Deniro and Joe Peschi's roles are all fantastic. Scorsese does great with this film, and even though he has done many similar movies, this one is still fresh and new. Deniro seemingly plays the same role he usually does but it's a much deeper role than most, one of his best performances ever. Peschi on the other hand is definitely at his best, he is so intense he almost steals the film.Casino is a brutal and intense look at organized crime and Las Vegas, sometimes even hard to watch due to the violence in some scenes. It is one of the greatest films ever. Although some people know it best as the film that uses the ""F"" word more than any other, it should definitely be remembered for directing, acting, writing, etc, more than anything else. It is truly a masterpiece.The film will most likely be loved by anyone who watches it, as long as they don't have a short attention span. Any fan of Scorsese, DeNiro, Pesci, or Stone must watch this film. A modern classic that isn't going anywhere.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Martin Scorsese classic,"In 1983, Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) leaves his casino and gets blown up in his car. Ten years earlier, he's running Tangiers with money from questionable sources. The money is getting skimmed and delivered to Kansas City for the mob bosses. Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) is the manager. Andy Stone (Alan King) is the head of the teamsters and Phillip Green (Kevin Pollak) is the front man. Sam falls for con woman Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) who has a weak spot for her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is his violent childhood best friend who comes out to Vegas and causes problems pushing his weight around.I'm not always good with narration. The constant narration could have thrown me off but it fits perfectly. This is simply Ace and Nicky teaching the audience the way of their world. De Niro and Pesci are terrific. Sharon Stone brings something different to this. The movie is stretched out a bit at 3 hours but it never loses the tension.

Better than Goodfellas,"Everything about Casino is better and far superior to the highly overrated and bland movie that is Goodfellas from the story, the writing, the cinematography, the acting, the action and the characters. It's flashy, colorful, dark, gripping and everything a crime mob movie needsNot once through the 3 hour length was I bored out of my mind with Casino unlike Goodfellas. The true story of Sam "" Ace"" a wiseguy running a successful casino in Las Vegas who marries a troubled, broken and damaged woman named Ginger, the quick distrust and deterioration of their relationship even after they have a child, Ace's mobster friend Nicky who as aspirations to be his own mob boss causing constant trouble in Los Vegas and for Ace. It had everything you need from suspense to unpredictabilityThere were times I was expecting Ace and Nicky to not only fall out but also attempting to kill each other by the end or Ace not only giving up on his wife Ginger but ends up murdering her. None of these happens, the start of the movie is really smart as it sets you in not only towards the end of the movie but paints you a picture of what you might will happen by the time you reach to the end of the movie againAnother thing about this movie is it made me think and question the relationship between Ace and Ginger, throughout the movie it paints a one sided point of view from Ace's perspective and throughout most of the film I sided with him but as you see how angry Ginger is and hateful hating and wishing Ace dead, it made me question my perspective and their relationship. There had to be plenty of good reasons as to why the relationship ended the way it did and why it appears Ginger is painted as the truly bad oneThe action and violence is pretty brutal but it mainly keeps it on the lowdown only appearing when it's needed and it's always present in the mob world. Frank Vincent who you might know as Phil Leotardo from The Sopranos is not only in this movie as he was in Goodfellas but plays a very prominent role throughout the entire movie. Great actor and the acting from De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone is spot on. Everyone is on gameI also liked the setting of the movie in Las Vegas, it's very unique and different compared to the typical mob crime movies that usually take place in New York or Chicago.

Outstanding acting coupled with a great story makes for quite the spectacle!,"Casino (1995) is , in my opinion , the best film of that year if not one of the best of the decade. Martin Scorsese's fascinating film ""Casino"" knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas. It's based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi, who had full access to a man who once ran four casinos for the mob, and whose true story inspires the movie's plot. As IMDb rightly puts it it is a film of greed , money , power and most importantly deception. In terms of acting De Niro steals the show as 'Sam Rothstein' as well as Sharon Stone who also portrays a very convincing performance. I believe the explanation of how 'Rothstein' runs the Casino are the most intriguing scene's of the whole film (as in how it is shot and acted) with De Niro giving us an 'in absolute character' performance. My only dislike for the film is what most people have recognised when watching it and that is it's similarity to 'Goodfellas' ( characters and narrative) and the fact that Joe Pesci plays the same little angry Italian everytime but this pales in comparison to the positives. Ultimately , having of finally watched this film after years of wanting to i regard it as one of the best of that decade and recommend it highly.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"shut up, Bobby","I know I'm not alone in my fascination of Las Vegas casino ""culture."" I've only been there once, but I was completely awestruck by the delicious, glowing obscenity of it all (mind you I'm a jaded New Yorker, not some babe in the woods). ""Casino"" only adds to the fantasy. The irony is that while Vegas is seen as a separate universe where vice is as commonplace as streetlights, it's probably the only HONEST city in the world. Every other city is as full of vice and corruption, but Vegas is the only place that admits that these things are at the core of our lovely civilization. Scorsese has many tools at his disposal; here he uses his scalpel and Bedazzler above all else. The one thing that really bugged me (other than the usual Italian-American stereotypes, but what are you gonna do) is the OVER-use of voice-over. Voice-over is pretty annoying to begin with, but here it's just way too much. It almost sucks the life out of the movie (especially when coupled with Scorsese's snappy montage style). Visually it's quite breathtaking, and the performances are top-notch, especially from Sharon Stone, who emits a raw energy not common among today's leading ladies.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Great Movie, but not as good as it's predecessor","Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci once again star in a Martin Scorsese mob movie, and yes it's a damn good film, but it does fail to live up to the standards set by 'Goodfellas' which used the same combination of talent. I think it's because Casino lacks the stylistic breaking new ground feel of the afore mentioned movie, and this distracts from the overall enjoyment a little.De Niro puts in a Oscar worthy performance, as does Sharon Stone, she was superb in this movie. Joe Pesci once again plays the psychotic hard man with a certain flair for sadistic violence, a role he seems to act with brilliant ease; and of course Scorcese once again directs with his usual brand of genius.If you liked this film, you simply have to see Goodfellas.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The incredible acting talents of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci definitely bring their characters to life. In reality, THEY, and other incredible talents made the movie memorable. And they are the ones who prevented this movie from being nominated for the worst picture award.Because when you look at the whole movie without those incredible talents, it is very lame and impotent. It has a great beginning, an interesting ending, but much of the middle is worthless. Out of 3 hours of movie, maybe 1 is watchable.It can be compared to a practical joke that involves a piece of paper that says, ""How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over."" And on the other side it says ""How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over."" In terms of entertainment and development, it would as effective to make a 20 minute movie, and repeat that exact same 20 minute movie over and over again until near the end of the movie.

A Scorcese Classic!,"Martin Scorcese really knows how to make movies. Every one of his movies are just well-done classics worth watching over and over again. Casino is no exception. I'm kind of surprised that no one seems to have seen this movie. I guess it's just overshadowed by other Scorcese's films with greater hype such as Goodfellas or Taxi Driver.This movie is almost a sequel to Goodfellas. It goes much more in depth in the lives of the gangsters more than the fore-mentioned movie did. This is about how the mafia placed a guy in charge of running a casino. This guy wants no unnecessary problems, but unfortunately that happens in the way of his new wife.The acting is very good. Robert de Niro is one of the greatest actors of all time. Joe Pesci is great as the cursing, ugly slimeball. The only weak link is Sharon Stone. I'm not a big fan of hers.The voice-over narration in the movie works. That kept me hooked throughout.

Great entertainment!,"Prior to viewing this film I was not a Scorcese fan. Casino was a masterpiece! He created three hours of pure entertainment. Robert De Niro as always superb along with Joe Pesci and James Woods et al. I'm saying the film belonged to Sharon Stone. She was more than convincing as the meretricious demimonde. Her character began as a shooting star and deteriorated to a burnt out derelict. She should have won the Oscar for this awesome portrayal. Direction was meticulous with each shot and scene saying something pertinent to the plot. I did not appreciate the F word used so many times. it tends to cheapen the film. What did we do for sixty years before the F word was used?? I'm fortunate in viewing the film on TV where the filth was dubbed over. I remember seeing a film called ""Glen Gary, Glen Ross"" I had to leave the theatre due to the senseless filth in the language. I mean really stupid, unnecessary profanity.

Goodfellas in Las Vegas,"When a director makes a fantastic movie, sometimes there will be a follow up movie that has a similar idea and story. This isn't a sequel, but it is pretty much the same movie with a different location and list of characters. This can be done by the same director or a different one. In this case, Martin Scorsese made Goodfellas in 1990, creating one of the greatest movies of all time. In 1995, he came back with another movie of the same caliber as Goodfellas.Casino is the story of the rise and fall of a casino in Las Vegas called the Tangiers during the 1970's and 80's. Casino operator Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) try to make this casino the best there is while making a huge amount of money for themselves, their wives, and for the ""bosses"" back home. They use some interesting methods of persuasion for cheaters in the casino so they never come back, and of course there are payoffs to police, security, politicians, and anyone else who needs to be ""taken care of"". With so much corruption in this town, they fit right in.Sam's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is the woman of his dreams, or at least that's what he thinks. Together, the two of them go on a roller coaster ride through everything. Just when things are looking great, the whole operation falls apart. The Tangiers is running smoothly, no one is ratted out, and they are becoming kings of the Las Vegas strip. Little by little things crumble down into oblivion. Snitches, FBI agents, and all sorts of trouble rain down on this paradise in the desert.Scorsese does a nice job of illustrating the rise and fall of this casino. It is very reminiscent of Goodfellas, the story being the rise and fall of the crime family. Casino the same idea with a different story. The good thing is that there isn't a problem with that because the movie itself makes up for it. Scorsese brings back De Niro and Pesci from previous movies like Raging Bull and Goodfellas to make this movie worth watching. The addition of Sharon Stone, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her performance as Ginger, gives the movie more of a reason to watch.The only problem with this movie is that is really long, running just short of three hours. Some parts seem to drag on, but with the changing storyline, it's always something new. Scorsese does what he does best and that is tell a great story. His use of narration throughout the whole movie by De Niro and Pesci is very well done. The transition from the 70's to the 80's is noticeable in the equipment used in the casino, the clothing, the music, and the lifestyles they pursue. Whether it's watching the casino floor or taking some guys out back to ""talk"" with, there is a lot to watch and be entertained by. The hard work put into running a casino and all of the in's and out's are exposed. It's a hard life out there, but when a problem arises, all they have to to is dig a hole in the desert and let the pistol do the talking. Casino is a great story that is definitely worth a viewing at least once. As the saying goes, ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas..."". Thankfully this movie got out for us to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Today, it looks like Disneyland.""","Martin Scorsese have gained a lot of respect and power through his films. Ranging from Taxi Driver to Goodfellas, his career have spawned one magnificent movie after another. His films are powerful, violent, well-crafted, well-directed and well-written. You can also say that in a lot of his films, there's a sense of ambition. In the case with Casino, it qualifies as another great piece of film-making from him.The story begins in 1973, where Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, (Robert De Niro), is sent to Las Vegas to run the teamsters-funded casino called The Tangiers. In the Tangiers, the mafia controls every aspect of activity. Sam becomes the boss of the casino, giving him full responsibility to run it. His best friend, Nicky, (Joe Pesci), is also involved with Sam's business of running the casino, giving Sam all the protection he needs. But, when a woman walks into Sam's life while playing on the craps table and also causing a disruption, he spots his eyes her. The girl's name is Ginger (Sharon Stone). Soon enough, Sam and Ginger get married. But, what Sam doesn't know is that Ginger is a prostitute and her unfaithful actions to him comes from her long-time pimp, Lester (James Woods). When Sam finds out about Lester, he takes matter into his own hands. As the film progresses, Sam's dreams are shattered when he starts to lose control of his casino empire and everything becomes too complicated to handle or bear.The photography is very well done and it creates a sense of vibrant to the world of Las Vegas. Furthermore, Scorsese shows us how the casino operation works. There's one scene in the movie where Nicky narrates about what goes on in a specific room called the ""Count Room."" In the Count Room, casino managers count up all of the money that is collected from the players. It turns that the mob controls the casino and Rothstein is calling the shots. But, as the movie progresses, I felt that the film turn into a ""How to"" movie, where the viewer learns a thing or two about mob operations in Las Vegas.There are other parts in Casino that I really like. Another criticism that I have is the relationship between Sam and his wife, Ginger. In this relationship, we see that Sam really love her, yet what he doesn't know is that Ginger doesn't love him. Sam, as a person wants to do right and set certain things right because he wants them to be this way. However, in the case of his relationship with Ginger, he is trying to help her get over her drug addiction. But, like the casino business, he can't seem to control her, and therefore, the result is very fatal and destructive.Another thing that Sam can't control is his relationship with Nicky. Just like his wife and his casino managing, Nicky is a giant complication to Sam. He's out of control and throughout the entire movie, we see Nicky getting more and more arrogant about setting up his part in Las Vegas. That proves to be too much for Sam because he doesn't want Nicky get out of control. As a result, Nicky is becomes his own enemy toward the mob and that, his fate is ill-fated.What Scorsese does in this movie and also with Goodfellas is that the mafia world is being used as a crutch and that the main character of both films set their standards toward the mob. Yet, even though his promises are convincing, they are really not what they seem to be. In other words, what one would warned to another, another does the impossible. In Goodfellas, Henry Hill is told by Jimmy Conway to never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut. In the end of Goodfellas, that promise is broken, yet there is a sense of resentment and regret. In Casino, the characters are all infatuated by what goes in Las Vegas. It's almost as if Scorsese change the location from New York to Las Vegas.All the performances in Casino are astounding. Robert De Niro is excellent as Sam Rothstein, the man who wants everything done, but can never predict the problems that he has to face. Sharon Stone gives, I think, an Oscar-nominated performance as Ginger. This performance proves that Stone can act under so much pressure and destruction that creates her character to be convincing. Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his performance in Goodfellas, is effective as Nicky. Some people would say that Pesci is playing in the same field as in Goodfellas. But, Pesci is playing a character here. A character would can snap if he is push too far. All three performances really hold the movie together and all three should be given a certain amount of respect to their characters.Scorsese continues to make movies after Casino, with other future works like The Departed and Gangs of New York. But, Casino is his second boldest. I say that because his latest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, is probably his most boldest yet. With the evidence of Casino, he really scores high with this masterpiece. He captures the life and glamor of Las Vegas life, yet I have to say that this film and Leaving Las Vegas really brings us to the world of Sin City, where the bright and shining lights are covered behind a sense of toughness and crime. Another film that failed to live up to Casino or Leaving Las Vegas is Showgirls, which fails to capture the toughness of being in Las Vegas. Casino is bold, bloody and brilliant and its ambition takes us deep into the heart and crime of Sin City. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
After movies - Casino,"A Martin Scorsese's film, casting with his longtime partner Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, like another ""Goodfellas"". This time the story is about Casino, but mobster is still an indispensable part of it.The film began with a car bomb and then flashed back to how Sam carved out his way in the casino business, how he desperately kept the balance between business and his mobster background. At the same time, this film emphasized his unsuccessful relationship with his wife, Ginger. Which is quite unusual in a Scorsese film because most of his films female characters are just ornaments. But this time, Ginger (played by Sharon Stone) is indisputably the leading actress in Casino.Violence is another important ingredient of this film, torture, beating, bombing and killing, all to bring forth the cruelty of the living world. If you're a typical Scorsese's fan, you will love it.The accurate and realistic depiction of Casino business is also remarkable. The colorful world filled with gambling, cheating and hustling. But all gamblers are losers, the only winner is the casino itself. Business is business, making profit is the ultimate goal. When Sam had made great fortune by running the casino, he wanted to be a normal businessman and didn't want to be involved into mobsters anymore. But it was difficult to quit because he had already made the countless ties with them. When it concerns with benefits, it's not a thing one man can decide anymore.Talking abut the actors, I have to admit that Sharon Stone is wonderful in this film, her only Oscar-nominated role by far. But there is something I must complain about, that is the role of Ginger, which is so stupidly written, she was just a mindless Blondie who only wanted to marry a rich man to enjoy a luxury life. We don't blame her for that, nevertheless how could she be so in love with James Wood's role is beyond redemption and totally unconvincing! Maybe the answer is either me or Martin Scorsese does not understand women at all. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci's acting are some kind of continuing of their roles in ""Goodfellas"", good but far from excellent.This film is not Scorsese's best work and Sharon Stone shines in her bitter and badly-written role.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An absolutely incredible film!,"Casino (1995) is hands down one of the best films I've ever seen in my entire life. I say that because honestly, there just aren't many films that are this well done, it's pretty rare to find a gem like this one. Now, some may not care for it simply because it's just not their cup of tea, but nonetheless it's still a great film. The writing is really perfect for the kind of film it is. A record of the most F bombs ever spoken in a film was set by Casino, before Wolf of Wall Street came along that is. I would probably say the 400+ F bombs used was overkill if it would have been a different kind of film, but it fit perfectly for this kind. The writing definitely fits the characters. The characters are wonderfully deep too, we learn so much about them and we get to see them played by such great actors. Pesci, De Niro, and Stone all turn in marvelous performances, especially Stone (this was her Academy Award nomination). The story is very interesting and you won't be bothered by the somewhat long runtime because of the good pacing and the level of interest. There is just so much happening with these interesting, very damaged characters that you won't wanna turn away, I sure didn't.

A modern cinema classic.,"""Casino"" is another modern classic from Martin Scorsese. Drawing parallels with his earlier ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"" again teams Scorsese up with writer Nicholas Pileggi. The result is a truly engaging tale of mobsters setting up a new gambling empire in Las Vegas and the subsequent ripple effects that involve the local authorities and the police.With an incredible cast, superbly realistic visuals and dynamic direction, ""Casino"" is an unforgettable experience. Violent, gritty and uncompromising, it is a hard-hitting story but extremely entertaining nonetheless.

One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made And One Of The Greatest Gangster Films Ever Made. Another Scorsese Classic.,"Martin Scorsese's Casino is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest Gangster films ever made that's filled with brilliant direction,excellent acting and a great Rock N' Roll soundtrack making this film another Scorsese classic,one of his best films and one of my all time favorite films.Set in Las Vegas in the 1970s and 1980s and based on a true story,Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein(Robert De Niro),an expert gambler connected to Gangsters and because of his success he is asked by the Mob to run the Tangiers,one of the biggest Casinos in Las Vegas and help steal money for the Mob. While in Vegas he marries hooker and hustler Ginger(Sharon Stone)and receives help from friend and gangster Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci). But as time goes on Ace,Ginger and Nicky discovers that their successes will lead to violence,death and betrayal and know that no one stay's on top forever.Released in 1995,Casino surprising received a mixed reception among critics and one of the criticisms of Casino is that the film was too similar to Scorsese's earlier Gangster film Goodfellas. But,thanks to showings on Cable TV,Home Video and DVD sales Casino has now been regarded as as a classic and one of Scorsese's best films and it's rightfully deserved. If Goodfellas was about the rise and fall of a New York Gangster then Casino is about the rise and fall of a empire. With Casino,Scorsese gives viewers a big and violent epic gangster film and shows viewers a different side of Las Vegas that most people probably already knew about but not many have seen where the city of LV is being secretly controlled by the Mob and where money and violence rule the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas. Casino is in many ways a tragic film where the characters in the film have success and money but there are many things that happen in the film mess up their own empire and value because when you listen to most of the narration in the film you feel like the characters are looking back at their past with regret and wishing they would have done something different. The rise and fall in this film is almost like a Shakespere play. One of the things that I always loved about Casino is the cinematography because Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson gives the film a beautiful and stylish look where the colors of the suits and production design just come off the screen and hit you in the eye. Scorsese cleverly tricks viewers with the beauty of the film and almost makes viewers forget about the violence and death that is in the air. The photography is one of the things that is different from Goodfellas because where Goodfellas seem more gritty and dirty,Casino is almost like Goodfellas glamorous and flamboyant little brother in comparison. The three main characters Ace,Ginger and Nicky,like in most of Scorsese films aren't always the most likable but have levels of depth and dimension that each characters shows throughout the film when things are happening around them whether it's buy their own doing with Aces' pride and ego,Ginger's troubled past and present,Nicky's violence or by someone else. You don't always like the main characters,but you don't hate them either. Although Casino is nearly three hours long the film moves at a quick pace and there isn't a wasted scene in the film. It's one of fastest near three hours you will ever watch. The violence in the film is bloody and deadly and Scorsese does not compromise or tone it down one bit showing what it's like when you're in the crime world. The violence in the film is so disgusting that you will never want to gamble or go to Las Vegas. Casino did for gambling and going to Las Vegas what Jaws did for swimming in the water. The ending of the film is great because it is a combination of violence,brutality and sadness which pretty much hangs over the course of the film and it is a classic Scorsese ending.The whole cast does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein,with De Niro bringing depth and intensity to the performance. Sharon Stone earned an Oscar nod for her powerful,sexy and fiery performance as Ginger,a hooker Ace falls for. Stone has great scenes with both De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant,funny and volatile as Nicky Santoro,with Pesci stealing every scene he's in. James Woods is great in his role as Ginger's pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Frank Marino,Nicky's right hand man. Pasguale Cajano is fantastic as Remi Gaggi,a top Mob boss. Alan King is great and memorable as Andy Stone,a head of the Teamsters. Kevin Pollock is Wonderful and smooth as Phillip Green. Don Rickles(Billy Sherbert),L.Q Jonesz(Pat Webb),John Bloom(Don Ward),Dick Smothers(Senator),Vinny Vella(Artie Piscano)and Phillip Suriano(Dominick Santoro)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant and masterful,with Scorsese giving a big,epic feel to the film with powerful atmosphere and is always moving the camera and using great angles. Great direction by Scorsese.The film has an amazing soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Can you Hear Me Knocking,Heart Of Stone,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,Sweet Virginia.),Devo(Whip It,(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction(Devo cover),The Moody Blues(Nights In White Satin),The Animals(House Of The Rising Sun),Fleetwood Mac(You Can Go Your Own Way),Rod Stewart(I Ain't Superstitious),B.B King(The Thrill Is Gone),Brenda Lee(I'M Sorry),Little Richard(Slippin' and Slidin'),Cream(Toad,Those Were The Days),Dean Martin(You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You) and more great songs. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci or Sharon Stone,I highly suggest you see Casino an unforgettable and powerful Gangster and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great entertainment, but no 'Goodfellas'","It's impossible not to compare 'Casino' to another of Scorsese's films - the gangster classic 'Goodfellas', which is my favourite film of his. 'Casino' is strikingly similar in style but is unfortunately overshadowed and often overlooked due to the success and popularity of 'Goodfellas'.But while 'Casino' may be in the shadow of 'Goodfellas', it is still an excellent movie in its own right. The film oozes style with stunning cinematography and great attention to detail in every frame. In terms of the plot, I can't say it's anyway near as enthalling as 'Goodfellas', but there is still plenty of entertainment to be had despite the overly long running time.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the BEST gangster movie ever made,"Casino is one of the greatest Gangster films I've ever seen. Martin Scorsese once again gives us a terrific movie, that has been directed Excellently. The movie folds around De Niro running a casino, and having marriage problems with Stone and Problems with a lot of things you can say with Pesci. Robert De Niro delivers yet another Brilliant Performance. Joe Pesci's character Nicky is similar to Goodfellas Tommy. Once again Pesci delivers a Superb performance as the violent Nicky. Sharon Stone looks sexy as ever and surprisingly delivers a Good performance. Casino Entertains Big time thanks to De Niro and Pesci working together. If you look at Pesci in Goodfellas and Pesci in Casino, which one is mightier. Both characters are Violent and a little crazy you can say. Pesci's Casino Character is slightly rougher then Tommy. Anyway Casino is a Must see, if you haven't seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Lots to like, but I think I like it a little less than most","Casino is the meaner, sleazier, louder, more aggressive, and more bloated younger brother to Goodfellas.It'd been a while since I'd seen Casino and wanted to give it another shot. I still feel, to some extent, it's the only Scorsese movie that feels a little too similar to a film that came before, in that it really does play out like Las Vegas Goodfellas at times.That's not a terrible thing though. Scorsese might be my favourite filmmaker and Goodfellas would crack my top 5 of all time, but I think Goodfellas tells its story better and feels more original, having been released first. I also feel like the characters are more human in Goodfellas. Even though the sympathetic characters do terrible things, there are still characters with sympathetic qualities, whereas everyone in Casino feels like a violent monster, and it's a big ask of the viewer to spend three hours with this many bad people.That might sound blasphemous, and I don't take any pleasure liking Casino less than most Scorsese fans. It's just how I feel.But all that negativity aside, it's Scorsese more or less firing on all cylinders, so there's still so much to like here. The one thing it does that's distinctive (compared to Goodfellas) is capture the look and feel of its setting beautifully. Is Goodfellas set in LA or New York? I always forget; the setting doesn't feel so important. But Casino is unmistakably Las Vegas-set.Pesci and De Niro do their thing fantastically. Sharon Stone is great but unfortunately most of the movie, her character's a bit one note. She's fantastic in her early scenes, before she marries De Niro's character and spirals into drug addiction, so I think it's the script's fault for simplifying her character.Oh well. Lots of quotable lines and good visuals abound at least, plus a typically rocking soundtrack. It's a good movie, but still not nearly one of my favourites from Scorsese, I'm sorry to say.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish but Overlong and Repetitive,"Attempts to capture the glitz, corruption, and violence of the Las Vegas underworld but ultimately overstays its welcome. While Martin Scorsese's direction is visually striking and the performances-especially from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone-are strong, the film suffers from excessive length and a repetitive narrative. The story feels like a less impactful rehash of Goodfellas, with similar themes but weaker emotional depth. The pacing drags, and many scenes feel unnecessarily drawn out. Despite its stylish presentation, Casino lacks the sharpness and intrigue to keep it consistently engaging.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Who's got the action?,"I watched this movie over the course of a weekend.  I played it once. Played it twice.  I played it a total of 4 times.This movie is one of the most incredible movies ever to be seen by any stretch of the imagination.  If you've ever been in a casino then this movie will really let you appreciate all that goes on in the background.This is a story about love, obsession, greed, ruthlessness--most of all this story chronicles the life of a Casino manager, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert DeNiro), and his ascent to power in 1970s Las Vegas.  Sharon Stone stars as Sam's debutante, Ginger McKenna and Joe Pesci is the crony, Nicky Santoro. Much of the story revolves around these three altogether very different characters.  Unlike Goodfellas, where the crew was trying to get money, power and women, the crew in Casino already had it--they were trying to keep it from competitors, law-enforcement and most importantly--each other.This movie is severely, SEVERELY underrated.  There are moments when it would be safe to assume you'll know what will happen next but, other times (and I won't mention anything specific--except the corn field that is) you won't know what hit you.The camera work is incredible, the story is fantastic and the characters are nothing less than superior.Overall, Casino is not a movie for the faint-of-heart but, a story that is gripping, moving and deeply entrenched in mob tradition.9/10 stars!",,Anonymous,Crime
"Flashy lights, green grass and red blood.","After the great Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese released Casino, a very similar movie with a few of the same actors, and I think I actually prefer this one to its predecessor, by a small margin. Casino is embellished with a lot of flashy overhead shots of nighttime Las Vegas, but underneath all that, you'll find a compelling and gritty drama full of great characters, a complex and winding plot that will have you stuck to your seat for the full three hours - not an easy feat, I might add - with multiple subplots that all remain interesting. They intertwine and twist into the great drama that is the individual man's life, and there are countless scenes here that will remain memorable: the introduction of each major character, Joe Pesci interacting with his young son, Sharon Stone interacting with her leeching ex-boyfriend, the scene where Robert DeNiro stands in the desert as the dust from Pesci's car kicks up around him, and the countless scenes of upper-class suburban Los Vegas juxtaposed with the chaotic, grimy personal lives of those who inhabit it.This movie is pretty long, so if you are not the type who likes to sit down for three straight hours, then I wouldn't recommend this one to you, but for everyone else, feast away. Martin Scorsese's Casino is always realistic, stirring and memorable, so go see it if you haven't already. Superlative.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

De Niros acting is as always very good, and he interprets Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal very well as Sam Rothstein. The movie might be quite violent, but I feel this gives the movie a very realistic approach to the novel - and sadly the reality. It seems to have very little to do with http://www.bettingexpert.com/dk/casino - but even though Casino is a movie that affect you, it 's a feeling - the same way as you got a special feeling when entering a Casino.

"""He'll keep coming back until one of you is dead""","Repetition occurs in cinema at every level. If something is successful, highbrow or lowbrow, there is a good chance that those responsible will simply rerun the formula to get the same result. In 1990 iconic gangster movie and filmmaker's favourite Goodfellas was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by Nicholas Pileggi, and starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. In 1995 gangster movie Casino was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by You get the idea.Admittedly Scorsese and Pileggi did work well together, the director illustrating the writer's every word with a well-placed pan or close-up. It's a bit dizzying and the constant musical switching gets a bit tiresome, but you still have to admire the craftsmanship that goes into a picture like this, especially in Scorsese's meticulously planned tracking shots. There's one near the beginning where we follow the skimmer into the casino, and the camera eagerly overtakes him as he heads towards the counting room, really engaging us in what's going on. Or there's the tracking shot at the wedding, where Sharon Stone's flick of her head seems to propel the camera on to the next table. It's a very artificial, obtrusive way of making a movie, but it is nevertheless carefully designed to involve us in the story's world.This was the eighth, and to date, the final time Robert De Niro has starred in a Scorsese movie, and this is predictably familiar ground for him. Sam Rothstein is really just a slightly more relaxed version of the De Niro character in Goodfellas. De Niro can at least do menacing without using his fists, and of note is his articulation of the word ""dead"" when he threatens his wife. Joe Pesci's role here is nigh-on identical to the one that earned him an Oscar in Goodfellas. He's good at it though. Look at how he stabs up the man with the pen; he really gives the impression of a little guy who's had to get the kicks in quick to survive. But reliable as these two are there is very much a sense with De Niro and Pesci that they are going through the old familiar motions. The real standout in the movie is Sharon Stone. For this part she has to be angry, tearful and drugged-up, as do a lot of actresses, but to do so for such a large chunk of the movie and remain believable throughout, never slipping into over-the-top hysterics, is admirable.Being a repetition of Goodfellas doesn't necessarily make Casino a weaker movie. It has almost all the same merits and flaws as its predecessor. It is perhaps a little more lacking in true drama and comes closer to a documentary, at times being little more than a list of anecdotes, which makes the nearly three hour runtime a little wearing. One area which, for me, made Casino stand-out was its costume design. Garish as they are, there's a mad kind of co-ordination in Rothstein's suits. There are plenty of other tawdry yet outstanding outfits throughout the movie, such as an Ace of Hearts dress worn by a bit player. Sharon Stone's leather suit in her climactic scenes is memorably striking, and as such helps to highlight the fact that she's been in the same clothes for several days. For me, it's the clothes more than anything else which evoke the misguided glamour of Casino and its denizens. Unfortunately, this isn't what people tend to consider in the gangster movie, so it seems to have gone largely unnoticed",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Exceptionally cast, shot, and told.","Casino in no way should be compared to the film ""Heat"", as I've read in other reviews- with the exception that it uses two of the same well known actors. It's release date is irrelevant, however similar, since stories make up movies, not release dates.With that said, Casino is a striking and glittering rise and fall epic depicting the mafias' crooked grip on an early Las Vegas. Based on a true story, it stars Robert Deniro as Sam ""Ace"" Rostien, a dead-on and almost obsessively methodical gambler used and highly appreciated by mob bosses to run an efficient money machine named The Tangiers Hotel and Casino- an establishment, like all others at that time, whose initial investments were OK'd by the mob. Joe Pesci stars as Nicki Santuro, who works under the same bosses to protect their golden child, while Sharon Stone plays Ginger, a high-end Casino hustler who sooner than later wins Ace's rare affection in one sparkling moment while in his Casino. James Woods reaches the pinnacle of genuine sleaziness as Lester Diamond, a childhood friend of Ginger's and bottom of the barrel moocher and hustler. The film, using voice over and gliding explanatory takes, encompasses a brutal and almost ""behind the scenes"" type story of what went on in the early years of sin city, before commercial giants put their foot down and legally out financed everyone else. Under the guidance of Martin Scorsese, rich characters are proudly lived out by Deniro, Stone, Pesci, and Woods even in his small role, who all fit their character to a T. Thanks to Robert Richardson as cinematographer (The Doors), Casino not only excels at being an exceptional tale of money and trust, but also arrests the viewers attention with whirring motion, glowing color, and beautifully composed framing and lighting. The ever popular Soprano's has nothing on this movie. Music, locations, and editing serve the story as well, making it one of Scorsese's most solid works to date.",,Anonymous,Crime

Like Raging Bull and Goodfellas, Casino never veers into unwatchability, remaining inspired throughout, especially for those interested in the truth, whether it be about the Mafia or no. The real truth here is the heart of mankind, which is filled with evil. The perpetual lure of sex and violence, end of the world hypocrisy, the false faces that cover the insatiable lust and love of money. Man's inability to avoid corruption, the ease with which he walks and rides roughshod, to roll in destruction and without remorse. The real world extremes of what people are capable of. Of what seeds are planted in the soil of the human heart, and the flowers of evil that are nurtured and grown. Martin Scorsese is an end of the world prophet here, and this underrated masterpiece is one of the brightest sermons he ever delivered. A latter day warning to mankind that the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Town Will Never Be The Same,"After films such as Cape Fear and The Age of Innocence, Martin Scorsese returns to his roots where this would be the final film of Scorsese's mob trilogy (his first two were Mean Streets and GoodFellas) before his prequel (Gangs of New York) in which we get to see Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent in their last collaboration with Martin Scorsese before adding DiCaprio to the mix. Life in Las Vegas will never be the same.The film's prologue has Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro) going to his car where he narrates about sacrifices about love, than his car blows up leaving him flying in the air. After the credits have rolled with his body flying, we get to see Rothstein before his death smoking a cigarette where he narrates about how he ran things very successfully and that he was a bookie who changed the odds for everybody; also we are introduced to characters from Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) who is Ace's best friend watching his back and says they screwed up the whole plan to take over the casinos; Ace's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is shown as innocent until we get to know her later as a street hustler who robs men for their money and hangs out with her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods).The film is very different from GoodFellas and Mean Streets were both films talked about the territory of the mafia life such as nobody dating anybody different than their races; murders becoming an exception; damaging things when somebody doesn't pay; etc. Casino is more of a document on how organized crime controls what goes on in Las Vegas. It shows people in the account room counting money; all of the managers, dealers and bosses watching one another to see if they are doing their job, rob the rich people, take care of the high officials in the city and make sure that nobody tries to cheat in the casinos.The character of Rothstein is a genius in terms of trying to take people's money and helping others get money. After his character is in charge of The Tangiers, Nicky narrates on how Sam got information on what went on with sports; he find out if the quarterback got his wife knocked up, if they did cocaine, crooked referees, even the wind velocity for the field goals. Nicky says, ""The boys back home didn't care if he enjoyed himself because Sam was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money."" The character of Nicky Santoro is like Pesci's Tommy DeVito from ""GoodFellas"" where they are volatile when not doing things their way. We see that in Nicky's character when a patron is verbally abusing Sam when all Sam asked was if the pen next to him was his, Nicky stabs the guy in the neck until the patron starts wheezing. Sam explains, ""No matter how big somebody is, Nicky would take'em on."" His appearance in Las Vegas worries Sam because he was going to be taking care of Sam along with his partner, Frank Marino (Frank Vincent) for which they scare most of the people away from Las Vegas and play their own game.Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) has been a call girl all her life for which she steals chips from her Iranian boyfriend while having a camera zooming in on her and is being watched by Rothstein. He goes to the craps table where he sees Ginger wanting more money from the boyfriend and than tosses the chips to the floor where Rothstein has fallen in love with the call girl. ""In Vegas,"" he says ""for a girl like Ginger, love costs money."" Indeed it does, as Ginger robs Rothstein like Peggy would rob Al on ""MarriedWith Children"" where she would take his money, when telling him that she is going to play some slots; Ginger also gets most of the employees on their knees as she drugs Andy Stone (comedian Alan King), one of the people working with the mafia; and gets most of the casino workers to give her things as long as she covers them; from clothes and cars, she had everything except her old boyfriend Lester Diamond who was a hustler stealing people for cash.In a movie full of serious actors, there are three comedians playing supporting characters in this crime drama; Alan King is Andy Stone has I had mentioned, he works for the mafia in which he has conversations with them about how they should control Vegas; Don Rickles plays Billy Sherbert, the Casino manager who doesn't do much except waddle around and gets hit by Nicky; Phillip Green is played by Kevin Pollock in which his character is more of the reticent for which he can't do anything or say anything just because the teamsters gave him 62,700,00 dollars, it didn't mean anything as long as he pretended to be somebody big.As much as performances go, the spotlight belongs to Sharon Stone in a great performance. Sharon has often portrayed the lured of affection for which we see her take her clothes off or try to appeal in a sexual situation. In Casino, she plays the character very mature and most likely will be her only serious performance; she'll be herself once we stop watching this film. Another spotlight belongs to Joe Pesci who won his Oscar for GoodFellas, yet he steals the show as a main character instead of a supporting character for which he gets to tell the point of view.Casino proves to be another hit in the Martin Scorsese collection with an awesome soundtrack as its own theme, performances that shine, and bad guys that people like to root for.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The dizzying climax to Scorsese's Mafia trilogy,"Like Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" and Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", Scorsese had created a bit of monster for himself when he released ""Goodfellas"" in 1990. He created an undisputed, instant classic for which all of his subsequent films - as well as all other Mafia films - would be measured against. As magnificent as ""Goodfellas"" is, it can be considered a curse. This is evident in ""Casino"", Scorsese's more-or-less follow-up to the life depicted in ""Goodfellas"". It is an impressive achievement, even more dense and visceral than ""Goodfellas"", but it has received some derision over the years by those who have accused Scorsese of ""copying himself."" (How can a filmmaker ""copy"" himself anyway? Nobody has moaned about Spielberg constantly re-visiting the days of WWII.)Merciless in presenting his strict attention to detail, Scorsese chronicles the rise and fall of Las Vegas under the grip of the Mafia from the early 1970's to the mid 1980's. Utilizing endless freeze-frames, multiple voice-over narrators, incessant music, swirling cinematography and eye-bruising set decoration, Scorsese brings us deep into the diamond-crusted bowels of the big business of Las Vegas and how the mob ""skimmed"" all they could from it for over a decade. Robert De Niro brings a subtle gravity to the role of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a genius gambling pro from Chicago recruited by the Mafia to manage and operate the four largest casinos in Vegas. Rothstein's insurance arrives in the guise of childhood friend Nicky Santoro - now a hotshot Mafia captain (and rendered with crushing brutality by Joe Pesci). After years of successful slumming as a mid-level gambler, Rothstein sees Vegas as his shot at legitimacy. He tries to solidify his dream by marrying a high-class Vegas prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who despite her glamorous exterior and sturdy attitude, is ultimately emotionally lost and still desperately hung on her greasy pimp / boyfriend, Lester Diamond (nicely underplayed by the eternally sleazy James Woods).  Ginger tires to escape Ace's marital clutch while still enjoying the perks of being the wife of the most powerful man in town, while Nicky disregards Ace's ""nice-and-neat"" policy of running business in favor of violent extortion and rampant thievery over everyone else in town. Ace sees the coupling together of his rocky marriage to Ginger with Nicky's aggressive attempts at taking over Las Vegas as problematic, but pride & greed prevent him from acknowledging the true severity of the situation. When Ginger and Nicky's frustrations with Ace inadvertently turn them toward each other, all hell breaks loose.There are probably very few other films that hit the three-hour mark and fly by as quickly as ""Casino"". Longtime Oliver Stone cinematographer Robert Richardson gives Scorsese's Las Vegas a polished, glossy look; bathed in neons, pastels and solids of every color imaginable. God's gifts to Editors - that being Scorsese's number-one partner in crime, Thelma Schoonmaker, creates a smooth but frenetic pacing in Scorsese's storytelling. The music - which encompasses a bizarre brew of blues, swing, classical, doo-wop, rock and even punk - works wonders. Only Spike Lee is as skilled as Scorsese at utilizing music to re-create an era instead of merely advertising the film's accompanying soundtrack. De Niro's take on ""Ace"" Rothstein - who's obsessed with doing the job right - allows Scorsese to splurge on showcasing the in's-and-out's of Vegas. We see Ace chastise reckless dealers, slightly overweight dancers, and beleaguered chefs in excruciating detail. This is not limited to Ace's perceptions, Scorsese explains how money is won and lost, and how it is stolen - whether by the mob or by the players. The first hour of ""Casino"" could easily pass as a documentary on the mechanics of operating a gaming establishment.Aside from the usual mainstays, De Niro and Pesci, Scorsese has assembled a stellar cast. Both Sharon Stone and James Woods give fiery interpretations of their tortured characters. Stone really surprised everybody with her performance here, but really - how many people would agree to act in a Martin Scorsese picture and sleep through it anyway? Vegas comedy legends Alan King and Don Rickles also appear in straight roles as a casino manager and a mob front, respectively. The great character actor/comedian Kevin Pollack also offers his talent as the mob's squeaky-clean front man. No performance falls flat here.One way to angle the film for yourself if you're at all put-off by its structural similarities to ""Goodfellas"" need only regard this - ""Casino"" is basically an explanation of what would have happened to the characters in ""Goodfellas"" had they succeeded beyond the middle-class comfort of where they roamed. The film also contains the novelty value of displaying De Niro's ability to juggle! I try to be concise when writing reviews and not ramble as I have done here, but it is difficult to do so with a film like ""Casino"", because it is a film so crowded in its presentation. It's a traditional American Mafia story about gluttonous, reckless, greedy people. Nonetheless, it is another Scorsese masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Scorsese Film?,"In typical gangster films what is the common theme and emotion that you get from them? the answer is you tend to not feel to much emotion towards the gangsters actions however Casino is much different I Felt so angry, upset and so sorry for Bob Deniro in this as his role played to perfection as always. Did anyone else wanna go into the film and beat the s*** out of Sharon Stone ha ha. Thats exactly what i am trying to get at. The acting is on another level, so amazing that These emotions were brought out by the audience watching! Sharon Stone's Excellent performance as Ginger i thought stole the show. A straight up lovable hustler turned drug addict. Stone not only en captivates the role and fits the image, she also nails what i think, is the best performance of her career.Robert Deniro as Sam Rothstein once again consistency is the true mark of a great actor and Deniro nails this role to a tee as always. I see Sam as the Good guy of the movie! A good man who just wants a quiet life we as the audience feel compassion towards him throughout and i sense of sorriness as he loses all of his riches Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro amazing as always in this film i see him as the Lovable character, the moments of comedy, the vicious streak all together make such a great personality This film could be Scorsese's best however many opinions will fly around and at the end of the day it becomes hard to say which is his best Casino 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Casino Has to Rate a 10 if you like the genre -- no other way,"A more realistic gangster film, more subdued than other greats, but this is also what makes it a great film. And excellent use of voice-over narration by the different characters. When you add in the fact that, in addition to being great film-making / storytelling, that this film also serves as an engaging reference to the historical and contemporary phenomenon that is Las Vegas, the ultimate metaphorical caricature of the United States, how can this film not be a 10? And the performances? How about the killer soundtrack?? As unintelligent as it may sound, the only knock I can imagine on this film from the aficionados would have to be the lack of violence when compared to say, Pulp Fiction, but I definitely think that there is ample blood and guts, but the gratuitous violence is actually (and this is rare) overshadowed by the depth of the art going on here, and this is the mark of greatness within this genre. Also, the editorial-stype commentary in the last 3 minutes was a bit heavy-handed, but nothing that would detract from a deserved 10/10 rating. Thoughts??",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Fitting Coda,"The feeling of revisited material notwithstanding, Martin Scorsese's close of his New Mafia trilogy (""Main Streets"" and ""GoodFellas"" were the first two chapters) is striking for its last-gasp desperation and depletion: when it runs out of steam it simply expires--there's nothing left. The expulsion of the Mob from Las Vegas also serves to reinforce Scorsese's recurring themes of redemption and ascension; here both are mutually exclusive and to be redeemed and delivered from hell means an existence in purgatory. (Heaven, meanwhile, is reserved for the blue-haired innocents who have become the guests of the corporations that have purged Vegas from sin.) By the time it's over, Scorsese seems exhausted; he doesn't have anything left to say on the subject and it looks doubtful he ever will. Still, if he never makes another masterpiece, this will be a fitting coda on a remarkable subject.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Still a good mob movie,"Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joes Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is the only one of the three that doesn't come through for me. I do find it funny though that so many of these guys end up in the same gangster movies, do they even have to read the script anymore. Even with that said I do enjoy these films a lot and I hope they keep making them. I would like to see a new mob movie come out. The Sapronos is a good guide but even still I don't know how Deniro would deal with somebody like Tony Saprano. I would like to see a Casino 2, maybe Deniro's character wants to get back into the business, and I am not talking about the sports betting side of the coin.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Although it shouldn't take 2 hours and 51 minutes to tell a good story, Scorsese manages to draw us in.","By 1995, Martin Scorsese had well and truly etched his name into the film making book and Casino is really just a cherry on the icing which was already on the cake; this means it's not a bad thing but just feels unnecessary. Whilst this film took me two sittings to get through (I had to cut it off with about 40 minutes remaining the first time I sat down to watch it), I can still see why it's gained a somewhat cult status amongst the masses.What's good about 'Casino' is its energy and vibrancy. The film is very colourful and attractive and it sucks the viewer into its world with several brilliant voice-overs that are informative and dark yet often funny. This is twinned with some brilliant use of colour giving us stone wall proof that cars don't just have to be metallic dark green or blue; jackets don't have to be grey Armani's or pinstripe suits  (they can be pale red!?) and that walls and buildings can be splashed with every colour of the rainbow and still look moderately average. Everybody has a favourite colour and so, when the viewer is drawn into the world giving the feeling you're actually there, sitting in the bars opposite the characters, walking and talking with the croupiers and gambling with the rest of them; it feels like there is something there for you  everyone, in fact and the colours act as a focal point as you map onto various items, objects, props and costume that bear your familiar favourite shade, making things easy on the gaze. This is how Casino's early attempt at drawing you in works.Although the film stays in the exact same gear for at least thirty minutes and the voice-overs (which you think will depart once the scene is set) remain, you can ignore it in a certain sense. There is that nagging sensation, however, that the whole opening is just a watered down back-story  explaining what happened in the first film, making 'Casino' actually feel like a sequel rather than a new, fresh film in itself.What's also odd is the fact that a lot of scenes just feel unnecessary. Pesci's character's dialogue scenes and twitchiness can only feel genuine and spookily evil for so many times and the results from his mounting relationship with a female character can be seen coming from quite a mile away. Although they feel out of place, the scenes are still entertaining enough  especially for the viewer who wants to see Pesci pile on his evil, bad-guy, 'wise-guy' caricature that he's been made famous for over the years. It's these things that bulk up the running time, frustratingly.What really grabbed the film by the scruff was the whole plot point that catapulted it into its final third. Without giving anything away, I'll mention one word: 'corruption' that involves (in some crazy way) absolutely everyone. And, as the final third reaches its, and the films, climax; there seem to be several twists and flips of the coin that involve characters floating here and then to there and then back again and then to where they were two stages ago..and so on. This was very annoying and was a disappointing, messy way to finish the film. It concludes, then re-opens and then concludes again before partly opening it back up before finally allowing the equilibrium to catch up with itself.Although brave, bold and energetic; 'Casino' ultimately felt like an excuse to pool together a couple of big name Hollywood actors, actresses and a director just to make another gangster film that everybody will probably love. If you want a film like this one but better, try Wayne Kramer's 2003 film 'The Cooler'. At least that's not as ridiculously long.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Every movie with gangsters in it will have the same kind of characters because that is the characters the mob is filled with, smart ones, raging bulls, good earners etc. There is a Nickey character in every mob, a hard raging machine that you just don't mess with because he will fly off the handle, their is someone like his boss Remo who seems calm and cool but was the most important man in the mob and he just needs to push a button and thats it lights out, then there are good earners like Ace who may not be Italian and cant be made, but they are around because they are useful and smart and great at making money for them.

Quote: 'back home (east coast) they would have put me in jail, out here they give me awards'. a city awash in cash, proof of the adage 'a sucker is born every minute'.I personally have never been to Vegas and have no intention of going. I have however been to Atlantic City and can understand how the glitter and jingle of the slots can be so mesmerizing, or more precisely saw just that happen numerous times. I never felt the tug, my suspicions confirmed one day at the local casino when I popped a token in a machine and lo, it came up 'bar' 'bar' 'off by one'.

Her fight scenes with DeNiro are jaw-dropping in their intensity.
There can be too much of a good thing, and this movie proves it.

More influential than its given credit for being,"""Casino"" is at its best when its essentially just a very stylish, masterfully done documentary on the history of Vegas and the back-room dealings with the mafia. The primary plot of the movie is good, but doesn't have the same kind of replay value and ultimately just above average.The film's dramatic story is good stuff, but what's important about ""Casino"" is the overarching information it reveals about Vegas, and the amazingly sleek and fun way it does so. Nearly 15 years after Casino, the story depicted in this movie has become essentially the official version of the history of Vegas. It's assumed that something more or less like what's depicted in the movie is what really happened in Vegas from the 1960s and 1970s. Most people don't want any more information - Scorsese's version of history is good enough. And why not? Some of the fine details are wrong, but Scorsese basically used a feature film to unveil to the public for the first time a generally accurate history of organized crime in Las Vegas. In many ways this is what Coppola did with the Godfather - no, every fact isn't true in either film, but both create a narrative, the general gist of which the public accepts as the story they want to believe about a certain chapter in the history of crime.The second reason ""Casino"" is so influential is purely stylistic. This movie is chock full of very indulgent, flashy scenes with very overt camera work, heavy narration, catchy music, busy scenes with dozens of characters at times, and generally a style that is very forceful and exciting. This sort of style seems to have become a mainstay of Hollywood films that were big-budget and looking for box office returns, but also wanted some respect from the critics. Some of the major films that fit that description over the next few years - Boogie Nights and Ocean's 11 pop to mind - hang their hat on scenes directed very much in the lavish, showy way Scorsese does so well in Casino.Altogether, ""Casino"" stops just short of delivering on the promise of its stellar first hour. Perhaps Scorsese wanted to avoid reusing too many of the devices he used to wrap up ""Goodfellas"", but unfortunately, with Scorcese putting away the cinematic fireworks after intermission, I think people remember all of the excitement of the first half, and the second half is just a blur of the stars gradually heading downhill in the predictable ways. Still, with a first half like that, the full film can't help but be a classic, if an uneven one.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The reason i like 1995 Martin scorsese's Casino,"I do enjoy Martin Scorsese's Casino (1995), beside my interest of gangster serial films and mafioso, Casino have a gripping exploration of the mob's influence on Las Vegas. The film stars Robert De Niro as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a skilled bookmaker managing the Tangiers casino, alongside Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. It intricately details the operations of casino life, from skimming profits to dealing with cheating. Critics praise its storytelling and cinematography, noting its blend of historical context and character-driven drama. While some find its violence and pop music overwhelming, others appreciate its authenticity and depth, marking it as a significant work in Scorsese's filmography.I appreciate its rich cinematography and detailed portrayal of casino operations, contrasting the glitzy facade with the brutal reality beneath. While it shares thematic elements with Goodfellas, Casino focuses more on the characters' internal struggles and the consequences of their greed and hubris in a morally ambiguous world. I also appreciate the religious theme, particularly in how it depicts the casino as a
paradise lost due to greed and moral decay In Casino; Martin Scorsese potray
themes of greed, ambition, and the brutal realities of life in Las Vegas.I can relate the movie portrayals the seductive allure of the casino environment, likening it to a paradise that ultimately leads to self-destruction. Characters like Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and Nicky Santoro exemplify how unchecked ambition and pride result in chaos and downfall. Scorsese uses religious imagery and a moral lens to illustrate that
without oversight, human vices flourish, culminating in their inevitable ruin.Lastly, the narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of living in a world
devoid of accountability. Notably, Scorsese's ""Casino"" combines realism with rich storytelling, capturing the era's ambiance while highlighting the brutal realities of organized crime and rigged
gambling. The film serves as a cautionary tale about the seductive nature of gambling, emphasizing that ""only Vegas wins in the end"" this includes on today's major problem to those are addicted with online gambling by wasting money to
win absolutely nothing. Its legacy reshapes how casinos are depicted in popular culture; blending glamour with corruption.In summary, Casino (1995), chronicles the rise and fall of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a mob-associated sports handicapper tasked with running the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas for the Chicago Outfit. Alongside him is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a violent enforcer whose reckless behavior threatens their operation. As Ace's relationship with con artist Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) deteriorates, the Mafia's influence wanes, leading to brutal consequences for Nicky and a transformation of Las Vegas into corporate-run resorts. The film reflects on the loss of the old Vegas charm as Ace returns to sports betting, lamenting the changes in the city.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great gangster movie in the Goodfellas/Godfather tradition,"Very violent, but also very entertaining. Pesci, DeNiro, and Stone are great-also the supporting players- especially Rickles and Vincent. Pesci is the great little tough guy of our generation. The movie is certainly a drama, but there are also many comic components. I like the continuing interplay across several movies between Pesci and Frank Vincent. In Raging Bull, Pesci attacks Vincent. In Goodfellas, Pesci kills Vincent and buries him. In Casino, at the end, Vincent kills Pesci with a baseball bat and then ""ships"" and buries him. I believe most people like the violence- they just don't want to admit it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

10 years in the life of Vegas...Embellished slightly.,"It's amazing how some shows tend to glamorize my adopted hometown of Las Vegas...How everyone who lives here has tons of money and the best of all indulgences under a sunny sky and neon nights. Well, ""Casino""  gives everyone a good primer on what NOT to do if you are a local.I particularly liked Rothstein's narrative on how everything is choreographed and coordinated to separate the happy tourists from their money. A little cynical, but otherwise very accurate and enlightening. Anyway, the movie is an entertaining look at the way life was out here, back in the 70's. A lot of the old-timers (some of whom knew the actual players on which ""Casino"" is based) tell me that they miss the good old days when the town was cleaner, less crowded and safer to live in. It gives a slight thrill to see the glamour and excitement, but never fails to remind us that there is a gritty and seamy side to the town. Then again, almost every American town has a ""City Confidential"" of its own. Even the real people that these characters are based on had a lot of just day-in, day out routine. Anyway...DeNiro did a great job portraying Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, even though Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal was not a particularly exciting person in real life. Joe Pesci played a very convincing Nicky Santoro, but a little more over the top than what Tony ""The Ant"" Spilotro was supposed to be like. Sharon Stone was even more compelling in her role as Ginger McKenna, because she was very accurate in her portrayal of Geri Rosenthal, Frank's beautiful but troubled wife. The timeline is a jazzed-up and high-compression version of Vegas from '73 to '83, thanks to Scorsese's action-packed touch and all-star soundtrack. I thought it was a crowning touch that most of the filming was done at the Riviera, as it is one of the classic ""old Vegas"" joints and definitely was in the same league as the Dunes and the Sands once upon a time. All in all, a great movie that tells a great story...Just remember that you have to remember that for once, fiction is a little more entertaining than truth.",,Anonymous,Crime
Another Triumph of Martin Scorsese,"I have always been fascinated by the Mafia underworld and I have admired Martin Scorsese's work since a young age. Scorsese has brought us several good gangland films, like Goodfellas in 1990 and The Departed in 2006. In between the two, he brought us Casino in 1995.Casino tells the story of Frank Rosenthal (Portayed by Robert De Niro under the name ""Sam Rothstein"") and Anthony Spilotro (Portrayed by Joe Pesci under the name of ""Nicky Santoro). The film's subject is the 1970s casino skimming the mid-western Mafia families built an empire on. The movie is basically about two hoods from Chicago who get to the top of the world, only to be dragged back to the ground.The film is a first person narrative, much like Goodfellas. It is told from Nicky Santoro and Sam Rothstein's perspectives. One of the many attracting factors is that the film is Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the novel of Casino and the novel of Goodfellas as well as being involved with both screenplays and Martin Scorsese, who directed, also wrote. The result of these two geniuses in their fields working together was a great script.The performances were also great. I believe Sharon Stone was nominating for an Oscar for her portrayal of Ginger McKenna (based on Geri McGee-Rosenthal), Sam's greedy wife. Joe Pesci, playing a similar role to what he did in Goodfellas, comes back with a vengeance as a brutal Mafia hit-man. And of course, Robert De Niro is great lead (as always), as the smart and cool Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein. The film also has a great supporting cast, including Don Rickles and Frank Vincent.All in all, Casino is a great movie. The movie is not as good as Goodfellas, but almost reaches the point to being just as good. I enjoyed both of them.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Goodfellas in Las Vegas,"Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone. Now there's a group of people with which to make a movie.Casino takes place in Las Vegas in the 70s. Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro) is sent to Vegas by the mob to run a casino for them. After a while they also send Nicky Santoro (Pesci) to keep the wheels running and to act as muscle for Rothstein. Unfortunately, these two have very different ideas on how things should be run. Ace would like nothing more than to run his casino, pay his ""honest"" dues to the mob and to just sit back and relax. Whereas Nicky wants to climb all the way to the top, no matter how many bodies he has to leave on his wake.This movie is often compared to Goodfellas, Scorsese's previous masterpiece. And I can definitely see why. We have the mob, gangsters a plenty, rags to riches themes, and even two of the same actors, although Pesci is deservedly in a much bigger role this time around.And yet Goodfellas it ain't. It's plenty good on its own merits, but it lacks that degree of identifiability a proper old time gangster film has. The 70s and Las Vegas muddle up the story, make it seem that much dirtier. Drugs flow freely, no one can be trusted and none of the main characters is at all likable. Which is most definitely the point, but it is also the reason why I prefer Goodfellas. A much better comparison mood-wise would be Scarface, although that takes an even harsher stance on the viability of the gangster lifestyle. Whereas this movie is kind of half-n-half.Still, a good movie by any measure. Well worth a watch for all fans of the gangster genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Goodfellas Pt.II, in all the right ways","The simply titled ""Casino"", one of many Scorsese/ De Niro collaborations, tells the fact-based story of Las Vegas, 1970. Many themes are present, most notably the power of money and greed. The usual suspects are here, and both De Niro and Joe Pesci fit their roles very well; De Niro the suave, level-headed thinker, and Pesci the volatile buttonman.Five minutes in, and an appropriate title popped into my head: Goodfellas Part II. All the signature aspects of that bar-setting film are present in Casino: smart-talking, wiseguy narrators, constant music in the background, constant action and furious dialogue, swearing (you won't BELIEVE some of Pesci's rants), and dripping mafia style. One thing that isn't the same though is setting: Las Vegas.The stakes here are higher, so lots about the movie has been scaled up as well. The plot is rich, with many angles. Goodfellas had a more contained story with less to explain, or it was just explained better. The first 20 minutes of Casino tell you all kinds of Vegas info very quickly. I hope you know your gambling. I don't want to say it's a fault, because it's very necessary, but it seems almost rushed. But it's not like it would affect the runtime, the film is almost 3 full hours. I'm a fan of that though, this is a bog movie with lots to tell. And because of great pacing and exciting moments, it's a 3 hour treat.The content has been elevated too. Violent and vulgar, this is not a film for kids. But it's all important. Pesci's character Nicky does most of the swearing, probably 300 or so f words from him alone, because he's always in a foul mood, which makes him unpredictable. Then there's the violence. Starting with a scene involving a pen, this is super-duper violent, showing just what people do to get what they want, or because they're crazy Nicky.If you told someone this was a Scorsese/Tarantino collaboration, they'd probably believe you. Scenes with the vice, hammer and bat are right out of the Tarantino killbook, or out of Dead Rising. They keep you on edge and are brutal.Casino takes everything about Goodfellas, minus Ray Liotta, and puts it in Vegas. Except for a confusing start that can't really be dealt with, the only reason Casino didn't enjoy the success of Goodfellas is its bland name and being released 5 years later. See Goodfellas, then see this. 8.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Wickedly entertaining,"This is one of those gangster flicks where the acting is so incredible, you actually think you may intimately know the characters...but then again, I am from New Jersey!Anyway, Pesci is by far, the best.  He portrays Nicky, a real crazy goomba with a mean attitude, and a tendency to make people dead.DeNiro...what can I say?  Awesome as usual.  Don Rickles is even in the movie.  Sharon Stone turned out one hell of a performance...and James Woods, one of my all time favorites, is just fantastic.The violence is disturbing, but not gratuitous, and highly effective in accentuating the scenes.For sheer violence and authenticity, I give it a 9.0 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Crime
Hard stuff,"Very interesting gangster type film.  As good as anything else along these lines, if not better.  It reminded me a lot of the ""Godfather"" trilogy with the language and the killings.  If you like hearing all the versions of ""f***"" about every minute or two, sometimes three times in the same sentence, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you don't mind seeing about 30 or 40 guys getting wacked in the most bloody way conventionally possible, this movie will work for you.  To be fair though, that's what this story was all about so it had to be there.  If this movie is ever on TV, it's about as big a joke as putting on ""Scarface"" on TV.

Editing cinematography soundtrack, everything was engaging. Never felt lost in the movie.Even though I enjoyed the film it had it flaws.

Took too long to get to the Las Vegas Setting and It felt like a documentary at one point. A lot of unnecessary scenes.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci duo is flawless.

Fantastic,"Martin Scorsese is and always will be a legend. With Casino, Scorsese shows us his ability to keep producing masterpiece's. His specialty is with mob-based films and with his resume including Goodfellas and Gangs of New York, Casino is right on the dot. Its a masterpiece of friendship, destruction, and betrayal. Casino takes many chances with the plot but it is wonderfully voiced-over by Ace and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci). I believe the voice-overs makes Casino interesting because it feels as if we are eavesdropping in a secret place. We hear voice-overs at the mob bosses dinners, at Ace and Ginger's (Sharon Stone) wedding, during Santoro's burglaries and multiple other occasions. This film is a must see and i definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Movie from the Mafia Machine,"De Niro is the master of long movies: ""The Godfather: Part II,"" ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" ""Heat,"" and ""Casino"" were all three hours long or longer. With the exception of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" they were all good.""Casino"" is a semi-true story about Las Vegas in general and the Tangiers Casino in particular. Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) was such a gambling savant that the east coast mafia bosses wanted him to run the casino to make them money. It was an elaborate set up that made money for everybody. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) was the muscle to protect Sam, and Ginger (Sharon Stone) was the trophy wife.But all good things come to an end. All it takes is a little greed, a little lust, a little envy and you have the necessary ingredients for a colossal crash.""Casino"" was good, and if it weren't for the bad episode of ""Days of Our Lives"" that happened between Ginger and Sam, then it would've been a lot better. I'm not a fan of watching dysfunction. If I were, then I'd watch Jerry Springer. Sam married a woman who was a hustler. A woman who reluctantly married him. A woman whose love he had to buy. If those aren't enough warning signs, then you're either blind or resigned--resigned to the fact that you'll have a life partner who you can never completely trust. It was just nerve-wracking watching them two and their dumpster fire of a marriage. If that could have been excised from the movie, then A.) it would have been much better and B.) it would've been about thirty minutes shorter. Those are two plusses in my book.Mafia movies always seem to yield positive numbers: box office bucks and reviews. ""Casino"" was one of the many successes from the machine. It had its own flavor by focusing on Las Vegas, yet it still followed the mold of other successes before it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"great film, great soundtrack","An extremely captivating movie, Casino will suck you into its world. Scorcese's films often have a subtly seducing rhythym to them, and this one is no different. I came into this one expecting a rehash of his other movies, but came away pleasantly surprised (not to mention disturbed by the ultra-violent scenes, especially a sickening scene at the end with Joe Pesci and his brother, but it's what's to be expected in these types of movies; it definitely did not detract from the movie).Great performances by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and an underrated performance by Sharon Stone, but the real star here is the terrific soundtrack, which not only adds much to the movie but is also a great listen-to on its own.",,Anonymous,Crime
Completely fascinating but graphically violent,"Caught a little piece of this on TV and had to run out and rent the widescreen version.  (Look for that edition--don't waste your time on the pan-and-scan version.)First I have to say that ""Casino"" is a striking and engrossing film, but there are several graphically violent scenes which--although they may be appropriate in the context of the movie--are completely sickening. Consider yourself warned, but don't cheat yourself out of watching a masterpiece. Just keep the remote control handy.In this film, both the camera and the soundtrack are characters in themselves.  Scorsese's lens clings lovingly to De Niro, who gives one of his best performances.  I agree with other comments that the first 40 minutes are outstanding and completely draw you in.  After setting up this universe, Scorsese literally demolishes it.  What really struck me was the haunting sense of inescapable doom the viewer feels as everything unravels right before your eyes.  I felt positively hunted by the fate that was descending on the screen.  I didn't really like ""Goodfellas,"" but this film is superior in every way.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best mob movies I've ever seen,"A fascinating look at the corruption and violence that lurked behind the glamorous facade of Las Vegas in the 1970s and 1980s. Robert DeNiro is completely believable as casino operator Sam Rothstein, and Joe Pesci delivers a frightening performance as the psychotic Nicky Santoro. With great attention to detail, great historical accuracy, and graphic realism that will make all but the most hardened movie- goers cringe, Scorcese delivers a full- throttle look at the mafia in Sin City before their fall in the mid- 80s. Definitely worth your time, if you can handle brutally realistic violence and non- stop profanity. The only thing that prevents this from getting a 10 out of 10 in my books is the fact that I personally found the character of Ginger, Rothstein's wife, to be slightly too prevalent, and to have received too much screen time. Still, that's all I can think of to complain about in this well- crafted, brilliant movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Much like Goodfellas however, Casino is the memorable one.","Casino is not really much remembered by many people but for those who are Martin Scorsese, they'll know what to get from this. It has the same cast from GoodFellas, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci but I still can't believe that I haven't seen Raging Bull which I really want to. And I think they both starred in Once Upon a Time in America and I've heard that it's a really long film. With Robert De Niro's last collaboration between Martin Scorsese, this film is based on true events of what happened in Las Vegas, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci played Sam Rothstein, aka ""Ace"" and Nicholas Santoro, aka ""Nicky"", They're both childhood friends in real-life. It's kind of an interesting story about those two friends are getting a lot of heat on Las Vegas of who's going to run the Casino. I really like this movie even though it is very similar to GoodFellas with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci narrating but what can I say, there's nothing wrong with that and this is a phenomenal film with great performances and story and it has some good tunes in it. I am a fan gangster flicks and anything else and that's that.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterpiece,"I see this as a quasi-sequel to ""Goodfellas"", where we followed the life of a newcomer to the mafia and crime. In this movie, we start already with the characters in a crime world, and the movie changes setting to Las Vegas, where in the 50's and 60's the Casinos where ruled by an ellaborate web of bosses and dirty businesses. The police tried to stop it, but it was their money which was bringing the city to life. De Niro is great, as usual, Pesci is a show-stealer, and Stone, a novelty in Scorsese's work (as Ray Liotta was in ""Godfellas""), has a much-earned oscar nomination in the role of an empty woman whose path leads to decay. Scorsese's direction is fantastic (I recommend this as an introduction to his work), flamboyant and lusty as it has always been, and this is to me one of his best works. See it and marvel at it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese Bring Us the Tale of Vegas Mobsters in the 1970s","Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" is an often overlooked chapter in his storied filmography, and I personally feel this is for good reason. When people talk about Scorsese, they usually like to talk about ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Goodfellas."" And ""Casino"" draws a few too many parallels with ""Goodfellas"", in my opinion. Both films are told with a past-tense, first person narration of the main character(s) lives. Both chronicle the rise and fall of criminals caught up in the Italian mob. Both have excellent leading performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (no Ray Liotta this time around), who basically play the same archetypes that they did in that previous film. Both are adaptations of books, which were actually (loosely) based on real events. ""Casino"" also had the misfortune of being released a mere five years after ""Goodfellas"", which I consider to be one of the greatest mob movies of all time. While this film is by no means a bad one, it certainly does not tell the most interesting or original tale. It's a hard thing, even for a director as seasoned and revered as Scorsese, to strike lightning twice within that short amount of time with what is essentially the same film retold with a twist.""Casino"" is the story of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro), a Jewish sports and card gambler who works his way into becoming the floor manager of a Las Vegas casino; his best friend Nicky Santoro (Pesci), a hot-headed associate in the mafia who is sent to Vegas to take care of the dirty work; and Ace's wife, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), a former chip hustler who marries Ace for his wealth and valuable jewelry. The movie borrows the flashback style of ""Goodfellas"", as De Niro and Pesci frequently pipe in with comments and explanation about what's going on. Again, that worked all well and good in ""Goodfellas"", but in this one, that kind of storytelling seems to kind of get in the way of characterization and the foundation of a distinct and followable plot line. I know that both movies were based on books, where talking in the first person is literally how you tell the story, but I would much rather have been shown some of the things that we were told by the leading characters through narration. This movie just has way too much of it, and way too often. By the time if feels like we get comfortable with a scene, we are whisked away again and given an exposition dump.I also believe that it worked better in the previous movie as it told a long-term narrative, spanning decades. The plot of ""Casino"" only takes up a timeline of around five years. The first hour or so is dedicated to introducing us with the nitty-gritty operations of Ace's casino, the relationship that Ace has with Nicky and Ginger, and with some of the main players involved in this criminal underworld. After this, we turn to Ace's legal and PR battle with the state gambling commission, who end up denying him a gaming license needed to continue operating and growing his casino. Ace and Nicky then both make a little too much noise for themselves, much to the displeasure of the mob bosses. The movie shifts focus again in the final act, with the three main characters' relationships to each other gradually deteriorating and falling apart.""Casino"" just seems to lack the oomph that Scorsese packed with some of his other work. I'm making a lot of comparisons with this film to ""Goodfellas"", but I really do see this as just an inferior version of that masterpiece. I felt a lot more engaged with the plot in that one; there seemed to be a clear moral message as the greed, danger, and paranoia of the mob life tore Henry Hill apart and caused him to slowly lose grip on reality. In ""Casino"", Ace is never the one at fault for anything. He's always taking the heat because of someone else's mistakes. I'm not saying that every film of this nature needs to be melded with some kind of a message or chronically flawed characters, but I don't find Ace that compelling or interesting. The movie is based on real life gangster Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal. Apparently this movie is considered much more historically accurate than ""Goodfellas"", which took a lot of liberties with the stories that it was based off of. Adherence to historical fact may work better in a documentary film, but this is a Hollywood crime drama.Comparisons with ""Goodfellas"" aside, this is still a really good movie that I definitely recommend sitting down and watching. I personally wouldn't put this on a list of ""must see movies"" or anything, but it does work very well as a crime epic, and it will definitely help satiate the hunger of a mob movie fan who may be sick of watching ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"" on repeat. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci give terrific performances as always, the costumes and sets do a really good job of transporting the viewer to 1970s Las Vegas, and Scorsese's uses of the tracking shot while De Niro and Pesci narrate are very visually pleasing. Scorsese chose to go with radio hits for this film's soundtrack again, which also really lend to the time period (although I personally hate the choice of the Devo cover of The Rolling Stones' ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction""). In all, ""Casino"" is too technically impressive for me to feel justified giving it a score of 8, but this is a low 9 for me. I did enjoy watching it, but it does have its flaws, it's not a masterpiece, and it also just feels like it's way too derivative of Scorsese's earlier work.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of the worst films by Martin Scorsese,"I am not the biggest fan of Martin Scorsese at all, in fact, I don't like him and I think he is a tad overrated, and this film is a proof of why I think that way about him. It's a bad film that no supposedly 'great' director would do.It's a film moved by nothing. Seriously, there is no point to make that film. It looks like a worsened version of Goodfellas, that frankly also wasn't that great. There is the crazy Joe Pesci yelling and killing people and the quiet and conscious but also despicable Robert DeNiro. In fact, it can be considered a reprise of their roles. But unlike Goodfellas, that has an intelligent narration an is so over the top that you even laugh at some scenes, Casino has no redeem value or whats or ever. Is a mess. It's so predictable and so repetitive. Why should I spent three hours of my time to see things that were not only made before a lot of times, but made way better before, after all? It is not worthy watching at all. Not mentioning the fact that the film is ugly as hell, it has no art value and it looks like those low budget films made in the 70s. Total fiasco.The music was great, oh yeah, some great stuff on it. But it was all over the place. I merely believe how bad the music was on this film. But if the music was that bad it was because of the editing. One of the worst that I've ever seen in a 'big' film. Seriously, who are the editors of this film? What a lazy work. What they are thinking? I mean, what they are thinking? And the art direction was so tasteless, it looks like *rap. Sorry for the swearing, but it is literally what I meant to say. I know that the intention of the sparkling colors in the ambient was to make the bandits looks even more extravagant and repugnant than they already were, but it couldn't have been done in a better way? Well, I totally think so. I'm not even bothered by the horrible and senseless script, since that there is things much worse than that in the film. Anyway, it succeeds in passing the intended message, that is to show how dirty and how works the casino's world, but the rest, is a mess. The only good thing about it was Sharon Stone, that was by far the best actress in the film. 4.5/10",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Builders and Losers of Tinsel Town,"What if you had all your wishes come true and then lost everything? Casino winds its way through a rags to riches to rags story better than any movie I have seen. It is a dream becoming a nightmare.In some ways Casino is better than Goodfellas and in others it is similar. This similarity could be seen as a drawback but for me Casino is the sequel to Goodfellas. Both are based on true stories about the mob written by Nicholas Pileggi and are an achievement that can only be compared in quality to The Godfather 1 and 2.The magnificent opening of Casino shows Martin Scorsese using a more grand style. The wide open vistas of the desert are contrasted with the neon world of the gambler and the old neighborhood of the mob bosses. Robert De Niro is very effective in being the ""rational"" one who pleads that if everybody just follows the ""rules"" they would all be winners. His irrational equal (including in acting ability) is Sharon Stone who will not be tamed and helps to bring the whole house of cards down. In the Godfather films and in Goodfellas there are winners as well as losers. Casino is about losing it all.I felt Pesci's limitations were shown in the ""romantic"" scenes between him and Stone. Still, I can't think of anyone else who can do a better job playing a ruthless thug. And this drawback was more than made up by the excellent James Woods as the slimy boyfriend. Great stuff.Casino juggles success, corruption, vicious violence and farce in a broad sweep that never fails to impress. It's tale of destruction in some ways leads to sympathy.

There's a lot of holes in the desert...,"Simply one of the best gangster films out there with an excellent ""true"" story yet strangely underrated. Casino is a masterpiece of a mob film from Martin Scorsese, and in my opinion better than the well received Goodfellas...and I don't know if I could tell you why, that's just the way I feel. There are many obvious similarities since they're both created by Scorsese, both have DeNiro and Pesci, and in both the s*** hits the fan in the end. They are frequently compared in reviews so I'll say, for the record, that I enjoy Casino much more. I think most of the reason Goodfellas is rated higher is because it came out first and some people see Casino as a rehash. I do not care about that myself, they're both great films.I've seen this film over a dozen times and it still has yet to get old. It's filmed beautifully and the music seems to fit the time periods and helps to establish the overall environment of it all, as it should. DeNiro and Pesci were conceived by God himself to play their parts in films like these and are always a joy to watch. Sharon Stone as Ginger is a definite standout. I honestly didn't know she could act until she was in this movie. She portrays the drug addicted ex-call girl turned wife of Sam Rothstein, the mob friendly casino boss. The film is quite violent and some denounce it for being gratuitous as if the mob goes by the same standard. It's just a movie and if you enjoy watching films in the same genre, then it shouldn't be too much to handle. The language is also fairly harsh, mostly from Nicky (Pesci), but it helps give it a gangster feel. Plus, it doesn't help that there's so much voice over in the film, which is were a lot of the profanity comes from. That's just how mob guys talk, come on now. Didn't you know? All of the wise guys that I know do the same. Even though many consider voice overs a cop-out in filmmaking, I honestly can't imagine the movie any other way. It definitely works and at least it's not Ray Liotta's voice.As previously mentioned, the cinematography is beautiful, all that panning and sweeping...love it, and it works. I particularly enjoy the opening sequence in which the operations of the casino are explained.......also the intro to the meeting in the desert where the camera focuses on Sam's sunglasses as Nicky drives madly across in the reflection, stirring up a storm of sand. Simple, but great.Even more interesting are the true parts of the story. I did some research and the film does mix and match some things around, but for the most part it is true. In actuality, the true story was much crazier and it involved the skimming of four casinos, not just one, one of which was the Stardust....all were ran by the real Sam Rothstein, Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal. And yes, the character that is supposed to be Nicky (Tony ""The Ant"") really did do what he did in the movie with a vise. The fact that it's based on a true story does make it a little more enjoyable to me, especially since it's pretty damn close.What it all boils down to is one of my favorite films that I've seen, and one of the best mob movies ever...just like Goodfellas. I think most just don't give it a fair chance. Had Casino been released first, I think it very well could replace GF in the Top 250. Some will hate me for saying this, but when it comes to this category of films, Casino is only second to the Godfather films. Now watch my body turn up in a cornfield.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is not about a Las Vegas gambling house,I have never been a great follower of Martin Scorcese and I have never bothered to find out the reasons for which his films are admired both by critics as well as cinema lovers.All that I know is that the themes of his films are different and that he gives a so called specific Martin Scorcese touch to them.Casino is a bit long film for its 180 minutes duration.Sometimes it seems like a documentary about gambling industry.Acting performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are OK.Sharon Stone's acting performances are plain bad and sometimes it appears as if she is having a tough time giving a decent acting performance.Message of the film is still not clear to me as Scorcese has neither painted a glorious portray of casino industry nor does he appear to have a critical stance against gambling as a vice ?

The delivered performance by the actors, the perfect shooting locations and the wonderful directing by Scorsese makes it a true Oscar dramatic film. Robert De Niro portrays Sam ""Ace"" Rosthein, a powerful casino owner determined to run his Tangiers casino as smoothly as possible. He meets Ginger McKenna, a passionate high roller whom he gets infatuated with at first sight and is also faced with a threat; Nicky Santoro, his childhood friend and a violent man. As the Mafia game rolls, Ace plays by the rules but Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat and try to scramble their way to the top. Slowly, bit by bit, the mob starts to fall apart and the FBI gets aware of everything that goes on. A brilliant film based on a true story. Sharon Stone won a Golden Globe for best actress. It also happens to be Martin Scorsese's last collaboration with Robert De Niro with Scorsese as a director.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great mobster movie,"This movie didn't get much notice when it came out, but it's evidence that Hollywood can still put out great work. The filming and editing are superb. All of the veteran actors, with Robert de Niro as the lead, are at the highest standard. This movie will probably also be remembered as Sharon Stone's best roll. Casino has a lot of graphic violence, so it's not be for everyone. A guy movie, but an intelligent one.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Star-Studded but Slow,"Despite its stellar cast and strong critical acclaim, Casino (1995) ultimately fell short for me. With iconic actors like Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci, I had high expectations going into the film. However, its slow pacing and overly long scenes made it difficult to stay engaged throughout.While the movie certainly shines in terms of performances-particularly Sharon Stone, whose portrayal of a troubled woman is impressive-the overall flow felt sluggish. The story, centered around the inner workings of Las Vegas casinos and the mob's involvement, is rich in detail, but it often gets bogged down by drawn-out sequences that detract from the tension and excitement.In conclusion, despite its big-name stars and high production value, Casino didn't deliver the gripping, fast-paced story I was hoping for. For me, the film moved too slowly and lacked the tight, engaging structure of other crime dramas.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorcese's Post 1990s work is grossly underrated,"Martin Scorcese - the film's director - is known for directing some excellent movies. MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL have been great successes and Scorcese's start into the organized crime genre commenced with a loud bang with the box office success GOODFELLAS (1990). However, I believe it is Scorcese's post-Goodfella's work that he should be commended for - excellent movies such as CAPE FEAR (1991), CASINO (1995) and GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) have gone wholly unnoticed. While receiving 10 Academy Award nominations, GANGS OF NEW YORK didn't receive one and CAPE FEAR and CASINO were blatantly disregarded by the Academy - a gross oversight and disappointment to all Scorcese fans. IMDb users have also chosen not to put CASINO on its top 250 list - another blow to this wonderful film.CASINO revolves around an ex-criminal Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro). Rothstein is the successful - albeit corrupt - owner of an illegally run casino in Las Vegas. Rothstein is running the casino successfully and without many hitches.Enter two big obstacles in the form of call girl Ginger (Sharon Stone)and psychotic friend (sort of like Tommy DeVito in GOODFELLAS) Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein marry's the irresistible Ginger and Nicky starts up a brutal mafia racket in Las Vegas, leading to the slow destruction of Rothstein and his empire.CASINO was brilliant. Supported by excellent acting and masterful direction, this film is one which must not be missed. Scorcese's Vegas is violent, sexy and, in parts, appealing and this three hour epic portrays this very well. CASINO is a not-to-be-missed gangster film that you cannot fully grasp without seeing it twice. However, I ask this of all IMDb users who love this film: GET IT UP TO THE TOP 250!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
There is no prosperity dealing with haram,"The lesson to be drawn from the film is briefly; There is no prosperity dealing with haram. Those who deal with dirty work like gambling, interest, alcoholic beverages, drugs, manslaughter can never live a beautiful and happy life. They don't have a regular family life. They cannot raise their children well, and their child's psychology and life are ruined just like their own life.You can also see how they legally rob people in a filthy city like Las Vegas in the movie. You can see how the city of sins like Las Vegas ends people's lives. You can also realize that the gambler always wins, that no one can earn money by gambling, even if you make a lot of money in gambling, that money will be taken from you before you leave the casino, so it is empty business to deal with forbidden jobs like gambling.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Usual Scorsese explosive violence - Sharon Stone and James Woods excel,"I'll write a review here though in fairness I'm not a fan of Scorsese's movies though he seems like an OK guy.

Very good,Casino's better than Goodfellas. Why? It's got everything Goodfellas has and more. De Niro is so brimming with emotion. Robert Richardson's photography is sensational. Martin Scorsese is a genius. De Niro's character is more complex and likable than the one he played in Goodfellas. And Sharon Stone proves she's a real actor. It's a more emotional film than Goodfellas. The main characters are more sympathetic somehow. And James Woods is a great addition. It's good entertainment. Casino's long but the 3 hours goes quickly. Casino's a great movie. Enough said.,,Anonymous,Crime
No one did stay at the top.,"The fact that I believe that Scorsese and De Niro make a great pair might lead some people to think that I started watching this movie with the idea that it was going to be good, in other words, that I had a certain assurance that it was good.  Well I didn't.  However, I could have had one and the movie would still have reached my expectations.  I thought it was absolutely brilliant with some funny scenes and some great acting.The movie talks about, as it says in the title, a casino.  But it's not just a casino.  It's THE casino ran by Sam ""ACE"" Rothstein (De Niro).  Ace is the best football handicapper in the country but is so good that you could say he cheats when he bets.  Plus he never bets unless he is sure to win.  But in Las Vegas, running a casino requires help.  So his bosses in Kansas City send down one f his best friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), to watch his back.  As usual, Pesci plays a rather crazy character who seems to be particularly fond of being a gangster.In Vegas, Ace marries Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and complicates his life by doing so.  Sharon Stone is incredibly brilliant in her Oscar-nominated role as the woman who begins the whole catastrophe and is as beautiful as ever.  However, things between Ace, Ginger and Nicky spice up and lead to disasters and multiple murders.""Casino"" is one of the best Scorsese-De Niro movies.  The script by Nicholas Pileggi is as good as the one he wrote for ""Goodfellas"".  It's excellent.  Now enough said.  It's up to you to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent crime drama,"In Martin Scorsece's hit ""mafia"" film, depicting the rise and fall of group of mobsters in Las Vegas. Rob Deniro and Joe Peschi give top notch performances as the lead mobsters running the Tangiers casino in Vegas. In the first half we are shown how Deniro's character tightly operates his casino. He knows all the tricks in the books that hustlers try to pull, however noone can pull a one up on this guy. Peschi is his hitman who does most of the dirty work, but is eventually banned from all casinos. Turning in a fiery, top notch (Oscar nomination) performance is Sharon Stone as a drug hustler who enchants Deniro one day as she shows up at the casino. They marry and he hopes to ""make"" him fall in love with her one day, because her true love is a pimp (played by James Wood). Needless to say the last hour or so of this movie is vicious as we see the FBI crackdown on all the schemes the mobsters were trying so hard to hide in the casinos. Stone and Peschi, in particular have brutal demises. 9.3/10 extreme profanity, violence, and partial nudity. Excellent acting, direction, plot, and soundtrack. Only down side is the length of the movie, running well into above 3 1/2 hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
a stunning epic,"It usually takes a decade or more for people to wise up to to a Scorsese film, and notice how brilliant it really is...just witness all the sneering comments being made about Gangs and Aviator. When Casino came out, its only high profile defender was Ebert. Most of the other critics, and not just the usual suspects( such as a certain hack whose initials are M.M).thought it was just an knock off of Goodfellas. This is , to put it bluntly, absurd. This film is one of the three or four greatest organized crime epics.The texture, the rhythm, the pace, the color, and the horror of Las Vegas are captured with bold brush strokes.The costumes, the music, the editing, the cinematography..all are brilliant. I will comment on the acting... Robert De Niro portrays someone hes never portrayed before in a Scorsese film..a cool headed, calculating near genius.His Achilles heel is his pride in his intelligence. He cannot imagine that he can make a mistake, and it leads to his fall. Joe Pesci offers a better performance than in Goodfelllas, because his character has more screen time and is far more complex. Yes..he is a violent, destructive man. He also imagines himself to be extremely loyal, a good family man, etc. Note how reluctant he is to torture the guy using the vise..its just that he knows that if he doesn't, HIS head will be in the vise.Note the weird grace notes , like combing the hair of the woman he shoots. Finally, Sharon Stone.This is a woman who who is pitifully weak and confused, for all her outward bravado. James Woods (a stunning portrayal) plays her like a Stradivarius.). The last shot of Ms. Stone in the movie(I will not give it away)is terrifying-and pitiful. every performance in this movie,from the biggest star turn to the smallest cameo,is dazzling..the use of Stardust at the end is brilliant. This is a fabulous film, which will-eventually be seen as a great one.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Shiny, but not without a few nicks","In 1990, Martin Scorsese unleashed Nicholas Pileggi's hard boiled docu book to the cinema. After viewing it for the first time, I knew than and I am still confident today in 2009, Goodfellas is one of the finest motion pictures that will ever be made, let alone the best gangster movie of them all.Having read the Pileggi book prior to seeing the film, I was surprised how well the writer and director translated the source material. Casino is probably the best Vegas movie you'll see. I'd call Fear and Loathing a close second. Leaving Las Vegas, to me, was well acted, but boring and overly ""arty.""So yeah Casino is a slick piece of craft. Slick cinematography, slick design, slick acting. But the heart and soul we'd find in Goodfellas is clearly missing from this take. The mechanisms of greed, the procedures of skimming are fascinatingly and warmly documented here, but the people are just not very interesting. There is a good 45 minutes of human drama about humans we don't give a shi*t about.But the good in Casino is so good, we forget about the thin characterizations. We forget its too long, we forget, at least a little, Sharon Stone is the only miscast part. Sure its got a few spots, but this one is still pretty bright to watch, even nearly 15 years on.You have to hand it to Scorsese. Even his crappy movies are damned good.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stop comparing it to GoodFellas!,"Casino is an excellent film that stands on its own two feet.GoodFellas was also an excellent film. Both are about the moband both star De Niro and Pesci and are directed by Scorsese andwritten by Pelligi. That's about the extent of the similarities.To quote Roger Ebert, Casino is not just concerned with itscharacters but with history. This is historical fiction. This movietakes you inside Las Vegas. This movie knows.In the end, it may not be as appealing or popular as GoodFellas.But it isn't fare to call it an imitation because it deals withsomething completely different.This movie is worth seeing. De Niro, as always, is flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese makes fresh an old trick,"It would be easy to forget Martin Scorsese's Casino, or to dismiss it as derivative from his previous works like Goodfellas. But in my honest opinion as a moviegoer, that would be a horrendous mistake. I had more fun with Casino than I have had with every Scorsese movie except Taxi Driver.Casino extends for almost three hours, but unlike Gangs of New York, it doesn't sprawl - every scene is necessary, interesting and well-done, from the first to the last. A great deal of Casino is exposition, but its good exposition - and enough interesting stuff happens during it that it is still a lot of fun to watch.The most distinctive element about Casino is the casting of Sharon Stone. She is simply superb as Ginger, with a remarkable range displayed throughout the film. Her debut scene is cheeky and flirtatious, and I was as hooked on her as DeNiro was. Throughout the film, she convincingly descends into alcoholism and substance abuse, and she more than holds her own in her many screaming fights with DeNiro.Casino reunites a lot of the elements of previous Scorsese films, as well as a lot of the elements, but it manages to bring a lot of fresh material to the table. The voice-over doesn't get distracting, and I loved in the final scene where Pesci's gets cut off just as Nicky's fate is revealed to the audience. Its almost as if the narration is coming from the future, and the future dies the second the hit men lay hands on him. The tracking shots, freeze frames and excessive violence are all here, but he uses them for a reason - because they're effective.The interesting element of the DeNiro/Pesci/Scorsese partnership is that between this film, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, the combination is always shaken up. In Raging Bull, DeNiro is the dominant to Pesci's submissive. In Goodfellas, they were more equal. Here, Pesci completely runs over DeNiro. The two guys are capable of such great things and are convincing no matter what side of the partnership they are on. As I already said, Pesci is brilliantly belligerent, exuding power and arrogance far exceeding his performance in Goodfellas. There are subtle changes in their performances, but ones that bring a whole new dynamic to Casino. One of the most important things I felt was the total dominance he had over his lovers - he would kiss them once and then force them to perform oral sex. He is in charge.DeNiro gives a very under-appreciated performance here as Ace, because its so refreshing to see DeNiro claw for his power and not be 100% in control at all times. I also really bought his love for Ginger - Scorsese wisely refrains from his protagonist's usual womanising ways in developing Ace, and as a result, it brings a lot to his personality. It made their love story so tragic.Casino's screenplay really should have been nominated for an Oscar. It helps a 3 hour film remain thoroughly engaging. It is packed full of killer dialogue, wicked insults and eventful story archs. I loved every moment of the relationship between Ginger and Ace, and I loved the fights between Pesci and DeNiro. I loved the exposition about the FBI tracking Pesci. I loved the running of the casino scenes and the voice-over. My favourite line in the whole movie was the ""holes in the desert"" surrounding Vegas explanation. It was so well done, and I'd never thought of it before.I loved Casino. I could easily watch it again and not get sick of it. DeNiro and Pesci and Scorsese work fresh takes into old moves, and Sharon Stone and the screenplay are simply amazing. Any Scorsese fan, put this on your to see list far far above his more famous The Aviator, Gangs of New York or The Departed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ridiculous over reliance in voice over,"This is ridiculous. At the 35 minutes mark I was waiting for ""the movie to start"". I really and honestly was waiting for the voice over to stop explaining people's motivations and connections with each other and feelings and risks and problems and desires. Jesus Christ. And even if it went away a bit after that mark, it never completely disappeared. It is the laziest trick to tell a story.If it was needed to tell the complete story in 3 hours, then this story should've been a ""two parts"" or a trilogy, without any voice-over whatsoever. I can understand this in fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings, but in a gritty and realistic story? Lame.Also the miscast of De Niro. His character was annoyingly passive and nerdy. He just doesn't give that vibe. Not even close. Awful casting choice.
Also, no matter how awful your characters are, you should find a way to make them entertaining to see. Joe Pesci did that. But De Niro and Stone failed.
I was bored and annoyed by the voice over, and with time, I was bored and annoyed at the characters. I honestly couldn't care less about anything.Good ""based on a real story"" movies tend to make you want to find out exactly what happened after watching them. I couldn't care less about this ""Las Vegas"" incident after ""Casino"". It's not bad, but it is close.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the Best Movies From My Favorite Director.,"Casino is often hailed as one of Martin Scorsese's best movies, and rightfully so. I first saw it when I was 16, but now 6 years have passed and I admire it more. Not only is it one of my favorite Scorsese movies, but it is one of my favorite movies of all time.The plot follows Robert De Niro as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a Mobster who runs a casino. While he gets rich and powerful, his closest friend Nicky(played by Joe Pesci) and his gold digging wife Ginger(played by Sharon Stone) try to take over, and this leads to everyone's fall.Many elements of Casino justify it as one of Scorsese's finest works. For instance, the main actors-De Niro, Pesci, and Stone- all give some of their greatest performances in the movie.My personal favorite is Joe Pesci as Nicky, playing the ultimate villian in the movie. He's someone to fear, and that is very effective. In one scene, a casino guest insults Nicky, and in response to this he brutally stabs him in the throat with a writing pen!In another scene, Nicky tortures a guy for 2 days and nights to get some information out of him. His last resort is a vice tool to nearly squish his head in. His violent behavior bites him back in the end, but I won't spoil that for you. This is easily Scorsese's most brutal film, and that works to it's advantage.Sharon Stone looks lovely, but it's clear from the moment we meet her that she has an ugly heart. When she and Ace meet, he showers her with wads of cash and mountains of gold jewelry. Her alcoholism and smoking is another story. Ace eventually sees right through her, but removing her from his life proves to be an uneasy task.Then there is Robert De Niro, in his 8th and final role with Scorsese, that is- until The Irishman. His role as Ace marks one of the best in his career-his whole career, not just with Scorsese. He's a tough guy filled with greed, and he plays both characteristics very well.Apart from the acting. Casino has some of the best cinematography to come out of a Scorsese movie, up there with The Age of Innocence. In fact, Saul and Elaine Bass did the gorgeous opening title sequence, just like they had done for Age.Casino is also paced quite well. Even though the movie is a couple minutes shy of 3 hours long, the time goes by very quickly. If you checked the time stamp and you were an hour into it, you would wonder where the time went.For it's acting, cinematography, directing and other marvelous reasons, Casino truly is one of Scorsese's best movies. Those who love his work- or crime movies in general- should invest the time to see it. Casino is a gamble that is well worth the shot.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Raging Bull....Goodfellas....,"Definite Niche of Marty, and I'd give this a 7.6.However there were two problems for me (I still have them).The way the DeNiro character is introduced, conducts himself, and operates the arrangement he makes with Sharon Stone makes absolutely no sense to me. Not just getting married to her- but a former hustler for high rolling guests he decides is his fail safe person he can trust?The story flows but despite physical attraction he was not presented as someone or the type of man that would let himself be used and manipulated.The other is common but always has a unique aspect. If there's no time in the story to explore Stone's obsession with former Pimp a very sleazy James Woods the way he was presented...he's not some magnetic made guy who ran girls...if anything her new ""pimp"" is DeNiro.Otherwise another out of the park for Marty.I just wished he stuck with his real life based movies...as opposed to ""The King of Comedy""or ""The Age of innocence"" snore fest.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
***** out of 5,"This movie gains five stars because it is nothing less than perfection. Robert De Niro is at his personal best as he give a white hot performance that could melt the varnish right off you kitchen table. Never has a man delivered his lines with such power and personal angst as this man, he is truley one of the most gifted actors on the planet. But it is not De Niro himself he is also giving an amazing script by Nicholas Pileggi, the same man who brough us Goodfellas and one of Americans greatest directors of all time Martin Scorsese. Joe Pesci is also fantastic as a violent mobster who is like a walking time bomb. Sharen Stone and James Woods are also in top form as well. It is the three hour plus story of the owner of one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. We go through his ups and downs of life and his business. This is by far one of the grestest movies ever made and I am shocked at how even though it is over three hours long it never becomes boring and in fact even blinking might make you miss to much of this amazing gritty and very powerful drama. I have also found that out of all the actors De Niro is one of the only people who actually make swearing sound cool and you better believe there is a never ending stream of it here. If you like Goodfellas this movie is not to be missed since it follows the same basic formal just on a much larger scale. Not to be missed at any cost",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great Story, Great Cast, Perfect Picture","Casino is an underrated film that sits in the shadow of other Scorsese greats like Goodfellas.  However, I honestly think this is Scorsese's best picture.  It has the best ensemble cast out of all his films, and each character is opened up more than in Goodfellas.  Sharon Stone's role is amazing and very enjoyable to watch... Pesci is his same great self... and De Niro shows us once again why he is the best actor of the last few decades.  I found that this story was very engaging and the insight it offered behind Las Vegas, crime, and casinos was very interesting.  The direction of this movie is superb... each scene carries emotion and brilliance.  I truly believe this movie deserves to earn a much higher IMDB rating.  It deserves to be among the top 250 movies, if not much higher. In fact, along with Pulp Fiction and American Beauty, Casino is among my 3 favorite dramas ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An excellent gangster film!---9/10,"After seeing this and Goodfellas i have come to a theory: All movies should star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. These two geniuses can turn any movie into a masterpiece. They can make you laugh and cry pretty much at the same time. The film follows Ace Rothstien (De Niro) when he gets the biggest prize a gambler can get: his own casino. Of course he has to pay the mobsters who gave it to them. He also has to deal with the violent and costly exploits of his friend Nicky (Pesci). Joe Pesci again perfects the loud mouth loose cannon character as he did in Goodfellas, but i think here he was given a more important part. Robert De Niro can not fail. You can see the stress and anger in his eyes in this film. Martin Scorsese is the world's greatest director. Screw the Academy. He should have won the best director Oscar several times by now. I would love to see him do more work with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This is a classic gangster picture that is always compared to Goodfellas.

"a Joe Pesci vehicle also starring De Niro with an absurd amount of talking and narration, but impressively acted and filmed","There's no denying this is a great movie. It's a crime epic, frankly, but while I'm being honest I will say that it takes well over half an hour for anything to really ""happen."" That said, for me, the real pull in this Scorsese ""classic"" is undeniably Joe Pesci. When compared to Goodfellas, I'd choose Goodfellas over Casino every day, but even in that film Pesci was a favorite. In Casino he has more room to shine, and he delivers a disturbingly great performance beginning to end. This isn't to say that De Niro and others aren't superb; De Niro really excels in the last hour. It's such a cohesive movie, inspired by real events too, that it often feels like a documentary. Which I think is probably the biggest compliment one could give a movie and its actors. My main gripe is the heavy narration in the first two hours and the length. It often felt like a lot of the script was repeating itself, especially in the first act. At three hours and very little ""action"" within the first two, but enough talking to give you a headache, I couldn't wait for the third to be over...but that's when the movie really gets going. Knowing about all the improvisation throughout the movie, especially between De Niro and Pesci, and James Woods, made me respect the acting even more.

"""For guys like us, Las Vegas washes away our sins. It's like a morality car wash""","Perhaps proving the theory of cinema bringing to life the dark desires audience members dare not act out, the American film industry and audiences alike have always demonstrated a perverse fascination with the crime epic - films detailing the illustrious life of those prospering off a life of breaching conventional codes of ethics. Such is a theme that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese has returned to time and time again: demonstrating the pros and cons of a life lived on the other side of the law. And while Scorsese's mob classic Goodfellas charted the rise of a lowly hood through the ranks of the mob, Casino details the contrary: a life of luxury at the top of the mob, the consumption of man's soul by greed, betrayal and maddening violence, and the inevitable plummet which ensues.Although comparisons to Goodfellas may prove inevitable, (given the similar subject matter, stylistic narrative and cinematic techniques, use of brutal violence and even the re-use of actors De Niro and Pesci) to fail to recognize the staggering accomplishment that is Casino, similarities or not, would be unforgivable. Ultimately the two are entirely different animals, as Casino, despite its glitzy exterior, demonstrates a distinctly darker storyline throughout, as its meticulously constructed, precariously balanced criminal organization begins to be torn apart from the foundations, with cataclysmic outcomes. The script, written by Nicholas Pileggi (working from his own source novel) and Scorsese himself is a fiercely memorable piece of work, punctuated with harshly realistic characters and scenarios, and a slew of maliciously well crafted lines. Although De Niro and Pesci's dual voiceovers can be slightly distracting, leading one to believe that the film might have benefited from the elimination of the Pesci voice-over all together, they do provide intriguing contrasting sides of the same story, and one can hardly fault the writers for experimenting.The legendary Scorsese is operating at the top of his game here, bringing all of his trademark meticulous professionalism to play with devastatingly effective results. By moving his film along at a steady, blistering pace, yet still taking his time, allowing his characters to slowly unfold throughout and giving the audience plenty of time to drink in the seductive yet tainted luxury of the lifestyles of high profile casino officials, Scorsese uses his film's hefty duration to his advantage, immersing the audience within his story in a truly peerless fashion. With typically superb neo-noir style cinematography (with many lengthy sweeping shots, capturing the breadth of the casino in all of its hedonistic glory) and editing, and enormously well complimented by one of his patented soundtrack amalgamations, Scorsese's work similarly excels on a technical front, making for a supremely impressive piece of film-making.As per usual, Scorsese extracts riveting intensity and realism from his cast, with captivating results. Robert De Niro inhabits the role of casino owner Sam 'Ace' Rothstein with a masterful conviction and charisma, dispelling all fears of him coasting by on such an admittably familiar role. Joe Pesci runs the risk of being forever typecast in a role only a shade away from his performance in Goodfellas, but fiercely proves his peerless status in inhabiting psychopathic loose-cannon mobsters. Sharon Stone delivers a surprisingly powerful performance as Rothstein's endlessly greedy drug-addict trophy wife, entirely believable as her character arcs from smoothly manipulative to dizzyingly cocaine-addled and truly pathetic. Don Rickles is a charming presence as Rothstein's right hand man in the casino, and Frank Vincent gives a strong performance as a suspicious fellow member of the mob. James Woods proves grotesquely memorable as Stone's past pimp boyfriend, and Woods shines in his few scenes, chewing the scenery with disconcerting aplomb. Kevin Pollack also impresses as a smooth talking ""front man"" for the more sinister undertones of the casino.Brutally intense and endlessly fascinating, Scorsese's crime epic delivers a sufficiently flooring clout to easily merit distinction from Goodfellas' shadow. A masterclass of brilliant writing, blistering acting and disturbingly realistic thematic content, Casino proves another towering accomplishment from the incomparable Scorsese, one worth seeing by any in search of searingly powerful and impeccably crafted film-making.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Because no matter how much money is gained, the characters always want more, and they resort to acts of unspeakable cruelty to keep the money flowing, for themselves and their mob bosses back in Chicago who are financing the casino scheme.This is possibly Scorcese's most disturbing and violent film. The characters are compelling but none are particularly sympathetic. Rothstein, perfectly suited to actor Robert De Niro, seems the only character to at least have some kind of sensible code. But even he is not above resorting to acts of violence if anyone is caught cheating at his casino, The Tangiers.In addition to De Niro, the acting of the other cast members is equally first rate, with a tour-de-force performance by Sharon Stone as the most tragic character of the story. Her character, from the in-the-know casino hustler paying off the valets to the dependent drug-addict giving thousands of dollars to her old pimp and junkie, is completely believable from beginning to end. Pesci also turns in another fine performance very similar to the character he portrayed in Goodfellas as the ruthless jewel robber and murderer.The film is somewhat hampered by voice-overs that last too long in some places. The beginning voice-over makes sense as De Niro describes the operations of the casino. But then other characters chime in and it gets over burdensome. Also, the violent is incredibly graphic, even for Scorcese. Definitely not for all tastes and certainly NOT for children.Still, despite some misgivings, Casino is still a great film. Maybe neither an Oscar winner nor Scorcese's best but certainly the director's most ambitious project.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Haven't I seen this before?,"This film is basically the same as Goodfellas but capitalising on Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. We have the amoral gangsters, materialism, divided loyalties, broken friendships and relationships, and so on. We've seen this before. At least this time the setting is more interesting and the acting was good as always. This film doesn't live up to its predecessor but it was still well made so I can't rate it very low.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Haven't We Seen this Before?,"Who doesn't love Scorsese? He's made classic, fun films with some of the best acting performances ever. 'Casino' doesn't fit that bill.As many have noted, all aspects of 'Casino' are extremely derivative of 'Goodfellas.' One of the flaws of 'Goodfellas' though was Robert de Niro playing a dull character. Well, guess what? Scorsese thought it'd be interesting if that de Nero character had a whole movie to himself. De Nero gives a fine acting performance that lends itself to a believable character. But it's just hard to get over the fact that he's playing a manager at a casino.Our two other big stars are Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. I really wasn't crazy about either. Pesci could care less when he read one of his many voice over narrations. And it was 50/50 if he actually did something of note when acting. A far cry from his 'Goodfellas' performance. Sharon Stone was just a lot to take in. Her sophistication and smarts at the start of the film melt away as soon as she marries de Nero.This is definitely a good mob movie. Yet it can't be called a masterpiece. The three hour run time definitely feels it, the acting is hit or miss, and voice over narration enables a bad tendency in Scorsese of having drawn out stories.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Tale Of Money, Power, Greed, Deception & Murder","The last collaboration between director Martin Scorsese & actor Robert De Niro as of today, Casino is a tale of money, power, greed, deception & murder that takes its inspiration from real-life events to paint an interesting portrait of both the glamorous & grisly sides of Las Vegas and is expertly steered by stellar performances from its terrific cast.The story of Casino follows a gambling handicapper who is sent to Las Vegas by the Mafia to oversee their casino operations. When his supervision doubles their profits, they send a mob enforcer who's also his childhood friend to look after him. The plot covers their friendship which turns sour over the years as they compete over a gambling empire.Directed by Martin Scorsese (best known for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull & Goodfellas), the story opens with a bang and comes full circle over the course of its runtime but there is no proper narrative structure to it. We watch people going about their daily business and few people dying, and that's what goes on for 3 hours. But the interest isn't all lost, thanks to Scorsese's fine direction.However, the repetitive nature of it does diminish the earlier excitement and after a while, the only thing that keeps it going and makes sure that the film steers past the finish line are its trio of excellent performances. The 1970s casino ambience comes alive in vivid detail but the story is at its most gripping when depicting the other side of Las Vegas that's violent, merciless & uncompromising.Coming to the performances, the film reunites Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci yet again and while the two play their respective roles with comfort & confidence as expected, it's Sharon Stone who steals the show with her at times broken, other times volcanic rendition of the avaricious character. We may not like the characters this film has in store but there's no denying the performances from the cast is absolutely top-notch.On an overall scale, Casino is another fascinating crime epic from Martin Scorsese that recreates the 1970s casino scene in splendid detail and presents its cast at the top of their game but just like most of his other works with De Niro, it's a picture that I admire more than I love. A three-sided character study that takes its trio to the top, only to throw them off the summit, Casino isn't going to be a smooth ride if you can't handle lengthy narratives or don't have the stomach for strong, intense violence.",,Anonymous,Crime
"""Goodfellas"" is just ""Casino 1""","Up until now, most of the criticism I've heard from people is that ""Casino"" is ""Goodfellas 2"" or that Scorsese's done the ""gangsters with voice-overs and the classic rock soundtrack"" thing before.To that I say, ""So what?""  It worked brilliantly before.  But, I'll even go so far as to say that it works better now.Ways in which ""Casino"" is better than ""Goodfellas"":1) The setting is better. 2) The story is deeper and more complex. 3) The characters are much better developed. 4) DeNiro is brilliant in a bigger role. 5) Pesci is great in a much better role. (His character isn't so 1-dimensional.) 6) Sharon Stone is great in her best performance. 7) James Woods is excellent in a supporting role.In addition, the movie contains one scene which I consider to be one of the greatest ever.  It was the scene late in the movie in which Pesci's and DeNiro's characters meet to air out their differences.  Two great actors meet with the desert as a backdrop in the movie's key scene.""Let's get one thing straight.  I'm what matters out here, not you and your f**king casino, or your f**king TV show."" ...The story is very well-told, even if it's a little longer than it needs to be.  But, the scenes where Sharon Stone and James Woods are fighting with De Niro (the obvious places for substantial edits) are such compelling acting/drama that I wouldn't want the movie to be any shorter.""Goodfellas"" falls just shy of ""Casino"" in so many ways.  Had ""Goodfellas"" been made later, not only would it be considered ""Casino 2"" but it would not even be held in as high regard as ""Casino"" is now.Scorsese improved upon what was a great movie-making formula.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Scorsese gangster film,"A pretty interesting film. We get the usual narration for a Scorsese gangster film, we're told right from the start that the characters fail in their efforts to maintain a casino empire but this story will tell you how that happened.The locations and sets all look really great, A lot of this movie takes place at night amid the neon lights of Vegas and it looks really terrific. The camera is able to glide through scenes during parts that are narrated in a really immersive way, the Steadicam shots really hold up well. The performances are really strong from all three of the leading cast, De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci. The film gives us a lot of details about the inner running's of the casinos as they were at the time which I found one of the most interesting aspects of the film. It's a long film clocking in at about 3 hours and a few bits I found hard to follow. Casino isn't just about crime and gangsters but also about addiction and drugs and this aspect of the film works well too. The strongest element of the film though has to be the performances and the direction.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Goodfellas II: The Desert,"I'm giving this a four out of ten because it is not necessarily a bad film. But for Scorcese, it's not a good film.Goodfellas is highly superior to this crock. Where Casino is showy, at times arrogant, and even excessive, Goodfellas is nuanced, hungry, and even new. Casino just feels recycled. It is beyond me how people can endlessly praise this movie and pejoratively reject films like 'Gangs of New York' or this year's 'The Departed.' Rent and rave if you want to fall in with the crowd, but otherwise, keep an open mind and try something different.However, this does not mean the film isn't good - it's fine.

A detached view of the American psyche,"Perhaps its an American thing to glorify the violence of Scorsese's gangster films and to see totally inhuman creatures of no worth as heroes.Regardless of the actual cinematic merits of this film,no reasonable person could justify the portrayal of violence and murder displayed for our edification.The characters are tired stereotypes rehashed from the equally pointless ""Goodfellas"".DeNiro turns on the acting autopilot and is not worth his money.Joe Pesci is a one trick pony and really should try to broaden his portfolio a little.The rest of the cast appear to be from the rent-a-bad Italian agency.So we watch a story of a bunch of Italian American Mafia/Mob wannabes beating each other up and swearing at every opportunity due to a rubbish scriptwriter.So what?

An amazing film!,"I had bought my-self a copy of Casino a while back ago but never did get round to watching it, however on Sunday I did as I thought I would keep up with my gangster movie phase I am going through, however unfortunately whilst watching it , my disc messed up and I got annoyed as anything (never purchase second hand DVD's). However the very next morning I got up and went to my local rental shop and watched it. All I can say is - WOW!, I mean I thought Goodfella's once probably Scorces's best work but I can probably say he has topped that with this beaut! No one is truly a fan of the gangster genre without paying homage to this. This movie had all the ingredients to keep to make a recipe for disaster and Scorecse just brighten's it up for us which keeps us hooked. The most funny I found about this movie was that Robert De Niro reminds me of my own ex-boss, his constant nagging and micro-management of everything might seem good to others , but then to the rest of us he just seemed like a control freak and all round ass hole. But I guess thats what keeps you in tune with the character because no matter how much we hate it ranting and raving we all know the stuff he is saying is true and oddly enough I thought to my-self thats what really matters in the movie. Joe Pesci was just nothing short of brilliant, I felt that this time he was let of the leash big time and he did provide a lot of the entertainment especially with his 21 F-U rant in just 2 mins! Sharon Stone was brilliant , normally in gangster movies I have noted that the women are either there for eye candy or their presence in the movie is not of a an big or major significance but I was glad to think that it did not happen over here as her performance is note worthy! Scorcese's makes Casino a pseudo-documentary with his clever use of commentary telling us what we all ready know about Vegas but with its use of colours, lights , music and glitz and glamour one is taken in by its hedonism and it because easy to understand how someone got taken into this world of lust,power and deception and greed. Nearly everything I have covered is probably covered in all the other the comments that people have posted on here...but the reason behind is that it is all true . To conclude Casino should be on every film geeks '100 movies to watch before I die list'. The only problem I had was that a few moments in it were a little bit long which made it drag and it is a long movie so do have a clear mind when you watch it.CASINO - 8.8 OUT OF 10You Don't Stay At The Top Forever...",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"It's a good movie, but a little overrated","I started watching this and after a while realized something; what seemed like an intro to the movie, the narration and non-stop music at the start, kept going and going and never ceased. I care a lot about soundtrack in movies, in this movie however, it was to the detriment of the movie. The music never stops for a second, I thought if it was 'diegesis' at first, a technique in which the music is not just for the audience, but it comes from, say, a radio the character's listening to, so I thought maybe the nonstop music was the music playing in casinos or something, but no, it was constant throughout the movie. And I had a personal taste problem on top of the bad use of music, I hate the kind of music played in this film with a few exceptions(like Bach), but that's just my music taste and I understand most of them were fitting in a movie like this. But I really hate those soulless music pieces that people who really goes to casinos and watch James Bond movies like, kind of music Sinatra sings, hate it. I know I am mostly focusing on the soundtrack here, but it's really important to me. As a genre, crime movies are not my favorite movies, but I remember another crime film, Heat (1995), which also stars Robert De Niro coincidentally, the soundtrack of that movie was what made it so memorable to me. The director (of Heat) Michael Mann generally uses very good music in his movies, I don't know if it's his personal choice or if he works with the right people on that department, but when I think of his movies like; Manhunter (1986), The Last of the Mohicans (1992), Heat (1995), etc. The first thing that comes to my mind is the music from those movies and the scenes in which I heard the music. But even if we put the music choices aside, the frequency with which they are used still makes it very annoying. It never stops.What I loved about the movie was they say that casinos are just there to rob you, they say it out loud without mincing words. But the irony is, most people who like these kind of movies will go there and waste their money nevertheless. Something is different and very wrong in their brains that you and I don't understand, they think they'll make it, I don't know if it's superstition or what, but they must know that they can't win, the cognitive dissonance must be very strong with them. I worked in Atlantic city some years ago as part of my student exchange program, I didn't spend a single dollar in their casinos, but watched some of my friends waste their money there and it was sad. Next year, I was in Tahoe, and I had to make separate plans than my friends because they wanted to see Vegas, which I don't understand, what is so appealing about that place? We had to meet in New York later, I went to beautiful San Francisco while they were in Vegas. I know no one cares about what I did, but my message is Vegas, casinos, that kind of lifestyle is fake and empty, you can go see a lot of beautiful places with your money, instead of losing it to the machines while drooling like a zombie...",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Overlooked, But Equally Impressive Scorsese Masterpiece","""Casino"" is a dominant film which is based on the true story of how Las Vegas was transformed from a simple gambling mecca into a place that has as much personality and color as Disney World.  Robert De Niro stars as a casino owner who is on the ground-level of the city's change.  He is a high-class crook who's able to turn profits with the help of the mafia and crooked gaming practices (a norm for all casinos).  Joe Pesci is on hand as the mob assassin with the short fuse who is De Niro's right-hand man. However, no one stays on top forever and De Niro's demise is partly due to his ex-prostitute wife (Sharon Stone, in her Oscar-nominated role).  Bad decision-making, shady dealings, and questionable alliances will also be key factors in his ultimate downfall.  Once again Martin Scorsese has created a film that is so multi-layered and smart that the viewer is completely engrossed for the entire 182 minutes.  ""Casino"" is a crime epic, in close contrast with ""The Godfather"" series of films.  Scorsese accomplishes what he did with ""Raging Bull"" and ""GoodFellas"".  Once again De Niro and Pesci shine with Scorsese's direction and the unrelenting screenplay.  Sharon Stone does the best work of her career.  She does not necessarily shine brighter than De Niro and Pesci, but she holds her own and never lets either of them steal her thunder and lightning.  Another great thing about ""Casino"" is the supporting cast.  Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, James Woods, and Joe Bob Briggs (!?) all add great elements of both comedy and drama to this outstanding winner which has been overlooked on Scorsese's list of credits, but is just as potent as his other five-star films.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Crime
**** out of ****,"A fascinating look at the mob-operated Las Vegas casino industry, Casino is a success on every level.  Despite being three hours long, it never gets boring  it's driven by brilliant direction, superb acting, and an interesting screenplay.  Covers familiar ground but never really feels like a retread of Goodfellas, although some make that claim.  The only real similarity is Joe Pesci's character  while he delivers a fine performance, I can't help but feel that his presence is largely their because of his success in Goodfellas.  Regardless, it can hardly be considered a flaw in the film, and it works very well.  An excellent addition to Scorsese's already impressive body of work.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Tough guy, you and your brotha'! No more!","This is my favorite mob movie. Say what you will about Goodfellas, this is better. The documentary style filming by Martin Scorcese during the first 40 minutes delves deep into the inner workings of a mob run casino. The first 40 minutes is brilliant. From there the movie chronicles Ace Rothstein's marriage, his business of running the casino, his hitman pal Nicky Santaro, and his wife's affair with Nicky. I really, really love Robert DeNiro and here he has a great supporting cast: Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, Don Rickles, James Woods, and Frank Vincent. All of them put on great performances. I love mob movies anyways but this one rocks. It's got a great soundtrack. Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci steal the show with the two best characters. And the ending scene of Joe Pesci and his brother being beaten to death with baseball bats in a corn field then buried alive to the tune of Eric Burdon's ""The House Of The Rising Sun"" is probably five of my most favorite minutes in film ever. And it will give you nightmares. I have the soundtrack, I have the movie. They both rule. #7 on my top 100 favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Somewhat Derivative But Has Plenty of That Scorsese Magic,"I adore Martin Scorsese he's an amazing director and has ultimately mastered the mob movie with films like Goodfellas which I love, but I often hear people talk about this movie as if it is on par with it but I have to disagree with that I find this movie a bit overrated but far from terrible. I also like to start reviews of positively so I will say that I loved the world that was set up in this film, the whole mobster world hidden behind the guise of casinos in Las Vegas was a very entertaining aspect to this movie. Robert DeNiro is really good in this film I loved the scenes he had with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone he was very imposing and did a great job in this film. Joe Pesci was good but it definitely felt like we've seen things like this from him before. But by far the best performance in this movie was Sharon Stone she was amazing in this movie she was perfect at conveying a damaged and sick woman with no way out and her break down scenes are just amazing to watch. This movie is extremely violent but I loved that about this movie, the violence was effective it showed the brutality of this system and made it feel all the more realistic. However I think this movie has some very big flaws that people has ignored. For one the first 30-45 minutes of this movie are nothing but exposition through narration your given all the inner workings of this world and everyone in it but it just doesn't work because it's given to you all at once and your struggling to catch up and should have been given slower and more gradually across the movie. Another massive issue that has been addressed with this movie is how many similarities it has to Goodfellas but it never comes close to matching that films greatness. Since its structured and layed out so similarly to Goodfellas the film feels like it has the massive hole in it, since the characters that DeNiro and Pesci are playing in this film are so similar to their characters in that movie you feel as if there should be another character in it to fill the place of a Henry Hill but there isn't and the film never recovers from that. This film is also very long and makes for a lot of moments to drag on and I wasn't really satisfied with how they wrapped up Sharon Stones character arc.Casino is a flawed movie it's got some really good performances, it's very well directed and has a great world to it, but the simple fact is that we've seen movies like this from Scorsese before and it's has far to much narration given out over to long a time. Though it's far from Scorsese best it's still a solid film.B-/71%",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Very similar to ""GoodFellas"" but is that such a bad thing?","Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" found him treading very similar ground to his film of five years earlier, ""GoodFellas"". From script to actors to storyline to narrative devices, the two films share several common elements. While that makes for a somewhat unoriginal movie, there are certainly worse templates to go by than ""GoodFellas"".The story is once again based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi. This time, we're treated to a fictionalized account of the rise and fall of Las Vegas casino boss Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (modelled after Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal). Some liberties are taken with the facts but the movie is generally true to life. Like in ""GoodFellas"", voice-over narration is employed throughout the film.Returning from the cast of ""GoodFellas"" were Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci. De Niro was more in the spotlight this time and delivered a characteristically excellent performance. Pesci's performance is also good but could certainly be seen as a rehashing of his previous, Oscar-winning role. Sharon Stone rounded out the stars and she delivered the best performance of her career; one that resulted in a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination. Besides these there are several other notables in supporting roles including Frank Vincent (another ""GoodFellas"" cast member), James Woods & Don Rickles, to mention just a few.Visually, the film is exceptional. Robert Richardson's cinematography was worthy of an Oscar nomination and Scorsese's direction is great as always. Like ""GoodFellas"", Scorsese also made excellent use of music (mostly popular) throughout the entire film. The sets & costumes also show remarkable style and attention to detail.In the end, ""Casino"" won't win any awards for originality but it's hard to fault the film when many of its strengths are shared with ""GoodFellas"". The movie might be a bit too long for it's own good but, other than that, I think it compares quite favourably with the vast majority of crime dramas.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
