The surfer deserves better,"In all its silliness and tongue-in-cheek disposition, the first ""Fantastic Four"" movie wasn't really a landmark as far as comic book films go. But it wasn't so bad either; it's just that after Marvel Comics' recent domination of the film genre, it's natural for one to expect that each of its characters having a shot at the big screen would present something legitimately entertaining to the audience. Something the first installment failed and the second struggled to achieve.In ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" the four superheroes are back once again to help everyone solve their gamut of problems. Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to wed Susan Storm aka Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba). However, an unknown cosmic entity is causing a screw-up in earth's natural phenomena, prompting the couple to postpone the wedding, and work with Johnny Storm aka Human Torch (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm aka The thing (Michael Chiklis) to find out the cause of the mysterious occurrence. They soon come face to face with the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne) and realize that the world's survival is hanging on the balance. In addition to this, Victor Von Doom aka Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) returns and is intent on destroying the Fantastic Four.Granted, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" has a greater scale than its predecessor. But for all this, it's still very... middling. The title and the trailers suggest something of a grand battle between the eponymous characters but aside from the chase sequence involving the Human Torch and the Silver Surfer (which, by the way, has been shown numerous times in the teaser trailer), nothing much exciting still happens. Not even the team's rescue attempt in London. The quality of the special effects are inconsistent and all the visual polish expectedly goes to the Silver Surfer. (And while I personally don't think it's an issue, I imagine how some fans of the comic book might sneer at how the characters of Silver Surfer and Galactus were handled.) Instead, director Tim Story and screenwriters Don Payne and Mark Frost opt to flesh out the characters more but the end result feels less natural and more repetitive. Gruffudd does an okay job with Mr. Fantastic but there's really no feeling of chemistry between him and Alba, who manages to adequately portray a tough yet vulnerable character. In contrast, Evans and Chiklis continue to generate an easy rapport between them and the two get majority of the film's most amusing moments.""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" barely does what it sets out to do. It fares a little better than its predecessor with a more serviceable story and a little more enjoyable action sequences. But taken on its own terms, the film doesn't present anything to its characters that has been done much better with other characters of their ilk. The movie is entertaining to some extent but in the end, it doesn't really rise to something special.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not great!,"I think it's safe to say that when it comes to special effects we have no more expectations, they all nail it these days. This movie was no exception, good graphics and pretty colors as another guy here said. Unfortunately, the moment the special effects kicked in the world of the movies, the good old script got a good kick in the nuts and can barely stand now let alone hold a whole movie on it's feet. This movie again, it's no exception. I have to admit, the plot was OK, the lines good, there was humor, romance, action, a reasonable balance to everything. Yet, I could not feel it taking me in; I remained a spectator, while the short dialogs even though containing the essence of the story, were still dry and well, short. No wonder the movie was a mere 92 minutes. Conclusion, a good PG movie, a bit better than the first one, but which still failed big time to impress, just like the rest of this summer blockbusters.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugely  entertaining sequel that's a significant improvement on it's predecessor .,"The Fantastic Four are back in action, trying to save the world once more, this time from mysterious alien 'The Silver Surfer' whose creating havoc by inflicting blackouts and huge craters throughout the World,Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) & Susan Storm (The rather tasty Jessica Alba) are due to get married, but their nuptials are disrupted by the arrival of the Silver Surfer, and so along with Johnny Storm & Ben Grimm (Hunky Chris Evans & Michael Chiklis respectively) go into battle.A lot of money was spent on this sequel ($130M +) and it shows with amazing special FX, The story being a PG rated film is family friendly and doesn't require a PHD in comic books to follow, and also being PG rated the violence is pretty much non-existent so anybody expecting something in the vein of 'The Punisher' this isn't for you... but. everybody else - young or old should find a lot of light hearted enjoyment from the Fantastic Quartet... which is FAR better than the original.Highly Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not too shabby,"Potential for a great movie, the Surfer is a great character and has underrated and amazing abilities. I'd say he's one of the strongest characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The chase scene between the Human Torch and Surfer was amazing.Overall, the movie touched a bit on that greatness but fell short. My personal rating is probably leaning more towards a 6.5 than a 7.5 but obviously we cannot include decimals in our rating so the movie earns a solid 7. Perhaps production costs prevented what could have been an amazing movie.Anyone saying, ""it sucked"" are exaggerating but those saying it was amazing have probably not seen many films to judge appropriately.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Silver Surfer's First Film Appearance Deserved Better Treatment,"I don't know what it is about this movie that keeps me watching it every few months. It almost as if I need to watch it on occasion to remind myself how mediocre it is. It was hard to believe that a Marvel film utilizing one of the most interesting characters from the comic universe, Galactus, could be so bland. I suppose one of the reasons I keep returning to this film is that I want so badly to see the Fantastic Four franchise survive. I know it has potential; I love the characters, it has an interesting collection of villains to select from, and the comic series provides some great stories as starting material. It just isn't happening, thanks to poor writing and a little too much creative license at the hands of director Tim Story and writers Don Payne and Mark Frost.The second installment in the F4 franchise suffers from the some of the same problems as the first film, while adding some new issues on top. The story potential is high: Reed Richards and Susan Storm's wedding is postponed (again) when the Earth receives a visit from the Silver Surfer, herald of Galactus. Further complications arise when Victor von Doom returns with plans of his own. Just writing that synopsis made me want to watch the film again; it sounds like the foundation for a great F4 film. My issues began with the fact that we wasted the first 30 minutes of the film preparing for Reed and Sue's wedding instead of getting to the meat of the Silver Surfer plot. Then, once the plot kicks into gear, we're rushed through the next hour to a deus ex machina ending that fails to satisfy (and may even aggravate some of the comic series' fans). When the film was over, I felt as if the Surfer was never given the opportunity to reach his full on-screen potential and I've been left hoping he's given another shot.Just as in the first film, this movie is plagued with some cringe-worthy one-liners (once again, Doom is given some of the worst). I know the F4 was a bit goofier than some of the other Marvel properties but the filmmakers need to tone it down a bit. Though, I can deal with corny dialogue; what I can't abide is blatant slap-in-the-face product placement. I loved that the filmmakers were able to work the Fantasticar into the script (especially since I'd considered it a bit too cartoonish to work in a film) but the shout-out for Dodge when Johnny first sees it and excitedly exclaims ""A hemi!"" went a bit too far.All of the original cast from the first film return, which is both good and bad. Just as before, Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are perfect choices for their characters and do a (no pun intended) fantastic job bringing their characters to life. Also, just as in the first film, I was unimpressed with the performances of Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon. Alba is a beautiful woman and fits the image of Susan Storm, but I've never felt her to be too talented an actress and she remains the weak point of the series. McMahon, again, does not feel right in the role of Dr. Doom; he has a hard time doing insidiously evil without coming across as a hammed performance and I just can't take him seriously. These are not traits I want in the man given the role as one of the best Marvel villains.For what time we're given with him, the Surfer is the most impressive aspect of this film. The visual effects team did a great job with creating the iconic character and Laurence Fishburne was an inspired casting choice for his voice. Galactus, unfortunately, does not receive the same treatment and we are never given a real glimpse at the demigod through his surrounding cloud. In my opinion, it was a waste but the director Tim Story clarified in the film's supplemental material that he chose to keep Galactus vague so that future filmmakers could do him justice. After two average films, now we need to hope someone is even given the chance.Honestly, this film will only appeal to fans of the series and, even then, don't expect to be wow'd. The second F4 film isn't a bad movie, but it never rises above mediocre. The impressive special effects and production design fall victim to plot holes, poor writing, and under-use of the film's assets. It's a quick, mildly entertaining means of spending 90 minutes but, if you're anything like me, you'll walk away from this film wondering what could have been if the epic introduction of the Silver Surfer and Galactus had been put in better hands.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'Bomb-Bastic' ... Shame too.,"What is wrong here? You'd think the director and writer second time around would get better right? Yea, you'd think but no such luck. Tim Story directed this thing like a newbie while both writers could'not seem to shake corny near senseless dribble. If I was Exec Prod, I'd be one ticked off guy for spending more than 130 million on this. Hell, for 10 million and real talent they could have done so much better.I never felt taken away by this film in any way. No drama, sense of danger or urgency, even from the actors. Like eating spicy buffalo wings made of pink flavored bubble gum. Simply the whole film was a paper tiger of itself.The best about this film... Every scene with the Silver Surfer and the magnetic Dr. Doom, Julian McMahon, whom was used far too less, made you feel like you were took along for the ride. They're the only charismatic, interesting and professional energies in this film.Some effects, like in most fight, Surfer and earthly scenes were pretty impressive. However in the corny, ""oh, let me stretch over here to get those papers"" scenes, it looked like Barney Budget scale. And the unfunny cliché after cliché was embarrassing and frustrating.And what's up with Alba's distractingly fake colored Lil Kim contacts? I mean, every time she was on screen, you'd have to fight being distracted from what's going on.Or Mr. Fantastics gray hair changing density and shape with most every shot.That the larger than life 'Thing' Ben Grimm is seemingly reduced to a pint size butterball party favor.The interaction and perception of our hero's with the general public is tapered down like a cheap parlor trick leaving no sense of drama or superiority.Ioan Gruffudd's acting was wimpy and stylized by director Tim Story as if he was in a day time soap opera.Too bad the great possibilities for one of the best comic groups ever thought of, were laid to rest on such an incompetent team that possibly could have ruined it's chances forever.I would have enjoyed myself better watching the animated series from decades ago.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining sci-fantasy action for a wide-ranging audience,"After watching lots of action hero movies, you almost always expect the nice guys to win in the end. Almost. It's the twists that make a suspenseful, entertaining action hero movie. For those of you who don't know the plot, you are in for quite a few, believable surprises, which will leave you guessing as to who the goodies are, who the baddies are, and whether the goodies will win in the end!Sure, there were lots of lines which probably sounded lame in comparison with subtle drama, and the performances won't be winning any Oscars. However, this is a film which is enjoyable the adults as well as the kids, on the SAME LEVEL,which is quite difficult to do. That means that adults are not laughing at in-house jokes that the children don't get - everyone is invited into believe the action. Remember, this is the first action hero movie to receive a PG rating for a while, which is a nice change from the increasingly violent movies we are subjecting kids to these days. The movie also has a moral bent; of cooperation, reconciling differences, and not judging others too quickly.On the special effects side, I would say that they were, indeed, very well done, with one exception: that is, I felt that Mr. Fantastic's powers were not done justice by the special effects team, in comparison to some beautiful effects which we see in the other characters. The dance scene was particularly disappointing.An entertaining film that everyone will enjoy, together.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great improvement over the first.  Fantastic fun again.,"Tim Story stays true to the roots of the 2005 film, keeping this sequel fun and clean, while developing a new story with a couple new characters and making our favorite 4 heroes grow even more. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is better than its predecessor, and one of the better sequels of recent memory.Things appear to be going great for the Fantastic Four. Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan (Jessica Alba) are in love and ready to be married, Johnny (Chris Evans) is still on fire with the ladies, and Ben (Michael Chiklis) has finally found happiness with Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington). However, their happiness will be tested when strange occurrences around the globe point to one culprit: a mysterious being known only as The Silver Surfer (Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne).One of the biggest improvements 'Rise' has over the first film is the fact that the Fantastic work more as a team in this film. Yes, in the first movie they fought together, but it seemed as if they each were fighting different battles within one big one. Here, they take a different route and take on even the smaller events together. Also, the writing is much better, making Reed aka Mr. Fantastic out to be the leader of the Four, much unlike the first movie, which bothered me. Ioan Gruffudd really seems like a leader in this movie, which was a definite strength. Chris Evans also flexes some acting muscle, as The Human Torch is also well written this time around, giving him a wake up call and turning him into a more believable human character this time around. Alba and Chiklis are both good as The Invisible Woman and The Thing respectively. Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne portray the Surfer brilliantly as body and voice respectively. Fishburne has this incredible ability to say the deadliest of lines (All that you know is at an end) with unbelievable ease and charismatic calm. He is the perfect choice as the voice of one of the most powerful comic book characters. I liked how they wrote the Surfer as well. He does become vulnerable in the film, but at the same time, you'll have no doubt that he is the most powerful character by the time the ending rolls around. Doug Jones always impresses me with how he captures and creates a character while doing so little, and after successful turns in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy, Jones gives the Surfer life just as he did Abe Sapien in Hellboy. Kerry Washington and Julian McMahon are also good reprising their roles as Alicia Masters and Dr. Doom, McMahon especially. He's even better as the evil and manipulative Dr. Doom this time around.Tim Story really did a good job with the atmosphere of 'Rise'. He really explores every corner of the planet, with action scenes in Germany, New York, China, outer space, and the heroes' kitchen. All the action scenes are well done and the special effects are used smoothly and effectively, even though it looks as though most of the increased budget was spent on The Silver Surfer and Galactus, who look amazing. They forgot to make Mr. Fantastic look as realistic as possible, because most of the time you can see the visual effects. All in all, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (PG) is a fun movie experience that anyone over age 11 or 12 should enjoy. There is some mild sexual innuendo, but it's not too bad.--spy 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you're looking for mindless big-budget fun, this is the place for you and your bucket of popcorn","Like many other people, I was also thrilled upon watching the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer trailer at the cinema. Similar to numerous people who adore CGI, read the comic books when they were kids and thought the first installment was decent enough to justify a sequel, I was more than willing to get myself ready to be overwhelmed by the mere strength of the eye candy and CGI effects within the film. And then I watched it at a special press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel.To make a long story short, FF2 is not a bad film. I was actually quite entertained throughout wide parts of the film (particularly at the beginning - but more on that later). Problem was, once I stepped out of the theater, I couldn't actually recall anything specific or special about what I have just seen (other than that cool CGI Silver Surfer, that is). It was just so mediocre in terms of plot, direction and acting (somebody really ought to give Jessica Alba some acting lessons a.s.a.p), that I didn't even care enough to remember it. Furthermore, while the original film required some suspension of disbelief, let's just say the plot in its sequel stretches this boundary one step too far, IMO.As I've already mentioned, FF2 actually starts up in quite a promising manner. While Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue (Alba) get ready for their media circus wedding (think Tomkat style - but bigger), strange electronic and climatic disturbances occur across the globe. From here on out, you have this huge build up that pays off about half an hour into the film, continues with a bang and some dazzling CGI shots, and suddenly ends abruptly while the initial novelty of the Silver Surfer's appearance wears off. As usual, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm steals the show as the only character to truly evolve during this film, Mike Chiklis as Ben is seriously under-used, my 1.5 year-old nephew could play better than Gruffud's Reed and Alba isn't even that pretty anymore. Then you have all these villains (Silver Surfer is definitely not working alone, as implied in the IMDb official plot line) and some twists and turns that leave you feeling mildly entertained, but also incredibly under whelmed.You see, if you're looking for mindless big-budget fun, this is the place for you and your bucket of popcorn. However, don't expect to find the heart of Spider-Man 3 or epic feel of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Don't even look for credible acting or intelligent plot. Only decent thing you'll find are some good looking money shots, and mindless action sequences. This formula of a film may work well as a matinée, but not as something you'll want to come back and watch again in the coming future.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantasitc Fun!,"With Von Doom back in his homeland of Latveria the fantastic four have new troubles when Galactus has decided that Earth is his next target. When his henchman, The Silver Surfer, is sent to Earth he discovers that he's getting more than he bargained for when he encounters the Fantastic Four. But that's not all when Dr. Doom decides that after two years in the homeland he is ready to return.With it's short running time, FF2 is a fast paced movie. It doesn't waste anytime on anything and gets right to the point. It's more or less a popcorn film because it's really not all about the action. This film is even better than the first film (although not as good as the extended cut of the first film). There is more character development, more intense, and more dramatic.With more dramatic scenes, there are also more comedic scenes, most for both the children and the adults to enjoy. The problem is that this movie switches from drama to comedy in scenes. If you want it to be funny, go with it and vice versa.Although with the PG rating, there is even more intense action sequences and a death scene that pushes the PG rating a bit. The CGI in here ranges from being bad to fantastic with some things you can feast your eyes on. I like the acting by cooler Ioan Gruffudd, the sexier Jessica Alba, the handsomer Chris Evans, and the, well, Michael Chiklis.I also want to attack a ""problem"" in this film that people are complaining about: Galactus. Yes, many will be disappointed on how he appears in the movie or that he appears at all but isn't this film called ""Rise of the Silver Surfer""? So please, don't be surprised of how Galactus appears.Although not as good as Spider-Man 3, this film is harmless fun for the family. There are more action sequences and comedy. It doesn't take itself seriously like the more serious superhero films (ala Batman Begins, Superman Returns, Spider-Man). It's an okay adaptation for Silver Surfer (there will be a spin-off), but many people will be surprised this film will exceed their expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"with its GP appeal, expect it to deliver good, clean fun and passable entertainment","This was better than the first of the series, but still campy. While the title highlights the Silver Surfer, the plot in fact still revolves around the two-dimensional issues of the Fantastic Four.As Dr. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic, played by Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (The Invisible Woman, played by Jessica Alba) try to get married in the midst of the hoopla as superhero celebs, the team discovers that they aren't the only super-powered beings in the universe when they come up against the mysterious Silver Surfer and the Earth-threatening Galactus.Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/Torch is the only one who lights up the screen with his sizzling screen presence (pardon the pun), and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/Thing is his reliable foil.Julian McMahon (of Nip/Tuck and Charmed fame) reprises his role as the evil Victor Von Doom; it's a pity he did not get more screen time.I have not read the comicbooks, but F4 was different in that unlike other superhero stories, the foursome are open celebrities and lead no secret lives. Yet, they unrealistically squabble about their issues as if they are not used to being on call to save the world at a moment's notice (hello, that's what superheroes do!). Also unlike other such stories, the military/police are not grateful for the Fantastic Four's help and do not seem to collaborate with them, treating the superheroes as brats they have to deal with.Nonetheless, with its general patronage appeal, expect the movie to deliver good, clean fun and passable entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better than the first, but could be a little better","I just got back from seeing this on the big screen, and was it worth it: yes and no. All comic book movies have everybody talking (""Is it going to kick ass?"", ""Is it going to suck?""), and FF: RotSS doesn't kick ass, but it doesn't suck either.I was expecting a pretty moderate superhero movie, because I know that the FF ain't as popular as Spiderman or Batman or Superman, but they couldn't be worse than Daredevil either. My point is this movie isn't horrible, but it's plagued with a few mistakes that came right out of Spiderman 3.First off, the GOOD:1: visual effects are pretty awesome. They aren't better than Spiderman 3, but they are good.2: Johnny's humor is actually better than the first one (somewhat), along with Grim's as well.3: Jessica Alba being partially naked in a PG movie is just a BLAST to think of!!! Bravo Tim bravo!!! Now the BAD: 1: there are very little fight seqeunces in this movie, and pretty much all of them don't beat the first movie's fight scenes.2: Johnny's humor is pretty funny, but some of it is pretty lame and mediocre.3: Galactus. He suffers just what Venom did in Spiderman 3: TOO LITTLE SCREEN TIME!!!!! I admire the fact they changed his appearance (from a giant monolith with a crown to a cloud of dust and energy), and he's a good character to put into the movie, but they could of put a little more background into him besides ""Some call him Gah Lac Tus, the destroyer of worlds."" Ooooo scary.4: Last, but certainly not least is the Silver Surfer. He's also an outstanding character. Doug Jones did a pretty good job of portraying him, but there's just one problem: LAWRENCE FISBURNE DOES HIS VOICE-OVER!!!! Horrible. JUST. PLAIN. HORRIBLE!!!! His voice doesn't even match the Silver Surfer's look!!But overall, it's a darn good superhero movie, just ignore Morpheus's voice the entire time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing here has risen folks.,"After the critics and comic-book aficionados gave the first Fantastic Four film a ""bitchslap"" of bad reviews, it became a surprise hit nonetheless. But some of you already knew there was going to be a sequel on the way. And since there were a lot of mistakes made, there must've been some lessons learnt from everyone involvednot that they could care less about ""negative reception"", since the movie has made 330 million worldwide. 2 years later, the promise that the sequel will be darker (so they say), and more serious (so they say), have been hype to death, though this is the same hype that has damaged both Spider-Man 3 and X3. Then, there's the publicity stills of the Silver Surfer as the next FF baddie, helping me leave my lowered expectations behind. I decided to give this one another shot, and that's because the Silver Surferwho is one of the coolest Marvel creations ever.Rise of the Silver Surfer is an improvement over the first film (And that's saying a lot for those of you who have ever seen the first film), since its source material is a reasonable one. The Fantastic Four must save Earth after the Silver Surfer, who is the herald of the planet eating being Galactus, signals it's destructionwhile Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman prepare for their upcoming nuptials. Seems fair doesn't it? This could've worked, but the problem is that a brief 96 minutes running-time isn't enough to pull it all off. How are you going to pull off an ""Independence Day"" under 96 minutes? Not only is the running-time a huge problem, but the film is just too lackluster for me to fancy. And because of everything being so brief, arbitrary and perfunctory, there's wasn't enough action, fighting, or confrontational battles between the heroes & their foe(s). This is a film about an extraterrestrial being coming to destroy Earth, but you don't see too many things being blown up; devastation of landscapes or set pieces with an atmosphere filled with intensity, peril or panic: all of the things that can give this film a dramatic affect. Like the first FF film, FF2's suffers from a limited imagination, and I honestly think that Tim Story lacks the vision that it takes to handle such material that's supposed to be filled with thrills, excitement, darkness, drama, and for the faithfulness to the FF camplight-hearted ""fun"". The ""over-hyped"" nuptials of Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman turned out to be a disappointing subplot, due to the fact that it's just a set-up for the Surfer to have his first encounter with the heroes by intruding on the ceremony. Though I was hoping they could get it over withsince it has taken up most of the film's time; they have been yapping about it throughout the entire film. But thank god Stan Lee came to make his usual cameo appearance. Was it light-hearted? Yes. Seeing as how there's a goofy dance number with Reed Richards, and the typical slapstick momentswhich one scene includes Sue's body helplessly rendered in flames because of Johnny's molecules being unstable after his encounter with the Surfer, causing him to switch powers with anyone he touches. Was it funny? Nope. Chris Evans (Human Torch/Johnny Storm) is typically ""comedic relief"" with all the dull-witted jokes he can carry, but tries to make it work with decent delivery. Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm/The Thing) isn't given much to do here but stand behind and be the goofball.The attempt at tenderness between Sue Storm/Invisible and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is unrealistic, with both the film's hackneyed script and the lack of chemistry between Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd. Whenever these folks are supposed to kiss and show affection, it seems rather forced then natural. Alba (now looking like Lil' Kim with her blonde-hooker wig and scary-looking blue contact lenses), is just cold and uninteresting for me to stomach. It seems that she is always in this emotionless state. It's like she's this walking mannequin: she does nothing, but stand around, look hot, and wear tight-fitting outfitswhile wearing eye-glasses to give off the effect that she has some sort of intellectwithout the intellectual babble (doh!). The script does nothing to help her express her words, but she doesn't have the altitude to express emotion either. Gruffudd seems to always be in this state of lost. It's quite difficult to understand why such an amazingly gifted actor can be so boring in this film. Were any of the heroes fantastic this time? Not a chance. The Fantastic Four are treated are bland super-dummies, while their nemesis, the Silver Surfer, upstages all them in terms of awesomeness and coolness. Too bad this isn't his movie. The Silver Surfer rocked, no doubt about it, and brought to life by amazing special effects, he's even more fantastic then the four who carry the moniker. Do we really need Julian McMahon returning as Dr. Doom? People have truly underestimated him in the first film, but here, he doesn't provide much for the story, while the idea of the big bad-ass Galactus turning into a dust storm doesn't work.My advice for the next installment1.) Let see these guy do more fighting2.) Let these characters show their full potential when they perform their super-powers.3.) Never let the next FF baddie cramp the heroes' style4.) Enough with Doom 5.) And please upgrade on the special effects, they still look cheapeven for a big-budget film.Of course, this is supposed to be a ""light-hearted"" family film, and like a Diet Coke it's ""Half"" the calories (PG folks)while the hardcore comic-book fans with avoid it like the plaque. They deserve better. And by the title being Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, it's really more about the Silver Surfer. In the good words of wisdom from Flava Flav: ""Don't believe the hype.""",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Silver Surfer stole the show.,"The follow up to the first F4 proves to be much more entertaining and engaging, good pace, good story line and none of those cliche script unlike the first one. Seeing it again after many years didn't let me down.Every time Silver Surfer appears, I'm mesmerised by his movement and body expression though he deserves a more important role than merely just a scouter for Galactus. Didn't do enough justice for him and Galactus to be honest. And that gas giant as Galactus is a big no no.Doug Jones played Silver Surfer deserves a massive applause. But the voice of Silver Surfer by Laurence Fishburne just sounded weird for the character. Could have just used Doug's voice and would fit better in my humble view.I hope now that F4 is back in the Disney/Marvel family, we can truly do justice for Silver Surfer and Galactus again. Laurence Fishburne as Galactus... now we're talking. They are so important for us Marvel fans. And please cast Doug Jones again, this time including his voice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Comic Book Movie Genre Takes a Huge Hit,"This is one of the first movies I can say I hated from beginning to end!After the opening fifteen minutes, I felt like going back out to the lobby and staring at the cardboard cutout display, knowing I would find better acting there than was present on the screen.Perhaps I have reached the point of CG overload, but it seems the more things blow up, fly through the air or transform miraculously, the more I yawn. People are falling all over themselves drooling over the physical appearance of the Silver Surfer. I too was impressed...BACK IN 1991 WHEN I SAW THE SAME EFFECT IN TERMINATOR 2!!! In the sixteen years that have transpired, they haven't improved on that original effect one iota. What they have managed to do is make Jessica Alba look like a bad special effect, not when she's invisible mind you, but in her live action scenes.

Couldn't we just focus on the Silver Surfer all along ?,"Why didn't they say so ? In part 1 ? The Silver Surfer is very cool. A metallic looking alien with a board attached to its feet. It should be, in my opinion, 100% obvious that you introduce the Silver Surfer even before you show us the Fantastic 4. I absolutely don't get it. CGI was all there during part 1 in 2005, ready, and so much cheaper (I suppose). Just show us the Silver Surfer exploring the galaxy, voyaging from gas planet, to spitting sun, to mysterious planet 9. Instead, I have to look at the ugly Thing. Did the producers intentionally hold back ? Save the good stuff for a rainy day ? Because they had so much to tell in part 1 ?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Grossly Under-Rated,"I just watched this movie on Blu-Ray, and it was the first time I'd seen it since viewing it in the theater during its 2007 release. Then and now I found this movie to be much better than the reviews and reception it received. The only thing I can figure is that in 2007 people were just beginning to grow tired of the first wave of superhero movies.The movie is a bit hokey--but that is in staying true to its source material. As in the original film, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" features a ""Thing"" costume that could have been a bit better done, and an actor playing Mr. Fantastic who doesn't look a whole lot like the Reed Richards of the comic books. But the movie features a dynamic and fun plot, a well-paced storyline, extraordinary effects, and an altogether good movie experience.That being the case, I'm going to give this film 9/10 stars, after having given its predecessor 8/10. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is actually one of the better comic book adaptations that I've seen--yes, MCU movies included. Galactus is neat (even if a complete reimagining of the comic character), the Silver Surfer storyline is neat, Doom's return is neat. It's just a neat movie all in all! If you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while, give it a shot. You may be surprised at how much you enjoy this film that tends to get lots of criticism.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Blandtastic Bore: The Ruse of the Silver Screen,"I am a comic book reader of longstanding, and have enjoyed several of the screen adaptations of comic books, but both Fantastic Four films have been textbook examples of how NOT to translate a comic book to the screen. Seriously, I thought they couldn't make a worse film that the original Fantastic Four, but I have been proved wrong.From the gratuitous attempts at showing Alba as naked as possible, to the less-than-convincing physical presence of the Thing, to the miscasting of Alba and whoever plays Reed, to the pointless changes in the story, to a bland visual style (performed upon one of the most visually dynamic creations in comic book history) to the endless scenes of dull dialogue. Nothing goes right, here as in the first film. Galactus is a hungry cloud with no actual personality at all, and the obnoxious military man seems totally unaware of who and what the Fantastic Four are. Plot holes, flat acting, uninvolving action scenes. The movie acts as a sort of fraud pulled on comic fandom.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Quite As Good As Its Predecesor,"Another acceptable entry into the superhero library that seems to be ever growing.The effects are good, the characters work but the story lets itself down a little.I think from my perspective it pushes or forces the humour and its how it comes across on screen, its a little silly in places.Still, a good movie and its a shame they didn't do a third instead of opting for an unnecessary reboot.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Norin Badd,"I've watched a decent amount of old 70s fantastic 4 cartoons, haven't read comics much though. However fantastic 4 is very campy to me in general.With that said this movie was par for the course imo. The saving grace is silver surfer. His character is awesome, he's a man without a home, drifting through the cosmos, a lost soul. And if you can't appreciate the character development I don't have anything to say. But surfer totally makes the movie to me. I literally googled ""silver surfer movie"" for three years after fantastic 4 sequel was released. And now 14 years later this is all we have. So rather than gripe I choose to enjoy this cinematic experience.I think you will enjoy it!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Have They No shame?,"This movie takes Crap-tastic-ness to new and previously un-explored heights.I'm not going to give you a synopsis or get into specifics about why I hated this disgraceful excuse for entertainment so much. Go watch the movie and discover that for yourself. Instead of touching upon the acting, the plot lines, and the dialog ( all of which were laughable ), my biggest problem with this movie is the total lack of respect shown to the source material by the writers and producers. The Fantastic 4 are a wonderful group of heroes, fun and interesting. Their enemies are some of the better villains in the comic book world. Yet even with this wealth of characters and ideas, this movie turned out like garbage. Why? Because the people responsible DON'T CARE about the comics or the fans. I realize that movies are made so that they can bring in money. This is perfectly fine, nobody can dispute that if films aren't financially viable then they won't get made at all. Fantastic 4 was a cash grab plain and simple, so pleeeeeease Hollywood, stop ripping us off. If you don't want to invest your full effort into a film, then I don't want to invest my money.

Surfer Saved this Movie,"This movie started off slow, boring, and all around just a drag, but the Silver Surfer was the best part of the entire film.I might be biased because I've never liked a Fantastic Four movie so my rating may be harsher than how I usually rate these movies, but I find the main characters so boring and annoying.The Silver Surfer was monotoned yet the most interesting character on the screen I also think that the way they used his flying ability was well done but could be better.I wouldn't recommend this movie to be honest, but I will say it isn't too bad, I gave it an extra 2 stars solely because of the Silver Surfer.Final thoughts:Plot: 3/10 Writing: 3/10 Acting: 4.5/10 Special Effects: 7/10 Cinematography: 6.5/10 Personal Enjoyment: 3/10 (+2 for Silver Surfer).Total:6/10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Little Better Than The 1st But Still No Contest,"Fantastic Four 2: Rise of the Silver SurferStarring: Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, Julian McMahon, Kerry Washington and Doug JonesGenre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/FantasyRated PGAfter the so-so turnout of the first Fantastic Four movie, I was wondering how were they going to make the sequel better than the first movie? They brought in the Silver Surfer into the plot. So basically the movie picks up two years later from the last movie, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are about to get married and things couldn't seem better. However, the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones) is sent from Galactus to destroy the earth and Doctor Doom returns to steal the powers of The Silver Surfer and now The Fantastic Four must save the Earth from disaster. Compared to the first movie, this one had a little more action and the addition of The Silver Surfer was a nice touch but still the Fantastic Four movies are not going to match up to the success of the ""X-Men"" or ""Spider-Man"" movies. Plus I also don't understand why they gave this movie a PG rating instead of keeping it PG-13? I didn't see a reason for them to lower the rating for this movie. I don't think there will be a Fantastic Four 3 because somehow I think it would only make it worse for the movies since they've turned out with two decent movies unless they can make it extremely better to blow our minds. But I would like to see a spin-off movie for The Silver Surfer. I also enjoyed some of the funny moments from Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis). Overall it was decently better than the first but it still won't match up the high success to ""X-Men"" or ""Spider-Man"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Well I had no fun, just sat there squirming with manic depression! It is the worst avalanche of excretion to be released in centuries. There's not even any point in saying about anything in the film, it was so useless.Those people who wrote those 4 (out of five) star reviews should be banished to the sort of worlds that the Silver Spunker comes from.Don't go and see this nonsense, Jessica Elba is tasty, but so are all the girls on the cover of the 90 men's mags at your local paper shop.

Not as bad as people have made you believe.,"I have always wondered why these two movies have such a bad reputation. I remember seeing them in the theater when they first came out, and then I've re-watched them on DVD several times. Yes, it's true, they are nothing to write home about, but at least they are entertaining. Also, despite their imperfections, at least they have their own personality instead of being the insufferable cut-and-paste that MARVEL, Netflix, and Disney have imposed as a film production model, which I am more than fed up with. In short, a superhero movie of moderate length (90 minutes), for all audiences, with a happy ending and no political agenda. Not a bad thing, given the times we live in.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Rises High Above the Original,"Fantastic Four was a movie I had very mixed feelings about. As I have never read a single Fantastic Four comment I couldn't complain about the storyline being different, or certain character be interpreted in the wrong way, no the reason I had mixed feelings about it was the fact it was poorly made. There is no doubt in my mind that had someone like Sam Raimi or Christopher Nolan been given the directors job they could have made a better movie. However, could they have given it the fun, energetic tone that the story requires. Honestly I don't think they could have done. For all its faults the original movie was fun, it was poorly written and the characters poorly visualised, but the movie itself was fun, and I still had high hopes for the series. I was very much looking forward to Rise of the Silver Surfer. The trailers were brilliant, the storyline sounded interesting, and the fact that the origin storyline was out the way is always a good thing. So does it surpass the original? Does it live up to my expectations? Yes on both accounts. Rise of the Silver Surfer is a success, it still is flawed on many ways. But the movie is a lot better than the original and the fun tone has improved greatly. The performances seem to have improved, the storyline actually exists here, and the special effects for the surfer are spectacular. Its surprised me that the best comic book movie of 2007 so far has actually been this, not hard really when you see that Giost Rider was an unmitigated disaster, and Spiderman 3 was overlong and dull.Anyway, the cast here seem to have settled in nicely to their roles. I had a major problem with Ioan Gruffudd in the original, a shame as I know he is a talented actor. I just didn't feel he had much to work with. Thankfully his character has improved here, he seems a lot more likable, his performance less strained, and his dialogue at times really works. I also found his action sequences didn't feel as lame as they did in the original. Jessica Alba has thankfully improved, she is now average in this series with a few bright spots along the way. I still believe a more talented actress is required for her role, but in some scenes, such as the very well executed wedding sequence, her character and performance worked very well. But of course, like the original, two actors dominate this movie. Michael Chiklis as The Thing, and Chris Evans as The Human Torch. I think I liked the fact that The Thing is used more often for comic relief, it suited the character more, and he has some really great comedic moments. Chris Evans has also improved, he was very funny in the original and had great charisma, here he shows some emotional weight on a few sequences, but generally he's the same guy. Julian McMahon's performance for me was an improvement on the original. He's definitely decided to be a pantomime villain, which this time very much works. Special credits must also go to Doug Jones, who as the surfer, gives him the grace required. Laruence Fishbourne's voice also is perfect for the surfer.So what of the big action sequences? Well the action here works a hell of a lot better. The original suffered quite a lot because apart from two decent scraps, we really didn't see the Fantastic Four being fantastic. Here we see them doing a lot more action, and we also see them do a fair bit of globe trotting, which in my opinion highly benefits the storyline. The much advertised sequence of the Human Torch and Surfer chase looks amazing, but is nothing compared to what follows. We have a well executed sequence in London, a great bit in Shanghai, and various other little fights along the way. All of them look pretty impressive. However, some of the effects do look very naff. Which leads to me to one of the films flaws. The effects for Reed, and even at times the Human Torch, looked pretty naff. Annoying as the surfer looks so brilliant that whenever you compare the effects together it always makes the bad effects look even worse. The action also has a more intense feeling that the first movie lacked, the Shanghai and very final bit (won't spoil it) definitely feels a lot more epic than anything the original dared to attempt. This new found style, added with the entertaining factor from the original, makes the movie a vaster improvement, and makes the Fantastic Four definitely a franchise I'd be happy to return to in the future.The storyline here has improved a great deal, the threat seems a lot better, the off screen Galaktus is a great villain and we never see him. But this is the surfers movies and the fantastic fours movie. I liked the family dynamic still being front and centre, and also the fact the cheesy humour is no longer intolerable makes the movie a great experience. Of course there are flaws, Jessica Alba's still mediocre performance and the special effects definitely being the main two. But also the script still needs a bit of polishing here and there. But all this is overshadowed by a generally good cast and a great sense of fun. The fact the movie doesn't feel overly long, but never too short, is always a good thing. Rise of the Silver Surfer definitely has given life back to a series that could have flagged badly if this movie was a failure. This will undoubtedly be one of the highlights of the summer, and will definitely entertain all kids of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good lord, what a piece of garbage","This movie is awful in every degrading sense of the word. I hated it, and I honestly can not understand how anyone above the age of 11 can like this. I realize that it is a movie for children, but does that mean that the movie should be bad, because children does not have a fully developed sense of what is good and what is not?""Let's just make a movie without really caring about the outcome, because children love famous and pretty people, and doesn't know a bad story from a good one, so they'll be happy no matter what!"" - Tim Story I can envision the director telling the crew this in the beginning of production.The direction was below average, and it was quite evident because the whole movie felt like a string of random scenes cut together, with way too much focus on all sorts of stupid things that had nothing to do with the story. Why did they put the scene with the bear in there, for example? Was it important? No, it certainly was not, let me tell you.The acting was as well lousy. The worst of the lot was Jessica Alba. Sure, she's a pretty face, but nothing more, but I suppose they put her in the FF-movies because of just that. The others in the ensemble are better than her, but that doesn't make them good. Chris Evans was OK in Sunshine, so why did he decide to suck in this one? I don't get it.Another thing, if Galactus was so powerful, and he was the one who gave the Surfer his powers, then why would the Silver Surfer be able to destroy Galactus just by surfing into him? Seems the Devourer of Planets would handle something like that. While I'm on the subject, a villain in the form of a silvery man on a surfboard is just stupid.I'm just gonna end this review now, because this movie frankly isn't worth commenting on anymore - it is a very, very bad movie and you should be able to tell (but judging from the comments on the official MySpace-page to the film, most people might not realize it)if your IQ is higher than your waist measurement. Go watch Transformers instead - at least that one is entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good fun,"Whilst the geek in me has issues with some of the changes in the original comic book plot I have to say I found this great popcorn fun.It's a fairly light hearted, family romp with some superb effects and a cohesive plot. And it's that cohesive plot which really holds it together where other superhero sequels have failed. No unnecessary multiple villains or convoluted threads here, the film has a story to tell and tells it without getting bogged down by trying to do too much. The Fantastic Four themselves are all well characterized, especially the interplay between The Thing and Johnny Storm which is very reminiscent of the source material.Certainly it's cheesy but it's *fun* and at the end of the day that's exactly what a comic book superhero film should be.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Seriously?!?!? A high rating for this crappy movie?,"I only saw this because my brother wanted to see it, and I just had to know how bad it could be. I laughed at how ridiculous these movies have become, I could have easily fallen asleep, and I long for the days of The Crow. The times when real comic and graphic novel movies came to life. The F4 series is crappy, Disney drivel that should be a ride at the amusement park or a cheesy video game. Please stop making movies like this and make something interesting for a change. Can you imagine Ed Carnahan directing a super hero movie? It would rock. Period. This movie flat out sucked a$$. Its hard for these movie companies to stop making these movies and aiming for younger kids who can't drive to the theatre. So the parents have to take the kids and thus, a movie sells more tickets. I get that, but if you made a cool comic movie for adults that some kids could see, well you win there too.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good!  Much better than the original.,"I didn't think much of the original FF, but this one is far better in every aspect. Better writing, more exciting storyline, and better acting, as well. The special effects are amazing, as everyone can probably already tell from the previews, particularly the Silver Surfer. His scenes were incredible.I laughed quite a bit at this movie, surprisingly, as I didn't find the last one very funny. The humor in this movie was a little more mature, particularly when Johnny Storm is asking Ben Grimm about how he and his girlfriend have ""relations (which is something I always wondered as well)."" My favorite scenes were the ones in which Ben and Johnny interacted, as Michael Chiklis' Thing is my favorite character to watch. He really captured the spirit of the comic in both appearance and attitude.There are many things to like about FF: ROSS, just don't expect Shakespeare, or even deep comic book movies like Batman Begins or X-Men. This movie is rated PG, and rightfully so. While there are mature moments, FF is at heart a movie for younger people.The reason that I gave this movie a 6, despite my seemingly high praise of it, is the ending/last 15-20 minutes. While not enough to ruin my enjoyment of this movie, the ending definitely rubbed me the wrong way, particularly as a comic book fan. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't go into detail. But it's easy to see how the producers painted themselves into a corner by needing an easy way to finish a movie that could potentially have an extremely vast scope.Bottom line: if you're a FF fan, or just a comic book fan in general, this is one that you won't want to miss. Just, like I said, don't go in expecting to think deep thoughts.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sequel Squanders,"Reviewed by Sarhan ""Tsar"" RashidThere are few marketing departments in the world which can convincingly fool their target demographic. Fortunately for 20th Century Fox, they have one of best.Which would explain the positive buzz surrounding ""Fantastic Four: The Rise of The Silver Surfer"". So far the ads have sold the movie as a triumph over its predecessor. It must help to have Rupert Murdoch's numerous media outlets brainwashing the public with talk of a better script and a bigger budget. None of which appears to be true.They've also again managed to stir some controversy to raise curiosity amongst the core fan base (i.e. comic book aficionados).The first movie succeeded not because of the carefully orchestrated media blitz but because at its heart it was a simple, old-fashioned comic book romp. It had a decent cast, a focused storyline and origin stories are mostly always fun.The sequel gets it all wrong by padding scene-after-scene of repetitious exposition, poorly conceived drama and bland set pieces which only end up testing the viewers' patience. It's amazing how lengthy and pointless its short 92 minute running time feels. The proceedings never manage to engage the viewers. Even the Silver Surfer, under the direction of the visually lacking Tim Story, is realised as a flat one-dimensional hero.The cast must've been chasing a quick paycheck because they all look bored exchanging quips and cheesy lines littered with unreal sci-fi more fitting for an episode of ""Star Trek"". The comic interplay between these characters in the comic books has helped set them apart from their angst ridden counterparts. Here they decide to ham it up and play it broad.A special mention though must go out to one cast member. Jessica Alba. Her sugar coated smile, sun-kissed skin tone and perfect figure would be enough to keep my heterosexual eyes glued to the screen but she failed at even managing that. It was a good call to keep her in the background for much of the first films duration but here, where she's front-and-centre, it exposes how wooden her ""acting"" truly is. Was it so difficult to find a hot Caucasian actress with blue eyes and at least moderate acting chops to play the quintessential American sweetheart Sue Storm? Dolling Alba up in a blonde wig and obvious contacts has to be one of the worst ideas in casting history. And is it just me or does she share a better chemistry with Chris Evans (Johnny Storm, her movie brother!) than with Ioan Grufford (Dr. Reed Richards, her movie fiancé!)?Sorry to be so hard on Alba. Like I said can't blame her for chasing a quick paycheck.I doubt fans of the genre will be as gullible to trust the next such product Fox unleashes upon them. For that matter moviegoers in general might just start staying away from any comic book property Fox decides to butcher.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"I've written almost two years ago that I adored the movie adaptation of Fantastic Four, despite many out there who hated it to the core. Back then, what I found was right about it was its spot on characterization and its capture of the spirit which was FF, the bickering amongst its members as well as its theme on unity and family. I'm surprised that I actually predicted the coming of Galactus, though some would be disappointed with his big screen appearance.Don't kid yourself if you say that you didn't see Galactus coming. As its herald, no Silver Surfer story is complete without the arrival of the master wanting to devour planets to keep itself alive (kinda reminds me of the other Transformer animated movie with Unicron). However, purists would go up in arms at the depiction of possibly one of the largest being in the Marvel Universe, which I thought was a better alternative in the movie without making it look too stupid with its ridiculous purple tin helmet.And what is a Silver Surfer story without Victor Von Doom showing interest in its immense power? While you might think that the movie might have too many villains, with Galactus, Doom and the Surfer (well, for the most parts), and with 4 heroes in the fray, Rise of the Silver Surfer managed to maintain a breezy pace without getting too deep into its themes nor suffer from having to introduce in detail its characters. We've already established most of that in the first movie, and the details of the Surfer and its master was just enough to enlighten new fans, while keeping older fans happy enough with its accuracy.So it's much like the comic book again, with our family of four having to deal with first of all, the rock star like atmosphere of the marriage between Mr Fantastic and Invisible Girl, before the Silver Surfer's rude arrival causing major climate changes in cities around the world, and of course, trusting the USoA army to wanna play world police again.This movie is not without obvious flaws though in continuity and logic in its narrative. For one, while its big action scenes take place in busy parts of the world, the crowd usually gets dispersed in record time. I believe some parts of the action were chopped off to prevent it from being overly draggy, but therein some logic and crowd magically disappear. Some parts too will make you wonder why doesn't the Invisible Girl just knock everyone out with her invisible projectiles, or groan that the make up artist managed to make Jessica Alba look like a fashion disaster with her unnaturally dyed-blonde hair. She looks hot when it's all tied up, but when it's let down, I tell you it's time for some shampoo ad to do some major corporate sponsorship.But I still got a kick out of its humorous moments (not that it was so funny, but they had charm), and I can't get enough of the banter between the Thing and the Human Torch. One thing's for certain, while the acting might not be first class, the cast of Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis (with the help of the suit) sure looked their parts. And that in itself, is movie magic bringing comic book panels to life. Look out too for Stan Lee, whom I think for the first time in the recent slew of Marvel movie adaptations, actually play himself!Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer brings back the best elements in the first movie, and provides an avenue for more of such adventures with the familiar quartet. It's a popcorn movie, and one which entertains throughout its relatively short 90 minutes duration. And I'll stick my neck out and say it again, this is probably one of the better movie franchises that Marvel has put out so far. Given the way things are set up, if this movie still proves to be a box office success, may I now say that we can expect to see the Mole Man next?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four 2,"You can't compare the first movie to this, the second movie. While, the first Fantastic Four movie shows the introduction or the beginning of their powers and how they live with their superpowers, the second movie is on the action. The story is simple, a strange alien comes to the world and while Johnny chases after the silver sleek alien, he somehow gets to know the name, silver surfer. Silver surfer comes to destroy the world like others bringing Galactus to eat the world up. From there, the Fantastic Four must do something or their world will soon end.It is quite short, somehow like a short movie, but still it can entertain you with excellent fights with special effects which is the most entertaining, the talking about how to destroy or bring the board away from the Silver surfer is quite fast. All they do is action. On the other side, the movie is quite short and hence the fights scenes are quite short. Dr Doom is back and he is more powerful but the movie does not prove that he is powerful, that is why Fantastic Four can't be a short movie, when it is short, it can't prove the Fantastic Four to be more powerful like Dr Doom.Don't let the PG rating affect you, some scenes are a little intense. Either you like the first movie or you like to see Silver surfer in action, you can watch it. Hopefully, we will get an extended version on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not quite the comic book I would read,"The curtain goes up, you get your precursor to the story, the camera finally comes to the stars of the show. I had a flag of warning at that moment: Thing's rocky shell seemed somehow less weighted, he moved far to easy in it unlike he did in the previous installment; Sue was.. well... there was way too much hair spray; Johnny and Reed were just too clean. I'm sorry, but that seems to go against the trend to make things more believable in this decade. Batman Begins was almost perfect. Life for the Bat to be was dirty, violent and full of misery. You could at least feel some of his pain. The relationship between Susan and Reed were almost Barbie-ish. I was pleased to see Alicia (Kerry Washington) return - at least thing had some intimacy to balance his clobbering ability.While the movie had many weaknesses, as a story it was good. The Silver Surfer was undaunted in his focus, preparing the earth to be consumed by his master Galactus. For the most part, if I was between the ages of 12 and 21, I might have enjoyed it more... especially if I had read the graphic novels of the Fantastic Four (Then again, maybe not - specially if I was a purist). But reluctantly, as an old fat, I could watch the film and be critical of it simply because there really wasn't much there in the offering plate for me to munch on with a pleasant demeanor. The CGI, though good in some spots (the Galactus cloud creature as it starts to penetrate the Earths atmosphere was quite well done, and the Silver Surfer reminiscent of the T-1000 in Judgment Day), there were many other uses that just didn't seem to rise to the polish expected in a live action/CGI film.Aside from being almost short in it's running time (92 minutes), the story sometimes confused children, which was evident in the amount of chatter going on around me and my friends. There was one adult that took calls all the way through the film, and a carpool of kids behind us were eating something that required removal from a crackling cellophane that just got extremely annoying after the first 20 minutes. Parent bringing their 3 to 6 year old kids to this thing are just totally oblivious to the sensibility of raising children. They probably couldn't get a baby sitter, so they just allowed their kids to wanter the rows of seats and play on the outside isle steps. For a viewing audience, especially for this grumpy old turd, it just did nothing but aggravate the review of this movie to almost a negative experience.Mom? Dad? If your little kiddie seems to not really be interested in the film or is totally confused by it, it may mean the tyke is not ready for this stuff at this time in his/her development. Maybe your should wait for the DVD and pass up the theater experience. OK???? Thanks!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Show off!,"A sequel to 2005 box office winner, ""The Fantastic Four"", ""Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" sees director Tim Story and the original cast principals return for more super hero schlocky fun. The story is based around the Marvel stories that featured the first appearance of said ""Silver Surfer"" in the comic book franchise. Silver Surfer (Doug Jones with Laurence Fishburne dubbing the voice) is acting as a herald for the planet devouring Galactus, the next target? Earth. Which is a bit untimely as Reed Richards/Mr Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm/Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are trying to get married. Things are further problematic when after his first encounter with the Silver Surfer, Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Chris Evans) finds his powers a bit off - in fact when he touches any of the others I the team their powers are exchanged, much to Ben Grimm/The Thing's (Michael Chiklis) amusement. Not only that, but the military are starting to get heavy and annoyed with the four - and who is this back on the scene? Doctor Doom! (Julian McMahon) Thought he was dead, and how come he's in league with the military now? All of this issues must be addressed or the Earth will suffer the direst of consequences.Budgeted at $130 million, this sequel only just made its money back domestically, however, the Worldwide takings gave it an overall profit of nearly $160 million. Which when you consider that the first film (again raking the coin in) was met with very disdainful reviews (mostly warranted outside of Evans & Chiklis' efforts), it's somewhat surprising. Yet, and it's certainly no towering genre picture, ""Silver Surfer"" is a hugely enjoyable movie for fans of the source comics and the undemanding popcorn muncher. The fans, and I don't speak for all of them of course, should in the main be happy that the makers have been faithful to the origins of the story. There's also some nifty humour and both Alba and Gruffudd aren't as dull as they were in the first movie. Perhaps they are more comfortable now knowing that the paying public held sway over the critics?. Evans is still the best thing in the franchise (no surprise he would go on to play ""Captain America"" in ""The Avengers"" franchise), and the appearance of Andre Braugher as General Hager is a welcome edition. While the effects are considerably better than the poor fodder served up in the first movie - granted it wouldn't have been hard to improve on that score.With a lovely light hearted approach, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" does its job. In the pantheon of super hero movies it sits some where in the middle, neither great or bad, just honest wholesome family fun. 20th Century Fox have announced that a reboot of the franchise is to come, so while Chris Evans goes off to mouth wateringly play ""Captain America"", the next lot of actors are charged with the not so easy task of winning over a tough comic book crowd, and, the critics too. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A forgettable but fun sugar rush movie,"Okay, before we get into the meat of this analysis, let's get one thing perfectly clear: the Fantastic Four are NOT cool. They're too wholesome. Their teeth are too shiny and white. They look utterly ridiculous in those stupid blue jumpsuits they wear. Batman is cool. Spiderman is cool. The Fantastic Four, are not. But in some respects, this actually works in their favour.No no, hear me out, the reason why Rise of the Silver Surfer does a good job is because it does exactly what it says on the tin. You go in expecting frivolous nonsense that's cornier than a weekend in Kansas and that's precisely what you get. Unlike the bloated, over-complicated and over-ambitious Spiderman 3, it manages to deliver an energetic and fast paced storyline, decent special effects, eye-popping action sequences and all in a succinct hour and thirty three minutes. There's none of the ""let's cram as many villains in as possible"" approach that the web crawler had earlier this summer and while it's undeniable that this is definitely a superhero film with a kids market in mind, it still makes for an entertaining jolt of fun and a decent alternative if you get the family to the local multiplex only to find that Pirates 3 has sold out.Of course, it's not perfect by a long shot. Galactus for instance makes an eagerly anticipated screen appearance...for about thirty seconds, then vanishes. And if that wasn't bad enough fanboys, he's no longer a giant Roman Centurion wearing an over-sized purple helmet but an ominous looking cloud of dust, rock and magma that's come to eat your babies. Plus, there's a wealth of glaring plot holes that even the kids will be able to pick up on, like the American military letting a man who calls himself Doctor Doom into the middle of a top secret research facility. Perfect fodder indeed for anyone who may be getting a bit fed up with the continuing cycle of movies populated by photogenic spandex models and wants to have a good moan.This doesn't count for anything though so long as when you order apple pie, you want to receive apple pie. Rise of the Silver Surfer has flimsy characterisations, cheesy smiles and unnecessary romances aplenty, not to mention a couple of incredibly silly set pieces to get stuck into. The Human Torch's collision with Doom for instance is an absolute riot, as is the high speed mid air chase over the Great Wall of China, while the Silver Surfer unleashing his fury on the army is liable to make jaws drop. Older, cynical audiences may want to stay away but provided you haven't spent all your cash on the previous summer blockbusters, the continuing adventures of Rubber Man (Ioan Gruffudd), Orange Woman (Jessica Alba), Hulk 2 (Michael Chiklis) and Southern Fried (Chris Evans) are still an enjoyable sugar-rush for everyone that's still a kid at heart. Throwaway guff, but arguably better than Spiderman 3.And oh yeah, the Silver Surfer is totally, totally awesome.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horrible,"This movie was god awful. Horrible dialogue, horrible cast (Jessica Alba can't act), a storyline that dragged on and didn't really cut the chase. Like the first movie, there was horrible character development. Poor direction led to really corny camera shots as well. Why do they keep making these movies? This was absolutely terrible. I hope that they do not end up making a 3rd movie as it was hinted, because it will turn out even crappier than the 1st and the 2nd. This wasn't Fantastic 4, it was more like Horrendous 4. It was the most painful hour and thirty minutes of my life. If you just want to watch a movie for effects, then you will enjoy the movie. You might also be mentally retarded, but that's OK. I felt like busting out my iPod halfway through the movie, and then proceeded to go in and out of consciousness. I want my $7.50 back.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Flame On, Guys! (Wasn't That a Song by the Village People?)","I'm used to being in the minority when it comes to movies. But usually, I hate movies that everyone else seems to love. It's much rarer that there will be a movie almost universally disliked, but which I actually enjoyed. ""Fantastic Four"" is one of those.Maybe by the time I saw this I was just sick of all the brooding, psychologically complex superheroes out there and found a good old-fashioned cheesy comic book movie refreshing. What I like about this story is that the Fantastic Four have their superpowers foisted on them, and then have to figure out how to use them. They have a regular Joe quality to them that makes them easier to relate to. They don't have sinister back stories full of murdered parents, ugly childhoods, seething feelings of revenge. They're just geeky scientists who can do pretty cool things.People seem to be responding to the second installment, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" marginally better than they did the first, but I like both of them. After the overblown mess that was the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy and all of the dithery angst that filled Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" series, it's nice to sit back and let 90 minutes of fun, worry free action adventure cleanse the palate.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Simpering, vacuous cliché-fest. Best watched with bemused incredulity. Or when very drunk.","Well this was truly dreadful. Starting with the positive, the VFX were of average standard, and imaginatively realised in places. The score created the brief moments of atmosphere there were. But there is no rescuing this horribly over-sentimental and (surely?) badly adapted film.I had always thought Ioan Gruffudd a reasonable actor from his several appearances in British drama, but I stand corrected by his god-awful performance here. However, standing as it does next to the feeble acting abilities of the other leads, it sets a standards you wish the others would aspire to.Alas, they don't. They are not helped, of course, by the revoltingly clichéd screenplay, with its ham-fisted wise-cracking 'humour' (provided mostly, and relentlessly, by the daft rock-based thing), and the constant preaching of all-American family values. Then there is the absence of any coherent story, riddled as it is with numerous plot-holes, inconsistencies, and characters being SO stereotyped (Army general, anyone?)that one can only laugh at the seriousness with which they woodenly phone in their hackneyed and predictable dialogue. It really is painful to watch in places.And deeply, though unintentionally funny in others. The ridiculously named villain, 'Victor Von Doom' hands in a performance that is as threatening and intimidating as a tossed salad, and every line he perfunctorily regurgitates raises a smile for all the wrong reasons. I might venture that he 'just looks a tit'.This is a horrible film in almost every way. I could tell you the plot, but it's rubbish, so I won't waste your time. I haven't read the comic, and almost certainly won't if this was anything approaching an accurate testament to it. I sincerely hope it wasn't, and that comic fans feel equally let down.The VFX team and the composer should leave the room and head for the pub, feeling, I'd hope, that they have contributed the only redeeming features of this unrewarding film, but everyone else involved should hang their heads in shame, and aim to do better next time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Super Powerless.,"Laughably awful and downright boring cinematic canine has the titled characters (led by Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd) attempting to save the world from a mysterious alien being who literally glides around causing destruction on a surfboard and foretelling the doom of the entire planet. Never making much sense, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" tries to get all cutesy by trying to cater to 10-year-old boys with low brow humor and then never creating much suspense or coherency with a screenplay that feels like it was thrown together a few minutes before the cast showed up to start shooting. Even Julian McMahon, who actually carried the first one to its mediocre standing, succumbs to the sheer idiocy of this entire venture. Hopeless. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Last but not least for this summary release,"With a livelier script and stronger production values, this sequel far outdoes the 2004 original. Funnier comedy, more interesting characters and much slicker effects work make it a terrific guilty pleasure.The Fantastic Four are having trouble balancing their professional and personal lives. Reed and Sue (Gruffudd and Alba) can't get married without being interrupted by a crisis. Johnny (Evans) can't settle down with a girl, not that he's trying. And Ben (Chiklis) is made of stone, although his girlfriend (Washington) doesn't seem to mind. Now the world is about to be devoured by an evil force heralded by a glistening silver guy on a surf board (Jones, with Fishburne's voice). And they may need to team up with nemesis Victor Von Doom (McMahon) to save the planet.The filmmakers strike a humorous tone early on, combining a colourful comic book design with goofy comedy to get us chuckling. Jokes about invasive paparazzi and corporate sponsorship abound, even as both are the franchise's bread and butter. And the wink-nudge innuendo will keep kids feeling like they're watching something vaguely grown up, even though any TV sitcom takes things far further than this tame movie. Meanwhile, we know the wackiness will soon be interrupted by something nefarious and earth-threatening.And it's pretty impressive. After a slightly awkward plot set-up, things kick into gear, combining thrilling action with genuinely clever gags (the power-swapping is ingenious). It's great to see a full-on London effects sequence, as well as subtle references to, of all things, rendition and human rights issues. Yes, it's still simplistic, with the requisite boneheaded military idiot (Braugher) and some extremely random scenes, but it's also thoroughly cool--especially the foursome's new vehicle and the surfer himself. There's also an intriguingly serious final twist. Ish.Clearly, Stan Lee and Marvel have an obsession with embarrassing disco dancing this year (see also Spider-man 3). But it helps that the cast are having a lot more fun this time. They're engagingly relaxed and allowed to deepen the characters and play around with the iconography. Honestly, this is how the first film should have been, and it bodes well for more to come.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Let's Go Surfing,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Tim Story and the entire gang are back from the first film only this time the Silver Surfer adds a touch of class. The initial chase scene with Johnny Storm and the Surfer makes the film worth the price of admission.Yes, there is a bit too much relationship mush and scientific mumbo-jumbo, but this group was never meant to be an overly charismatic group except when they are saving the world. I will say, Jessica Alba seems a bit more annoying this time around, both in her fake tan looks and her whiny-bride act. Still, it is fun when they go into full ""fantastic"" mode.Laurence Fishburne is the voice of the Silver Surfer and all scenes involving this fascinating character are a bit more exciting than the rest. Ion Gruffudd, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis fill out the rest of the FOUR, and Julian McMahon is back from the dead as Victor Von Doom. It is set up for yet another sequel, and who can blame them as long as there is an interest from the fans. Don't expect classic film-making, just go for the light hearted fun and special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the first movie but still suffers from some of the same problems.,"What I sometimes like about sequels is that they make seem that the film-makers have learned from their previous mistake during the last movie. This was previously for instance the case with the other superhero movies ""X2"", which was a better movie than ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man 2"", which was better than the first movie. This movie also learned from some of its mistakes it previous made in ""Fantastic Four"". Well, not all though.What it definitely learned was that it needed some more fun in it. The movie is more entertaining to watch and there is some more comedy to enjoy as well this time.Unfortunately the story is just as weak and gets also brought just as weak as was the case with the previous. The main plot just never gets developed good enough and the movie seems too much in love with its four main characters. The ending just also seems to come out of nowhere because of that, since how, when, why just never got explained good enough. Luckily it has the Silver Surfe in it this time, who still nice to spice up things.There also is some more action but it also gives you the feeling it is not enough or it certainly isn't big enough.The special effects have definitely been improved this time, which makes the movie more convincing to watch. Also the make-up for The Thing seemed to had been even more improved but Jessica Alba's chest on the other hand was still as distracting as ever, which is not a bad thing though.Basically all the characters from the first movie return and then there are also some new additions to the cast this time. The Silver Surfer is a welcome addition and he is a good looking and also interesting character. But you can wonder if it was necessary for the movie to bring Dr. Doom back. You sort of feel that the only reason they included his character was because when was being hinted at a sequel, during the previous movie, it was hinted that his character had survived. But you can actually really wonder if his character for this movie really adds anything and was necessary at all.Just basically some good simple fun, as long as your expectations for it aren't too high.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

His voice radiated coolness and the seamless scene of his coursing through the air and demolishing things was the films guilty-pleasure highlight.But overall this film is as campy, stupid, and childish as the first one.

What All Comic Book SuperHero Movies Should Be...,"I'm sure the critics and naysayers of this film will take exception to my review, but I loved this! As a longtime fan of the Fantastic Four comic, I went into the first movie with fairly low expectations, and was very pleasantly surprised to the contrary. Not a great superhero movie, but a really fun one, a trait that far too many films based on comic books seem to be lacking. Having enjoyed the FF the first time around, I went into this second one with much higher expectations - and it exceeded them on almost every level! The same feeling of fun was there, along with some real blow-you-out-of-your-seat action sequences, and what I thought was a pretty good storyline. Perhaps I'm too undemanding or simple-minded, but I had a Fantastic(!) time in the theater watching this movie. In many ways, it blew me away like no movie has in a good many years, and made me feel like a kid again! Of course it helped that along with the FF, the Silver Surfer has always been one of my favorite comic characters. If I have one complaint, it's that it ended too soon. I hated for it to be over after only 92 minutes. Hopefully when the DVD is released they'll include a longer extended version as well (or as in the case with the first movie, they'll wait two years until the third one comes out, and make us buy the second movie on DVD all over again). I really hate that sort of marketing ploy, but in the case of FF2, it will gladly shell out my money twice. Mostly because I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I think I'll start working on my new home theater system tomorrow!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not so fantastic,"Just saw this in a rather bizarre ""regional Premiere"". The film had its good moments, particularly Stan Lee's cameo and some of the other lighter moments which continued to establish the camaraderie of the Four, whilst some of the stunts and special effects were sufficiently spectacular.The early build-up in the film was reasonably well-paced as the enigmatic surfer wreaked havoc over much of the globe, but the climax failed to build up adequate tension and ends with something of an unexplained deus ex machina.Finally you end up being left with a feeling of ""so what?"" There is some light entertainment in this film but little emotional involvement, as the short run-time (less than ninety minutes) scarcely allows for more than by-the-numbers plotting.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A World Dies,"There isn't a single thing to like in this project. No appealing, interesting or attractive characters. No jokes. No cool effects. No engaging story. Nothing.I think I am giving up on the Marvel producers. They don't seem to know much about making a movie. I'm writing this as it is freshly in theaters and the competition is so strong I do not expect this to last a week. Rottentomatoes has this at severely rotten. So for once, my values overlap with most other folks. Hooray.I think the problem is simple. If this had appeared 8 years ago, it would be a hit.The way they make these things is to start from a comic notion. Then derive a comic-like storyboard, after having some high school make a story of course, but stories don't matter in these things. The point is that there's a comic book, flat perspective, key frame oriented perspective in how this is imagined.But the competition has evolved. Now we have flitting cameras, three dimensional action, overt introspection, occasionally some effective drama. And the competition is created first as a film, and then brought to us through production techniques (like preanimation) that de- emphasize the two dimensional eye.This form is dead. I suppose it will live for a while in anime, where two dimensions leverages some Japanese pictorial techniques that work. But marvel is dead until they reinvent themselves in film.

It was okay.,"This movie is an improvement over the first one, but it still falls short of expectations. The actors do an okay job, but the movie is messy and lacks coherence. Jessica Alba starts off weak but improves as the movie progresses. Chris Evans is annoying at first but becomes more tolerable later on. Ioan Gruffudd's portrayal of Reed is decent, and Michael Chiklis delivers a steady performance throughout. Julian McMahon's portrayal of Doctor Doom is forgettable, and the Silver Surfer's character lacks development. The cinematography is satisfactory, but the CGI is dated and not very impressive. The music is passable but nothing spectacular.The main issues with the movie are the editing and pacing. The first 30 minutes are not very engaging and feel like a continuation of the problems from the first movie. The wedding scene is uninteresting, and the issues from the first movie are still present. Things get better once the Silver Surfer shows up, but the movie still feels rushed. The powers trading subplot is unnecessary, and everything after the Silver Surfer's appearance feels rushed and lacks momentum.Overall, I would not recommend this movie unless you are a die-hard Fantastic Four fan. Even then, I suggest skipping the first movie and watching this one instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Quite an improvement over the first film, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is actually a good bit of light-hearted fun that is sadly overlooked and underrated.","There's something about the two ""Fantastic Four"" movies that makes it impossible for me to dislike them as some others do. For a while, I couldn't put my finger on it. Then I just sort-of realized the simple truth- these are fun films. They are light-hearted. They are silly.And that's why I like them. In an age where just about every single other Superhero film has to be dark, gritty and practically psychologically scarring (including the recently released ""Man of Steel"" where Superman of all people has a vision of being drowned in skulls), I just appreciate that 20th Century Fox and director Tim Story were content with giving us a fun, fluffy set of films to enjoy. It's almost admirable that a studio could look at a comic book and say ""Hey, let's make a film out of this that the whole family could enjoy!""And I do have to say, while not a particularly strong film, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (no, it's not called ""4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", to the people who insist it is), is actually one of my favorite ""dumb fun"" movies, and I think it is a much better film than the first. (Although I will admit the first is a definite guilty- pleasure for me) It's a film I can pop in after a rough day and know that within 15 minutes, I'll be chuckling and having fun for it's relatively short running length.The story begins with the titular Silver Surfer (an alien entity that resembles a human, only with metallic, silver-like skin, who rides on a surf-board like vehicle) arriving on Earth, causing various climactic and weather phenomena. At the same time, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) are preparing for their big wedding day, amongst a media circus, as the ""Fantastic Four"" have become huge celebrities during the films. However, after a disastrous (and pretty exciting) action sequence, the Four (also including ""Ben Grimm/Thing"" as portrayed by Michael Chiklis and ""Johnny Storm/Human Torch"" as portrayed by Chris Evans) are forced to abandon the wedding in order to learn more about the Silver Surfer and what dark forces he may be an omen to, as well as contend with the return of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who they are forced into an uneasy alliance with.I think the cast works a lot better here. As was the case in the first film, Gruffudd and Chiklis are the strongest performers, but I feel that Alba and Evans do a good job as well, and play their characters more naturally and evenly this time around. And it makes the chemistry of the characters all the better. McMahon is also good once again as Von Doom. And the two new actors portraying the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones as the physical body performer and Laurence Fishburne as the voice) do a wonderful job bringing the iconic character to life. Supporting roles by the likes of Andre Braugher and Kerry Washington are also well-played and a lot of fun on-screen.I think the script this time around is what makes this a better film. The first film's script had a lot of issues. It meandered and was too overlong for the sort of story it was trying to tell. It made the clichés and some of the flatter jokes stand out more. Here, we have a much better pacing, less meandering with the shorter length and the characters are showcased a lot better. It also doesn't hurt that some of the subplots this time around are actually a ton of fun, and easier to relate to than in the first film. And it has a better balance of action-to-story, which was a big issue with the first film. (In that the first film barely had any action, whereas here, there's a pretty decent amount)Director Tim Story is also a bit more in his element this time around. Part of my issue with the direction in the first film is that it felt a little plain. I think in part because it was Story's first big action film. Now that he's had experience, the action is a lot better, and feels more exciting and organic. It's genuinely a lot more fun this time around. He also seems to have learned some lessons by the mistakes of the first film.Asides from that, I think the rest of the production is quite nice. The effects are generally good. The set and costume design is great. And John Ottman's score is a lot of fun.I honestly do consider this to be a good, fun film. And I think it is tragically, criminally under-recognized and underrated. I was actually sort-of sad when it was announced that Fox had plans to reboot the series, because after this film, I wanted to see a third entry in the series. I wanted to see more work from this cast. And it's a shame that we won't have that chance now, because I think a third film could have potentially even been better.But as it stands, the two ""Fantastic Four"" movies are a lot of fun. And I would recommend both of them (this one in particular as it is the better of the two) to anyone seeking a good, silly, fun time with a good, silly, fun film.I give ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shame it was the last one in the series,"(because the failed reboot doesn't even count)
I thought this was a very nice sequel to the opening film, which had explained how our heroes gained their strange powers and set the stage for an enduring franchise. So I'm sorry there won't be any more follow ups by this engaging cast, since Chris Evans has become overly identified with the very successful Captain America franchise now. What I don't understand is the hostility of some people towards the film, particularly criticism of the acting by an excellent cast from people weaned on the sort of pap served up on US TV and at Saturday matinees. I could understand it if comic book fans had found glaring differences to the Marvel originals, but as films I think they stand up very well and I'm sure they will be well regarded by posterity. Right now there seem to be far too many people with personal axes to grind, which helps to explain the dire state of the country's political situation.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Painful 4: The death of a series,"I was reading through the other comments for this movie, and was very surprised when I actually found some positive remarks on this movie, so I decided to write a comment myself.First of all, I'm not a Fantastic 4 fan at all, so this is not a die hard review from a comic book fan, however this does not save the movie at all.There are actually more problems in this movie then can be explained in writing if you seek to understand what makes this movie hell on earth, I suggest you sit down and watch it, if you take this reviewers opinion on how bad it is I would however stay far far away from it.Problems: Jessica Alba's acting is worse then ever, its heart breaking to see such a nice piece of ass be so insanely bad at acting.Special effects where bad, and I mean REALLY bad, I know people have been saying that ""uhh the silver surfer was sooo shiny"", well pal of mine that doesn't mean squad. IF you want to base an entire movie on special effects they better be up to the challenge, but they aren't special effects in most computer games are way better.Flame on looks like a yellow retard with goofy lights shining.The Thing still looks like a jelly man, not at all convincing that he is made of stone.Mr. Fantastic, has a horrifying dancing scene that will make you puke bad effects for a week.But if the special effects, and the acting weren't bad enough, the plot tops them all delivering a mindblowingly bad story. Alba's char. is so badly developed that she is plain annoying, she worries more about her marriage then the end of the earth, Goodjob for a superhero woman. And to be honest I really can't remember the ending except the good guys winning, don't know how, I saw this movie once when it came out, and I actually forgot ever seeing it, so when i saw it again today, I felt like when big bad dejavu ala. Matrix changing my death from a car accident, to drowning.I must say, if they manage to scoop up another billion dollar for another painful film, I would be very surprised, and I really hope it doesn't happen, cause damn we deserve to be rid of painful big budget movies like this piece of crap.

A Slightly Better Fantastic Farce!,"The sequel to 2005's Fantastic Four finds itself in a position where it has improved slightly, but not enough to categorize it as a ""good movie"". Now don't get me wrong, the cinematography is great, but everything else, not so much.The CGI in the movie is awesome, it's all very well-made, especially the Silver Surfer. Lots of nice little effects here and there as well such as explosions and other stuff. Despite how lame I think it is that Galactus is shown as an enormous gaseous being (or being in a gaseous surrounding, whatever), it's still a very cool-looking gaseous being.Now that we've got the good stuff out of the way, we can focus in on the negatives. There are a number of cringe-worthy scenes in the movie that involve stale jokes and imbecilic one-liners as well as how the actors get across some of the emotional aspects of the film. Now I, as any man, love Jessica Alba, but however much it pains me to say anything negative about her, she should just quit acting and find a career in modeling. Every scene I watched with her in had me sighing heavily with my head down, rolling my eyes. That's not to say Ioan Gruffudd or Julian McMahon were any better, which they weren't. The same goes for them as well, however, they're very good in some of their other works.If you're looking for a deep, heavy movie that satisfies your ""abstract movie"" needs, then look further, this isn't the movie you're looking for.

Not bad,"""4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" surfs the line between mediocrity and potential with a 6/10 rating, and I have to admit, it was just okay. The actors, especially Chris Evans as the Human Torch, bring a certain charisma to their roles, but the film's humor often feels forced. The film editing keeps the plot moving, though it occasionally veers into clichéd territory. The film's strength lies in its introduction of the enigmatic Silver Surfer, a character with fascinating potential, but it struggles with the execution of the villain, Galactus.

"Solid set-up, but falls apart in the second half","Released in 2007, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" continues the adventures of the Fantastic Four with Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue (Jessica Alba) getting married, but their wedding is interrupted by a literal herald of global destruction, the Silver Surfer (voiced by none other than Laurence Fishburne). Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon return as The Thing, the Human Torch and Dr. Doom respectively, not to mention Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters. Andre Braugher and Beau Garrett are on hand as General Hager and Capt. Frankie Raye.I've been a fan of the Fantastic Four since my childhood and felt that the 2005 movie was a very good set-up for the series despite fumbling the ball with Dr. Doom and a mediocre action climax. With the presence of the Silver Surfer and Galactus I was expecting a great sequel, but it was not to be. The first half is quite good, however, with the main cast comfortable in their roles and obviously having a good time. But something goes awry in the second half where the proceedings get dull. It's hard to pinpoint the problem, but clearly they needed to work some kinks out in the script. On the positive side, Dr. Doom is better portrayed than in the first film. Despite my criticisms, there's enough good here to give ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" a lukewarm 'thumbs up,' just don't expect greatness.The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in British Columbia, California, New York City, Germany (The Black Forest), China, Japan and Greenland.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"Wow. What a pile of crap. There is not one interesting or heartfelt scene in this entire movie. The jokes fall flat and the acting is just as bad. I really feel bad for Ioan Gruffudd because, he is such a better actor than he has shown in these forgettable films. Then there is Jessica Alba. Can someone please explain to me, what so many people see in her? Why is she so popular? Her performance in this film is just laughable. She seriously can't be taken seriously as an actress. "" Why are you trying to destroy us?"" ""Look, I'm trying to help you. But in order for me to do that, you need to tell me the truth. Please!"" Then there is the plastic faced actor Julian McMahon. Is he supposed to be intimidating? Or am I just lost?",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent and watchable movie,"Would give a 6.5/10, this is not a 7/10.
The first start is better and had good pacing? The movie has some cool action scenes and soundtrack and decent cgi.Enjoyable pop corn flick but nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This was so lame.,"Crummy acting, crap dialogue, and comic inaccuracy. A kid in kindergarten could've made up a better story. This movie sucked from every aspect. Watching Alba doing her mime push was just so lame... ""I'm a sthooper hero!"" I'm sorry but Alba can't act her way out of a paper bag.Main gripe is that Galactus didn't look like Galactus and he died waaaaaaay too easily. The writers of this obviously didn't even glance at the comics... though it's hard to believe Stan Lee would have signed off on this load of crap. He's f-ing Galactus! He's WAAAAAY stronger than the Surfer... and he's killed by an explosion that doesn't even wipe the Surfer out for good? What the f*** is this??! And don't you think the Surfer is moral enough to do this as soon as he learns of his true identity? The Surfer isn't so selfish that he would put his life before countless others. This show was so f-ing LAME!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Can the 4 once again prove their worth?,"From the start it seems like Superman Returns. A planet blows up, credits. and the film isn't even called Fantastic 4: insert subtitle here, but merely 4: insert. Does this mean they aren't fantastic anymore? It'd appear so.From the get go on earth the team are like modern day Paris Hiltons, everything about their life is in the papers, and paparazzi are just overpowering the wedding of Sue and Reed, causing problems even for our beloved Stan Lee in his finest cameo, comedic wise at last, and at least it's not cheesy, i mean, 'Amazing how one man really can make a difference"" ? But, not to spoil the brilliance for anyone, the movie, as stated everywhere in the build up, is all about the awesome action in the film. Yeah, OK, that may be, but mixing awesome action with CGI that looks remotely realistic wouldn't go amiss, i know it's a comic book, but it's not a cartoon adaptation, real people don't look or plastic-esquire you know!Gripes apart, and there is one other that pops up later, the film is a testament to the belief that the last one was good but not enough. More comedy, more action and less of the plot problems, rather they add a new character, they work as a team, and Doom comes back and just as quickly turns on everyone in what can only be described as the moment the makers were hoping would make the film a PG-13 in America for reputation, unlucky guys, apparently.Going from London to China to Japan, i think, and Germany, and just in New York, where the Baxter Building's roof now has glass on the top in the shape of their logo :) It's dizzying, and a little too fast, when in all they could have gotten it done slower with more breathing space between random action that rots your brain until you go, oh, it's almost over, but wait, they have to wrap it up, come on, okay, that's it, yep, oh, you aren't going to die? Damn, my smile has dissappeared from my face.See, spoiling without spoiling, me so clever. The acting is average, Alba really annoying with them glasses randomly, and just not being great, she never is, but Evans and Chiklis showing great chemistry once again as everyone's favourites, and even more a-fussin' and a-feudin'.On top of that, add the grandiose 4plane, the great Doug Jones doing what he does best, take that you motion capture wuss Serkis Jones knows how to not be human, unless the Pale Man really is what he is like... And Lawrence Fishburne adds deep bass and humanoid-ity to the Surfer, who, considering i never liked him, kind of showed me his worth, and although the film should be called Silver Surfer meets the Fantastic Four, as it's more his movie than their's, especially the final battle, the film keeps it's tone high, take that darker sequels, yes Spidey, AWE and X3! funny, silly, and despite poor graphics in some bits, and annoying moments including bad pacing, the film is just as good as the original, and shows promise once again that the next Fantastic Four could be a little longer and a lot less about Sue... 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit of nostalgia and a look at F4 from today,"Both movies are definitely underrated.If I give an overview, yes they are weak in terms of story but the character portrayals, atmosphere, cgi etc. Are better than most superhero productions today and yes they are still fun to watch today.Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom are especially good cast, also Silver Surfer's appearance in this movie is the best in all superhero movies.Finally, the depiction of Galactus is very debatable, but considering the period and production cost of the film, it was a good handling. Perhaps if he had been portrayed as expected, he would probably have been seen in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, but oh-so-cheesy and predictable","Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, was supposed to be one of the big summer events, but over all didn't make it as huge of an impact as expected, but I was hearing pretty good things from my friends who saw it. But I wanted to wait for the rental since I really wasn't into the first one, the first one just was so silly and didn't keep my attention. I have to say that Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer was definitely better than I expected and so much better than the original Fantastic Four, but I think I will probably skip out on the next sequel, this just isn't my type of super hero story. But that's the way Marvel has always been, very cheesy and silly, but the hero's always save the day. I think also I'm having a problem since Jessica Alba is getting nothing but the ""hot factor"" publicity lately, so I can't help but be sarcastic during her scenes where it seems like she really can't act, no offense to her. But Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is just glitzy effects with a fun story.The fantastic four are back and Sue and Reed are about to get married, but that is quickly interrupted when a planet eating rock is about to destroy their world. The Silver Surfer is destroying country by country and when they get ahold of him they know his surfing board is the source of his power and if put into the wrong hands, well, things could just get so much worse. But the fantastic four ban together to save the world once again.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is definite entertainment, a lot of special effects and a decent story, but the actors are still not that great in my opinion. I feel actually so bad because I know there are a lot of comic book fans who love this kind of story and grew up with the fantastic four, but I guess I should just stick to Batman, I prefer the darker stuff, for super hero's I always thought that yeah, they should have some cheesiness to the story, but not when it takes over the whole film, you know? But I would recommend if you're just looking for a fun little action film, it is major eye candy, I'm talking mostly about Jessica Alba though, lol, just kidding.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Certainly an improvement over the first film,"In 2005 ""Twentieth Century Fox"" released ""Fantastic Four"" to mixed to poor reviews. This reviewer, himself, also was quite disappointed. Now, in the summer of 2007, the sequel is up but is it an improvement over the first film? Well, the good news for you readers is that it is an improvement over the first film but by how much.Sometime after the first film, the fantastic four believe that life is back to normal. Reed Richards and Sue Storm plan to get married and the four are celebrities. Suddenly their plans are interrupted when the great Galactus plans to destroy planet Earth, by sending his henchman, the Silver Surfer, to the planet. The four have another problem to deal with too; their old enemy, Doctor Von Doom, is still alive and wants his revenge. With their own enemy back and their world in danger, can the fantastic four save the day?All of the fun aspects of the first film are in the sequel. The relationship between Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) still brings good comic relief. There is a bit more humor in this one as well. The special effects and action scenes are a lot better this time around. They really did not try to do anything more then just make it a quick 92 minute summer comic book movie. Keep your eyes out for the Stan Lee cameo too.The things the first one was lacking are improved in this one. This reviewer already talked about the better special effects and action scenes, as well as the humor and the Stan Lee cameo. Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) is back and was given a more menacing, less cheesy role. He is not at the point of where he should be but it was a lot better then the first film. Ioan Gruffudd did a much better job portraying Reed Richards, though he still suffers because of the bad chemistry between the love interest Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) and him.The real highlight is the Silver Surfer (aka Norrin Radd). The look and design of his is amazing. From the combination of Doug Jones in a motion capture suit, similar to Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and Lawrence Fishburne's voice, the Silver Surfer was everything you would have wanted. While this reviewer will admit that Lawrence Fishburne's voice sounded out of place in the beginning but by the time the film gets rolling you love the voice work. Some may complain that the Silver Surfer looked too much like the T-1000 from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" but the surfer looked exactly like he did from the comic book so there is no problem. The best scenes in the movie somehow involved the Silver Surfer. WETA really did do a great job bringing him to life.Now that the positives were discussed it is time for the negatives. Jessica Alba, whose only talent is her looks, is still a lousy actress. It is a weird to think that her character actually had more chemistry between her brother and her then with her own love interest. Another negative, and positive, was the humor. There is more humor but many of the jokes felt too forced, some of them worked and some of them did not. In addition, it took a little while, thirty minutes approximately, for things to get going and actually start picking up. Luckily once the action hit it never slowed down. For those major comic book fans, they do a huge butcher job to the Silver Surfer/ Galactus storyline. It bothered this reviewer a little but not as much as it could for the hardcore fans that grew up with it.In conclusion, if you are sick of those big epic movies that are over two and a half hours, like ""Spider-Man 3"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,"" you might want to check this one out. It is not the greatest movie you will see this summer but it is still a fun time and a big improvement over the first. Is it worth over $9 at the cinema? Well it depends on what you are looking for, but this reviewer got his $9 worth. ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is recommended!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie Review: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"When the trailer is better than the movie, what does it says about the movie? That is how Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer turns out to be. I'm going to be wicked. The filmmakers should rename the sequel to 2005's Fantastic Four to Plastic Flaw: Fall of the Silver Surfer.The hardest review to write is having nothing good to write about. So if you, the reader expect any good here then you may be disappointed. There could be a couple of things good but mostly there are more, I shouldn't say bad, but just not good.I really liked how the Silver Surfer looks in the movie but it is just that for a film based on the comic-book genre, it is awfully thin. (Comic books may be thin in physical appearance but they are usually big on ideas and graphics) When I say thin, I'm thinking three things, the script, the CGI (except the Silver Surfer) and Jessica Alba.I liked 2005's Fantastic Four despite it being critically bombarded by many reviewers. It is at least entertaining and I could relate to the feelings of each Fantastic Four characters. This sequel however gave nothing valuable for the price of an entry ticket.What happened? I needed some answers. Let us check what shuffling was done in the production shall we?A check on the crew list reflected a change in the personnel that did the screenplay. Mark Frost and Michael France who did the screenplay in the first film were no longer there. Actually it was only Michael France who was missing. The two of them gave Fantastic Four some very interesting and fun dialogues that a comic-book genre movie needs. That part is not apparent in Rise of the Silver Surfer. The screenplay turned out to be bland, uninspiring and mostly uninteresting. It was hardly moving and nobody's even laughing at the funnier scenes.Mark Frost and Don Payne did the screenplay instead. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is loosely adapted from the stories in the original comic book. And according to Don Payne, the story in the film is based on Fantastic Four #48, where Galactus makes an appearance and #57-60 where Doctor Doom steals the Silver Surfer's powers.Mark Frost was also the one who wrote the story and it was OK. Why does the film need a storywriter? Isn't it based on the Marvel comic book? Lest you forget, a film still needs to be written so it can be played out on the big screen.If you're not a comic book fan or if you had not read Fantastic Four then you should be as clueless as I am. As good as the Silver Surfer looks with that chrome body of his that is all so cool, the movie did not tell us who he really is except that he was once named Norrin Radd and he works for something or someone known as Galactus, who or what looks like a cosmic storm cloud and is said to be a devourer of planets.I cannot imagine what the fans will think of this film. I can only guess they will be disappointed.If you had read this far then I think you are interested to find out more so here goes and I'll lead you into the film.The movie begins with the Silver Surfer flying away from an exploding planet and into earth. Bursting through the air space in various parts of earth, he caused a climatic shift that sees snow fall in Egypt. Large craters then appears and it was found that every planet that the Silver Surfer goes, it dies in eight days.Meanwhile the Fantastic Four has gotten used to their extraordinary lives with the Human Torch (Chris Evans) seemingly enjoying much of the limelight. The Thing (Michael Chiklis) having found love with the blind Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) after his wife left him because of his hideous looks is looking OK. Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffuld) and Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are getting married. Everything is looking all right until the Silver Surfer arrives and mess up their lives again.Quarreling and fighting, the team of four with their diverse persona will come clashing with one another. Underneath their appearance is another layer of skin that cannot be seen with the eyes. That part needs to be understood by those who care. Who are they?With the earth's existence threatened, the team of four needs to work out their differences to save the world. Things are not helped by the return of power hungry Victor or Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon), the villain from the first film who has escaped his captivity in Latveria. Evil as he is, he has a different agenda although first appearing to be helpful.How can the Fantastic Four save earth from a force so powerful that devours cosmic planets? Look to the title of this film for the answer.The plot is interesting isn't it? I thought so too. But if you refer to the top, I changed the name of the movie. Plastic Flaw because even as a film that relies on CGI and special effects as its selling points, it is flawed in appearance. Everything except for the Silver Surfer looks only superficial and adds nothing new to what we had already seen before. And Fall of the Silver Surfer because the Silver Surfer fell off his board quite literally just as the movie did.Watch if you're a fan because surely you will. And watch if you've got 90 minutes to kill. But if it is an entertaining, inspiring and fantastic movie you're looking for then you'll need to look elsewhere.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is not fantastic, just ordinary.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fairly Fantastic...,"Fantastic Four: The Rise Of The Silver Surfer is a story loosely based on its Marvel Comic counterpart. The story stays fairly faithful to its comic counterpart, with few changes in the Surfer's abilities.This show in essence, is a fairly good movie. It has amazing CGI effects, and fairly good acting. Being a fairly short movie, it is a good movie to watch and forget. This movie may not be an award winner, but it is definitely worth watching to pass time. However, the show relies too much on Jessica Alba to market the show. Action is not as lacking as it was in the first movie. It is definitely a better then the first movie. It is a show still worth watching, albeit being slightly less then Fantastic.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The only connection to the comic; This mess rates in the Negative Zone!!,"I'm pretty critical about most film, but I've never been a snob about genre. I've seen great, visionary work in Action, Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy, Drama... you name it.I've also been reading the Fantastic Four comics for 30 years. As a kid, I used to dream about my favorite heroes making the leap to the big screen. This type of film is a complete embarrassment to the comic, which (as a medium) has been so maligned over the years as a lowbrow form of entertainment. If the comics are lowbrow, this celluloid atrocity is NO-brow.First, let me comment on the cast: Ben Grimm (The Thing) is supposed to be a mammoth, imposing creature. NOT an ""aww-shucks"" curmudgeon that constantly stares at his feet and apologizes to anyone he brushes against, or even startles from a distance! I felt like I was watching Shemp!! Pathetic. Sue Storm (Invisible Girl) looks like a Volkswagen full of clowns crashed into her face! If you have to put THAT much effort into convincing us that this is a blond-haired, blue-eyed all-American girl-next-door, why bother? They've bastardized the whole thing so badly already; why not just leave Alba as she is? Otherwise, just cast someone who actually FITS the part! It's not like Alba is any great actress. ""Why does this always happen to ME?"" (as opposed to it happening to anyone else) laments the oaken-spoken Invisible girl, after an embarrassing scene wherein she becomes visible just after she loses her clothes? I don't know, Jessica.... Is it because you're the only one who can go from visible to INvisible? If you meant that this SITUATION always happens to you, wouldn't you put the emphasis on ANY OTHER WORD besides ""ME""??? Just awful. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic).... I understand the need to give the stiff-collared, human computer a ""hip"" overhaul for today's young audience... but this schlemiel bears NO resemblance to his comic book namesake. He's about 20 years too young, he's a SHRIMP (Reed should be thin, but tall) and, as an actor, he ranks a notch below Dan Marino! NEXXXTT!!! Johnny Storm (Human Torch) is probably the only redeeming interpretation of an FF member in the film. He's cocky, impetuous and a superstar w/ the ladies. His performance caused me no pain. No complaints.As far as the story and the dialogue go.... UGH. This is where I draw the line. Over 60% of this dog focuses on just how difficult it is for super-heroes to have a wedding. WHO CARES? That is no basis for a whole STORYLINE. The whole mess amounts to incessant, insipid and puerile dialogue that gets ZERO miles to the gallon. If you're going to put these characters under a microscope this way, write some dialogue that doesn't sound like a passage from Goofus & Gallant! The characters, again, were so off-the-mark that I thought I might begin to throw up, and never stop. Reed Richards, with a little prodding, becomes a high-steppin' chick magnet on the dance floor? I needed a double scotch after that one.Doctor Doom was just a pointless addition, and his character is so far removed from what Doom is all about, they may as well have left his entire screen-time on the cutting-room floor.This is, perhaps, the most witless script I have ever cringed through. Stan Lee's writing was like TOLSTOY compared to this abortion. As big a fan as I am of the FF comics, I held off on seeing EITHER FF movie in the theatre, and after suffering through this wince-a-thon, I know my decision was justified.Lastly, the special effects looked like something that Sid & Marty Krofft cobbled together after smoking some Sigmund. The above-referenced sequence featuring our Mr. Fantastic on the disco floor had the most pathetic ""stretch"" effects you can imagine. The Thing looks like a fat brick-layer from Paterson, NJ. He can't comfortably sit on an airplane seat? The Thing would need an entire two ROWS, people. The Silver Surfer looked OK, but the mercurial terminator from Terminator 2 (SIXTEEN YEARS AGO) looked just as good as this. Regardless, if they had spent 40 of the minutes they wasted on the whole wedding nonsense on the Surfer, the film might have been bearable.Kirby would spin endlessly in his grave, we he aware of how corrupted his creations have become.Quite possibly the WORST comic-book adaptation ever made.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really entertaining addition to the marvel franchise!,"I just saw the premier of this and I have to say, it is one of the best Marvel movies ever. The special effects are even better than X3 and Ghost rider, and the Silver Surfer is beautiful to watch.The story this time is more interesting, and its nice to finally see superheroes being given recognition and funds to carry out their work by the government. All the actors fit their characters perfectly, and really bring a lot of energy and zest to their roles. This time its a lot funnier, and Reed richards is geekier than ever in his science geek - cum - superhero role.The movie never drags, although sometimes the humor that involves The Thing is pretty lame, and dumbs down the movie a lot, while most of the scientific stuff is mentioned to the viewer in a ""you wont get it anyway"" summary type explanation that isn't always convincing.However, the look of this movie is so grea that you have to see it, and especially the ""day after tomorrow"" type disasters that SILVER SURFER brings along with him, including draining the river Thames in London.Againi, the cast looks great, with Jessica alba beautiful as usual and Lee evans looking really buff and toned.My advice - go watch it and enjoy yourself instead getting scared straight or bored straight watching all the other ""big"" summer sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"While it feels like a 2nd tier movie, it's still a pretty fun action flick","If the critics had their way, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer would never have been made. They pretty much unanimously bashed the first Fantastic Four film, yet the film went onto a very respectable 56 million dollars opening weekend en route to a 154 million dollars overall.I haven't yet seen the first film but if it's anything like the sequel, it isn't too hard to see why critics might feel like this franchise is a second-tier version of X-Men or Spiderman. The special effects can be pretty impressive at times. The London Eye sequence, for example, and the airborne battles are great set pieces. If I hadn't been introduced to Google Earth in the last couple of years, I would have been blown away by the scene where the Human Torch first chases after the Silver Surfer where the frame zooms out of Manhattan to a satellite photo of the Eastern seaboard as a flaming red speck and a silver fly across it. The problem, however, is that the special effects and the world they're set in do not seem well thought-out. Having the Human Torch and Silver Surfer bounce around from New York to Washington D.C. to outer space and Cairo without much second thought, almost feels like something out of a ripe-for-parody 1950's B movie.That's the case for a lot of this movie: a villain with the name Dr. Von Doom (could they have been any less subtle?), this general blasé feeling by every character in the film about the world ending, etc. Take a film like ""Independence Day"" to see a somewhat more grandiose vision of our world as it faces a doomsday scenario. In ""The Fantastic Four,"" Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) massages her husband's shoulders as he's being a work-a-haulic and says, ""Relax, it's not like the whole weight of the world is on you."" Actually, that's kind of EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. Batman is a superhero franchise that's set in ""Gotham"" and with it, this dark otherworldly atmosphere and Superman weaves together the world of the mundane in Manhattan with extraordinary abilities of Spiderman and his villainous counterparts. On the contrary, Fantastic Four, just appears set in Manhattan out of a lack of anywhere better to film it in. In short, Fantastic Four doesn't feel like a fully realized superhero film in tone.What makes up for it, in part, is a certain kind of camaraderie between the characters. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkis) both are characters imbued with a sense of humor and form a sort of Abbott and Costello chemistry. Besides just being eye candy, Sue (Jessica Alba) brings a sort of feminine balance to the group. Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) is the actual superhero of the group: the equivalent of Peter Parker in Spiderman or Wolverine in the X-Men series. Much of the drama centers around the choices he makes. When you see these four in interviews or press conferences, there's a chemistry between them all that makes them that much more appealing on screen.So overall, it's a decent action flick that pulls in some decent laughs but it's not necessarily a must-see event.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No,"Please stop these shameless productions. Please, while we still have a chance.The only way this movie could have been better would have been if a super hero with the power to turn crap ass movies into quality movies appeared and turned Galactus back into some semblance of his original self, explained that Jessica Alba believed she was playing the role of an android sex-bot, and that Ryan Seacrest was heavily considered for the role of the human torch, then apologized for not having come sooner to spare us the expense of paying $8 to bask in the embarrassment that was this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
FANTASTIC FOUR,"I guess ""the powers that be"" decided that they could jump start this franchise better if they dabbled into the ""cosmic Marvel universe"" and brought in the Silver Surfer.

"Enjoyable, entertaining fun","I saw the film last night and really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the first one.Obviously after reading so many other reviews of a weak script etc I must be brain dead but I liked the story and the characters. The four main characters are likable, do actually work together as a proper team and aren't constantly bemoaning their lot in life and the curse of their superpowers.I found the humour entertaining, I loved the scene where Reed stood up to the major and defended his nerdiness. Being freed from the over wrought drama and continual 'damsel in distress' bullshit that fills the spiderman series makes this a considerably more enjoyable experience.I've not read the comics so I can't comment on the Galactus representation issue but as a newbie I found it worked. I also like the issues of sacrifice and bravery that the film used, particularly in the satisfying final action scene.Films, especially comic book ones, are meant to be visually entertaining and it more than delivered on this. Great action sequences, cool characters and good ideas.On a final note what is happening to Stan Lee's ego? Can't he see the damaging impact that his woefully lame and intrusive cameos have on the flow of his movies.www.paynebyname.co,",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies I've ever paid money to see,"It's been 30 years since Star Wars rewrote the action movie rulebook. In the intervening years we've been treated to a whole slew of great SF movies. Comic books and graphic novels have been especially well represented, with Batmen, Supermen, and Spidermen showing us how action movies are supposed to be made. Last night, we were treated to an example of how not to make an action movie. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is not just the opposite of a great action movie, it is the opposite of decent film-making of any kind. The ways in which this movie goes wrong can be measured by the different crafts that go in to the making of all movies. The script, the actual words that these poor actors are forced to utter, are among the worst of any mainstream American movie I've ever seen. To call them trite is to undersell the vapidity of the sentiments expressed by dialogue. The emptiness of the script is compounded by some of the worst directing ever. The awfulness of the dialogue is brought in to relief by the agonizingly slow pacing that gives the viewer way too much time to contemplate the inanity that comes out of each character's mouth.The special effects are just plain cheap. They're Star Trek: TMP kinda bad. It would take a studio with an awful lot of contempt for the audience to settle for what passes as CGI in this misbegotten mess.I'm not sure who this film was made for. If it's made for kids, the studio may be in for a bit of a disappointment. The great crop of movies American kids have been raised on will likely have prepared them for something a lot better than this. Kids aren't stupid. They know when they're being sold an inferior product and there's plenty of good diversions out there for them to have to settle for grade D crap like FF:ROTSS.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
major improvement on the first !,"The first Fantastic Four felt like a Lamborghini Gallordo, from the out-side you wanted to check it out but then once you saw it and experienced it, you realised that it was not all that and you felt cheated and left out. However just like Lamborghini, the makers of the disappointing Fantastic Four went back to the drawing board and gave us this version of the Fantastic Four , only this time round they threw the Silver Surfer in for good measure and to be honest , The Silver Surfer was the one who probably saved this one this time round. Although the problems that arose with the first film are still very apparent with this one , it is the Siover Surfer appearing out of nowhere with his presence that ends up saving the movie and not to mention Julian Mchmaon who helped give Doctor Doom a little more justice this time round. To conclude although Rise of The Silver Surfer might not be the greatest comic book movie made , the producer went away and done some research on the movie which made this one entertaining and fun to watch, worth a look at.Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer - 8.3 out of 10RISE...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did I misread the word Fantastic?,"Well I walked into the cinema with an open mind, the first Fantastic Four was not the greatest Superhero film of all time but it was OK. But after watching the opening half hour of the film I was getting restless and bored, the story lacked action that we come to expect from films of this nature. In the overall scheme of things I would say there is about 20 minutes of action at the most in this film, instead it centers around the characters of Mr Fantastic and The Invisible Woman and will they ever get married, quite frankly I was sick and tired of hearing about their wedding.The other problem with this is that the characters are not as developed and rounded as those such as Batman, Spider man and the X-Men. All the four characters are 1 dimensional, Mr Fantastic is just the science man who explains whats happening in the film every 5 minutes, the Invisible Woman is just the eye candy in the film who just changes her clothes in every scene, the Flaming Torch is just an arrogant guy who turns into flames and the Thing is just a rock from Brooklyn. These superheroes lack the back story, lack the personal problems apart from not being able to get married...YAWN! Big deal. In Batman and Spider man the main characters have problems, have their own little wars waging on inside them constantly but with the Fantastic Four everything seems to nice.If there is one good point it would have to be the Silver Surfer, who doesn't really do that much to be honest. He looks cool and he steals the film from the supposed main characters. It would have been better just to make a Silver Surfer movie instead without the Lame 4. Another good part is Stan Lee's cameo.But overall the Fantastic 4 fails to deliver and I just hope that a third film is not on the cards. Give up with the Fantastic 4 and bring on Batman who at one point the fantastic four make fun of. What a joke! Did I hear someone say Fantastic? No, of course not.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good effects, basic script, funny jokes, nothing relatively bad, pretty cute, average to very good...","Reed Richards and Susan Storm are engaged to be married. However, during the ceremony, something strange appears in the skies of New York. It is the Silver Surfer, an alien being who has great powers and works as a herald for Galactus, the destroyer of planets. The Surfer came to Earth to prepare it to be destroyed by his master, but to achieve his goal he will have to face The Fantastic Four.I do not understand the negative for this franchise, in my view one of the best superheroes, whose theme I am not a fan of, however, this one enchanted me much more than most Marvel and DC together, such as Batman and Thor, for example, that I have rancid...

Cheesy...,"This movie features all the stars returning to the familiar characters of the heroes, as Reed is about to marry Sue, the love of his life. But an alien being has different ideas, which stand in the way of that very wedding, which, in turn, begins to raise doubts in Sue.The plot is there, but I feel that Don Payne and Mark Frost could have done a better job of writing this up. The comedy between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm kept the movie on the light-hearted sides, but, like all the other sequels I've seen this summer, the plot has felt like it was FORCED!

More Disappointment For Die-Hard Comic Fans,"Slight SpoilersFirst off, for all of you that enjoyed this. Fantastic! I can see why...a little. But when you're a die-hard Silver Surfer/Galactus fan, or even comic book fan for that matter, the movie disappoints too much.FFandTRofSS is a perfect sequel to the first one. Same average/Hollywood acting, nice special effects, and weak writing. And like the first one, the people in charge decided to not follow the comics. And yet again, I'm left shaking my head. Why did they make the Silver Surfer dependant to his board? Why did they ruin the anticipation for the Super Skrull in case he shows up in a future film? Why not show Galactus? They probably would have saved money since his craft is just a huge orb. Why make Alicia Masters black? For real lovers of comic-book writing, there's just too much being changed.But if you know nothing of the Silver Surfer/Galactus or Dr. Doom, or comics at all, you will most likely enjoy this film. It's popcorn movie madness.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I just could not get involved with this mess.,"I'm not a great follower of the Marvel Comics pantheon of heroes, 'tho I recall the Silver Surfer's appearance. I thought the concept was silly then and I still think it's silly. But, I was prepared to accept it in the spirit of a fun time at the movies.Maybe I didn't get enough sleep the night before, but for whatever reason,I sat in the theater totally incapable of connecting with the characters or the story. Perhaps this was because most of the characters seemed to be acting or speaking to be ""funny."" Humor of this sort can work, but here it seemed totally artificial and forced.As in most CG-intensive movies, there were scenes that were outstandingly impossible. Impossible doesn't need to mean unbelievable, but when it does -- as it does here -- the story falls apart under the burden of computer graphics trying to substitute for a story.The admission ticket plus the snax would have easily paid for the upcoming DVD, and more than paid for renting it. Your TV is where this movie belongs, preferably when it's free on a movie channel, or even later when it's on broadcast TV. You won't miss anything by waiting, and you'll probably enjoy watching it in an environment where you can pause the movie to get something to eat, answer the door, call your friends, or consume drink after drink.It's that bad.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
WOW!!! Can You Say Sequel Can You Say Thumbs Up,"This is the best sequel I have seen all so far this summer, takes up right were first left off. Focuses on Mr. Fantastic, & Sue, where as the first focused on Viktor, Johnny & The Thing (by the way buy the extended version of first film before going out to see the sequel not that it's relative but it's a better movie with just a few added scenes, very cool) Norrin Radd was better than I expected, special FX top notch, just enough action, FX, and character development kept the movie moving at a nice pace with a slightly slow start which actually helps the film build in excitement. The return of Doom was well handled even if they played up the clichéd bad guy trusted by army military nuts over intelligent non-aggressive typical scenario it plays well in the movie and Reed grows some gonads in a very funny tet-a-tet with a Colonel who learns to late he should have listened.I loved it and can't wait for the next one...a perfect tweener for a trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Probably the best Fantastic Four movie... yes I know that's not saying much.,"There was a Roger Corman Fantastic Four movie... that was terrible but had a low-budget charm to it. The 2005 Fantastic Four movie was terrible... but at least it was probably in some part responsible for Chris Evans becoming Captain America later. Then we got the Silver Surfer... which was not very good for a variety of reasons. For me, it's more of a middle of the road movie, not bad enough for me to give it a one, but not good enough for me to give it anything higher than a 5/10.Rise of the Silver Surfer does several things wrong, like the presentation of the villain Galactus... FFS make him a giant guy in Blue and Purple armor or just GTFO okay??? The design of the Surfer was good, but this movie's ""comedy"" just came off as weird and awkward, much like in the first movie.As for the rest... the team involved in making this thing did... an okay job at best. This movie had SO much potential, and it ended up being about as mediocre as superhero movies get... not horrible, but certainly not good either. The actors did the best they could with the material they were given, the chemistry between the characters works, but only just barely.I would not recommend this film, or the horrible Josh Trank FF film... but that's a review for another time.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, but I expected more.","Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer was a good movie. I enjoyed watching it and I wasn't bored at all. However, I felt a mix of thoughts and feelings at the beginning. It seemed to be fast and slow at the same time. Allow me to elaborate.Now if you didn't see the preceding title: Fantastic Four, or if you aren't familiar with the comics, then you may be a bit confused at the beginning. There is hardly an introduction for the characters, making you feel as though you missed something important. You'll catch on though; nothing to really worry about. The events were filled with dialog at the beginning, and knowing what type of movie this is, you await the action. The action won't come until later on, and even then it seems to end a bit quickly.A slight problem I had was that the movie attempted to be dramatic and catastrophic. The keyword being: attempted. The world is coming to an end because of the Silver Surfer's invasion, but I didn't feel emotionally drawn into the moments that transpired. In some movies, you can actually feel what the characters are feeling in their moments of strife. You can identify with them, and even compare the experiences with your own. However, this movie lacked that ability. What I'm trying to say is that it felt too much like a movie, and not like something that you can identify with. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I expected this movie to give me that mental and emotional connection that I spoke of.The best thing about this movie is the characters. Each character has a unique relationship with the other, and it makes for an amusing experience, even though it attempts to be ""touching."" But in concern with the actors who play the characters, there is nothing about their performances that will blow you away. It was satisfactory, but not excellent.If you're looking for an entertaining but not too profound film, then I would suggest this movie to you. It wasn't at all bad. It just didn't live up to my expectations. It was good, but I dare say it was fantastic.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Fun.,"Firstly let's get this out of the way, I liked the first Fantastic Four film and I really enjoyed Rise of the Silver Surfer, there I've said it. When a sequel is done properly and all the background information and origins are dealt with in the first film you can just crack on with the action. So welcome back Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben the Fantastic Four for some fantastic fun. With recent superhero films trying to go darker (Batman Begins, Ghostrider etc) it's refreshing to see a comic come to life with such humour and watch ability for the viewer. It never takes its self too serious and the jokes are as good as the action. The Surfer himself is pretty impressive as is Galactus (what you see of him) Victor Von Doom is back and hammier than ever and they even introduce the Fantastic car. The set pieces are great especially the one at the London Eye where the four battle the Surfer and contend with the falling wheel full of tourists. The storyline is solid and leaves enough room for every one of the characters to shine through, the effects are good and the music adds the finishing touches to the overall package. If you liked the first film, superheroes and action packed fun then you will love the Rise of the Silver Surfer. With the recent disappointment of Spiderman and Pirates 3 it's nice to leave a cinema saying 'I thoroughly enjoyed that'",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
couldn't be taken seriously,"I love comic book movies. I don't know about you, but I go to see them for the visually stunning action sequences and the nostalgia to see awesome characters of childhood cartoons, books and games. This movie delivered the later...ONLY. I can honestly say the only reason I gave it a 2 was because I saw the characters and their powers (kinda).To give you a summary of this horrible movie: it started, their were jokes, use of powers to make the jokes funny, more jokes, about 15 minutes of total action, more jokes, poor representation of galactus and sappy ending with more jokes.Silver Surfer, one of my favorite characters, was well represented. He was the only thing that made me not walk out of the movie. The jokes were the cheesiest I have ever seen. Even more so than Maguire's ""goth"" in spider-man 3. The redeeming quality in that movie was the action sequences. You don't get that in FF2. Just pseudo seriousness and cheap jokes by using and/or abusing their powers. Just don't see it, save your money.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
awful,"Why? I can't believe how bad this is. Haven't these people learned a lesson from Batman & Robin? It's campy and juvenile. It's not really that bad, but it's nowhere close as good to Spiderman 2, Batman Begins, or even Superman Returns. Like what happened to the Dark Phoenix arc in X-Men 3, the writers of FF series wasted another great mythology to the comic books. At least the Silver Surfer fx looked good. Oh well.After the mediocre 1st Fantastic Four movie, you would think that they would have listened to all the criticisms and made improvements on this sequel. Instead they went the other way, doing exactly the opposite of what the fans wanted. I don't even consider myself a comic book dork, but I'm getting malcontent with the dilution of quality in these comic book adaption after a strong run of some great movies in the last couple of year. I hope this movie tanks, so we won't get another. Unfortunately, I've highly doubt it. This movie will have an big opening. Enough to warrant another sequel.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic Four 2 Better Then First One But Still Flawed,"Fantastic Four Rise Of The Silver Surfer is better than the first one but it still has some flaws that are in the previous film. Director Tim Story does an okay job of bringing this movie based on a comic book to the big screen with more action and improved special effects but the camp factor hurts the movie as a whole. The cast are good in their roles including Ian Grufford as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/ The Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and Julian McMahon as their nemesis Victor Doom. Kerry Washington is all right as Ben's girlfriend Alicia but unfortunately she isn't given nearly enough screen time. Besides Evans as Johnny and Chilkis as Ben who stand out in the cast one of the best things about this sequel is the introduction of the Silver Surfer. In his first big screen appearance his character does leave an impression. He's played by Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne provides the voice for the character and they both do a solid job as the newest and more interesting foe/ally to the Fantastic Four. The rest of the cast are good in their small roles including Andre Braugher and Beau Garrett who at least try to bring life to their characters but unfortunately they lack screen time. As mentioned before the special effects and the action sequences are better then the first one but they're not as near as good as they could've been since none of them really even last that long. Some other problems I found with the film was that McMahon's character Doom didn't really need to be in it because they already fought him in the first one. McMahon makes for a good villain but his character takes a backseat to the Silver Surfer who at least to me is a much more worthy adversary with an interesting back story. A few other flaws were that it seemed Michael Chiklis lacked screen time too as The Thing and he wasn't involved in the action as much as he was in the previous one but he still turns in a good performance. The dialgoue wasn't the greatest at times either and the planet eating Galactus a popular character in the comics is given a brief cameo as this cloudy mist thing from outer space only showing up a couple times here and there before being easily defeated. With its problems aside however this sequel is still an entertaining comic book movie with good performances by most of the cast, just the right amount of action, some humor, cool special effects, and a little romance that keeps the film moving at a steady pace. If you're a fan of the first movie than you'll probably enjoy this one as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fairly entertaining superhero fluff,"I was one of those who thought that the first Fantastic Four movie wasn't as bad as everyone else seemed to think. This time around, though, I have to agree with the general consensus. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a passable superhero movie but certainly nothing special in any way.All of the main characters are back from the previous film. In my opinion Ioan Gruffudd gives the best performance but this is hardly a film to be watched for acting. Jessica Alba is pretty awful but she's only there as eye candy, of course. Funny how so many female scientists in Hollywood films are drop dead gorgeous. But I digress...The direction doesn't bear remarking upon but the special effects do not disappoint. Then again, the special effects are little help when the story isn't that interesting. It's standard 'save the world' superhero stuff with a predictable outcome. The internal struggles within the group aren't as intriguing as the last time around either.If you must, see this one with low expectations. It's a decent diversion for superhero fans but otherwise utterly forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the first,"Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Invisible Woman/Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and The Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) make up the Fantastic 4. This time they are much more like a bickering family. Reed and Sue are getting married, but superhero stuff keep getting in the way. They introduce the mysterious character of the Silver Surfer, and Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) is back causing problems.The best part of this movie is the family dynamics. They feel like a real family having family problems. They have much more chemistry this time around. The most fascinating must be the Silver Surfer. He's definitely the character with the most promise. But he's neither the good guy nor the bad guy. The moral ambiguity really muddies the waters. It's fascinating. The most disappointing must be Galactus. For a planet destroyer, the ending seems too tame. The final confrontation just wasn't special enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great movie for those who share a passion for older sci-fi,"This movie is a solid in terms of the balance between the action and the humour. Despite the bashing of the storyline I believe for what it is it works wonderfully and fits the older sci-fi genre. So, for those who share a passion for older sci-fi you will truly enjoy this movie from the chemistry between the characters to the.unforeseeable plot it's one you do not want to miss. One of the highlights of the movie worth watching for is Sue's encounter with the antagonist herself , as the writer's beautifully portrayed the essence of her character. The downsides of this movie were probably only the graphics for Mr. Fantastic's powers but other than that overall it was a fun film, causing you to constantly wonder what will happen next.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"again,lacks the epic quality it should have,but it doesn't exactly suck","well,at least it didn't suck.but it wasn't as good as the potential hinted at.i guess it's maybe slightly better than the first one,but barely.the story is interesting and has some merit,but the execution of the film left me empty.the Silver Surfer is a pretty cool looking character,but i wish the character had been developed more.Having Laurence Fishburne voice the Surfer was a definite plus,as his voice fit the character perfectly.no disrespect to Doug Jones,who physically played the character.i'm mot sure i've heard Doug Jone's voice,so all i can comment on is Fishburne.like the first one,this movie is too short and seems rushed.it lacks the epic quality this type of movie should have.another problem is the characters didn't really have to do much more or different than they did in the first one.having said that,the movie is entertaining,if not compelling.even with it's problems,i'd give ""Fantastic Four:Rise of the Silver Surfer"" 7/10.as a final word,if another installment or a possible Silver Surfer spin off,is planned as rumored,one can only hope they pull out all the stops and make whatever's next into what it really should be:an epic tale worthy of its source material.otherwise,there's no point and they should stop right now.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Far from perfect, but better than the first film","When it comes to the first Fantastic Four, I didn't hate it or anything but in more ways than one it could have been better as well. This sequel is an improvement in quite a few ways, but hampered by some of the flaws of the first film.The story had a great idea, had great potential and started off very well indeed. But in the middle I think it slackened in the pace and the story became less interesting and rather repetitive as a result. Also the film does have some cheesy and cringe-worthy dialogue especially in the one-liners, Reed and Doom unfortunately getting the worst of the lot.However, as I've said, there are several improvements. First and foremost, Silver Surfer. Silver Surfer alone is a more interesting character than any of the characters in the first movie, with a great design and performed just as impressively by the talented Laurence Fishburne. The special effects are incredible and greater in scope than the first, and the scenery is beautifully realised and perfectly captured by the crisp photography. Doom while having some bad lines is more intriguing here and developed and incorporated much better, and Julian McMahon's performance is deliciously evil and camp. Tim Story's direction is much more assured this time round too, John Ottman's score fits better here as well and the overall is shorter and better rounded off with a more exciting and less long-winded climax. The acting in general has also improved, while they are still the weak links in the cast Ioan Gruffodd and Jessica Alba's chemistry feels more natural and both feel more relaxed in their roles too. Michael Chiklis acquits himself even better, and Chris Evans provides the film's most amusing moments.All in all, imperfect but improved sequel. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More like the Barely Adequate Four...,"Thirty years ago, when Star Wars was just being released to theatres and Superman was in production, this film might have been impressive. Twenty years ago, a little before Tim Burton slapped a lot of expectations upside the head and redefined the way comic book adaptations are filmed forever, ROTSS as I will call it henceforth might have been mildly impressive. But the thing about storytelling is that once your audience has seen or heard a good story told in an impressive fashion, the bar is instantly raised. Ten years ago, in the wake of the stink that was Batman Forever, this half-baked offal might have seemed passable. But after the incredible statements on how far we have not come since 1945 that the real X-Men films turned out to be, ROTSS is woefully inadequate. As I stated in my comments about the previous Fantastic Four film, ROTSS is more a case of X-Men Dumbed Down For Infants, and the fact that director Tim Story was not fired after his appalling effort on the first film demonstrates that not everyone at Fox has their act together.One of the most commonly-cited complaints about the original Fantastic Four film was that the characters seem largely indifferent to their newfound powers and their situations. This was because, with the sole exception of Michael Chiklis, the actors are never given any time to explore their characters, their characters' emotions, or their characters' situations. We ended up knowing less about the Four than we do most characters in a soap opera, and as a result, they seem less real. Even in Dark Angel, arguably a top ten contender for the worst-written dialogue ever heard on television, we had more reason to care about the support characters there than we do the titular heroes in ROTSS. And that is the one big problem which ROTSS just cannot recover from. Because these so-called heroes live like celebrities and are treated like rock stars, we end up with no reason to care what happens to them. In one memorable (for all the wrong reasons) scene, as Reed is using his flexibility to impress women in a nightclub, we cannot help being reminded of Rogue's abject fear of even touching someone.In the original Fantastic Four, this effect was bad enough on its own. Its poor time economy and seeming inability to properly develop the characters left this sequel with little or no foundation to balance itself upon. Where X-Men 2 had the inevitable attack of the Normalness Patrol upon its heroes and its anticipation, the biggest event in ROTSS when going in is the wedding of two characters. Since the two characters have about as much character as the leads in an episode of Neighbours, we are not just indifferent to this event. We literally just flat out do not give a crap. And considering that ROTSS has to make do with a mere ninety-two minutes of running time, you cannot count on any story development to give you an investment in what happens to the characters, either. When Victor Von Doom steals the silver surfboard for his own purposes, one ends up being too aware of how little time remains in the film's running length to really get worked up about the possibility of anything exciting.Not helping anything is the mostly-droll acting. Jessica Alba looks more comfortable here whining about the inevitable challenges of her nuptials than she does convincing us that she regards the safety of our world as her responsibility. Ioan Gruffudd and Chris Evans are just there, and just basically adequate. Even Michael Chiklis is ultimately reduced in this sequel due to his character being given all of the perks of fame without a single drawback being given the slightest exploration. Julian McMahon could not play Victor Von Doom on the most maudlin day of his life, and in this film his credibility as a genuine threat is almost as sorely missed as that of the Silver Surfer. Speaking of the Silver Surfer, the film attempts at one point to flip gears and make him into an unwilling servant of a much greater menace, but one ends up caring a lot more about those millions of civilians who were presumably killed when he dug one of his little holes in the Earth's crust. This is not helped by the fact that when the Silver Surfer attempts to explain why he does what he does, it amounts to a lot of tell and no show.Not helping matters any is the parameters of the softcore PG rating. Exactly what convinced the MPAA this film was even nearly as adult in tone as either of the real X-Men films is going to be one of the great unsolved mysteries years from now. The action is about as intense as the effort with which I blow my nose, and only a delusional crackhead could find any suggestive content here. You could probably shave another five minutes off this film and get it a G rating in Australia. And when you consider that this film is dealing with the possibility that every life on Earth might be extinguished, such beating around the bush is simply not on. I am not saying that the film needs to be another RoboCop, but when you present the audience with a situation in which people will inevitably be killed, reminding the audiences that there are consequences to detaching a chunk of a building from its foundations is actually a good thing. And no, the impalement at the end does not count, because like one of those ghastly Narnia films, the director cannot resist the temptation to invoke the magic reset button.Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer is the epitome of what I call a two out of ten film. Even twenty-five years ago, I would have told the nearest adult to turn this kiddie trash off.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Silver Surfer Surfs to Stardom while the Fantastic 4 Flounders,"Initially, I was going to wait for a week so sincere reviewers would get a chance to write this one up. I became so tired of the fake reviews which were written with ulterior motives. But, I caved in, anxious to see the new, improved version of The Fantastic Four. I came out ""not impressed"" but grateful it was not as bad as the first.First, the good stuff: the characters individually and independently were better, Silver surfer was a very good character, the special FX were better, the action and movie as a whole was definitely geared towards satisfying the young and family oriented movie goers, and the humor was sometimes better.I still do not get anything out of the relationships for the most part. It feels like there is just no connection between the characters. Reed and Sue getting married? Why? They are no more in love with each other than The Thing and Human Torch. Adding to this bland relationship tragedy is the horrible dialogue which is just as bland. Dialogues come across more like announcements than engaging conversation. While I managed a couple chuckles, the humor seemed forced and cheap. I found nothing funny in scenes where devastation surrounds mankind but time is taken for the F4 to ignore the crowd around them while they make a wisecrack or two. Superhero action seemed to be inserted as an after thought sometimes. Why does it seem there is always a crowd around when you don't need one?Not only was camera work stiff, it was almost like flashing snapshots on the screen a lot of the time. And why do they always have to stop to have a discussion while fighting evil. Is Tim Story telling us that his viewers are too stupid to follow a conversation on the move? Believe me, I got bored watching action stalled out for the sake of one-liners.Speaking of one-liners, here's one for you, the background music seldom matched what was on-screen. And I am sure the gun fire sounding like muffled firecrackers was not a problem at the theater.I do not know if it is Story's fault or 20th Century Fox's that this movie still does not make The Fantastic Four as fantastic as they deserve to be. I only know that because one failed, they both failed. Both should remove themselves from Superhero movie-making.Like I said, I was not impressed but thankful it was slightly better. I struggled to give it a 5 out of 10. No thanks to Doom who did nothing much at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a film about older internet users.,"Fantastic 4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer (2007) -I don't know how the Marvel Comics introduced the Silver Surfer to the Earth originally, but I personally felt that his character probably deserved a better start, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, than he got with this film and it should have been much more about him than it was.Overall though, I think that I liked this one, because the origins had been dealt with in the previous film, for the main cast at least. I didn't necessarily think that it was worth bringing Victor Von Doom back however. Julian McMahon did seem ever so slightly less slimey in this one though.And while I still thought that they had got Johnny Storm and The Thing cast perfectly, as I said about the first film, Sue Storm played by Jessica Alba and Stretchy McStretchy-man, Reed Richards, played by Ioan Grufford were just not right for me. I'm not even sure that I liked their characters to start with. Perhaps I have missed something by not reading the comics and favouring The X-Men instead, but the couple just seemed to drag the action down, when they weren't locked in the laboratory that is. Not to mention that Ioan's dancing was really quite embarrassing, far worse I felt than Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 3 even.There's a bit more comedy in this one which I did like, although Reed wasn't the right choice to make the jokes or be the comic relief, the rest of it balanced things out a bit better.I also liked that the threat was introduced earlier, meaning that the action kicked off sooner too.At the end of the film they don't exactly save the day as a team? It's mostly just Johnny and Norrin. I'd like to have seen what they can all achieve together in that respect. That was supposed to be the beauty of them I thought, but it seemed to be a little of this guy, some of that one and then the other guy will turn up for that bit.With all that said, it's still an easy and enjoyable film that doesn't take itself too seriously, isn't overly ""comic book"" and has Chris Evans in it, although not enough.And it's definitely still better than the 2015 version.619.18/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A mediocre sequel to a mediocre film.,"I was not a big fan of the first fantastic four movie, but I must admit I had a good time watching it. I thought perhaps this sequel would be a chance to keep the same entertainment with a better script. Boy was I wrong.Perhaps it's wrong to criticize a ""comic-book movie"" for having a contrived plot or a weak script...so taking THOSE things for granted, it's still lacking what any superhero movie needs: action.The biggest problem with the action scenes (if there even is more than one) is the lack of an antagonist. The silver surfer is rather elusive and demure. The FF don't so much fight a villain as they do chase him or try to slow down the destruction of whatever environment they're in. No spoilers, but I definitely saw the FF fight buildings and debris more often than any person.So that's my review. Even ignoring the weak story, the bad dialogue, and the directionless acting (except for ron perlman) that one might expect, there is also a disappointing lack of action. I was hoping for a roller-coaster, and I felt like I was stuck waiting in line.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It could have been better.,"After the first and never released film of these great heroes came a couple of films whose production had everything in their favor and which tried to be as faithful as possible to the comic. The problem lies in the script, which is unattractive and highlights the inability of the producers, writers and director to find enemies to support a complex and fun story. Galactus barely appears and the Silver Surfer is itself another hero. And that Doom always appears is a sign of tiredness and creative annoyance. The movie could have been much better and it's a clear sign that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with these superheroes. He featured the film with production design by my old friend Richard Bennett. Big hug for him.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit like the 'Human Torch',"The first big screen outing for the 'Fantastic Four' hardly set the Box Office alight. Therefore a lot of people were actually quite surprised when they were afforded a second attempt. So... did they get it right the second time around? Well, sort of. Like my title states – this film is a bit like one of the Four themselves, i.e. hot and cold.I always felt the first film only really got going in its dying stages. Both movies are no more than an hour and a half in length and the first one only really sees the Four coming together to fight their nemesis, Dr Doom, in literally the last ten minutes. So, I was kind of hoping this one would continue the battle most of the way through. Sadly, it didn't. Everything kind of goes back to how it was before – the four heroes bicker among themselves and then have to use their combined powers to save a cat up a tree (or something – I may have made that one up, but you get the idea).Now, instead of just Dr Doom, we now have three baddies to contend with. However, none of them really do muc that's bad throughout the best part of the movie. We have the Silver Surfer (voiced a bit by Laurence Fishburne) who just kind of flies about a bit and causes power cuts. Dr Doom is still on the scene, but after the whole of the first film was spent turning him into Dr Doorm, he promptly drops his iron mask and cape and returns to a guy with slightly effeminate eyebrows (who has borrowed Emperor Palpadine's lightening fingertip powers). Finally we have Gallactus (I think that's how you spell it). In the comics he's a giant robot who eats planets. Now he's a kind of giant puff of smoke who travels through space squeezing worlds (and you only see him in the last quarter of an hour or so).So, without – what I would call – 'real' villains, do the heroes carry the film? Again, not really. Ioan Gruffudd may be a decent enough actor (and look the part of Reed Richards), but he's not really (action) leading man material. And, if that wasn't bad enough, the special effects used to extend his limbs always look a bit ropey. Jessica Alba looks cute, but does little else, Michael Chiklis is probably the best, utilising his decent 'Thing' make-up to add weight to his character while Chris Evans kind of just uses these films as a warm-up for his Captain America superhero outing.I first saw the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer when it came out in 2006. I have just watched it again in 2015. Baring that in mind I'd forgotten enough of it to make it okay for a second viewing. And, if I was bored and fancied something that wasn't quite up to the 'Marvel universe' movies such as Iron Man, Thor and the Avengers, I'd probably watch both Fantastic Four movies again in another nine years.Kids will probably like it the most. It does have a couple of good action scenes that gets your blood pumping, but, like the human torch, just when it heats up, it cools down equally as quickly.Probably better than the first one, but only just.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Slight Dip From the First, But Still Good","The Fantastic Four learn that they are not the only super-powered beings in the universe when they square off against the powerful Silver Surfer and the planet-eating Galactus.So, I overcame my dislike of the Fantastic Four in the first film, and now I am almost ready to overcome my stronger dislike of Silver Surfer. I think he is a terrible character, but this film really focused on the tragedy of the character, echoing the tragedy of Ben Grimm in the first film. Seeing him as all-powerful but lonely? A nice touch.The film also tends to focus on the Surfer almost too much. Too little shown? Galactus. His portrayal is something of a disappointment (though I am compassionate with why he ended up how he did). And also, why did Doom come back? I am glad he did, but he plays such a small, marginal role. Nothing gets fleshed out as far as it should.This movie demands a sequel, but it will probably never get one now that Marvel is devoting every new film to the Avengers story.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rated PG. Same staff from the original. Same actors. We might have a problem here,"Not only does the entire cast of the original Fantastic Four return for a second installment, the flaws make a return as well. Whether it's the painfully obvious product placement, the bad acting, lack of action, cheesy lines, pointless scenes, lack of chemistry amongst the main two characters, low usage of the villains, mediocre treatment of the villains, lack of character development, or the abundance of jokes falling flat, Rise of the Silver Surfer is practically a prettier and more polished version of the original failure film. While it is a much more entertaining movie than the first, it still needs a bit more work in order to even compete with the hotshot comic book franchises like X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman.In Rise of the Silver Surfer, we see the Fantastic Four preparing for the wedding of the century, as finally Reed and Sue are getting married. However, there are new threats approaching, hindering the wedding and also messing with the fate of the world. An alien from outer space is entering Earth and creating massive craters for unknown reasons. To add to the mayhem is a return of an old villain, whose hatred towards the heroes is stronger than ever. Upon all this lies an even greater danger lurking deep in space. Quite a lot for a film that's only 92 minutes. This would explain the lack of development and lack of action sequences.We can start by bashing the acting. Besides the performances of Chris Evans (Human Torch) and Michael Chiklis (The Thing), the acting in Rise of the Silver Surfer is rather awful and laughable, even at the more emotional moments. There are several scenes in which are accidentally funny, and many lines awkwardly delivered, especially that by Ioan Gruffudd (Reed) and Julian McMahon (Dr. Doom). Not supporting the lack of decent acting is the writing, which becomes just as dreadful. There is a lot of cheesy dialogue in this movie, and while the story had potential, ultimately doesn't deliver because of the lack of screen time share by the Silver Surfer and Dr. Doom. Most of the movie we see the Fantastic Four fighting and bickering amongst themselves, while the villains kick back and wait for their moment to shine.There are many good stories in the Fantastic Four comic books; it shouldn't be that hard to flesh out a good storyline involving the heroes and villains. The handling of the villains and enemies are just as bad as in the original. Dr. Doom is one of the roughest scoundrels in all of Marvel, yet is limited to a mere joke and side note in the second installment. Doom was wreaking a bit more havoc the second time around, but yet again doesn't deliver the sense of danger and fear that is presented by over villains in other comic book films. The Silver Surfer is heavily underused, as he was able to showcase his cool-looking powers in just one chase sequence and another run-in later in the movie. Also not helping is how the audience is never able to explore the origins or the motivations of the mysterious being. Worst of all is the totally unique image and portrayal of the planet-eating monster Galactus. There are comic book fans that will squeal in anger upon seeing its appearance.The short action sequences of Fantastic Four were nicely handled and drawn-out, but just didn't last long enough. There weren't enough showdowns, not enough epic battles, and most certainly did not deliver on the climax. By the end we'll see stupid departures and a slew of cop-outs, as well as anti-climactic scenes, massive plot holes, and unnecessary emotionally heavy moments (you'll see why). The special effects were a mixed bag as well, as the Silver Surfer and doomsday effects were done nicely--but then contradicted by the effects of the Fantastic Four in action (especially the stretching done by the main character). Add a ridiculous dance sequence, bad jokes sprinkled, and blatantly obvious product placement, and we have ourselves the biggest disappointment of the summer blockbuster season.Bottom Line: With so many things wrong and going against it, Rise of the Silver Surfer disappoints and is a letdown in almost every single possible way. Granted its better than the original, the franchise still needs major changes, or at least a totally different cast. Is it too late for a Fantastic Four Begins? Seriously, stop making a joke out of the enemies. Stop screwing around with a potentially good franchise. This movie isn't going to attract any new fans nor would it please the people already fans of the comic book. Skip this and read the books, you'll be much more entertained and have a better chance of feeling like you got your money's worth.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"More Enjoyable than Its Predecessor but Not a Huge Improvement,","Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.While it certainly isn't a massive improvement from the first Fantastic Four,I did think this one was better,it had a storyline that was more enjoyable to follow and it also had a lot more light humour than the previous one did.The effects are very good,particularly the Silver Surfer,but I was a bit annoyed at times when they took a very cartoony approach,for example,Mr. Fantastic on the dance floor or Sue making her pimple invisible.My favourite part of the whole movie is Stan Lee's cameo,he always does great cameos in Marvel films,but this one is still today my favourite,I won't spoil it for anyone but it is hilarious.Not an outstanding movie but a good sequel,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is fun and I would recommend it as a family film or something to watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill.Just coming up to Reed and Sue's wedding day,the Fantastic Four must face an old enemy and two new ones that could be the end of the universe as we know it.Best Performance: Chris Evans Worst Performance: Julian McMahon",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is it possible to make it worst?,"Well, this is the kind of film that you go to the movies just because you do not have any thing better to do or because is an action movie and you can enjoy of your pop corn and drinks.The story is too simple, even with such interesting characters and they waste a lot of time in matters absolutely no important for the story itself.Stan Lee is just a mercenary the same as Marvel itself, only interested in making money, with no respect at all for their characters or the public. If they want to make a movie with some superheroes, is OK, every one will go to the movies, but just do no kill well known characters in that way (figuratively speaking).I will really like to ad more comments so you can evaluate with it, but i do not want to spoil the movie, but just as advice, do not waste your money in the movies, rent it with 20 friends so it is worth the money you pay for it.Bye",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's full with action, and comedy pack. The story itself is easy to understand.While for the effect, it's totally awesome.

Wow that was terrible,"Personally I was not a big fan of the original movie although I did not hate it. This one I did hate. The only thing other than the surfer who was intriguing, that was any fun was looking at Jessica Alba and that was not even executed very well. Personally when there was any dialogue it was hard not to laugh at how bad the delivery and writing were. The first half-hour of this movie was the worst half-hour of my life. I cannot stand when movies try to pretend their is any emotional story, because these actors were in no way good enough to carry out any emotions. This movie should have involved all one liners and explosions. Because that is what it is good at, before you pass judgement I am not some adrenaline junkie and I thought the one-liners in the movie were awful. I am a huge movie fan, and I do like action but usually I watch more dramatic movies with actual quality plot and acting. I just think that movies like this should just give the idiotic mass audience what it wants and skip out on the plot. Also this may have been the most predictable movie I have ever seen. I tried to bet a friend of mine during the movie on exactly how the movie would turn out and I was exactly correct although he refused the bet, because he said I would probably be right. I just had to get a few things off my chest and since this was the first summer sequel I have see I may just skip the rest. The romantic subplots were not only pointless and emotionless, but also so contrived I felt like vomiting.I give it a 2 because the surfer was a cool character, and I felt like being generous.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nothing Special but still entertaining,"Fantastic Four Rise of The Silver Surfer wasn't bad. Like its predecessor, it was more of a fun popcorn film. The story was also improved from the first movie, though some of the dialoque was worse.I'm not going to go into plot details because I'm sure most Marvel Comic fans know the story about Galactus and The Silver Surfer from the FF comics back in the sixties titled The Coming of Galactus. Granted there was no Watcher like in those comics, but the origin story of both Galactus and The Silver Surfer was pretty much accurate, with the exception of Sue taking the place of Alicia on a major plot detail. We also have the return of Doctor Doom as well.I'm sure many have seen the previews and trailers for the movie, so it's no spoiler when I say the scenes where Johnny switches powers with the other members of the team aren't as goofy as I thought they would be. In fact it goes hand in hand with the ending, but I won't share those details.Fantastic Four 2 is about on the same par as the first film. With the exception of Chris Evans who has all the good lines again, the acting still seemed off. It's most likely because of the horrendous dialoque. There also was no real chemistry between the Reed and Sue characters, but Ioan Gruffudd was pretty good playing the quirky scientist that is Reed Richards. Mike Chiklis was also somewhat okay, but Jessica Alba still needs to improve her acting.And for those who didn't like the way Galactus was portrayed, I can understand your point, but it wasn't really that bad because Galactus can take on different forms. However, there is a scene in the movie which kind of does give and image of what Galactus looks like in the comics. It is not a clear image, but it is there.On one final note, the ending of Fantastic Four 2 was superior to the ending we got with Spider Man 3, and I found FF 2 more entertaining as well. Maybe it was because of its short 92 minute running time, whereas Spiderman 3 was just too long with too much going on at once.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not art by any means, but very fun.","Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer - After the death (er...statuizing?) of Dr.Doom the Fantastic Four think life is back to normal. Reed Richards (Ioan Grufford) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) make plans to get married, but are interrupted when the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones/Laurence Fishburne) shows up, trying to destroy the earth and it's up to the fantastic four to deal with him, as well as with the return of Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon).Let me start off by saying that I was never that big a fan of the FF comics (More Batman and Spiderman). I liked the powers and all, and they had some good stories, but they always struck me as the Brady Bunch of the Marvel universe, so squeaky clean and loved by all. And Marvel was always at their hokiest when they tried to get into science. And dear god, WHY did Dr. Doom always narrate his actions in the third person? Still, I liked 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" film, which was stomped on the throat by just about everyone (This one has been as well). Not serious enough. Alba couldn't act. Dr. Doom wasn't Darth Vader blah blah blah. That film was a brainlessly fun piece of fluff and so was this one. Everyone's been spoiled by the Batman Begins masterpiece.Let me start with the performances. Grufford is somewhat subdued as Richards, though he gets to show some spunk and initiative this time around. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis have a great little repartee together as The Human Torch and The Thing respectively. Alba has gotten better than last time. She's still not what I'd call an actress, but she's not bad. She doesn't whine or detract from anything and has some funny moments. And I didn't give a crap about how bleached blonde she was. The powers all look good but with a few cheap-looking glitches with Mr. Fantastic. The Surfer looks fantastic but I do wish Doug Jones had gotten to voice-over instead of Fishburne because aside from a few sad looks and gestures they could've had anyone under all that CGI. Don't get me wrong, I like Fishburne and he speaks well without getting too melodramatic, but I love Doug Jones' stuff.The opening 10 minutes of the movie are pretty weak, but it gets much better with the wedding and the Surfer/Torch chase that I'm sure everyone's seen by now with the trailers and all, but it's somehow been given more intensity and fine polish for the film. There are several other action sequences and the movie offers up decent action for a PG film, as well as a particularly cool way to off someone, but I want more. I feel like they used a bunch of the action up in the trailers and TV spots, but there's still loads of cool bits of CGI and whatnot. It's all great turn-your-brain-off stuff. The jokes are well played, but the film lacks a little for seriousness. And I wish Julian McMahon had been given more evil crap to do, cause I like his stuff. There were very few moments where I wasn't enjoying the film.Galactus was a small disappointment, not because he wasn't true to the original comics (which he was). I know there are a huge legion of fanboys livid about that, but I don't think they'd be too happy about a 70 story tall guy in purple Viking armor either. The problem with him/it was there was a certain feeling of awe and magnitude lacking in his arrival. He was also dispatched too easily, which makes me feel that there was no good way to end the movie in a very satisfying way, cause the way the comic ended sucked too.It's a fun movie that you have to turn your brain off to enjoy, because there are stretches of ""scientific"" crap (like the comics) that make you go ""Huh? a pulse what?"" It's not art, and the movie gleefully acknowledges this and still makes you have a good time. It's fun, it's funny, and it's light-hearted. a C+",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"It's Not Flawless, but is a Triumph Over the Original","In a summer in which each sequel has proved to be disappointing and less stunning than its predecessors, Silver Surfer is like a ray of hope. Spiderman may have drawn the crowd, but its intense marketing left fans and others viewers expecting more. Surfer on the other hand has been an underdog story. With little yet sufficient marketing campaigns, FF2 may truly be the sleeper hit of the summer.At the beginning of the film we find luckless Sue and Reed trying to tie the knot when a mysterious force ruins their wedding day. Driven by this, the four heroes begin their intensive research and start attempting to catch the enigmatic Silver Surfer. All seems to be going well, until an old friend returns from Latevria.Performances in FF were weak, and I cannot say that they have improved so much. Nevertheless, this time they somehow become more than simply awesome humans for children. Ioan Gruffudd is back as the Silver Surfer, and I am in favor of the writers' decision to bring him out like a proper nerd, which he is the comics. Jessica Alba falls into that category of actresses which have looks, but little talent, even though this kind of blandness is evident in Sue too. Chris Evans is definitely one of the most up and coming stars of Hollywood, and whilst judging him on his acting isn't that easy, he's got that charisma and charm which easily makes him an audience favorite. In the last film, Michael Chiklis, as the Thing, had a far more interesting role, as he was insecure and ashamed of how he was, and whilst it's certainly a nice change to have a superhero film without these internal conflicts, his character is ignored.In terms of action sequences, the film delivers, and whilst it certainly is becoming boring to see Sue Storm producing force fields, the Silver Surfer is extremely welcome, as he pumps up the action. From the thrilling city chase to the evasion of rockets during his capture, every moment in which he's on the screen, the film sees a colossal improvement. Dr. Doom has lost his charm and his final showdown is rather disappointing. And even though Galactus isn't as awe inspiring as in the comics, the scale is huge and it gives rise to much more exciting sequences.The special effects have improved and whilst the Silver Surfer is the main highlight, Galactus is also a feast for the eyes. However, my favorite special effects sequence has to the creation of the crater in the river Thames. The scene was climatic and you could for once feel the tension and fear of the citizens.A disappointment in the film has to be the lack of emotion. When Sue and Reed plan to abandon the group you'd expect some more drama, but everything is shallow and the film goes on without giving any importance to these scenes which could be emotional heavyweights.VerdictFantastic Four 2 has its flaws, but unless you are one of those people who start freaking out as soon as they see something that is different from the comic, then you'll find this film to be a relaxing and fun treat, coupled with a priceless 93 minute running time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

'Surfer' is a considerable improvement over the strained original,"Fantastic Four 2: Rise of the Silver Surfer; This sequel picks up a little while after the original ended, where the group was revealed to the world as a newly formed group of popular heroes. This time, it's a considerable time after, and the foursome have their own portion of a building, shaped like a giant 4, in New York City. After a funny, refreshing re-introduction with our heroes, we learn that Susan and Reed have had some issues in the planning of their wedding, which the public goes insane over. However, what seems like it could be finally tying the not is interuppted by the shocking appearance of the Silver Surfer, which Reed suspects is linked to bizarre occurrences previously around the globe. The foursome joins forces with their previous villain, who seems to have an agenda all his own, in order to bring down this mysterious new villain.Fantastic Four was a box office success, but a critical and general audience failure. Still, it's no surprise that this sequel was churned out by Marvel almost two years later. Thankfully, you can step off the edge of the cliff. 'Surfer' is a considerable improvement over the original in just about every way. It's slicker, louder, funnier, more creative and with better special effects and a better story.Everyone seems to be having a funner time making this when compared to the original. 'Surfer' has frequent doses of light humor and touches. Performances are better and less stiff here, particularly for Alba. Evans, as in the first film, is the one who pops the humor flashbulbs. The re-introduction of the foursome is probably the best part in the film, and 'Surfer' gets a good, although stretched, gag about a switching powers incident. This film does have a problem, however. It aims for a younger age range, and this plays as a fault for the film. Some of the sequences seem down-played, as they feel as if you could have been bigger, and a little bit better. However, most people at any age will have fun with these heroes. 3 from 4.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Better than the first film, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good film.","The original cast (and director) is back for another superhero adventure.

However, things does not go according to plan, as fate - off course - intervenes. Sue's brother, Johnny (Human Torch) is back as well and so is the conflict between him and Ben (The Thing). There were a few sweet moments between Ben and the new love of his life, the blind Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington). Julian McMahon also returns as Victor von Doom (Dr. Doom), but in a less prominent role.As with the first movie, the attempts at humour fails miserably, and is annoying rather than funny. This film is too comical with a silly premise altogether. I mean, they even made jokes during life threatening moments! I mean, seriously?

"Much Better than the Debut, but the Surfer is a Bit Watered-Down","The second installment in the Fantastic Four franchise is a more plot-driven reader's digest version of the classic Jack Kirby/ Stan Lee story of the Silver Surfer and Galactus. Those who do not already know what was left out of the screen adaptation will probably not feel the full depth and power of the original work - the Surfer's constant anguish, his loss of identity, the labyrinthine philosophical dialogue and the profound power of Galactus, and the hopelessness of our heroes' situation. Nevertheless, 4: The Rise of the Silver Surfer manages to connect the dots surprisingly well, and distills this great tale to its essence.An astronomical phenomenon has come to earth, bringing with it environmental disasters and warnings of worse to come. The phenomenon is the embodiment of the power cosmic - a being infused with the ability to convert matter and energy at will. What does he want, and how long is the earth to survive? Meanwhile, back at Fantastic Four HQ, Reed and Sue are planning a wedding, and Ben and Johnny are beginning to settle into their characters. As the earth crumbles around them, the couple that binds our team of heroes are considering leaving heroism behind once and for all. But Reed's mind can not be contained, and when Victor Von Doom surfaces with new knowledge about the surfer, his competitive instincts and sense of danger are uncontrollably agitated.I have long held the opinion that the saga of the Silver Surfer could not be made into a successful movie. Thankfully, this film does not attempt to tell the whole story, but only skims the surface of the surfer and Galactus' introduction. Jack Kirby's amazing artwork could never translate properly into the cinematic medium, and - again thankfully - the art directors and screenwriters involved in this film completely re-envisioned and reinvented Galactus, but left the surfer largely intact. In my opinion, this film did what it set out to do as well as it could be done.The cast seemed both more challenged by and more comfortable in their roles in The Rise of the Silver Surfer. The script, editing and directing were all noticeably better than the introductory film, and the special effects were appropriately fantastic.Recommended for fans, but not recommended for purists. As always, comic book fans should not let their expectations run away with them. Film is a different medium, and sometimes requires a radically different story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Superhero escapism at its most simplified and unashamedly enjoyable,"From the very onset of its being announced, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer stood out as one of the least expected sequels of the year. After the lackluster box office and critical reviews of the first adaptation of the classic Marvel comics team, it seemed unlikely that any further mileage would be attempted to be extracted from the source material. However, Twentieth Century Fox saw differently, and a sequel was triumphantly declared, begging the question as to whether the franchise would follow the recently conventional superhero route of going darker and more complex. In the end, such concerns couldn't be farther away from the intent of the project, as Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer proves just as deliriously determined as its predecessor to entertain, even at the sake of complexity, its exploration of the coming of the Silver Surfer, one of the most fascinating in the comic's history being processed as superhero escapism at its most simplified and unashamedly enjoyable.The story begins immersed in expositional drama, with the pending media circus of a wedding between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman leaving the couple debating abandoning superheroism in favour of a normal married life. However, despite the intriguing subtextual examination of the cultural role of the superhero in a media obsessed society, the madcap pre-wedding antics may be cute but are often oversimplified or overstated, the occasional profound kernel lost amidst borderline excessive silliness (Mr. Fantastic ""loosening up"" at his bachelor party is fun, but a bit much). As such, it is almost a relief when the future of the world is threatened, and the real fun begins. The expanded scale of the conflict (saving Earth from destruction by intergalactic force Galactus and his herald the Silver Surfer) allows the special effects team to up the ante on flexing their big budget muscles, between exhilarating cosmically powered showdowns to more subtle touches (Mr. Fantastic's stretching ability looks far less artificial this time). John Ottman's triumphant musical score completes the heroic package, exemplifying the 'generic but undeniably fun' tone of the film.Returning director Tim Story's continual desire to keep the mood light and fun may hamper the story's potential for actual gravitas regarding the pending end of the world, but the breezy exhilaration of the film is sufficient to prevent the viewer from devoting enough attention to the ludicrous situation, content to earnestly wow and cheer rather than fret matters such as realism, coherence or the vain attempts to make Jessica Alba appear blonde and blue-eyed. Story's penchant for nodding to fans of the comics also makes the film substantially more entertaining, with inclusions such as the Fantasticar proving rousing and exhilarating, and even his revamping of the ominous Galactus proving surprisingly satisfying. In an era of superhero films attempting to continually one-up each other on the 'dark and brooding' front, it is surprisingly refreshing to see a comic book adaptation with no more grandiose goals than to entertain, sporting such an unpretentious sense of fun that one can't help but go along for the ride in despite the numerous stumbles.Once again, Ioan Gruffudd impresses as emotionally distant yet quirkily noble heroic scientist Mr. Fantastic, perfectly essaying the occasional comedic or dramatic moment which emerge from his aptly maintained front of stern focus. Unfortunately, Jessica Alba disappointingly delivers a far less inspired performance than even her usual standard as the harried Invisible Woman. Alba's flat, painfully unemotional performance is uncomfortably punctuated by her grotesque excesses in makeup, giving her the appearance of a bizarre doll rather than human being. Conversely, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis as the impish Human Torch and gruffly wisecracking rock-encrusted Thing prove the casting highlights, their comedic banter and irreverently charismatic performances providing the film with much needed emotional heart and comic relief.However, returning antagonist Julian McMahon as Machiavellian Doctor Doom feels like a hasty last minute addition, his sparsity of screen time giving McMahon little chance to exude sufficient villainous menace or even appear to have much point as a character. In contrast, Kerry Washington is delightfully charming as the Thing's blind girlfriend Alicia, and Andre Braugher delivers a reliably disapproving performance as a gruff military general. Finally, the masterful motion capture movement of Doug Jones and melodious, otherworldly voice of Lawrence Fishburne combine perfectly to capture the mystery and pathos of the dynamic Silver Surfer, instilling real heart into a potentially overly artificial character.To call Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer mindless entertainment would hardly be a substantial overstatement, as the film's primary concern of delivering light-hearted fun often comes at the expense of character development and credible emotional engagement with the story. However, mindless entertainment need not be seen as strictly a negative, and those willing to take the film for what it is, a piece of not overly challenging, fun and occasionally exhilarating superpowered escapism, may well find the film a rousing success - just don't expect to remember much of it days down the road.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Same Old,"This is just another run of the mill comic book adaptation with the usual predictable story line. At least Jessica Alba and Kerry Washington are beautiful enough to give us guys something to look at. Otherwise,I cannot find another reason to recommend it. Then villain is actually a silver guy riding a silver surf board whose mission is to suck all the energy from the earth. The battle scenes are OK but repetitious. The actors seem to have a good time reading through a pedestrian script but at an hour and a half, Rise of the Silver Surfer is a mild diversion from everyday life.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not as bad as I would have thought,I've been avoiding this movie like it was Catwoman and many of the things I've read about it reminds me of the fact. In truth however this isn't near as bad as I've heard. Maybe the whole thing about low expectations...The movie starts out with the group right where they left off in the first movie and how they are starting to fight with each other's values as some are trying to settle down while others are heating things up. Meanwhile a planet destroying fiend is making his way towards the earth and an old villain shows up to try and shake things up.This movie was predictable and it was indeed a fairly brainless action film. Many of the points made were not bad when it comes to comic book movies and it was enjoyable to watch. The battles were fun and even if the other characters don't fit their old school comic book character types the main four have the chemistry down right. Over all if you get a shot at this in the $5 bin I say go for it you'll have a liitle fun.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I am so hot for you right now...not!,"So yesterday I saw the crap fest that was Fantastic Four 2 and the whole movie felt like someone was punching my balls. I was actually embarrassed by how bad the dialog was. The effects were also bad. Were in the year 2007, that's the best effects you've got. Now i thought the first movie sucked so going into this I didn't have much anticipation, but all the reviews saying that it was better than the first really made me want to check it out, hoping for a miracle. What a major letdown! I didn't even walk away from the film thinking ""Wow that was fun, a little campy, but still just an all around good time"", well that wasn't the case! And to all of you stupid nerds out there who thought the movie was ""Fantastic"", you have absolutely no taste in movies! The only thing I liked about this movie was one line that i thought was hilarious.I am so hot for you right now.As for this franchise.I am so done with you right now",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better than the first one, but little else than simple summer entertainment","Given the first Fantastic Four's box-office success (despite a storm of negative reviews), a sequel was almost mandatory. And with a trailer that promised lots of action and, most of all, the screen debut of fan-favorite Silver Surfer, one may be forgiven for expecting the second installment to be much better than its predecessor. The truth? 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is nowhere near the levels of Spider-Man, X-Men or even Hulk, but it does slightly improve on the original, the result being a passable, rather entertaining summer actioner.At first, though, it seems like we're slipping back into the first film's mediocrity: after a pretty good opening sequence (showing Galactus, here depicted differently than in the comics, as he destroys a planet), the movie cuts to Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm's (Jessica Alba) wedding arrangements, during which the FF's leader throws out some gibberish about their imminent union being more important than sub-molecular problems (huh?). His fiancée's reaction? ""That's the most romantic thing you have ever said to me!"".Thankfully, that dull moment is immediately forgotten, as we move on to the actual wedding ceremony (featuring one of Stan Lee's best cameos: he plays a rejected guest, in reference to a similar scene in the original comic-book issue), which is abruptly interrupted by a mysterious force that is causing climactic changes all around the world (cue an amusing joke about global warming). This force, it turns out, is actually the Surfer (physically portrayed by Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne), a herald who looks for planets the aforementioned Galactus can feed on. His presence implies that the Four have got only one week to come up with a solution to Earth's problems, and on top of that they have to deal with the return of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who was revived by the Surfer's actions.In terms of plotting, this film has a more interesting script than the first installment: having introduced the characters in the previous movie, Don Payne and Mark Frost can focus on defining them a little better (something that was missing last time) in order to properly integrate their different personalities into the story. Largely, they succeed: the best characters are still the Human Torch (Chris Evans, cocky, self-absorbed and funny) and the Thing (Michael Chiklis, ranging between amusing and eager to fight), but Reed and Sue get a better treatment as well, emerging as three-dimensional people instead of underwritten type. Gruffudd, in particular, is more comfortable in his role, as proved by a hilarious disco scene, one of the best examples of how the film manages to replicate the comic's mix of humor and light action (this is a PG feature after all).Speaking of which, another improvement concerns the action scenes: they may not match the visual inventiveness of other Marvel adaptations, but thanks to the Silver Surfer's presence they are charged with an energy that was unseen in the first movie (the Torch-Surfer duel is even better in the actual film than it was in the trailer). The Surfer himself is also a charismatic addition, although the short running time (92 minutes), combined with the fact that it takes half an hour before he shows up, makes the exploration of his tragic nature a little rushed. Of course, it doesn't help that a lot of time is spent, or rather wasted, on Dr. Doom: McMahon may look more menacing than before (especially at the beginning of the film), but once again he prefers to sideline his own lethal charm and mimic previous Marvel villains (the Green Goblin in the first movie, Magneto in the sequel), reducing a respected and feared character to a half-hearted pantomime; in addition, the bad-guy-becoming-ally gimmick has been used before and much better, namely by Bryan Singer in the superb X2. Another disappointment is Galactus: that he doesn't exactly look like his comic-book counterpart was to be expected; that he doesn't speak once and is used very sparely (little more than five minutes in the entire movie) considerably diminishes the impact of his presence, making the Surfer the only element able to save the film.Saving a motion picture, however, turns out to be a lot more difficult than saving the world, at least in this case, meaning that, though enjoyable, 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a fairly average summer movie. Which is all right compared to the original FF movie, but not considering the higher quality of other blockbusters out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better the reboot didn't dissapoint.,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a tedious, disjointed bore for people over the age of 13 who are not comic book fans. The cinematic desecration of one of the most storied and adored Marvel comic book epics is an atrocity for comic book fans of any age. It turns one of the most menacing and dangerous of all villains into an interstellar storm cloud and reduces recognizable characters to soulless special effects.For a viewer who doesn't give a damn about what's happening on the screen, I can see how there might be some flimsy appeal here. But because Rise of the Silver Surfer is so subpar, Spider-Man 3 seems like a masterpiece in contrast.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Well,  you got me, pal""","Having just seen this at the Garland Theatre,a second-run discount theater in my neighborhood,I'm glad I didn't pay for a full price cineplex ticket. Not that it's a stinker, but it just doesn't qualify as a very good film in the superhero genre. There's a telling bit in the wedding scene where Marvel honcho Stan Lee is refused entry to the event. Stan and Marvel have not had a lot going their way this year. SPIDERMAN 3 is doing just OK at the box office, but, worse, it's collecting less than stellar reviews from some quarters who say it's the worst of the trilogy.The X-MEN franchise is going downhill also and there don't seem to be any comic superheroes waiting in the wings for Marvel to take Hollywood by storm as Spidey and X-Men did. If it's any consolation, Superman and Batman are not doing much better on the big screen. These things go in cycles, though, and I'm sure the comic book superhero will rebound again. It will take some new faces and characters to do it probably, but the superhero is not dead, it's just like a sleeping volcano that's bound to erupt again. Getting back to this movie, I give it good marks for some clever plot devices. The wedding was played way too straight, though, and the director should have either given it more humor or more suspense. The switching of super powers was another thing that should have been given more play, and the possible breakup of the team should also have been emphasized more than with just a few lines like my summary quote by Thing to Johnny. At just 91 minutes, this film was just way too short to develop much of the storyline better. Sometimes, more is not better, but in this case, what I saw on the screen just left me wanting more. It was mildly entertaining, but SILVER SURFER never got me, pal. Dale Roloff",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic,"""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (2007) is a sequel that, while entertaining, ultimately struggles to surpass its predecessor. While it boasts impressive visual effects and introduces the iconic Silver Surfer, the film suffers from a predictable plot and some uneven pacing.The arrival of the Silver Surfer, a powerful cosmic entity, presents a compelling threat to Earth. The film effectively captures the awe and terror inspired by the Surfer's destructive powers. Visually, the Silver Surfer is a stunning creation, with impressive CGI bringing the character to life on screen.The core cast reprises their roles, and their chemistry remains a highlight. However, the film struggles to delve deeper into the characters' personal lives and emotional conflicts. The focus shifts heavily towards the external threat, leaving less room for character development and introspection.The plot, unfortunately, is predictable. The film follows a familiar formula, with the heroes initially struggling to understand the threat, forming an uneasy alliance, and eventually banding together to save the day. While there are some exciting action sequences, the overall narrative lacks the originality and surprise of the first film.Despite its shortcomings, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" offers some entertaining moments and impressive visual spectacle. It's a decent superhero film that effectively introduces the Silver Surfer to the big screen. However, it ultimately falls short of reaching the heights of its predecessor, failing to fully capitalize on the potential of its premise.Disclaimer: This is just one perspective on the film, and opinions may vary.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kinda fantastic,"I believe these actors are these characters but not much happens. The silver surfer looked liked the comics but the effects on him weren't that convincing.But I hate they couldn't do Galactus the devour of planets right, it doesn't look like him at all",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Swoosh !...........,"I liked this installment better than the first. Character development went to the next level and the introduction of the Silver Surfer was acceptable. Exploration of the S.S. character as the 'Herald of Galactus' might leave a hole in some folk's understanding of the evolution of The Fantastic Four, and some other Marvel characters, within this pop genre literature. I would suggest going to Wikipedia and reading up on 'Marvel Universe' to gain further insight into the thought process and development behind the milieu. Stan Lee's cameo was great and I am happy to see that he is finally getting the recognition (and paycheck) he deserves for the concept and development of this genre. Story line, acting, screen play, dialog, scoring are all good and this film plays true to the comic book format at its roots. I found it, over all, to be an enjoyable experience, however.....it did cost me $8. to get in plus $5. for a SMALL popcorn , I brought my own bottle of water. So for $13. I got to see a pretty decent, 90 minute film....maybe I should have waited till it came to the $2. theater..................",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a significant Rise of quality,"First things first: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is better than its predecessor, 2005's Fantastic Four. However, that doesn't mean it's a great film. Rise of the Silver Surfer has more interest and mystery to it, indeed, but it still falls short of comic book adaptation greatness by a long shot. An over-reliance on sitcom style humor, a lack of satisfying action, and a weak villain don't serve the film well, making Rise of the Silver Surfer an underwhelming experience.As the film opens, Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are about to be married when strange occurrences across the globe are brought to the attention of the Fantastic Four. Water is frozen over when it isn't winter, it snows in the desert, and large craters begin appearing throughout the world. Reed tracks the radiation present at the events and eventually narrows it to a being that is flying throughout the world, composed of silver and riding a surf-board like object. He is dubbed the Silver Surfer, and after having been chased by the Human Torch ne Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), the Surfer is discovered to be more powerful than bargained for.Also interested in the Silver Surfer is a healed Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who has reappeared and offers to help for hidden nefarious purposes. The Fantastic Four and Doom join forces to attempt to thwart the Surfer and stop the destruction throughout the planet, but the Surfer appears to only be a taste of the danger that looms on the horizon.The story of the Silver Surfer is one of the iconic comic book plot lines, cherished by millions, and while Rise of the Silver Surfer does a better job of producing a somewhat entertaining film than Fantastic Four, this probably isn't what comic book fans are looking for. The film's principal problem is it's rather shallow, silly humor that gets in the way of the story having much in the way of any impact. The Fantastic Four aren't really developed much, and fail to resonate with the audience, so their petty squabbling proves tiresome and counterproductive to building any interest in the goings on that occur. When one key emotional scene arrives, you don't feel anything for the characters because you just don't care about them.Rise of the Silver Surfer is hampered by the return of its weak villain, Victor Von Doom, in the guise of Julian McMahon. While he has a bit more menace this time around, he is still not tremendously threatening or interesting, and has relatively limited screen time. Screenwriters Don Payne and Mark Frost also make the poor decision to create one of the stupidest characters in a film in recent memory, Army General Hager, portrayed by Andre Braugher. This character is so inept and silly that you can't help but shake your head in several scenes. Braugher, a terrific actor, deserves much better.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer does do some things right though. The visual effects that realize the Silver Surfer are exceptional, proving to be fairly eye-popping at times. And while the Silver Surfer isn't given much of any development, he does have a sense of mystery and threat to him that works at times, and in a key scene manages to earn a degree of pathos.That being said, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer proves to be just a slight notch above what came before, and not the home run many in the comic book community might have been hopelessly dreaming of (this reviewer included). It isn't a disaster, Superman IV and Return of Swamp Thing don't have to worry about being dethroned as the worst comic book movies ever, but it could have been much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining to be kind. Very Messy and Convoluted,"I had some fun with this title. I do have to say it was pretty messy. For a 90 minute film, it had way too many plot lines. I thought the growth some of these characters go through was great, but it also felt like it was out of nowhere. Johnny being a standout. At times things were rushed, and even unnecessary. You absolutely did not need Doom in here at all. I thought Silver Surfer was cool as well. To be kind this movie is entertaining enough. It was way too short, and way too convoluted. I found it to be pretty obvious, the stuff that didn't need to be in here. Another problem with this movie is that it feels like it doesn't have a purpose. There was no clear drive, or no clear direction of where this movie was going. Don't even get me started on Galactus.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rise,"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is one of this year most awaited summer blockbuster and for me this got to be the most improvement of them all compare to Spiderman 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End. Or maybe the first one was pretty bad that it make this one look good, but for what it was this one is pretty entertaining.Synopsis: Fantastic 4 have a new mission, stop the Silver Surfer who has been terrorizing the planet after they learned that which ever planet the Silver Surfer visited, the planet dies within 8 days.I thought the film was very entertaining. The story is pretty good specially there is more stuff going on, though not much more it looks a whole lot more. It actually kinda has a lot of content that are similar to first movie. I like the idea where they reintroduce Dr. Von Doom to create a tense atmosphere. Though, I’m kind of disappointed that not much of character development at all, except for they have girlfriend.Silver Surfer got to be one of the best villains out there, and I’m glad they decide to choose him for this installation because he just doesn’t only look awesome, his ability is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately in this movie he was not able to show much of his ability and the only time you will see him doing anything is flying away from Torch and fighting with the army, which both scenes lasted just a few minutes.Apart from that it was the same old Fantastic Four with a little more action that is not really related to its villain. Mr. Fantastic and Invisible girl look much older than before. Torch gets much more screen time but somehow not as funny and memorable as the first and The Thing, what does actually the Thing do in this movie? Not really the part of the team at all.Despite complaining I got to say the movie was fun to watch. It is the same old mindless comical movie like the first movie but with vast improvement in CGI and much faster pace action and with more budget they now able to fight in different part of the world which is more pleasure to watch. Good for what it is.Recommendation: Yes, Watch It, Compare To The First This Is 10 Times Better.Reason to Watch: Silver Surfer.Reason Not To: Too Comical (But That What The Movie Go For).Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-).Please Rate (Y/N) After Read.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
worst...comic...movie...ever!!!,".05 out of 10 stars No, really...I mean it. This wretched pile of film makes other comic-sourced stinkers such as Steel, Ghost Rider, Judge Dread, the second two Batman (bat-nipples?!?!) movies and Daredevil (not to mention Elektra) seem like Nobel Prize winners. Wow, what didn't they get wrong with this??? The worst part about the whole mess is that The Fantastic Four should have been done with so much more respect and care (re: X-Men, Spider-Man, Superman 1,2, and Returns, Batman Begins...) as opposed to some flavor of the month action movie with a few cool looking sets, and that goes for the first FF movie as well. Where to start with how bad this is...The Thing is a cheesy rubber suit (didn't anyone learn anything from Roger Corman?).The Thing is a cheesy rubber suit. (deserves to be stated twice) -The characterizations of the individual members of The Fantastic Four are overbearing and for the most part wrong.The story and acting suck - Jessica Alba is just plain wrong for Sue Storm.Dr. Doom is a petty, one-liner dropping villain instead of a badass.Having to hold back the vomit crawling up my throat every time The Thing or Johnny have anything to say to each other...or anyone else for that matter.The special effects mostly suck, and they REALLY suck at the club when Reed is dancing.Going ""Ultimate"" with the story instead of culling better ideas from a 40 year pedigree.Worst Stan Lee cameo in any Marvel movie to date.Galacticloud I could take a long time and point out more but that's about all I care to recall about this movie since I've already wasted enough of my precious life watching it once and I'll never watch it again.

"A fun, action-packed comic book movie!","I'll start off by saying that the reason I enjoyed this movie was because, it was fun! Don't get me wrong, I love all the serious comic adaptations like Batman and The Punisher... but it was great to watch a super hero movie that was light, funny, and still had plenty of action/special effects sequences.The acting was so-so. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba aren't the greatest when it comes to acting, but they get the job done (although they deliver many lines that had me rolling my eyes). On the other hand, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans were perfect for their parts, and I enjoyed every moment that either of them were on the screen (they not only act as comic relief, but they're also the best when it comes to kicking the crap out of the bad guy).So, to wrap it up, the movie had great action sequences, some cute funny parts, and a simple storyline that should keep any movie fan entertained.

The Summer is Saved,"Thank you 20th Century Fox and Marvel, you have saved the summer for me. So we kicked off the summer with Spiderman 3 which was one of the most anticipated movies in history, and it was such a let-down. Next to take the plunge was Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, which i just couldn't sit through. And in quick succession was Shrek The Third and Oceans 13. Now while Oceans 13 wasn't all bad, Shrek The Third was just not great.So as i walked into the cinema today with all my friends i was hoping and praying that Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer could save the summer from all these huge let-downs. Walking out of the cinema i felt very elated, because this film is phenomenal. It wasn't too long, the story wasn't too complicated, the characters were all brilliantly played, the action was awesome, the special effects were great as well, the list just goes on. However there was one thing that made this movie so great, and that was the fact that it felt like a summer blockbuster. I was sat in the cinema thinking to myself, this exactly what it was meant to be like watching Pirates of the Caribbean and Shrek and that makes this film the bar for this summer.So lets all thank the Fantastic Four and the Silver Surfer for saving the summer for finally entertaining us and giving us something that was worth going to the cinema for.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just another way to spend the money,"Let me start with my subjective impressions. On the next day after seeing this, I was asked:""Where did ya go yesterday?"",well I said ""To some movie, y'know"";""Which one?""""Um... uh... well, y'know.. it had some superheroes.. I guess?"" ... Well, this summer is sure full of CGI movies. Fantastic Four being one of them, it was not in my watch list at the beginning, but then friends asked me to come and, with nothing better to do, here I was, sitting in the cinema. Well, at first it did seem better than I imagined, although it soon turned out to be JUST AS lame as I imagined. Lol.The special effects are all unrealistic and looks like some video game, except maybe the chase of Silver Surfer guy that was previewed in the trailer. Nothing surprised me. Nothing excited me. The movie had a few laughs, some mocked-up ""last battle against evil"" scene, but nothing could be called memorable or cool.The main heroes did get some development, but I think even Spidey 3 could surpass this film here (and yes, that's bad). Actually, those few emotional problems characters are facing seem remarkably similar to Peter Parker's ones (wedding, overconfidence), although this movie doesn't see anything bad about being overconfident in the end.Well I'd say you may go to this movie only if you want to KILL time. It doesn't have anything in it. It's shallow, and you will probably spend your time chatting with the girl on the right. As I did, in fact. I'm putting 6/10 only because I later managed to spend a beautiful evening with that girl. On the other hand, she stole my wallet. Oh well.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Soulless fun,"Why soul-less? Throughout the whole movie, I didn't really feel connected to the characters or their fate. Trying to analyse this, I think it's that they don't go very deep into anyone's psyche at any point; there's the different characters and you have an idea of the kind of people they are, but no one makes you take a deep look at any of them. When insights are given, they're rather thrown in and glossed over as though someone thought the film ought to have some more substance.The silver surfer is very cool, and the Fantastic Four's powers are believably and seamlessly animated (I can't remember/never really saw the 1st movie to compare to). It was more predictable than the average Hollywood blockbuster (oops is that a spoiler? :-), and personally I'm not sure I like Jessica in blonde, not sure it quite suits her skin colour.I had to think whether to knock it down to 4 from 5 (which I almost gave it) but in the end, I'm estimating the novelty-gain factor (ie. how you rate it having just seen it 1st time compared to the longer term view). Not a complete panning, but don't look for more than good special-effects and Jessica Alba being hot. No doubt big F4 fans will be commenting on everything that's different compared to the comics, I went with a friend who knew them. Still kind of a fun movie though, of the throwaway sort, which saves it a little.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not One of the Best Superhero Flicks Ever, But Cheesy Fun","So when I was a kid, I went through multiple phases of who my favorite super hero was. For quite a bit of time, it was a shared spot by all members of The Fantastic 4. When I saw the first movie, I thought it was awesome. And then in the middle of my FF phase, ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" came out. But what I got, wasn't quite what I had expected.Set about a year or two after the previous film, Reed Richards and Susan Storm are about to be married. But on their big day, things take a turn for the worst as a mysterious being shows up who is digging giant holes in the planet to the earth's core. The U.S. army task the Fantastic 4 with stopping the Silver Surfer before he destroys the planet. At the same time, Victor Von Doom, aka Doctor Doom, has been resurrected and after encountering the Surfer, goes to the army to help Reed, Johnny, Ben, and Susan stop the Surfer. It is revealed that the Surfer is actually a herald for a greater threat, known as Galactus, an entity that devours planets for energy. Victor steals the Surfer's board and now the Fantastic Four have to save the world from the combined threat of Doctor Doom and Galactus before either one control the planet.As far as acting goes, superhero movies from the 80's to the late 2000's are pretty generic with their acting skills. There are exceptions like Christopher Nolan's Batman films and Bryan Singer's X-Men films, but for the majority of it, the acting is never something the films thrive on. 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is one of those movies. The performances are bland and as good-evil as Hollywood gets. The only one in these films who I think played their character to a T is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. He embodies the Human Torch much more than Captain America in my opinion.The action in this film is pretty good for as far as super hero films used to go. With one's like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"" these days, where the action is really insane or thrilling, it's amazing. But in the 2000's, anyone will remember that nothing really mind blowing happened in super hero films until 2008. For a summer popcorn flick, 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' has good action. The problem is it's done all too fast and feels really rushed. I don't think there's a better example than the fight in the forest with the Silver Surfer. When Surf is flying around and smacking missiles away like they're nothing, that was awesome. But it all ends in like one minute when Susan turns on some device and it's like ""Well, that was short"".For one thing, I always thought bringing back Doctor Doom was a stupid move by the writers. They should have stuck with it like the ""Spider-Man"" films. Kill the villain, he's done for good. But in a logic defying move, Fox somehow bribed Julian McMahon to come back. This is my least favorite part of this film. I though Victor was a good villain in the first ""Fantastic Four"", but here, he takes a back seat so the Surfer can have the spotlight. Understandably, but still, it feels like Doom was added last minute just so they had an excuse to bring back a familiar face. It certainly feels that way with his relevance in the film. When Victor once again becomes Doctor Doom, he has a dumb new silver cape, which I always though looked stupid. I mean, it's always been green. Don't mess with tradition.Now the whole movie, Johnny's powers have been in flux. After the Surfer attacked him, Johnny can temporarily trade powers with the other members of the team. But when the final fight happens with Doom, it's not the Fantastic Four teaming up. Instead, Johnny goes solo absorbing all the Four's powers and just beats the crap out of Doom. Then Ben takes a crane and home-runs Doom into the ocean and they act like everything's fine. He survived being burned and flash frozen; you don't think he could survive taking a swim? It was obvious that the writers were suggesting that Doom would return in a third Fantastic Four film, but I'm glad that never happened.Honestly, the Silver Surfer sucks in the movie. Aside from the Surfer's powers,there's nothing really cool about him. He's a cardboard cut-out of a character. In the finale of the film, the Surfer sacrifices himself to destroy Galactus. That's right, the Fantastic Four don't stop Galactus, the Surfer blows himself up using the board's power. I think this was a really cheap move by the writers. It's like, instead of really thinking of a cool way for the Four to even fight Galactus, they took the lazy way out and were like ""Well how about the Surfer stops him?"" and they slacked their way from there.My final gripe about this film. Galactus. Anyone who has read the comics, or played Marvel Ultimate Alliance knows who Galactus is, what he looks like, and how unstoppable he is. Instead of the purple colossus of doom that Galactus has always been, the writers turned him into a space cloud. It looks like something out of a Roland Emmerich film, not an intergalactic super-villain.I know I've gone on a long bitch-fest about this flick and you probably think I hate it. Well, you're half right. I used to hate it, but after re-watching it the other night I found myself highly enjoying it. Despite the things I hate about it, I found that it's very good, cheesy fun.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Silver Surfer Rules !!!,"Being the first sequel of this year which has a chance to improve upon the box office records of its successor, Silver Surfer casts a cosmic charm on the big screen. Rise of the Silver surfer improvises on the original movie, it starts off with the impending wedding of Susan Storm and Reed Richards. We find a deepening relationship amongst them.There is a lot of chemistry amongst the four super heroes. Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm who cannot tolerate each other, overcome odds and become great buddies towards the end. We see a new side to Johnny Storm, The human torch. He is still the one to deliver the comic lines, but with a twist of events, he becomes the person responsible leading to missions getting haywire. Its a serious side to his character. Reed Richards, Mr.Fantastic becomes the character he truly is, he leaves the scientist bit, and becomes the leader of the Fantastic Four.If the first movie was focused on The Thing, then this one is based on the Human Torch. Unlike the first movie where he gets any girl to his liking, in this sequel he is vexed with an army vixen who doesn't spare a moment with him. There is a return of Von Doom, who becomes evil personified with the help of the Surfer's board.But truly unique is the character of the Surfer. He has feelings for Susan, because she reminds him of his loved one from his faraway planet. His mission is to make ready a planet for destruction. He becomes the tragic hero, the bidder of evil deeds, left with no choice. But his character is truly enigmatic, he is the all powerful being when conjoint with the board. He feeds on cosmic energy which is why practically speaking he cannot be killed or destroyed. His powers are immense. He can consume a missile, without scratching himself.The special effects are a whole lot better than the previous movie. The final sequence when the Four combine to give their powers to Johnny to destroy Von Doom. Then the initial chase sequence between the Human Torch and the Surfer is also mind blowing. the Fantastic Four vehicle sequence is also pretty neat.All in all a fair watch, mildly entertaining and good to keep your mind off from work for 2 hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Same tack as Spiderman but better,"Ten years ago moves based on comic books were created for kids and adults considered them idiotic. The heroes were idealistic cretins and the villains were one-dimensional idiots like Schwarzenegger in Batman & Robin.Fortunately, Hollywood has finally understood that their audience has grown up and have started making comic book movies that adults can enjoy. The pinnacle of that sudden IQ infusion was Batman Begins with Christian Bale.Silver Surfer is nowhere close to that but still provides an enjoyable superhero movie. It still suffers from tacky ""lets talk about our feelings"" moments, but thankfully it keeps them to a minimum and instead provides a lot of humor and action.If you enjoy comic book movies you should enjoy this one. It's not the best in its genre but it's still good entertainment.Dejan",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Okay after a slow start, some good sequences but not amazing","I was lucky enough to get tickets to the world premiere in London, it was very cool to walk down the red carpet (which was actually blue) surrounded by the stars and hundreds of screaming people.Some background, the first film I had heard such bad reviews of that I never saw it until last year when I caught it on TV in the US and I liked it much more than I thought I would. The Silver Surfer starts very shabbily I thought, about twenty minutes of lame humour around the wedding of Reed Richards and Sue Storm and the interpersonal relationships between the four. If I had paid to see it I would have been kicking myself at this point. However once the story kicks in properly and the action sequences start the next 70 minutes are very enjoyable indeed.The story concerns the Surfer coming to the Earth and the four quickly realising that his presence means that the planet is doomed since any planet he inhabits is destroyed a few days later. They must find a way of communicating with the Silver Surfer to find out why he does what he does and then battle an old enemy in order to save the world. The last hour contains some fantastic sequences that it would be a shame to spoil but by then there is finally a great balance of humour and excitement. I must say they have a kick ass new mode of transport and I particularly loved seeing the sequences in my city of London.There are some rather poor by modern standards CGI early on especially the Mr Fantastic stretching which looks cheaply done but later effects are much much better with the Silver Surfer himself looking fantastic. I wouldn't say rush out and see it but not bad at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Has its problems, but does a much better job than the first film","I was never a big fan of the first Fantastic Four movie. Despite my limited knowledge of the mythos of that comic franchise, I could still tell how sloppily made the film was. It had a few good areas, but not enough to make it pass being merely watchable. After watching it, I held hopes for the obvious sequel, and whether or not it would be able to truly make the franchise fall in line with other superhero films. But while Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer does improve a few of the errors of the first film, it still is plagued with a lot of the same problems.Picking up some time after the events of the first film, the sequel finds the team still trying to wrestle between leading their lives, and the media circus that follows their every move (even down to the point where Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm/Invincible Woman's (Jessica Alba) wedding is the celebrity event of the year). But when a strange force begins to cause unnatural phenomena, as well as bizarrely gigantic pot holes around the world, the team is thrust into trying to stop it before it does any devastating harm to the planet.While the origin story in the first film was quite sketchy and dare I say stretched a bit too far in the literal and emotional senses, this second story is a bit of a mixed bag. It is definitely a lot more concrete and straight-forward, but there are plenty of moments where I sat wondering why it was being so jumpy with what was going on. The opening seconds of the film even has a bit of an integral plot device going on. It was surprising and a bit jarring, and became even more so when I realized just how quickly it ended. There was plenty of exposition, but there was just something missing from the overall storyline with it being so short and fast-paced.What also did not help was the juggling act the film did with its themes and its tones. At the drop of a hat, it jumped from slapstick comedy to a drama, to just bizarre science fiction. I know that the comics were known for their humour, but much like the first movie, a little bit of it feels a little ill placed. I did indeed get plenty of laughs from the odd pairing of Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Michael Chiklis), but much of the other humour seemed a little weary and flat in some cases. The shaky tone of the film probably did not help this (as even the music became quite whimsical when even confronting what should be an intense action sequence). The themes were also a bit of an issue, as they did not stay as straight and narrow as anyone could have hoped. They too jumped around, focusing a little too much in some places that did not matter as much as the places they did not focus on.The special effects on the other hand, have greatly improved since the last go around. No longer does Mr. Fantastic look completely computer generated. He actually looks like a living entity this time (even during his hokey dance sequence which was nowhere near as effective as the one in Spider-Man 3), and actually moves a lot more gracefully. Same goes for the Human Torch and the Invincible Woman, whose powers now look a lot more life-like, and a lot more natural than they did before. The star of the show, the Silver Surfer (acted by the impeccable Doug Jones and voiced by Lawrence Fishbourne), may not get a lot of real backstory, but he looks absolutely amazing. It is immensely hard to even realize that the character is not totally computer animated, and in fact, looks even more realistic than the powers the superheroes are wielding. Kudos to the filmmakers for putting some extra money into one of the key areas that needed help (although I think Galactus probably could have done with an extra touch of work).Sadly, two years has done nothing for Gruffudd and Alba. They still do not work well as their characters, and they work even less as a believable couple. A key plot element within the film is about their wedding that keeps getting postponed. But when you see these two interacting with each other, you will be hard set even trying to imagine how they co-exist. There is not even an ounce of chemistry between them, and the film suffers as a result of it. Gruffudd is just too lifeless in his role as Mr. Fantastic, and Alba is too classless for Invincible Woman. She plays the character more like a narcissist waiting for the right moment to run to the bathroom to throw on some more makeup than she does as a strong willed scientist who just happens to be a superhero.Evans on the other hand, is pitch perfect as Human Torch. He has the egotistical mannerisms down solid, and is just enough of a wise ass to truly feel authentically created by the comics. Chiklis is a lot stronger this time round, but is sadly, the most underused of the four. I would have liked a little more sinister villainy from Julian McMahon, who returns as Dr. Doom and has a lot more screen time than I ever would have imagined. A little more dialogue from Fishbourne would not have been a bad idea either.On the whole, the sequel does a better job than the original, and seems to be headed into the right direction if they make a third film. While it does have a lot of the same problems as the first movie, it does an adequate job making up for a lot of them. I just wish everyone in the main cast was as perfect as Evans.6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
They didn't make the movie I wanted but I liked it anyway,"This is an update of the original review (below). I would say that the Avengers movie demonstrates the point I was trying to make about the potential these characters and story- lines -- unrealized by the Fantastic Four movies.In the comic books, the FF stories rival and often surpass the Avengers.You would never have known from this offering.***************** This 10 is not the same #10 I would give a great and enduring classic, but it IS a 10 just the same.I am a long term Marvel and FF fan. As a child, I bought the Galactus trilogy as they were printed. When I was 12, I decided that I wanted to direct the movie (didn't work out that way). So I have waited for this film for a long time.In my heart I wanted these movie to make these characters seem real and to make the audience feel the enormous gravity of the challenges that they faced. I also wanted their powers -- individually and collectively -- to seem commanding in scope and power. The ""screen-reality"" of these characters feel much smaller that what I had hoped for, but I enjoyed the films anyway.I am still holding out hope that FF2 will be successful enough that more films with adequate resources will be made -- and the gravity of the characters grow to meet my expectations.PS...

Great Movie,"F4 is a great movie, entertaining and fun. Of course is not going to satisfy all people like hard core fans that want everything in detail like a comic book, but everyone knows that's impossible because the movie is not intended to that audience alone , also normal people who never heard of that kind of heroes.And Mr. Fantastic is very good and Ioan Gruffudd makes a great MR.Fantastic. Every character is good in the movie and well balance so if you are looking for more characters personality the movie also delivers.Talking about special effects are great better than the first one and will catch you eye for sure.I think the movie delivers and anybody can enjoy it.And for those hard core fans better two movies of the F4 than nothing so accepted as it is because is great and is much better than reading paper so enjoy!!The movie is very good.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shootin' The Tube With The Silver Dude,"The Fantastic Four are back in FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER ...dude.Slipping back into the latest comic-book-to-film wave, director Tony Scott (of the 2005 FANTASTIC FOUR feature) tries to shoot the tube by giving us another character from the original comics.And the story goes...Mr. Fantastic, aka Reed Richards/""Stretch"" (Ioan Gruffudd), and Sue Storm, aka The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), are trying, once again, to get married. Interruptions have stifled all attempts at matrimonial bliss and this time it comes from another world. The Silver Dude (voiced by Laurence Fishburn, AKEELAH AND THE BEE) has ""surfed"" onto Earth to do his master's bidding (see Destroy Planet Plan 101). Breaking through the planet's mantle, The Silver Surfer prepares each planet he visits for the impending arrival of a cloud of ...um ...stuff known as Galactus (the comic book showed this as a giant robot but apparently Tony Scott refused to have any kind of giant robots in his films).Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) stars as The Human Torch and the first of the fabulous squad to interrupt The Surfer's wild ride. Energy transfers between Silver-Boy and Torch cause fluctuations in Johnny Storm's abilities to light up. Anyone who touches Johnny, too, gets a touch of this transference and is quite funny when Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) trades powers with him for a few short moments.Mr. Fantastic has to help the military find a way to disable The Silver Surf all while trying to prepare for his wedding. Time is short for both and when The Surfer shows up near Reed and Sue's hitching place, the waves come crashing down on their celebration (bummer, dude).Racing to save the planet from The Surfer's seemingly incalculable powers, the military enlists surprise, surprise! Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). You really didn't think he was gone permanently, did you? Victor's able mind and talents help bring Silver-Boy down but oh! you know that ol' Von Doom mind. He's got other plans for The Silver Surfer's powers.Shortened by nearly 15 minutes from the first film, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer feels lessened in two significant ways. First is that there's almost zero explanation as to how the Silver Surfer became the creature he is. The ""love"" interest between what was Silver-Dude's woman far, far away doesn't explain much and leaves viewers caring little about him. The second is the rushed story focusing on booms! bangs! and gadgetry rather than the substance of the characters. The other issue some may have is that it ends with no resolution as to what happened to Von Doom or The Silver Surfer's all-powerful board (maybe he sent it out for a nice waxing).Even so, this is a fun, quick watch. It has some hysterically comical moments (almost all of which are thanks to Chris Evans' plucky Human Torch).Just don't expect much character and you might enjoy certain aspects.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic? By no means! Better than the first? Indeed it is!,"Just like the first movie in the series this one had problems but somehow it just seems a lot more polished. The dialog is better, the story seems less like a pilot episode for a TV-series and the villain actually seems like a threat to the Fantastic Four this time around. So while your money might be better spent going with Spider-Man 3, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is by no means a bad choice either. The entire cast from the first movie returns (always a plus, I hate it when there are changes in the cast in sequels) and rehashes their characters and in some cases improves on them.Acting wise the movie is not far removed from its predecessor. Which is both good and bad. Ioan Gruffudd returns as Reed Richards and does pretty much exactly what he did in the first movie. He does, however, have a little more to work with and while his motivations seem a little vague he does do a decent job of it. Jessica Alba is once again smoking hot and just like in the first movie her performance is a little dodgy. She is not always completely believable but it can be forgiven. Michael Chiklis has a lot less to work with this time around and has been reduced to serving almost entirely as comic relief which he is great at but given his emotional range is a shame. We saw in the first movie that he was capable of portraying the emotions of the character through all the prosthetics (which must have been hard) and therefore we/I would have liked to see more from him. On the other hand Chris Evans gets a chance to show a little more of the character in this installment and it works great. Its fantastic to see cracks in the armor of a character who has previously seemed so unshakable. Evans is completely believable and once again 100% lovable. We expect great things from him in the future. Julian McMahon returns as well and he ups the stakes for Dr. Doom who becomes more menacing that he ever was in the first movie. Nice to see. The major draw in this movie is of course the emergence of the Silver Surfer one of the most beloved characters from the comics and he looks great and with the majestic vocals of Laurence Fishbourne he truly comes alive on the screen and his first appearance is nothing short of spectacular.Effects wise the movie has taken a great step in the right direction. The effects seem to have matured greatly from the first movie and this makes the film so much more interesting to watch. The Human Torch still looks fantastic on the screen and Mr. Fantastic's stretching powers seem much more credible this time around. The real money shots, however, are of course of the Silver Surfer who looks nothing short of spectacular. As previously stated his first real on screen appearance is one of the most entertaining sequences I have seen this summer. His powers look great as well and every scene with him has a spectacular effect of some sort. Galactus also makes a very brief appearance and he looks nothing like in the comics and for what its worth I think he looked great with some nods to his comic book appearance. All in all I think the movie looks great and this has to be a kudos to Tim Story who received a lot of bashing for the first movie.In terms of the writing the film still has a few issues but is indeed a definite improvement on the first film in the series. The villain has true menace this time around and a lot more is at stake. Both personally for the characters but also globally. The exchanges between Chiklis and Evans are still filled with humor and charm. Their scenes also seem to have a profound sense of warmth and despite their differences their friendship is indisputable. The scenes with the Silver Surfer are the most dramatic and in my opinion they work great and the Surfer has great authority (helped greatly by Fishbourne's vocals). The scenes between Gruffudd and Alba are sadly still a weak point. They seem forced and not always believable.All in all Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is an entertaining summer movie that takes the franchise it builds upon to new and exciting levels and is a clear improvement on the first film in the series. However, it is still not without its problems but works on the basis that you don't expect it to be a revelation.7/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic(ish) 6 (stars out of 10),"I was looking forward to this one only because of the Silver Surfer/Galactus potential. The first F4 movie was a bit of a let down, but not that big a let down as my expectations were not that high to begin with. The first movie was entertaining enough to warrant a trip to the cinema and to part with some of my hard earned cash (but only just!).The second one is similar to the first, the movie has ""Fantastic"" potential, but doesn't quite manage to capture that potential on screen. Although similarly to the first movie I didn't have high expectations regarding the film. I did however hope the whole Galactus/Silver Surfer story-line would at least help enhance the franchise, and in many ways it did. This movie is certainly more entertaining, more fun, better thought-out and grander than its rather damp squib predecessor but not near as much as I was hoping for. The Silver Surfer character had sufficient screen time but wasn't developed enough or convincing as the herald of an ""all conquering force"". As for Galactus well what can I say, poorly executed, yes I agree trying to portray the guy on the big screen would be very difficult, but the cloud just didn't do it for me. I however do appreciate the attempt to make Galactus a credible force on screen. The original cast all return and all do an adequate job, although Chris Evan's is once again the stand-out performer and pretty much steals the show again with some very funny scenes and lines. Direction was OK, script was pretty poor considering the material they had, dialogue was very poor, special effects ran hot one minute to very cold the next, but overall were impressive enough. I just need to keep remembering that this is a COMICBOOK movie....! Overall, its worth the admittance fee, and its an enjoyable 90 odd minutes of entertainment, but once again is a bit of a let down!!! 6/10 ******",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Relatively Speaking,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is not a good movie. It is, however, a good comic book movie. When you compare this film to many of Marvel's other recent cinematic outings, it can be appreciated much more.What makes Fantastic Four a success is that it avoids the pitfalls of other comic book films. It doesn't take itself too seriously (see ""Hulk""), nor does it lose track of the significance of its source material (see ""Spider-Man 3""). The movie is schlocky but not offensive; it is artificial without feeling completely manufactured. Despite the rampant and obvious product placement, the filmmakers avoid attaching the unnecessary social or political commentary that often weights down comic book films. The focus here is on the team's powers which give way to some decent and entertaining action sequences. The acting is mostly unremarkable, though Michael Chiklis once again steals the show as Ben Grimm.Fantastic Four is nothing remarkable, but if you enjoy tacky summer movie fare, it doesn't come much better than this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie was terrible,"If you liked this movie, it's because you have the mind of a 13-year-old. Awful script. Just awful.Superhero movies don't have to be devoid of true character depth and expertly woven dialogue, but they seem to be getting worse in those respects and this film is at the top of the list as far a Hollywood studio crap.The acting is teeeeerrrrrrrrrible. In fact, the acting in this movie sucked so bad, I can't really say if I even remember the direction or the the lighting being good or bad. The special effects definitely weren't spectacular.All in all, I will say that it's sliiiiiightly better than 300, which is the biggest disappointment I've ever encountered in a movie theater. Ever (I even went to the Apple store to listen to Zack Snyder and Fong, his DP, talk about their film-making process, which got me pumped on top of already being a fan of Frank Miller's work). If you liked 300, chances are you didn't read Frank Miller's graphic novel...because if you did, you wouldn't be able to stomach the film version, much in the same way that a person with any sense of superheroes and the infinite possibilities they give filmmakers to make really stupendous material should not have liked F42.Zach Snyder, stick to commercials...Tim Story, grow a pair and make your next superhero film for moviegoers with more than 2 brain cells.-And I'm out!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fantastic Four; Rise of the Silver Surfer, a good family flick","Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. What can you really say about it, the title says it all. This movie was more then just a sequel though; it portrays the characters even closer to the characters in the comic books.Reed Richards played by Ioan Gruffudd begins to start showing that he's the leader of the Fantastic Four as intended his character in the comic books. Human Torch played by Chris Evans, still the cocky self-centered underwear model role from the first movie, but hey, thats the role we love about him. Susan Storm played by Jessica Alba, once again she finds herself exposedliterally, to the public. And lastly Michael Chiklis as our lovable orange monster ""The Thing"", who will never stop to amaze us.But, the real story here, the Silver Surfer played by none other then Doug Jones with the voice of Laurence Fishburne. First off, Doug Jones is one actor in my opinion that does not get enough credit for the roles that he plays. We all loved him in Hellboy as our blue fish friend Abe Sapien, and now with his amazing role as the Silver Surfer. After all the Fantastic Four movies are complete, he deserves his own Silver Surfer movie with a healthy budget to give it what we want.Character development is similar to that of the first Fantastic Four. The chemistry between The Thing and Johnnie Storm is there, also with a new story added in of a wedding for Richard Reed and Susan Storm. However, in my opinion, though the wedding story was interesting and amusing at times it did tend to drag on which ate up lots of screen time that could have possible been used for some neat fight scenes with the Surfer. But all-in-all I don't see anybody getting nominated for a razzie this time around which is a positive.With a finally note, Not the best movie to come out this summer, But it also wasn't terrible either. Amusing, entertaining, a few good creative laughs and very well done special effects. What more could one ask for.So if you happen to be looking for a good movie to take your spouse and kids to and you enjoyed the first Fantastic Four, then I'd highly recommend Fantastic Four; Rise of the Silver Surfer.And keep a watch in the future for the next Fantastic Four, and quite possible fighting along side with the Silver Surfer or in his own Major Motion Picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Battle Against Mediocrity,"Not even the world's greatest superheroes can defeat the mediocrity of FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER.This time around, our heroes are little bit older, a little bit wiser but still coming to grips with their incredible powers. Reed Richards, aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to finally marry Sue Storm, aka the Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba). But then, as it inevitably does in these kinds of movies, all heck breaks loose. It seems some mysterious force -- the Silver Surfer, we soon learn -- is gradually draining the Earth of its life.The plot is suitably comic-book-like, but RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER becomes increasingly mired in a string of CGI-reliant action scenes that are as dizzying as they are fake-looking. Whereas most films have the viewer anxiously waiting for the next injection of action, this one has us wishing director Tim Story would instead flesh out the less-flashy, human angles. In any event, some of the story doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. While many superhero films can get away with that, it hurts this effort more than it would most simply because the film hasn't much else going for it.Perhaps the film's biggest asset -- literally and figuratively -- is Michael Chiklis as The Thing, a lovable lug made of craggy, orange rock. As he was in the 2005 original, he is a sheer delight, particularly when forced to endure the mischief of Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch (Chris Evans). Chiklis flawlessly captures a comic book character in a way few other actors ever have.As a long-time fan of these four fantastically odd heroes, I wanted to like RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER as much as anyone. I gave it many chances to redeem itself. It did not. It's quite a disappointment.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Thats It????!!!!!!,","This was my first reaction as the film ended and I'm sticking to it.BUT as I go from sequel to sequel,from Marvel movie to Marvel movie, and from OK movie to OK movie,so much ""MORE OF THE SAME"" is making it very difficult to write a relatively coherent, unemotional, and objective review.Im no fan but I've do some research on the comic movie I'm about to see.Few things are clear about the movie though.1)ITS A HARDCORE FORMULA (accounting for demographics)FLICK. (read my review of spider-man 3to know what I'm talking about).2)The budget was limited.3)AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IF EVER THERE WAS A Children's FILM THIS IS IT.The formula part is clear because.1)The FF visit so many countries, its funny how the powerful general is always black and how so many scenes show Asian Army Men (haha in real life i wonder how many senior ranking generals are black and how many Asians are in the Army).2)The special effects are strictly OK, Mr. Fantastic looks absolutely fake, Invisible woman does no invisible stunts (ones requiring extra CG), The Thing is there only to talk, all the special effects have been spent on Super Doom, Silver Surfer and Human Torch (and his super version).3)This movie is more like the cartoons of FF, everyone knows that save for the Galactus angle (he devours worlds but is a vital part of the universe) there is nothing dark about the FF, in this sense this movie is ideal for children, no violence, only one person gets hurt and that too not visibly, the messages are all there making the right choices,doing your duty,accepting what you are etc etc.The burping and bear jokes are clearly aimed at them, the DANCING IN THE CLUB ALA SPIDERMAN MAY HAVE BEEN FOR MULTIPLE TARGETS (women,preteens,children) If you want to take children for a comic movie and are afraid about the sexual/violent/dark themes than this is the perfect movie.IF YOU VIEW THIS MOVIE AS A Children's COMIC BOOK MOVIE THAN THIS MOVIE IS CLEARY AN 8-9/10, the only thing that pull it down is that even cartoon have more action (especially gun action though they always do no harm) then this movie).Now for the justification of the summary..I expected Jessica Alba to be hot BUT SHE WAS LOOKING HIDEOUS TO SAY THE LEAST, the signs were there when she kept going on record to say she wanted to look less sexy so people could take her more seriously as an actress YA RIGHT, FF is just the vehicle to prove your acting prowess.I expected there to be at least one really big scene, but after almost every scene is was satisfied but craving for more. (The Millennium Wheel and the first chase scene were really good though).The Thing and Torch provide lots of funny G rated jokes, this movie is filled with G rated humour.Eye candy was non-existent the alternate track with the blonde ""ohh so perfect and nice"" army woman was pathetic, the scene where she Johny pleads her to trust him when shes threatening them with a gun WAS FUNNY AND SAD AT THE SAME TIME (the gun may have as much as stung......................none of them), haha the FF and Silver Surfer threatened with a gun, minutes away from disaster have time for a dialogue scene.And the one fact that triggered the reaction, towards the end I expected a really big showdown between the most powerful character in the comic universe and his equally enigmatic but not quite as powerful servant, what i instead got was a damp squib that was stale enough to be ancient.SO THATS IT???!!! THATS HOW EASY IT IS TO DEFEAT THE MOST Powerful COMIC BOOK CHARACTER EVER.(The mega powerful SS wasn't beaten with much effort either).PROVISIONS FOR SEQUELS AND SPIN-OFFS HAVE BEEN MADE AS EXPECTED, I WILL SHAVE MY HEAD IF THERE Isn't At least ONE MORE FF AND A SILVER SURFER SPIN-OFF.On a positive note Laurence Fishburne did an excellent voice-over of the SS as did Macmohan with Doom.In all another film that just about meets the mark, BUT REALLY EXCELS AS A Children's MOVIE.Ideal for a matinée (any cheaper) show with the family on a Sunday (which is what i did).OR BETTER STILL WATCH ON TV WHEN IT COMES THERE.Watch with sequel considerations, ratings, comic book, current crop of movies in mind.-s NO BIG SCENES, every aspect leaves you with the feeling THATS IT?!!, so so acting, HIDEOUS ALBA, LACKLUSTRE END.+/-s Children's MOVIE.+s short and sweet, doesn't excel but manages to pull through on humour and a few memorable scenes dialogues,meets low expectations,VERY GOOD FAMILY/CHILRENS MOVIE.total 6/10 (factoring in lowered expectations and sequel, once again careful analysis makes the movie go from just good to OK to bad to worse, but when i left except the end leaving a really bad taste the movie was OK and I've stuck to my original rating, gone are the times repeat viewing and careful analysis made the movie better).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Four  Fantastic for what it is.,"I argue with my nephews constantly about the comic book movies. They grew up in graphic novel era. Deep dark brooding characters. I grew up in comic books. Stan Lee is probably mostly responsible for my wit and charm. I got it from the characters he created. So if I had my choice between the brooding Dark Knight and the light wit and humor of the Fantastic Four Fun is going to win every time. I first read comics books because I was too lazy to read a book. Then I read them because I identified with the characters and they we're fun. I only had twenty minutes to entertain myself between the demands of family chores, school or my jobs. The comic book gave me that time. This movie is a comic book. It's not a graphic novel. I don't have to think about it or even look deeply into it's meaning. It is quick easy fun filled E S C A P E. Today's price for escape is around $10 an hour at the theater. And I'm worth it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the best of this Summer...,"First off I want to say that I found Spider Man 3 a much more enjoyable movie going experience. The highlight of the Fantastic Four 2 was definitely the Silver Surfer. The story line seemed pretty solid, but there were weaknesses and these centered around the Doom character. I just didn't buy into it or it wasn't done with enough clarity or purpose and unfortunately it just made the movie weaker. Jessica Alba looked terrible in the first half of the movie but that did improve. I loved the Torch in the first movie and that attitude, for the most part, carried over into the second. But even then it wasn't as good and again, it was the surfer that pretty much stole the show. Mr Fantastic had the most dominant role and that came through very well in this movie.This could have been better, but it was still worth seeing. It's a short film with some rushed, spotty plot line and I have to wonder what was wrong with Abla in the first few scenes, weird. JD",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A great evening for the Fantastic Four: my friend, her two kids and me (Screen)","This movie concluded a ""family"" moment at the time of the coming back to school. After a Italian meal and shopping, we arrived in the projection room right for the opening credits.For my friends, who are outside comic-books, they find it cool, especially the ""Rose"" brick man and his famous expression to ""give five"".For me, a comics-fan for 21 years, I rate it better than X-Men #2 and #3 but far behind Spiderman Trilogy: Good because their family spirit is here, the design, story, effects are positive.Deceiving because Jane is depicted like a spoiled and jealous wife and because Galactus is too cheap!

Childish,"""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" was a childish movie. It was obviously meant for a teenage crowd. I found it ridiculously saccharine. The whole story about the wedding and the delays and Reed Richards' divided attention was just so adolescent. I know the movie is supposed to be comic book but couldn't the producers create something that appealed to people over 15 years old. The effects were technically impressive but pretty devoid of any real suspense. The characters were just clichés and the acting was just good enough for you to know that. Jessica Alba can't really act. She is really hot looking but utterly unconvincing and rather boring. I can't really say that this film is worth seeing. Maybe it is good enough for a rent, maybe.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Terrible movie,"Saw this movie last week on plane from Cape Town to Dublin. Dialogue was terrible. Acting was atrocious. Nothing, absolutely nothing redeemed this movie.Think about it. A human torch? A man with bendy arms? An invisible woman (why are these female characters always 'hot'?) What project will Hollywood waste money on next? Even allowing for the imagination, these characters make Spiderman look positively real!!And the plot? A man - in silver - comes from outer space on a surf board. He's trying to 'feed' something which looks like it came from your average fast food restaurant, and if he's not fed in time he's going to destroy Earth (the source of his food - work that one out).

Better this time,"Possible Spoilers Ahead I'm not reviewing this as if it were Citizen Kane or the Godfather, so fanboys take notice: This is a fun summer movie. It is better than the first(which I enjoyed as well).The team did not squabble as much and audiences were given a classic Marvel situation of heroes versus hero with the appearance of Silver Surfer. Doom was used just enough to give the team someone to battle.True, Galactus was not actually seen in his comic form, but truthfully, that would have been overkill- which is what made Spider-Man 3 such a drag. Rise of the Silver Surfer was just enough that it was still enjoyable to watch.Thankfully, there were also fewer ""hip tunes"" interlaced in this one, and a better focus on the theatrical score. The movie was well paced, with fewer dragging moments.FF's cast is pretty low-key in the media (with the possible exception of Jessica Alba, but even she is not as over-hyped as Kirsten Dunst).Folks, this is the kind of stuff, the little things, that make summer movies fun and not just ""events"". Is this mindless entertainment? To a degree, yes, but much worse has been done in the past (and I'm sure will be done in the future).To me the real appeal here, the true key, is that we don't have to suffer through secret identities with the FF. Their characters are established as celebrities, so we can fore go the usual crap and get down to battles! Here's the wrap up with just a wee bit of rant: It's enjoyable. See it. I sincerely hope we get a third installment (but that's enough) possibly with Mole Man as the heavy.This picture is going to be overshadowed by Spider-Man 3, but unjustly so. In my opinion, FF is a much better summer flick and I'll give you two reasons why: 1. FF was not hyped and rammed down the public's throat like Spidey.2. FF was not the victim of over-marketing like Spidey. I have become convinced that the more marketing tie-ins a picture has attached to it the bigger the disappointment it will truly be. You literally cannot turn around in a supermarket or department store without being smacked in the face with Spidey, Shrek, or Pirates merchandise and to me this over-saturation is what heralds the true quality of a movie. All of these pictures hit big opening weekend and then sunk like a stone. More merchandising says to me that an effort is being made to make money a movie that will fall fast because it's quality is poor. Hulk, Phantom Menace, The Grinch, the list goes on and on.

Better than the First,"After a long wait for F4: ROSS, after re-watching the trailer over and over again and not get bored of it, it is finally here and it's hell a lot better than the first one.

And I'm sure many would be looking forward to seeing Jessica Alba in a skin tight suit again.Story goes like this, Silver Sufer comes to Earth to scout and Fantistic 4 must stop him. But the Silver Sufer is too powerful. So they must team up with Dr Doom to stop him.Simple story, simple script, breath-taking special effect, Mavel jokes, Stan Lee Camoe, Dr Doom, good action and an almost naked Jessica Alba.

"Tires, Bores, Sputters.... Fails.","If you're a fan of the original Fantastic Four, you already know more than I do about the source material. I haven't been weaned on them... I won't conceal that that I've always been drawn to the darker Marvel material such as the Punisher. In fact, ""dark and morbid"" are probably reserved for the Punisher, if we examine the origins of every major title to hit the news stands in the past 50 years.But onto the film... where Spiderman revels in its altruistic to a fault pauper protagonist who can't reap his reward for fear of violating some nonexistent superhero code, Fantastic Four is about four heroes who are in the public spotlight. It's the opposite, and whereas I criticized Spiderman for playing the hardship card way too often, Fantastic Four is manufactured cool which is exactly like Ocean's Eleven/Twelve/Thirteen, it's so boring.The plot about Silver Surfer coming to earth and whupping our foursome with his intergalactic powers... and then there are a few divergent story lines with say, Doom coming back, and Reed marrying Sue. The dialogue is truly groan-worthy... Reed is not a charismatic geek in the film, he just makes you want to bury your head in your lap. Sue hopelessly adores him and bitches when she finds out he is working on something to help out the US military, and the military's top brass engage in some of the stupidest banter I haven't seen committed to script. (At one point, a general tries to allude to Reed's non-participation in sports in high school... and acts 10 paygrades below his rank while doing so.) I didn't appreciate the obligatory disaster-happens-and-four-work-together-to-save-ppl scenes in the first movie and I don't appreciate them here... they're little more than filler, and they're not very creative in my opinion. X-Men did this with much more flair and suspense, in Fantastic Four it's another yawn-inducing crescendo that barely raises the pulse on this unplausible, unlikeable, mediocre movie. I give it 3. Because at the very least, Jessica Alba is very hot.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Average movie,"Personally i found this movie to be extremely average. It is obviously a sequel to the original Fantastic Four and consists of the Thing, The invisible women, Johnny Storm, and Strecho. The movie is not extraordinarily good nor is it bad it is average. You get your usual one liners and your humour between the Thing and Johnny. The FF's main adversary in this movie is the Silver surfer and the planet destroyer named Galactus.The movie does provide some pretty cool fight scenes and some fairly good special effects. It is also fairly short so you don't get too bored at any point in the movie. The movie doesn't dish out too many surprises though. If you see the previews you have almost scene the movie. Stan Lees cameo in this movie was pretty funny. The movie was pretty much what i expected it to be and can be semi enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quite better than the original,"This sequel is more exciting than the first Fantastic Four movie. The ff now really work as a team like in the comics. The introduction of one of the coolest character in the marvel universe is definitely one of the reasons to watch this movie. Even when this movie has a runtime of 92 minutes the movie can be dull at times. But when the action kicks in it is very enjoyable. I do have my doubts on Victor Von Doom. He doesn't come near the character he supposed to be in the comics. (Why did he wear the iron mask,in the movie he isn't scarred at all! That was the reason why he put the mask on in the comics.) I did get the feeling that ""The thing"" was under used in this movie. He is my most favorite character of the four. And why didn't they show the true form of ""Galactus"" Well i can go on and mention all the flaws and be negative.

"Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer (Tim Story, 2007) **1/2","While slightly superior to the original, this is still essentially bland and juvenile stuff  and entirely forgettable once it's over. The film is obviously a special effects bonanza and sees the emergence of a new anti-hero (as opposed to an out-and-out villain  that requirement is filled by the reappearance of the Four's old nemesis, Dr. Von Doom, with whom they're forced to collaborate in order to 'understand' the Silver Surfer!). Certainly the most novel and engaging element about the plot is the fact that, on contact with the alien, our superheroes are able to exchange 'gifts'. On the debit side, the Surfer's ominous ruler is a big disappointment when it finally makes its very belated appearance, the military personnel are pompous and downright obnoxious (ditto Chris Evans' relentless strutting and inane antics) but, thankfully, Jessica Alba is on hand to provide the redeeming and expected eye candy.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Forget The Surfer, just watch Dr. Doom!","I don't want to give any spoiler anyway, you can find it elsewhere easily.I'm not one of those who love the trailer. There is nothing new with the special effect, indeed. Hence, I didn't have any high expectation when I saw this movie with my mother in Indonesia. However, the second trailer which showed Dr. Doom being attacked was interesting so I knew the presence of Dr. Doom will be a different one.In the first movie, Dr. Doom character was a joke. I didn't even remembered how he fought in the first movie.But not in this one. It is fortunate, Dr. Doom sequences in the movie never appeared on the trailer except his encounter with the Surfer.

If you're over 13 years of age, this movie is NOT for you.The surfer is hot with fabulous abs and a perfect chest and if you still need more man meat then you get a shot of fire-boy without his shirt, too.

Not a great movie but at least it's enjoyable,The Fantastic Four are back the following sequel to the first Fantastic Four this time there back in Fantastic Four Rise of The Silver Surfer witch is more fun then the first but still not great The most happiest thing about this Fantastic Four is that Director Tim Story boosted up the action witch was a major flaw in the first the story seems to progress much faster and the characters seem more interesting the story lines seem to be much similar to other 2nd super hero films such as wanted to give up and quite the team much like we seen the hero's quiting in Spider-Man 2 and Superman 2 but this film doesn't quite get anywhere or really get serious with that storyline the main story line is the Silver Surfer a famous character in the marvel comics keeps us not knowing if he's a good guy or a bad guy in the film we think he's the bad guy but we see towards the end of the film he doesn't want to but he's just summand to earth by his leader Galactus who many believe is a giant storm cloud as a comic boom fan myself i am very disappointed with Galactus witch is probably the biggest and most disappointing flaw of the whole film but then again they prolly never had the budget to create him. We also see in this film the return of Dr. Doom who helps reed and the army capture surfer but again turns against them Dr. Doom's look as improved over the first at least this time the mask fits the actors head the special effects and cgi in the film is well done in the most parts of the film.Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is a dull film only kids will think is smart but it however a enjoyable popcorn action superhero film that comic book fans shouldn't take seriously but just enjoy.6/10,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a harmless dry heave of a sequel,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver SurferReviewed by Samuel OsbornIt's sad enough when a sequel fails to live up to the quality of its predecessor. But it's an entirely different tragedy when the predecessor, in this case the first Fantastic Four movie, contained no hint of quality to begin with. Its sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer, is not just unnecessary, but achieves a woeful demotion from the comic book regurgitation of the original. That's right, it's even worse.Besides the obvious financial potential of a Fantastic Four sequel, the only plausible reason for Rise of the Silver Surfer to be granted the greenlight by its studio is by way of its title character. The Silver Surfer (voiced occasionally by Laurence Fishburne) is admittedly pretty awesome. He careens from outer space as a meteor into Earth's atmosphere, zipping around the globe and impacting the land with various craters in preparation for the planet's destruction. Never mind his humane intentions and fluffy nice guy interior; the Silver Surfer is a certifiable badass. Composed entirely of candied CGI goodness, he looks like the figurine version of Terminator 2's metallic T-1000 propped up on a chrome surfboard. His sequences are the only fantastic thing about this film, making his supreme lack of appearances all the more disappointing. Instead, we're given the likes of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who still leads the contest for most stupidly overwrought name for a villain. Von Doom soaks up screen time like a diseased sponge, blocking out any opportunity for the Silver Surfer to perform his titular rise.Returning to save the world from interplanetary surfers are the aforementioned four. Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) again leads the spandexed quartet, now mysteriously engaged to Jessica Alba, playing Sue Storm. Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans return as the big orange rock, Ben Grimm, and the cocky flamer, Johnny Storm. Each actor's performance lives up to the mediocrity of the first Fantastic go-round, with the exception of Michael Chiklis whose delivery has become as lifeless as the rocks he's composed of. Ms. Alba also loses some of her conviction, which probably is just an effect of the difficulty involved in manipulating a face lathered in entire bottles of golden bronzing.Anyway, the ride isn't very lengthy at a cool 89 minutes and thus can't irritate to its full potential. It's a harmless dry heave of a sequel, amazing sometimes in its technical prowess and also amazing in its complete ineptitude for telling a story. I'd make a sly finishing pun about how un-fantastic Rise of the Silver Surfer is, but I'm sure by now the point is made. This film is bad.Samuel Osborn",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie for the children!!! And not the best one either,"Personally i think that only children at the ages of 5-12 can enjoy such a movie. Boring and predictable storyline, crappy acting (with no exeptions), horrible sense of humor (if these pathetic attempts to make people laugh can be called a sense of humor), pretty dumb and childish special effects and sci-fi tech. I would give this movie a firm grade of 1 out of 10, but since its meant for kids (at least i hope so), i guess it cold be a... 5 perhaps. (Eventually i decided not to rate it at all)Back when i was a kid, even some movies meant for children had great actors (like the first batman or batman returns), and weren't all about guys and girls with pretty faces and nice bodies but with no talent.Just for the record i did enjoy some movies based on comics, by which i mean the X men.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surfing on to the silver screen,"The latest installment of comic book super heroes to jump from ink to the big screen is another big budget action fest. This time out, we find the Fantastic 4 fighting an alien invader, the Silver Surfer. The special effects are no less then great. The story is better then I would have expected from this popcorn film. While it is no citizen Kane, it did do its job; it held my interest and entertained me for 90 plus minutes. I'm not a super big fan on the comic book; I did read it from time to time as a teenager. I can't say if they are being true to the original or not. But if Stan Lee is willing to put his stamp of approval on it, that is good enough for me. Plus I'm not one of those super nerds that has never seen a woman naked so it was OK. Well, here it is; the bad news. The main down fall is the acting. While not all the performances came up short, Michael Chiklis is great as the thing as is most of the cast. The weak link in the acting chain is Ms. Jessica Alba. Like the rest of the red blooded American male population, I think she is super hot. That said; I have to say she can't act her way out of a bad soap opera. I think in whatever movie she is in next; she should play a mute in a bikini. She is great to look at, but once she opens her mouth to say any thing it obliterates the illusion. All said; I have to give this film two thumbs up. It was what a pop corn movie should be, entertaining. If you want to lose your self for a little while this is the movie to do it with. I hope the next installment is as action packed, and maybe they'll write fewer lines for Ms. Alba to stumble over.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's...OK.,"It's been a disappointing summer for sequels so far (Spidey 3 was poor, Pirates 3 was a little unsteady) and FF2 carried on the trend in some ways, but was probably the best blockbuster of the summer so far. Not that that is saying a great deal, given the level of competition. Basically, if you've seen and at any level enjoyed the first movie outing of Marvel's First Family, then you should see and enjoy this one (I didand did!) and if you didn't see it or did and thought it was lame then save yourself whatever the cost of seeing it may be. Like the first film, this has been harshly reviewed and has lots to enjoy  and stuff that will just annoy! It has more of the good (Johnny Storm), more of the unconvincing (she may be pretty, but I'm just not buying Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, and she's so obviously not a blonde), more of the poor (Ben Grimm) and more of the pretty good but ultimately a bit disappointing (Norrin Radd). I just hope it does well enough for a threequel and that they finally get it all the way right that time  third time's the charm.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pretty Good, but could be better","I like it . . . but that doesn't mean there aren't things that they could do better. First off, Galactus was a little lame. Also, Dr. Doom just comes out of nowhere. Sure, he's been brought back accidentally by the surfer, but nobody just comes right out to you, even if you are a galactic herald,and says, ""hey, let's rule the world together!"" Also, some of the character personalities have been changed like Sue. She's now shallow. however, the movie was good fun--it had some killer action scenes and a passable plot. It's a little over the top - but hey! - this is comic book world, people! Anything can happen! It was also relatively funny. Some jokes fall flat but they're all at least mildly funny. The silver surfer is really cool--he's well developed. All in all, I'd say the movie was decent. Not mind-blowing, but fun worthy to spend some time on.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Alba changed her look too much, though. VonDoom's return was pointless. The army general or whoever he was was laughable.But again, you shouldn't see this if you're looking for an engaging story & deep acting. Just appreciate the Silver Surfer & how fast pace of the movie. It's refreshingly slim compared to the bloated blockbuster action films of 2007.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Barely a 6,"First off, I don't like most comic book movies as they don't translate to movies well and far too much is changed. And, that will probably never change so I am now criticizing them on a curve.Two of the biggest flaws in this movie and the previous one, are the portrayal of Dr. Doom and the dialogue. Doom is played like a bad spin on Gordon Gecko and not the terrifying crazed armored scientist. And the sophomoric comic book dialogue doesn't mix very well with the ""real world"" look of the heroes. This makes for some cringe worthy moments like when this Doom is being chased by the FF and he yells ""Let's go a spin!"" right before he puts them in a whirlwind.The Surfer is somewhat acceptable and Galactus, IMO, should have either not been included or played exactly as he is in the comics. In short, the movie was mediocre. The effects kept it from being panned even worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lots of fun . . .,"At first I thought this was a little too corny but as the film continued it won me over. The light hearted and slightly corn ball comedy mixed with drama and action remind me of the original comic books. In addition the special effects with regard to the silver surfer are first rate. And that his character is complex adds weight to the rest of the movie. When all the aforementioned elements are combined this movie delivers something for everyone. And it's a good movie for the entire family.To compare a few other super hero franchises, Batman is very dark and gets the crap beaten out of him by the bad guys; Spiderman and Fantastic Four get the bad guys! - are just plain FUN. And in that context what going to a movie about a super hero is all about. If you sit back and let yourself be entertained you'll not be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A better film than the original,"Entertaining and mindless comic book fantasy isn't perfect but is much improved compared to the original film directed by Tim Story. It's also clear that a substantial amount of footage was cut (it runs less than two hours and was recut for a PG rating). The performances are better in the second film and, although the character of Victor Von Doom isn't given as much screen time as I would have thought, that's not a surprise given that this truly is the Silver Surfer's movie.Fans of the first film will enjoy this. Although it isn't completely faithful to the series of comics that ran with both Galactus and the Silver Surfer, the writers do manage to stay true to the basic concepts of the original comic book. Having recently seen the ""special edition"" of ""Fantastic Four"" that film actually was improved by most of the restored scenes of character development. Likewise, I'm sure that would be the case here as well.Still, ""Fantastic Four"" and the Marvel characters here were somewhat better realized with ""The Incredibles"" where Brad Bird borrowed many of the elements that made ""Fantastic Four"" and other Marvel comics so popular.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's not  Spider-man...,"It's clobbering time! Or is it? I thought I was watching Dr. Richard's Fun with Physics! Where is the action? Where is The Thing busting stuff? Well, in all fairness, I often complain that action movies do not have enough story. This one does, but goes a bit overboard with all the wedding drama and the comic book science. Maybe four heroes are too many to try to do the Spider-man soap opera thing. Still, it isn't a bad movie. The effects are great, the story is okay and the Surfer has potential as a tragic villain and these things make the sequel a little better than the original, which only had the great effects and the endless action scenes.Well, the fab four are back. Rex (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan (Jessica Alba) are still trying to get married, and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) is still trying to meet chicks and celebrating the joys of being a celebrity. A threat to destroy the planet starts to interfere with the wedding plans (can anything EVER interfere with ANY all-important wedding plans?) and only the Fantastic Four can step up. There is lots of silly science and logic gaps big enough for the Earth to escape through. Stan Lee has a great cameo and the effects are worth the price of admission.Hard to call! Those who love super-hero action flicks will probably find it a suitable, but less entertaining sequel, as they squirm and wonder where the rest of the action is. Those who are less enthralled with the Marvel movie universe should pass on this one.

A record-breaking Eyeroll Tally,"The first Fantastic Four was pretty bad. The writing bad, the casting horrible, the FX lacking but it was harmless enough. There have been crappy superhero movies before, and there will certainly be plenty more in the future. But a sequel?? Really?? What won't they make sequels to these days.They learned nothing from their mistakes on the first film. The Thing's costume is still terrible and looks like something out of a mid-80's flick, and his one-liners (mostly consisting of about 10 ""sorry's"" and ""my bad's"") are just annoying. Julian Glover as Dr. Doom is horribly miscast. Reed's stretching effects just look laughable - it's one of those powers that just does not translate to the screen well. Jessica Alba again looks goofy with fake blond hair, but now they've added the creepiest fake blue eye contacts you've ever seen, and just can't stop staring at them whenever she's on screen. Stan Lee's cameos continue to be distracting and stupid.But they didn't stop there - this sequel has failed on more levels. First and foremost, the Eyeroll Tally was OFF THE CHARTS. From every cheesy line to every bad joke, every dumb plot point to every stupid sight gag or bad effects shot, you couldn't help rolling your eyes. The one big theme they beat us over the head with is teamwork. Johnny (Human Torch) is told he's a loner and needs to learn to work as a team. So how does he do this in the end? By taking on everyone else's powers and fighting the final battle by himself. Huh?!??! That's teamwork?This flick was every bit as bad as any of the direct-to-video or 80's Marvel movies. Now there's talk they want to do a spin-off Silver Surfer movie. HELL no! His character is boring, unimpressive, and uninteresting in his brief scenes here, much less an entire film. The torch/surfer chase was pretty cool, but it's too bad everyone had seen that in its entirety in the first trailer. When Surfer loses his silver ""luster"" he looks hilarious as just some dude painted dark gray, and trying to cash in on Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus credibility by having him voice the Surfer was just lame. Fishburne adds nothing here.Like I said, I've seen worse flicks, and I know this was geared more for kids, but even kids deserve better. And with so many better flicks to choose from, I hope they find something else to spend their money on.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"if you don't expect too much, you won't be disappointed","Unlike some other reviewers of Silver Surfer, I didn't expect this sequel to improve on the first film. In my opinion, sequels rarely do. In these super-hero flicks it's ALWAYS more fun to see the initial changes taking place, the fish-out-of-water elements unfolding etc.However, Silver Surfer still manages to be an action-packed, fun and pretty human story, with the 'still-adjusting' bit coming in the form of Invisible Girl and Mr Fantastic trying to tie the knot while threats to the planet interfere with their tux hire and seating arrangements.There are some cool stunts and good lines and it's always just nice to find that someone's taken a bit of care over a sequel.Ioan Gruffudd looks much more confident in his role than in the first movie; only Michael Chiklis is a little under-used in this film.I rented the first movie because I was not sure it would be worth seeing at the cinema, but I happily paid to go and see this film and didn't feel I'd had anything but value for money.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much Better than the first and a surprisingly good movie!,"****Possible Spoiler Warning**** I saw the movie on Friday and I was already a little disappointed because of it's running time being extremely short. But none the less it's a great superhero movie! The beginning starts out with kind of the same feel as the first movie a few jokes here and there, okay there are plenty of jokes, but near the middle and end it has a darker better feel to it, besides the jokes some of the ending reminded me of X2: Xmen United. Despite it's run time it's a great superhero film and one of Marvel's most enjoyable films of all time! The film did much better than I thought it would with it's great CGI, Great action, and a great plot. I definitely recommend you to go and see this at you nearest theater and I'm definitely gonna get the DVD when it comes out. I was unsure if Tim Story could pull it off but somehow he did. I give this film a 10 out of 10 for being an excellent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Rise""","The Fantastic Four learn that they aren't the only super-powered beings in the universe when they square off against the powerful Silver Surfer and the planet-eating Galactus.Didn't have any expectations really as much so this was a renter. Rise of the silver surfer has the same rating as it's previous film, and that's what it deserves. I admit, the story is a little bit more tolerable and as in the first film, the film actually doesn't surpass the amount of cheesy moments the first one had. This meaning Rise is better, but better in a way where it is exactly the same as the first. Rise has way more (and pretty enjoyable)action sequences that also is better than the first. But the problem with Fantastic Four is that the film tries way to hard to be a serious superhero movie. It's a fun popcorn movie at the least but it comes nowhere to where you would want to see it in theaters or anywhere publicly. So if your wanting to waste some time or have nothing else to watch, I may recommend this. But don't listen to the complainers, or the non-complainers, Rise is average at best. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not great but better than the first,The first fantastic four was OK but this 1 was a lot better. Although it were great it was better than the first. You saw more action than you did in the last one and you got to see the fantastic four use their powers more. The CGI was brilliant and made the end fight scene look brilliant. I think for this one they wanted to focus more on the action rather than story telling because in the it was mainly all about that and not much action to see which was fairly disappointing but this one made up for it with the action. I didn't think Jessica Abla was very good playing her role as the invisible women just like the first one. Also in the film it was quite funny at times just like the first one. I thought the script wasn't to good and they could of done better with that.I thought this film was enjoyable to watch. my expectations weren't really running high but it was very enjoyable. If you like the first one and are a fan of fantastic four there i'm sure you will enjoy this. But if you didn't like the first you will probably not like this.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Still Mindless Fun, Slight Improvement on the First","I've never been much into the Fantastic Four. I think Thing is dynamic and Doctor Doom is interesting. But I never much cared for the others. They did get interesting in the Civil War when they broke up and started fighting each other. However, I really can't think of a specific FF story that stands out from the others, certainly not like Spider-Man's Death of the Stacys or Iron Man's Armor Wars, other than the coming of Galactus.The first movie was largely a disappointment. But that just means I got my disappointment out of the way and found myself enjoying this one. Sure the problems remain, but they don't seem as crippling. I already know that Doom, Reed, and Sue are miscast so I can merely accept them here for what they are.Everyone does seem to be trying just a little harder this time. Gruffudd is still plodding along with the technical jargon, but he seems a little more comfortable with it. Alba is still there to be breasts that walk with another scene thrown in just to show off her body, but she does show some improvement. Even Tim Story seems to be trying to be more than just mediocre.I really liked how they humbled Johnny this time around, so he isn't merely an arrogant jerk. Sure he tries to be, but they show there's more to him than that. However, I didn't care for how Thing is basically there with not a lot to do. They seemed to lose that tortured inner self that made him so interesting in the first. I also enjoyed the publicly known heroes aspect of the story. Sure, Iron Man 2 did it so much better, but they were the first to try it and there are some interesting aspects in it all.Doctor Doom is a little more, but not entirely, like we know and love him. I like that they show him doing more than just hating everyone else and actually developing some kind of evil scheme. It's just a shame that they didn't push that more.The real stand out of the movie is the Silver Surfer. He stole the spotlight in the original comic story and steals the movie. Surfer is, by far, the most dynamic character in the movie. There's little hints of his story that they would have expanded on in the proposed SS spin-off. Doug Jones is perfect for him. He perfectly captures those iconic Surfer movements. Though I wish they kept his voice rather than bringing on Fishburne, which just seemed unnecessary. Jones fit the voice just fine, and it seems Fishburne was brought on because he was the cool guy from The Matrix.I know many people bemoan the portrayal of Galactus here, but I liked it. Sure they go with the Ultimate Gah Lak Tus cloud rather than the 616 giant, but it's not like the movie is really hurt by not seeing the giant. From what I read, they would have shown the giant Galactus in the SS spin-off. I do appreciate that they left some mystery to it/him to be explored later.Neither of the Fantastic Four movies were anything that could be considered classics. They were more meant to be mindless popcorn films. This one showed that with time they may have made them more than that, but I'm certainly not sad they're not making a third. Brief aside, if they do reboot the series, I truly hope they bring back Evans and Chiklis as they were certainly the bright spots in this dull series.It's fun taking for what it is. But there's still some problems preventing this from being a great film. My rating 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why waste money on this?,"Why waste money and time on this crap? When I was going to see this I had so low expectations I thought they could not get any lower. Apparently they could.The only reason why I saw the movie was because one of my favorite music composers had worked on the movie. John Ottman, he has work on many major comic book movies. Superman, X-men2 and Fantastic 4. So I thought that maybe the music would get me thru the movie. Sadly it did not.The movie has all the attributes of a bad sequel, a lot of bad jokes, a lot of reference to the first movie. And the thing I hate the most, all of the over exaggerated personality traits. Johnny Storm in particular. He Is Rash and vain without limit. Its always this way with a really bad sequel, in the end of the earlier movie the flamboyant character shows that he isn’t as shallow as he seams. Then in the sequel that quality is gone with the wind. And then all character traits shines thru more than ever. Bigger is always better, or is it?I mean this might have worked fine in a comic book. But this supposed to be a movie. The only thing that I liked in this movie was the “Silver surfer”. Although I recognized Laurence Fishburnes voice right away, and at first I did not think it suited the character at all. But after awhile it grew on me. So thumbs up for the surfer.I feel like the people that made this movie thought that: “Oh well they have done Spiderman 3, X-men 3 and Superman… well what superheroes do we have left? Right, the Fantastic four. We don’t know what it will be about but we will spend a whole lot of money making it. We will just copy all of the other superhero movies, that way it will be a sure success. It will be great! Common boys let call up some sponsors” /BR",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as bad as the first movie.  First movie was very bad...,"This movie was simply not very good. It was OK but if you missed a nice sunny day in the park to see it you're at a loss.It started off with a few jokes and degraded into a joke. When the humour turned towards the Thing and sex (rockslide..ha ha ha) it just kept the download path.Jessica Alba looks like she really wanted to be somewhere else, and those blue fake eye colour contacts, what were they thinking? The Mr. Plastic/rubber guy, him I really felt sorry for because you could really see he didn't enjoy the roll at all, he was not into this film.Special effects were OK, except for the surfer which was nice but honestly the T-2 movie effects were on par and that movie was made over a decade ago.Oh yeah, the voice of the surfer...take the blue pill!

Kicks A**!,"This film could have been a mess like Spiderman 3 but Tim Story deftly navigates the multiple stories quickly and efficiently from scene to scene. It was in danger of becoming fairly complicated if adhered to strictly ala the Comic Books. What Story did was balance out the film time, budgetary pressures, target audience attention, Studio hidden pressures, etc etc and at times perhaps TOO quickly rocket from scene to scene; but you know what - this movie works. It does exactly what it says on the tin. It's a movie about fictional Superheroes - not real life heroes like Gandhi, Mandela, etc which would require detailed analysis and depth. This movie gives us what we expect and demand. Namely, a Summer blockbuster which zips past joyously quickly at just over 90 minutes - without so much as pausing for breath!

"Arise, Surfer","This sequel to Fantastic Four (2005) continues where the first one stopped. The Four are still together and doing what they do best - make silly jokes amongst themselves and planning marriage and such. It wouldn't be a superhero comic if there wasn't someone to add a thrill to the story though and so there is the arrival of a strange phenomenon on planet Earth in the form of a silver surfer. So, investigation starts. And that is much of the story of this film. Which is OK, this type of films doesn't need a thousand page book to back it, it just requires fun, nice action sequences and some slick graphical effects.The first film was more or less OK, it wasn't anything worth watching twice but was fun for a bored Sunday afternoon. This sequel is in my eyes a small bit better, but not much. It still is a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon, and still isn't worth a second watch. The bit of storyline there is is worked out well enough and some bits of the film were actually very funny. Some other weren't though and that made the total a little too inconsistent to become truly captivating.Graphic wise this one is pretty well. Most of the used effects are convincing enough to keep one watching the film instead of moaning about horrendously bad effects. Music was fitting, at least didn't fall out of style with the rest.6 out of 10 disasters happening on poor planet Earth",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An OK start, but where's the ending?","There are several good reasons why this movie gets such mixed reviews and that both the positive and negative ones make sense; RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER gets started just fine, apart from an awkward recurring bit in which the four magically exchange powers, and then -- appallingly -- two-thirds of the way through the story, apparently the production staff got tired of working on it and decided ""let's just not bother filming a third act."" What people are really saying when they say they are disappointed Galactus appears as a cloud here is that they have paid their money to see a whole story and been deprived of that. The feeling you are left with after watching this film, since its main villain, Galactus, never makes it to Earth, so there is never a meeting between the principal villain of the piece and the heroes, is that the filmmakers were actually too afraid of the character themselves to actually include the big sequences the story builds up to.We SHOULD have seen giant purple boots squashing buildings -- the ominous helmet with distinctive side ornaments blocking the sun -- Reed Richards scrambling to try and make the ultimate nullifier work in time -- rebellion by the Surfer against his master, and lots of terrific special effects as a city is destroyed as Galactus ALMOST eats earth, but they just skipped the idea of letting us see what SHOULD be there. The climax of the film just ISN'T THERE. It's built up to, but when you think it's about to start, an abrupt and not-very-believable character reversal and event takes place which tidies things up like magic, and our heroes don't have to lift a finger.This is seriously cowardly, lazy film-making. We could have had one of the best superhero movies ever made here if the original story had just been filmed as it was envisioned and written by Jack Kirby in the 1960s. What we get instead is something that plays like a Sunday Matinée musical that had to be called off early and an abrupt ending fudged because the actor playing the villain forgot he had one more entrance to make and left the building to go get an early dinner.And, for the record, Stan Lee had NOTHING to do with ""creating"" the Silver Surfer, or the X-Men or Spider-man either, for that matter; he has made a lifelong career out of exploiting brilliant original work developed and done for hire by writer/artist Jack Kirby and others and been able to get away with his claims because he knows the public assumes that Marvel comics of the 1960s were WRITTEN before they were DRAWN. In fact, the complete opposite was the case where the seminal Marvel stories were concerned. Stan Lee is not now and never was a good storyteller, nor was he an avid reader of classic science fiction and mythology as Jack Kirby was. What he is is a brilliant publicist who added ""groovy"" dialogue to illustrated stories which were handed to him completely plotted and drawn by artists such as Kirby and Steve Ditko AFTER they were complete, sometimes even including summaries of dialogue to be added to the page written in the margins. The credits for those old comic book stories should have said ""Written and Drawn by Jack Kirby, Dialogue by Stan Lee."" But, with Lee having the final word on what words got printed on the page, we got deliberately misleading inflations of the truth instead. Since the artists that developed the early Marvel stories did so work-for-hire, and Lee worked for the company, it was in his power to credit whoever he wanted, including himself, however he wanted, so first he promoted himself from dialogue writer to story author, then moved right along to ""creator."" Baloney. I know who really had the creative imagination on the team and put in the time at the drawing board. (Show me one Stan Lee dialogue script ever actually written for a Marvel comic and I'll eat this review!) At least Kirby's name appears in the credits of this movie -- it should, since he envisioned the amazing story -- one of the best ever told in comics -- and all its characters.It remains a shame to this day that Lee, in the late 1960s and early 70s, took Kirby's Surfer out of his hands and transformed a character that the writer/artist had envisioned as the very personification of pure, unfettered cosmic adventurousness into yet another whiner; Kirby's Surfer had no name, no missing girlfriend to cry about -- he was a blank slate, eager to be free of his servitude and fly through the stars at top speed and explore the universe and learn about anything, everything, with great enthusiasm. He was ignorant but learned compassion from his visit to Earth, which is why he rebelled against Galactus. Not because he missed his girlfriend! The original Surfer never whined, he battled, he quested, he flew, he dreamed. The Lee influence unfortunately affects the Surfer character in this film too; he's taken captive at one point which unfortunately for no apparent reason emotionally paralyzes him and by the end of the film, as happened in the comics as well, all life ends up sucked out of the character, as he sinks apparently into what is essentially a suicidal sort of depression, so this movie ends not with a fight but with a cop-out. Ugh.This is not to say that what DOES make it to the screen in this movie is ""bad."" It's generally not. The film just needs to be sent back into production and finished appropriately.They should have made this film years ago and let Jack Kirby direct it; he would never in a million years let this truly ""fantastic"" cosmic battle have been filmed without an ending.Mr. Kirby, and your spirit of adventure, you are missed.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A fantastic clod,"Every so often a film comes out that reminds my why I don't go to the theaters as often as I would like; this is one of those films. To fully go into what I did not like about this film would take more space and time then it ultimately deserves, but I will cover the films more grievous gaffs.To start let me please comment on the acting. Never have I longed for the days of Plan 9's performances more then when I heard Ioan Gruffudd force out the most ridiculous scientific babble that only proves Gruffudd's complete lack of scientific prowess. While Gruggudd stands out above the rest, the others just fail to achieve what would be called passable acting.Bad performance aside, the true atrocity is the story. When I first saw the trailer with the Human Torch chasing down the Silver Suffer, I was filled with hope for a mindless, fun, high passed summer movie; unfortunately they only delivered on the mindless. The very seen they show in the trailer ultimately proves to be the most exciting seen in the whole movie.The majority of the plot deals with the relationship betwixt Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. The problem is two thirds of this summer action film is filled with trite dialog that no one could make look believable, respectable or believable (a problem maid even worse by bad actors delivering them). Some of the embellishment on A LOT of the dialog is almost so laughably bad, it makes one wonder if the director was trying to see just how poor he could make the film and have it still hit theaters.A lot of my other complaints contain spoilers, and even though this is a warning not to see the film, it is one opinion among many and you still may decide to see it. This may not be the deciding factor on if you spend your money on this film, but let me assure you it is not worse the price of a ticket. Unless you are on a twenty hour flight across the Pacific Ocean, don't waist your time.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Expectation Matchstick,"Just back from the theater and thought, ""FFRSS... exactly as I could have hoped for."" The greatest film ever: of course not. Shakespearean caliber performances: of course not. So, you ask, ""how did it meet my expectations?""For starters, my expectations were real, their backbone being the first FF. If you saw that, you could not possibly expect this second installment to offer much more. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing astounding. Just a playful, escapist, superhero action movie based semi-faithfully on its roots as a playful, escapist, superhero comic book. And cool CGI as the trailer unveiled. Armed with this as a backdrop to what FFRSS might bring to the table, I'd say it exceeded my expectations, a little. In part because the characters are familiar, and despite an absence of striking depth, they have genuine likability.This is not to say FFRSS is an outstanding movie. Nor is there a noteworthy flaw. The plot is neither three-dimensional, nor totally lacking. The script is weak, but with some funny/cutesy one-liners that seemed to come off universally well with the crowd at my theater. The acting was mediocre, but counter-balanced by the likable characters, an ounce affection for the comic book roots, and a pinch of latitude for the genre.And, considering this genre, and the expectation standard established by the first FF, it seems bizarre that so many folk have inked reviews on IMDb which parse and pick at this movie as though it was billed as an Oscar contender. And comparing it to action hero gems like Spiderman, or Pirates, etc. I mean, really, how could anyone stand in line at the box office with that sort of expectation? Yet, they do.And one guy...Sa'ar Vardi(saarvardi@walla.co.il), from Israel...had the matzoh balls to pick at every actor from every angle, even stating that ""Jessica Alba isn't even that pretty any more."" Good God and OYE VEY...what is wrong with you dude (dudess). Do I hear a cat fight, or have you switched teams? I'd wager that even when she is invisible, Alba has more sugar on the eye than you.What should you expect? Well, let's see.This movie is about 4 comic book characters, one who turns into a flying matchstick, one who becomes invisible, one who turns into plastic elastic, and one who is a rock (made of sponge). That's the expectorant you should toss in one pocket before reaching into the other. The Silver Surfer character was cool, and the special effects a little more interesting than the previous FF.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The F4 deal with personal issues and a cool looking surfer bringing death and destruction.,"I have a confession: I have NEVER liked Hollywood's rendition of my childhood comic heroes.One reason is that I don't believe the actors they chose were right for the roles. The second reason is that they always insert some love interest or angle that slows the story down and that I don't care about. I suspect they do this to have a broader appeal to female audiences. As far as I'm concerned, a superhero -male or female- functions a lot better without attachments and personal relationships. This brings us to one of the reasons I found the latest Spiderman and now the Fantastic 4 annoying. It's like to me, these guys are forced to play house and deal with silly jealousies and domestic issues when more pressing things in the form of the fate of the world is at stake. Frankly, all this nonsense seriously cut into my ""kickass-time"".Okay. I'm glad I got that off my chest. Now to the Fantastic 4 commentary:This movie is not spectacular. However,in my opinion, it is a decent ""TV-level"" movie not suited for theatrical release. 2 reasons: tickets are expensive and audiences want to be blown away; this is especially true when they go to see a FX or ""special effects"" movie. They want to see something awesome, jaw-dropping, and in-your-face on the big screen. Not some guy surfing around 2 people and their wedding plans. Love, Boloxxxi.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing Fantastic Here: An Ordinary Sequel,"I'm surprised the first ""Fantastic Four"" (2005) was financially successful enough to make this equally, if not more so, dull sequel, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer."" At least, audiences had seen enough by then for another installment to be cancelled, although that wouldn't prevent the 2015 reboot dud. Being a relatively early entry in the emerging superhero genre of the 21st century, the action tends to receive a light treatment--comic books for kids stuff--despite the usual alien-invasion, impending planetary catastrophe plot (cosmic rays and dust that nevertheless appear to have no adverse effects on the solar system included). This one doesn't even have the interest of the characters discovering their powers.Even for a light treatment, however, the rom-com junk involving Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman struggling to pull off their elaborate wedding plans is vapid. You know, you can get married without a wedding, and cultural appropriation is hardly a ""better idea""--it's so random, too: since when did any of these characters demonstrate an interest in Japanese culture? In the movies, at least, it appears to be just this one scene. On the plus side, I suppose, Jessica Alba wearing a kimono distracts from the blonde wig they put on her (it's pretty bad when these movies can't even prevent hair from being distracting--the 2015 reboot had the same problem, among others, with the same character). This comic-book flick is worse than stupid, though; it's wholly without interest.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not Very Compelling Entertainment,"16 June 2007. Unlike other superhero sequels this year, this one spluttered and fell short. It was obvious that efforts were made at humor to move the movie along and at times it was hilarious but most of the time, the pacing was slow and boring. There wasn't a lot original - just a lot of moving around and action sequences. The dialogue seemed pretty lame and dumb - perhaps it's more the comic book story itself than the movie. Efforts were made to give the movie more substance, drama which flickered into interesting possibilities, but never sustained. While the movie was fairly clear, the plot reasonably outlined and played out, the compelling component of the movie didn't emerge, particularly for an adult audience. Somewhat predictable, this sequel moved more of stereotypical characters without much depth, more along the line of Star Troopers (1997).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not so Fantastic, it makes me wanna move to Latveria.","I've never been a huge fan of the FF, but there were at least two things I liked in the Comic-Book, and the movie ruined them both.First thing I liked was the excessive graphic imagination that Jack Kirby showed in the comic, with its incredible and gigantic creatures (year, Galactus !) from space or its amazing and futuristic weapons (wooh : the supreme Annihilator !). And in my opinion, the movie is way to shy on that matter. OK, some things are missing to avoid a ridiculous transcription of the comic, but here, there's almost nothing left. No creativity, no originality : everything is small, predictable, and empty. OK, Johnny Storm gets the powers of a super-Skrull, but hey, it's not The Watcher ! And what about the Surfer ? If he's impressive in the trailer (best scene of the movie, of course) he's inexistent in the movie - and the same goes for Doom, and, well, every single character.The second thing that the movie misses is the spirit of the Fantastic Four. The interrogations of Red Richard and Jane to leave the group in order to raise a normal family could have been interesting if it wasn't absolutely a betrayal of the comic. The Fantastics ARE a family, and they're trying to act like one with their powers : that's the all point of the comic : how to deal with your family and use your own abilities. There's no point for them to wonder how to become normal, in order to have a family ! Anyway, the movie doesn't even develops that thematic, and stay a conventional bad TV movie made for kids, with no characters, and visually very poor.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Rushed but quite enjoyable,"I wasn't a big fan of the first nice installment. It felt like it didn't know what it wanted to deliver, a big array of displaced jokes, uninteresting narratives and not much of a payoff.This second installment is better in the way it portrays its characters. We get a little depth and not too many unnecessary character 'side story lines'. The movie also tickled my funny bones in the right ways. Most of the times at least.The biggest problem with this movie is that the ending feels rushed. We have this big buildup that erupts into a quick fix ending. The character of the Silver Surfer deserved more attention to its complex details.Enjoyable although forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cute if you're ten,"Though I've never been a real big Fantastic Four fan, I thought I'd give this one a try. If I was ten, I would think this was the coolest thing ever: effects galore, thin plot and shallow characters, and of course, tna from Jessica. There's lots of unanswered questions of course, like where did the Silver Surfer come from? What was the deal with Dr. Doom, did he just splash in the river and the writers forgot about him? What was this ""evil""? I almost lost my lunch when I heard such original lines like ""I'd rather spend my last hours just holding Alicia."".....acckkk! Someone wipe all this sap off my shoes. There's no chemistry between Reed and Sue and her pasty fake blonde hair got really annoying. And am I the only one that could have predicted Johnny's romance from a mile away? All in all, it was a typical sequel with lots of glitz and no substance. I really, really hope there's not a 3rd one.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic Four Rise Of The Silver Surfer By First Class Reviews,"Ahhhh we're back with our heroes. Or is that a good thing?

Wait, what fight scenes? There was virtually no fighting int his movie at all. But does a Marvel movie need that? Yes. But somehow this one pulls it off. better than the first that's for sure.

Bad and not in a good way,"A wedding, and a Silver Surfer comes streaking in across the sky to mess things up. The Surfer comes to prepare planet Earth for destruction. Can't he wait until the vows are said? Can the Four save the planet? Will the wedding ever take place again? Some Inquiring minds want to know.One would think that The One who made the movie would watch it before putting it out there for Other Ones to see. If The One had done that The One would have seen that the voices all sounded dubbed in and everyone acted like they were in a dream-state and hence no excitement was to be found. And, The One would go back to the drawing board. The One didn't do that and here we are with something kids would only groove on when the CGI kicked in if they waited for the Silver Surfer to appear. And, the CGI was very good, but it cannot a movie make.This was like a rehearsal, a walk thru. Was I the only one to see it that way? I think people who do movies on comic-book superheroes need to get away from the comic-book dialogue. It works for the comics, but not in the movies that I watch. I noticed that most critics who get paid to watch this stuff said this one was better than the first one. No, it wasn't. The CGI was better but as I said that doesn't make it a movie. The acting..well, let me put it this way: the acting was like everyone showed up and knew a few lines and then waited around for someone to feed them the rest of the story so to speak.It is said this was for the kids. Give me a break, the kids would have boogied long ago.Now, why did I bother to watch this movie? Why to see Jessica Alba of course. But, she added nothing to the show. Absolutely nothing. She is a good actress who wasn't used right. None of the actors were used right.You know, sometimes Inquiring Minds want to know too much.Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Some people hate this movie, but in my honest opinion, I liked it. I consider this the best Fantastic Four movie I have ever seen. This sequel is as cool as the 2005 predecessor, and way better than the reboot. The plot may have some problems but the writing for the movie is pretty decent.

Poorly made but moderately entertaining,"The Fantasic 4:Rise Of The Silver Surfer was released a short time before Disney acquired Marvel,changing not just superhero movies but cinema in general. However,as mentioned before,this film was made before the Disney MCU and it is different in many ways but it dtill has many of the same flaws. By nature superhero films might be weak on plot or substance and too compromise for that,filmmakers fill them with unnesccary storylines and character development.
The first thirty minutes or so of this film has very little of why people go to these films and a whole lot of what Hollywood thinks makes a more complete film.All films are some form of escapism and require a ""willing suspension of disbelief"" so if unrealism isn't your forte than this picture isn't for you also if you cringe under expository,blatant dialogue this picture really isn't for you either. Though no worse than counterparts like Avengers:Infinity War(which made over 2 billion worldwide),it comes as no surprise that on a budget of 130million this film regained 131 domestically.Fairing slightly better internationally with a worldwide gross of 301 million.If you are looking for a form of light entertainment this film can serve that purpose for its tight 82 minute runtime.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you want to laugh at a cheesy movie with the DNA of Adam West's Batman (but not as compelling), then you might get a kick out of it. I recommend making this movie into a drinking game.Nothing about this movie works.I never really felt like anyone was in danger. No Drama. The action is slow and poorly choreographed. The special effects look like poop. The actors seem to be on vacation there is 0 chemistry. Camera work / lighting is shoddy and gives the whole production a 'made for TV"" quality.Basically if you watch this movie you get the sense that nobody gave a crap about it. I'd rather watch a B-movie made by people that care, you can forgive a lot of things if there is some emotion, but at the very best this movie is laughable.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should have been better,"... Or to give it it's proper title, ""Fantastic Four 2: The Contractual Obligation"".OK. That's very negative. As a superhero movie pitched towards very small children, I suppose that there is nothing wrong with ""4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer"", but really it should have been so much better. I know that a lot of people didn't like the first ""Fantastic Four"" movie very much, but I did (it was big, silly, technicolour fun), and sad to say it, ""4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" is nowhere near as good.The great assets of the first film were Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon. The film came alive whenever those actors were on screen. This time round they sleepwalked their way through their roles (I'm sure I saw one of them checking his watch), leaving Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba (very nice to look at, but I hated your hair this time, Darling!) to drown in a plot of bad jokes and semi-romantic mush (both of which I sometimes have a disturbingly high tolerance for, but not this time). The Silver Surfer effects are magnificent, but the least you can expect in a Summer blockbuster are good special effects.Should have been better. Much, much better.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unbelievably bad,"This movie didn't even make it to sophomoric; you'd have to invent a term and call it freshmanic or something like that. The script was flat, dull, boring, without life, charm, interest, excitement. The attempts at humor fell consistently flat and I won't even go into all the logical holes except to say that the ending could have come much earlier, given what we find out about the Silver Surfer, and given that the movie seemed long at 90+ minutes.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"Oddly enough, I did prefer this to the original (2005) outing for this not so very fab-four. This time the ""Reed"" (Ioan Gruffudd) and ""Sue"" (Jessica Alba) romance is about to tie the knot when the army intervene to enlist their help is dealing with the menacing threat posed by a mysterious ""Silver Surfer"" (who looks like an award your eight year old might have got for a Californian surfing competition in 1975). Anyway, it turns out that he is but a precursor to the far more deadly, planet gobbling, ""Galactus"" who is hungry - and Earth is on his menu. Meantime, good old ""Victor Von Doom'' (Julian McMahon) has not forgotten his shabby treatment from the last time, and so has his own agenda that will manipulate the army and the messenger and, he hopes, give him world domination. Can the four put aside their differences and save the day? What do you think? This is about as unmenacing and devoid of jeopardy as any adventure film could ever be. Again, Evans - now even more cock-sure than before, has all the best lines and action scenes (such as they are) and the special effects are well presented. The casting and writing, though, continue to let the whole thing down and the plot really does lurch along to an ending that - like ""Galactus"", you could see from space! Hopefully the last of these, and it's now pretty clear why ""Hornblower"" isn't going to make an Hollywood star anytime soon.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

fantastic bore,"""Fantastic Four"" is perhaps the worst of all the generally disappointing Marvel comics adaptations, even the worthless ""Daredevil"". The problem is in everything--the banal cast, the hammy acting, the insipid melodrama, the suspense-less plot, the inane subplots, the dorky storytelling style, the unimaginative action scenes, the lackluster special effects...The movie is too little-kid-oriented, and will likely not entertain anyone with teenage-and- above sensibilities. The only saving grace, honestly, is that Jessica Alba is hot. And even that is not true in this movie, wherein she wears creepy blue contact lenses and appears anorexic. She literally looks like a Barbie doll, and her character is about as boring.Oh yeah, the Silver Surfer is a character in this movie. The CGI animators only gave him one expression--inscrutable--which made him look like he was constantly bored...but perhaps I was just projecting.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unbelievably Awful.,"Unbelievably Awful.My two favorite comic book characters were Peter Parker and Ben Grimm and the FF4. Well the movie makers have done OK by Peter. All I can say is poor poor Ben and the other three. This script was so bad it seemed written by a financial boardroom made up of 8-year-oldsmake that 5-year-olds  the thinking was so childlike. The best performance was by a computer-generated character, and the attempts at humour would be intellectually insulting to an imbecile. I can only assume Chiklis, Braugher, and Fishburne needed to make their mortgage. If the camera had spent the 85 minutes locked on Jessica Alba's rear, there would have been more action, more comedy, more emotion and lot more entertainment than this thing had. Heck, then there might even have been some natural movement.Blame EVERYONE involved in the production, but start with the writer and director.

Fantastic Four... not really fantastic,"It is truly sad when Stan Lee cameo's as someone not joining the party. OK the first movie, despite it's obvious issues was a GREAT set-up movie. Standing alone with out a conclusion, not so much. The second movie had everything set up, just take it from there. No, no, no. The pop culture had to turn this movie into a crappy version of the superhero real world. There is no real plot, the fights last moments, no one is killed(not even sue), and everyone learns a lesson... True love is worth it all. I am not against that statement but when watching FF I think that maybe some GOOD plot(besides SS, who was the only saving grace) should have been developed. All be it cool that they incorporated Doom stealing the board but if you don't have the time to dedicate to a solid FIGHT, not CGI, don't bother. More focus should have been put on... crap I can't think of a single thing in that movie they could have focused more on. I mean nothing was developed enough to actually pay attention to, besides Johnny being more obnoxious and Ben being rude. I mean seriously people if you don't waste your money and time on CRAP, they might get the hint and stop making it. It could have been epic... it's a sad loss.

OMG! One of the most boring movies ever...,"I was real excited about going to see this movie. I really liked the first FF movie. But this one I almost walked out of. I got really tired of the bickering about the wedding stuff. There was way too much dialog about the wedding and not enough action. I got really bored.Then it got stupid. I don't mind it when a movie walks a little off the path of science. Part of the plot revolves around a new super-weapon that is supposedly designed to help defeat the enemy. Somebody mumbles something about the fact that it uses ""Neutrinos"" (btw Neutrinos are something you would see in Star Trek or something...). Nobody explains anything about it, how it works or what it is going to do. You just have to suspend your disbelief and accept it works. This is a sign of a poor plot and bad planning.I liked some of the humor, though.

The FF4 have sent Dr. Doom packing and now must deal with Galactus, a force that aims to suck Earth dry. Galactus sends ahead his creation, the Silver Surfer, to get things rolling, only to run afoul of the FF4. The special effects are solid, but characterization is weak -- something the Spider-Man movies excel at. Plus Jessica Alba remains a poor choice to play Sue Storm. She just doesn't have the acting chops, and the bleached hair, or wig, is awful. The Silver Surfer is all CGI and really isn't given much to do. Also, the Thing is still missing his prominent brow, making him look clownish. At least they got the costumes right, unlike the X-Men costumes. Skip this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why are you destroying our planet?,"Five movies into the summer of the sequel, the first release that is not a third installment is finally here. ""The Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is merely the second in a series, following 2005's original that introduced moviegoers to Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffold), The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), her brother The Human Torch (Chris Evans), and The Thing (Michael Chiklis). (Audio review here.) The story in this follow-up is basic superhero stuff, picking up not too long after the last one ended. Mr. Fantastic is getting ready to wed The Invisible Woman, then bad things happen, and The Fantastic Four are called upon to remedy the problem, which involves the Silver Surfer destroying the planet and Dr. Von Doom doing whatever it is he does.From there the heroes do their hero thing, which is accompanied by just enough side story to form slightly rounded characters and plot. Like its predecessor and the comic books on which they both are based, ""Silver Surfer"" is a different breed of superhero movie, one that varies in tone and content from recent renditions of more popular heroes like Batman, Superman, and Spider-man. With its multiple lead characters, ""Silver Surfer"" occasionally reminds of the X-Men flicks, but does not match the gravity present in those movies or other recent hits featuring the aforementioned main characters. Those are serious, more intense movies that can create wonderful cinematic experiences that feel more ""real"". Not that any of these kinds of movies are truly real, but both of the Fantastic Four movies have a more cartoon-ish feel that distances them from reality.This is both a blessing and a curse. On the downside, ""Silver Surfer"" does not have the emotional attachment that other superhero pictures have or at least desire, which limits the scope of the movie's power. A surprising side effect is the everyday levity that is provided. If you and your buddies had bizarre superpowers, wouldn't you frequently be making fun of each other's gifts and using your own for not entirely kosher reasons? Movies with solo protagonists are rarely able to capture such interactions, but with its tight-knit lead characters, Surfer can and does, with degrees of success that vary like most attempts at humor, from clever and hilarious to flat and unfunny. Nothing is brilliant or profound, everything just creates a casual surface relationship between movie and viewer.The minimal depth also allows for a streamlined hour and a half movie that has cursory side stories, unexplainable technology, and vague villainous motives, all of which is completely fine, if not preferable. Just as popcorn should not be loaded with substantive fruits and vegetables, popcorn movies like this one should not be loaded down with messages and complications that don't enhance the story.The shallow story and characters possessing only one or two dimensions means that the movie never has much chance of succeeding on multiple levels, so if you expect a serious action movie, you will be disappointed with ""Rise of Silver Surfer"", as you likely were with the original. If you expect mindless superhero entertainment and a near carbon copy of the first installment, then you will leave the theater content with what you saw.Bottom Line: There is a place for movies like this: DVD rental. 5 of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Michael Chikilis and Chris Evans are only bright spots of lame sequel,"Some of Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer is so ludicrous, I wondered whether it was originally conceived as a spoof comedy of the first more enjoyable movieA pre Captain America Chris Evans returning as Human Torch is the only highlight. Loan Gruffudd is annoyingly smug as Mr Fantastic, Jessica Alba once again is miscast as Sue Storm, but unlike in the first movie her acting is off here, and I'm sure she will consider this a career low. Michael Chikilis is solid as The Thing, but once again Julian McMahon is dire. He has never been a good actor. Though he did manage to convince Dannii Minogue he loved her enough, for her to finance (to the point of almost bankruptcy) his attempts at an acting career, so maybe I'm misjudging him, and I've just never sen him be good in anything!!

The FF Are Back! And More Better Than I Thought!,"I just saw this movie today with my fiancée to celebrate our one year anniversary of our engagement. And must I say, ""Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" was beyond fantastic. It was terrific! The first FF movie was great, I'll tell you that much, but it was even greater that Tim Story wasted no time into getting the sequel underway right after the first one was released. The special effects were more improved. The funny stuff got more funnier. And the romance between Reed and Sue showed a bit more zing as they approached their wedding day. Of course, let's not forget the main focus of the film: The Silver Surfer. Whoever did the work on this guy deserves higher praise than he thinks because the Surfer was done perfectly, just like in the Marvel Comics! BRAVO! Dr. Doom is still around, causing a lot of problems. But we know he can't beat Marvel's First Family. Hopefully if there's a third FF movie, the villain should be the Puppet Master. Dr. Doom could be a worthy accomplice to him. Those two villains side by side would be better than the team of Riddler and Two-Face in ""Batman Forever"".

hit-and-miss sequel,"I have to admit to being one of only a tiny handful of people who DIDN'T think ""The Fantastic Four"" was a terrible movie. Frankly, even though I could tell that it wasn't a particularly GOOD movie, still I rather enjoyed its breezy unpretentiousness and lighthearted refusal to take itself too seriously. However, I'm not really sure that this material was exactly crying out for further amplification, and, indeed, the inevitable sequel, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" is an only sporadically engaging entry in the ever-expanding and now preposterously overcrowded field of comic book superhero movies.Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben return as the chemically-altered crime fighters, who in between battling evildoers and dodging celebrity-hunting paparazzi, are bent on living as normal a life as their phenomenal superpowers and the demands of their adoring, star struck public will allow. Achieving such normalcy is easier said than done, however, for on the day when Reed and Sue are finally about to officially tie the knot and utter their ""I do's,"" in on a celestial surfboard rides a silver-clad gentleman from the farthest reaches of outer space determined to wreak havoc on the planet.The film may not have much going for it in the plot department, but that Silver Surfer is sure one gnarly dude, and the filmmakers have done a truly ""fantastic"" job bringing him to life on screen. It's enough to make one wish they would change the quartet to a quintet for the next inevitable go-round. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba as Reed and Sue are once again reduced to playing ""straight men"" to Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis' Johnny and Ben, who, in true second-banana fashion, walk off with all the good lines in the film. The humor is mainly of the schoolyard-banter variety, but there are a few zippy zingers sprinkled in amongst the predictable cluster of clunkers. The same cannot be said for the ""serious"" dialogue, however, which often drips with maudlin sentimentality and homiletic self-importance.Director Tim Story has filmed the flying scenes for maximum speed and effectiveness, and the locales have, for the most part, been well-chosen and well-photographed. The special effects are seamless and even awe-inspiring on occasion, although the shots of Reed expanding his rubberized limbs to enormous lengths do look a bit fake at times.If nothing else, it's at least a lot shorter than ""Spider-Man 3"" (barely over ninety minutes). Surely, that must count for something.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A worthy sequel to what was a fun superhero film.,"This one feels even more like a kid movie than the first one and I think it's pretty funny that 20th Century Fox couldn't get their act together enough to pump out a third installment. The studio was putting this film and this franchise on a pedestal with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and X-Men's Dark Phoenix Saga, those expectations were always going to fail given what this film has to build off of.This film being released one year after the disaster that was X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) only spelled disaster for the future of this story. It also didn't help that Fox flopped with X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) while Sony was raking in profits with Spider-Man 3 (2007) and the MCU was off to a great start with Iron Man (2008). There was just no way the studio could continue on this path they forged when their competitors were doing so much better with different styles. It is no wonder Fox rebooted both of their franchises and abandoned the fun.This film has a more coherent story but it isn't really as interesting. None of the characters are interesting enough because they don't really care about character development, the draw to this one is the fights and the pre-existing knowledge of the characters.The themes are incredibly heavy handed and they really just brought in villains that they figured would be cool to see on the big screen with the ones from the first film. I think the novelty kinda wears off for me of using the campiness and fan service but it isn't overdone and bad.Also I get why the comic book nerds and Marvel stans are angry but I honestly don't care. If anything, that entire crowd being dissatisfied is kind of a plus for me.I am glad that these films weren't the disaster that some would have you believe. Childhood me was right to enjoy these. I think it's funny that Chris Evans got the role of Captain America shortly after this film was released. And that the studio basically stalled the sequel to this because they didn't respect Jessica Alba.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Summer fun,"This movie was a lot of fun; it develops each of the characters nicely and keeps you entertained with its humor and human interaction. Although that is not always a great thing for a comic book movie, it plays true to the FF comics in that they were always a little different from the rest, more story line and less pure bash and bang. The Silver Surfer was great and could have had a larger part, but I will take what I can get. The part of Galactus wasn't great but even in the comics I always though he was a little campy for a destroyer of worlds. We do get to see the human torch mature a little and we also get to see the FF having to fight like a team in order to save the day. However, the real reason I am writing this is because I cannot believe all the Stan Lee bashing on this site. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but Mr. Stan Lee has more class, intelligence and creativity in his little finger then all of you coarse hermaphrodite, pseudo-comic-book-experts put together.

Less than Fantastic,"I am the only person I know over the age of 10 who liked the first Fantastic Four, so I went into the film with an open mind. After all, it has some of my favorite actors: Andre Braugher, Michael Chiklis, Laurence Fishburne, Julian McMahon and Kerry Washington. And although the first one was kind of silly, it was at least as good as the first ""X-Men"" and more fun than ""The Incredible Hulk"". Unfortunately, this film is even dumber than the original and plenty boring.It starts off with the impending nuptials of Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) coming right when the Four are recruited by General Hager (Braugher playing an idiot for the first time in his career) to stop an intergalactic force that has wiped out life on all other planets that it has come into contact with. It is always heralded by the Silver Surfer (Fishburne). The Surfer comes to Earth right when Reed (aka Mr. Fantastic) and Sue (aka The Invisible Girl) are set to take their vows. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) is sent to chase after the Surfer, but the Surfer wins their fight and gives Johnny the ability to switch powers with anyone he touches. Later on, the Surfer visits Latveria and attacks Dr. Victor Von Doom (McMahon). The attack heals Dr. Doom's scars, but leaves his superpowers alone. And so Gen. Hager, the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom team up to fight the Surfer before the Earth is destroyed.Aside from the inherent stupidity of the plot, I didn't care for Fishburne's performance, nor the fact that he's an English-speaking alien named ""Gordon"" with a girlfriend named ""Alicia"" (in the comics, his name was ""Norrin"", so perhaps this is a tribute to ""ALF""?). I also had a problem with Johnny (aka The Human Torch) and Ben Grimm (Chiklis) acting like spoiled children when Reed and Sue consider splitting off from the Four to have a normal marriage. I was unhappy that Kerry Washington--so good in ""Ray"" and ""The Last King of Scotland""--was given nothing to do except stare into space and tell Sue how much she loves Ben (aka The Thing). The fact that all of these great actors are stuck with such bad dialog is depressing. And I can't be the only movie-goer weary of Stan Lee's cameos.On the other hand, the CGI effects--while sub-LOTR--still look pretty cool. And Andre Braugher gives his all to a bad role that most actors would have sleepwalked through.But overall, this a bad film, not worth the time or talent that these otherwise gifted actors bring. I hope that Braugher, Chiklis, Fishburne, McMahon and Washington work together again, but just not for ""Fantastic Four 3"". 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a stinker,"For some reason, I completely hate this one. It had a terrible story, and everything was way too cheesy, in a very bad way. Nothing at all was memorable from this film.The effects ranged from decent to stuff worse than a Power Rangers episode. The whole movie had a crappy TV show feel to it. I seriously felt like I was watching Power Rangers at times.The worse part of all, Jessica Alba's makeup was terrible, and inconsistent. It changed throughout the day. She looked plastic. Why destroy a natural beauty like her. And her ""nude"" scene was terrible too. They showed more skin with her wearing the wedding dress.Just unbelievably awful. I rarely hate movies as much as this.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lame,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. No story. Uninteresting superheroes with little power(s). At one point a woman points a pistol at the four superheroes and the surfer AND they honestly try to talk her out of shooting them.. umm! They're superheroes!! Is there a reason they can't disarm a woman with a pistol? There's hardly any action, the sequences which are in the film are pointless. There's all sorts of lame worthless subplots, like Sue getting married... who cares? It's an action movie! I love the part where they have to fly a helicopter from New York to London to save the London Eye... why can't they fly? What lame superheroes. Also, last time I checked, helicopters can't fly from NY to London, especially not in five minutes...then back to NY a few minutes later, please. Where's the action plot? Don't waste time watching this plot less drivel.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than FANTASTIC!,"The first film kicked off pretty well, but I had high hopes for the best sequel to a Marvel film. In my opinion, the acting, action sequences and fighting was the best part. But what it missed for a perfect 10, was the unimpressive look of the CGI and the small portion of cheesy dialogue.Alba doesn't look too bad as a blonde, but there are scenes in the movie when she looked a bit ""fake"". The movie was a bit rushed though. I was expecting it to be longer but the movie still did good.There are parts in the film which are funny, but not too much of a big giggle.

The Fair to Middling Four,"The Fantastic Four return for more superhero silliness in yet another big-budget FX-laden movie from Marvel, which sees Sue Storm and Reed Richards preparing to tie the knot. But with a mysterious metallic dude known as The Silver Surfer, zipping around the world on his shiny surfboard making huge holes in the Earth (preparing it for consumption by Galactus, a planet-eating alien being), successfully making it down the aisle is more difficult than they had imagined.More tongue in cheek than many of today's crop of superhero films (The X-Men and Spiderman trilogies, Superman Returns), the Fantastic Four movies have the potential to be huge fun. But Rise of the Silver Surfer still manages to be a rather disappointing effort thanks to its lacklustre script which delivers little in the way of genuine excitement.For starters, far too much of the film's (rather short) running time is spent concentrating on the impending nuptials of Sue and Reed, rather than delivering impressive action set-pieces, and, since The Silver Surfer isn't out to directly hurt or attack the foursome, at no point do we feel like they are in any particular danger. In fact, the metallic menace cannot really even be considered a 'baddie' since all he is doing is preparing a snack for his boss (who looks nothing like his comic incarnationthe movie Galactus is a nothing but a swirling cloud).The cast are distinctly average, each playing their character with plenty of enthusiasm but very little depth. At least Ioan Gruffudd and Chris Evans look the part; Michael Chiklis as The Thing, however, looks rather rubbery, whilst Jessica Alba is the least convincing due to the fact that a Latino actress with blonde hair and blue contacts just looks daft.As for the much heralded Silver Surfer, he is no more impressive than the T-1000 from Terminator 2 which James Cameron gave us over fifteen years ago. So much for advances in technology.As a mindless piece of popcorn entertainment, Rise of the Silver Surfer is just about passable; as a big-budget summer blockbuster, it falls a long way short.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is not how it should be done.,"I was never really a big fan of the Fantastic Four, and I never really became a fan after the first movie was released in 2005. However, I was thrilled to know that in the next movie, the Silver Surfer had a bid role in the movie. Enough reason to see the film. Or so I thought...For those who do not know the Silver Surfer: It's a great Marvel Character . A lot of mysteriousness and power. And he has the mission of saving his people and his lover. The silver surfer has been around for ages (1966) and now he finally made his way to the big screen.The movie itself is OK. Not spectacular and not nearly as good as other superhero movies (Batman, spider-man, superman) but I enjoyed it, and I had a few laughs. Which brings me to my next point: This is not a comedy. It a superhero movie and therefor is should be brought in an epic atmosphere. Sure, a few jokes can't hurt anyone. But as I said: this is not a comedy.the thing in this movie that probably frustrates me most, is that the Silver Surfer is by far the most disappointing (and a bit boring) character in the history of superhero movies. The comics with the fantastic four were not that great, but I hope there will be a movie of the Silver Surfer solo. Then there is the time and the attention the silver surfer deserves.Finally I'd like to say: A great special effects team and a big budget does not guarantee a successful movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
5/10 for the Surfer,"Lame, lame, lame. That's the only word that comes to mind when I think of this movie. I went mostly because I wanted some real popcorn. I grew up with super heroes like Batman, Superman and the Fantastic Four. It's just too bad that number one Hollywood has become so devoid of original ideas that they have to keep doing the same thing over and over again and number two its too bad that if they are going to use Marvel material that they don't take the time to get it right. The other thing that really ticks me off is that Hollywood also seems to be devoid of good writing. If a good writer had been on this film it might have been much better. The subplot might have been interesting to explore if it hadn't been messed up by cheesy, stupid dialog. The whole issue of fame is a much needed discussion for our times. Too bad that a good writer couldn't be found within hundred miles of Hollywood. I am so tired of bad to mediocre I could barf.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"More like the ""Fall of the Silver Surfer""","I'm just really disappointed in this movie. This movie just goes to show you that 20th Century Fox just does not even care about the Fantastic Four franchise at all. I mean, the first film was kind of mediocre in my opinion, but the 2015 remake was just crap from the beginning. However, Rise of the Silver Surfer was a huge letdown from Dr. Doom getting his face back, to the final showdown and with the big reveal of ""G.I.N.O"" (Galactus In Name Only). Seriously, Tim Story, Fox....you have failed this franchise with this installment. And I really wish that Marvel should just buy the rights back so that they can actually make the characters more interesting to watch when they are interacting with the Avengers and other superheros and vigilantes like Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and Cloak and Dagger.Overall, I seriously do not recommend this movie to anyone at all. If you want a real ""Fantastic Four"" movie, go watch the Incredibles, instead. Or check out the 1994 version of the Fantastic Four movie. But, stay away from this movie. It's a waste of your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not only does the Silver Surfer rise, but also the rest of the Fantastic Four.","This is a summer movie to be sure. It has action, comedy, and a little heart as well. It is not going to win awards, it is not going to be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece, but it is still a very good movie. Add to that it is also short, something all summer movies should aspire to do. Granted, when first I heard of the running time I thought for sure this film would be underdeveloped, however my fears proved groundless as this movie's story was very well done with no loose ends unlike some movie's this year that ran nearly twice as long. I liked it better than the first movie as the comedy was funny and the action was rather nice too. The story has a mysterious force on Earth causing a bit of havoc as water is turned to glass and snow in the deserts. Even strange occurrences happen in Lateveria which is trouble for all. The Fantastic Four though are trying to make a wedding happen while balancing being super heroes and celebrities. The army wants Reed's help to track the force and Reed does, though without Susan's knowledge. Well the big wedding day occurs and it is promptly interrupted by a mysterious being seemingly made of Silver and riding what appears to be a surf board. The Fantastic Four must stop this being and find out his motivations before there is real trouble. Though they do get help in the form of Dr. Doom, which let's face it is probably going to be trouble later on. So yes, there is some good action, comedy and very good special effects. A great fight at the end with who you want to see the Fantastic Four fighting and a nifty climax featuring a very close call. To top it all off you also get out of the movie theater before you age a great deal as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And, seriously, most ten-year-olds would find this sh-t corny; the jokes are usually pathetic, the script is totally generic and unaffecting... and Jessica's fine bod: wrapped like a mummy.

Have we lost the concept of Super Heros?,"OK So I was never a huge comic fan but I'm still stunned that 'Marvel' was OK allowing its name to be branded across the very first screen ... followed by what I can only describe as unmitigated ignorance.If a person is really blessed with superpowers, and could do really amazing things like become a human fire ball (Johnny), strutting around in a towel (between gym sessions) doing the sexy, steam-dry, 'look-at-me-I'm-so-hot' trick for a female army officer is hardly the way to spend ones time when the fate of the world rests on your shoulders...(he was really really hot in that scene BTW but it's not the point!)And, if you have the misfortune to end up naked on the sidewalk outside your apartment block (Sue)... it was only for a few seconds, and it's not as if the media got a full frontal shot of her boobs, would you really sit up stairs in your big old glass fronted princess chamber, channel surfing to see how many stations were talking about YOU and your recent naked accident, and then howl at your fiancée about how awful it is to be in the limelight all the time and how it's impossible to get away from all the attention... it was a real 'shout at the screen' moment for me. Was I watching a movie or was I watching Big Brother meets American Dream on Sunset Beach... painful.And lastly when Reed answers back to the army guy with a series of one liners that was supposed to be a slam-down, I thought he belittled himself and his fiancée by objectifying her with statements like... 'yeah, and I walked away with the hottest chick in school while you were still the Quarterback.' like he's commending her for her blond hair and white teeth... and her response to this... NO JOKE... was... I'm so hot for you right now!"" I think the director must have forced the script write into this, maybe his grandkids told him it would sound really hip, about 10 years ago.To sum up... the movie has great special effects, lots of eye candy for boys and girls, cheap gags, no moral value system or character depth and I actually found it a bit of a time and brain theft. Put it this way... although they are superheroes, they should and probably will, all win the Darwin Awards at some stage.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rubbish,"I never had an interest in the fantastic 4 to start with. I didn't want to watch the first film at all. However, finding the Silver surfer appealing, I bought the DVD and gave it a try. What a big mistake. This film not only got all the stupid clichés you could think of, but the only character I thought would be interesting (The Silver Surfer) was reduced to a silly persona relating some sort of amoeba with god-like powers. Special effects apart, there's nothing to save from this film. There are people out there who want us to still believe that good special effects are enough to justify millions of dollars in expenses and a horrible plot.

Inane rhetoric of epic proportions,"The first F4 was good. Sappy but good. And so, with high hopes, I entered the theater to watch one of my childhood comics favorite spin off's (Silver Surfer). At first, I thought that it was just a slow painfully sappy start, but eventually things would get hot. Well, I've been wrong before and I was certainly wrong this time. I felt like I was watching the parts edited out of the real film. I feel bad that Stan Lee made a cameo appearance in this movie, for it is a sham of the real F4. My friend wanted to leave after 15 boring minutes but I convinced him that it would get better. Wrong again! Conclusion: If you're old enough to have read the original comics, avoid this movie like the mutating cosmic gunk that it is. For younger people, it might be a once only OK movie.

Can't write it any worse,"What a complete waste of amazing CGI and potential great story line. It's almost mind numbing how bad they wrote/directed this movie.

Instead of a mature treatment along the lines of X-men I,II, or Batman Begins, I felt like I was watching a Disney movie. Every time the F4 got together, I was half expecting to hear some ""Let's go team!"" kind of cheese.The commercials, especially with great voice-overs from Laurence Fishburne as the Silver Surfer, lead me to believe there was going to be some great, intelligent dialogue between the characters. I hear the Surfer Silver say ""All that you know is at an end"" and expect it to be the beginning of some intelligent dialogue about why he's here, what's going to happen, etc. Instead, he just leaves it at that and flies away. I was like, WTF?? That's it?? ""Perhaps later"", I thought. Nope, that was as deep as the movie got, I kid you not. Basically, there isn't really a story line. Just another Power Ranger-ish episode.And the acting? Alba and Evans are a complete joke. Perhaps that explains the Disney treatment. I could go on and on about why this movie sucks.

Fantastic Four 2: Anything but Fantastic,"They say sequels seldom pack the punch of the original, with only a few exceptions viz sequel to The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and as a matter of fact Die Hard with a Vengeance was probably better than the prequels. But with the Fantastic Four, it just wasn't to be. The first movie was itself a bit of a disappointment. The second has deteriorated one more notch.I have always preferred other Marvel superheroes to the Fantastic Four. As a team they never really proved their mettle before the likes of Batman, Superman, Captain America etc.The movie was anything but extraordinary. The character, Mr. Fantastic, is certainly a scientist nerd, but the character would have been better with a stronger personality assuming the role  perhaps, Billy Zane if he loses his English accent even George Clooney with his powerful personality and shades of white hair. Sue Storm aka Jessica Alba certainly does not fit the role well either. Her moves are not as crisp and powerful for a superwoman, as compared with an Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider or Jennifer Garner or even Charlize Theron in Eon Flux. Every instance that Jessica Alba triggered her force field, it almost seemed like she was only posing for a photograph. Her posture and the manner in which she carried herself was certainly not superhero-like. 'The Thing' and 'The Human Torch' are perhaps the only ones doing justice to their roles. The Silver Surfer speaks little and zips across the planet, but the portrayal was apt. He at least seemed to carry the sense of terror and might about him through his actions.Movies with superheroes are expected to be powerful, but it hardly shows with the Fantastic group. Take Batman Begins for instance. Although the movie did have several sober and emotional scenes, the build-up to the story was well done. The manner in which lose ends came together and smooth switching between past-present-and-future are credits to good direction in the movie. Fantastic Four did not have any of those. The story seemed like a mundane series of events where good foresees a threat, accepts help from evil and is double crossed but eventually prevails  in that very order. There were few instances of humor, thanks to The Human Torch and The Thing, else the movie would have been just that much worse.Among movies that have been adopted from comic books, Sin City, although one without super heroes, was powerful. It carried emotions and strength from pictures in the comic to the movie.Fantastic Four was everything but fantastic.I would rate it 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Fun and a Great Relief,"I thought ""FF:Rise of the Silver Surfer"" was great fun. I'm glad that Tim Story and crew managed to completely ignore the bad press the last film got and just forged ahead with their vision for # 2 (of course, they were helped by a $158 million take at the US Box Office for the last movie).I've nothing against the Batman-Style angst-ridden superhero genre, but after they angst-ed up Superman, the most positive of heroes, I knew that the ""dark superhero"" thing had just become a cliché in its own right. Every freakin' superhero has to be miserable for some reason. Bloat is the other Superhero movie ailment. Even the feisty Spiderman franchise has finally caught the ""Too Many Villains, Too Many Plots-itis"" disease from Batman. So, depression and confusion rule most of today's superhero movies--except for FF.The Fantastic Four have so far avoided both these traps. For the most part, the film shows having superpowers as being fun. In keeping with the original comic, the super-characters in the FF films do have problems like other folks-- but not deep, dark, brooding problems. And ""Surfer's"" plot, while typically comic book fantastic, is comparably straightforward and linear. AND, I might add, free of flab. No three hour epic here. Just a tightly composed entertainment that runs about 90 minutes--like an action movie should.To sum up--I liked it a lot!

While it is a huge improvement on the first Fantastic Four film (how could it have been any worse??), it still lacked a good story, acting, pacing and everything else that a good superhero movie needs. I realise that the director is aiming the film at a mainly young audience, but does everything have to be so simplistic? The dialogue, in particular, is really cringe inducing much of the time and actors don't do anything to help matters. Jessica Alba in particular, is very weak. And a little less makeup next time wouldn't hurt!! The one good thing was the Silver Surfer, who did look and sound pretty cool. Dr Doom was again hopelessly underwritten and was just there as a plot device. So on the whole, a real disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Comfortable slippers for $130 million,"I am back from the encounter that I have anticipated and dreaded for the past two years...back, from seeing FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER.Somehow, I never thought I would come away from it quite like this. I think maybe it's not a great movie. I do think, however, that it is a good summer popcorn movie. And I also think that it is a TERRIFIC Fantastic Four movie! Basically, the studio spent $130 million just so I could feel like I was putting on an old, comfortable pair of slippers...returning me to a comic book that I had started reading at the age of 10 (and stopped reading at 25).The bantering and bickering between the team here is absolutely perfect, and had me chuckling and even laughing throughout the film. It's enough to overcome certain weaknesses, like the FF's uncomfortable alliance with the military, and the apocalyptic effects-laden ending where the team sort of becomes irrelevant (although another huge CGI piece, involving a fight with the Surfer on the Thames, manages to keep the FF very much in the foreground). Johnny's adaptation from immature, egotistical teenager to immature, egotistical adult still works completely, Ben is much more comfortable in his rocky skin, Reed is right there sneaking in more work behind Sue's back, and Sue still dreams of nothing more than a normal life. The Surfer might have been CGI, but I had no awareness of that fact at all while watching. And even my dismay at seeing Doctor Doom bounce right back in movie number two--seeming to be more of a limited mindset to the franchise (a la Lex Luthor, Magneto, Green Goblin, et al.) than a statement about being the big nemesis--evaporated completely when I realized they were playing out another classic storyline from the original comic.Ninety minutes might have sounded short to me, but the movie was perfectly packed with character and action, and fully satisfying at its conclusion, leaving me exhilarated and feeling like I had champagne in my veins. As a matter of fact, I was tempted to stay and watch it a second time--which has me totally flabbergasted, considering no movie has given me that urge for something like 25 years! I can only hope this does well enough to bring us a third film in the series, and that the filmmakers are comfortable enough with it to feel they don't have to once again destroy the world merely to justify the making the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

How do I get back the time I spent watching this movie?,"I recently saw both Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer and The Incredibles. I'm amazed at how badly Fantastic 4 handles what's in many ways a story that parallels a lot of The Incredibles. Both are superhero movies that takes a team with family members included to fight a super villain. Even though The Incredibles is only an animated film, I thought everything about it was much better. The plot in Fantastic Four is predictable and boring (I guarantee that you've seen almost everything in this movie before), while The Incredibles was imaginative and fun, with interesting characters, good pacing and some plot twists along the way. The worst part of Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is the acting: Jessica Alba looks and sounds like an overgrown, animated Barbie Doll, while Mr. Fantastic is played like a combination of Super Nerd and the most boring person you've ever met. The other actors are competent but hampered by the script. On the other hand, the suspension of belief that goes along with animation allowed for the superheroes in The Incredibles to seem more realistic. The plot and animation was so good that to me they seemed more human as well. Overall. avoid Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer and see The Incredibles instead.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Power Cosmic?,"I am a fan of the Silver Surfer. I have worked hard to unlock him in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, own the NES game Silver Surfer, and also have read a lot of the comics. I went to see this film because of him, not because I liked the first Fantastic Four Film.I thought that the first Fantastic Four film was average at best. I did not like the actors cast as Mr. Fantastic and Mrs. Fantastic. I think Jessica Alba is very attractive but she can not effectively portray Mrs. Fantastic. Mr. Fantastic's portrayal in the film is bland and not exciting at all. He just adds nothing to the screen and is very uncharismatic.I do like the Human Torch and I think he is the best portrayed of the four. He acts the way he was in the comics and that is good. The Thing is pretty cool also and he is pretty well portrayed also, easily the second best in these films.So I was banking on Silver Surfer helping to raise the film to greatness. Silver Surfer was great, but a few issues. For one, when he does not have his board with him he is able to still use the power cosmic to bring it back to him. He did not need the board to use his power all the time. In this film once he loses his board he is defenseless. They should have stuck to the comics portrayal of him. Surfer gets to do a lot of damage but he really does not fight anyone outside of Galactus and Dr. Doom briefly.I have issues with Dr. Doom. WHy did they decide to put him in this film? The reasoning behind why he was put in the film is so stupid. They should have known not to release him from his prison and choosing to release him just to help out the Fantastic Four borders on retardation.If anything they should have left Dr. Doom out of the film and made Galactus the main bad guy. Galactus is not the way he should be. He is just a huge cloud and looks nothing like how he does in the comics. That was a huge disappointment since he is one of the best Marvel Villains.There also is a lack of solid action. That was also an issue with the first film. A super hero film with a lack of action is bad.Not a very outstanding film. Silver Surfer was cool, but the rest is not.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Worthy Effort,"Just returned from seeing the movie and can't find too much to complain about, ROTSS is a worthy effort and ranks only behind Superman Returns in the recent superhero boom.This movie has a little bit of everything, The action sequences and SFX are above par, there is enough cheese to keep you smiling throughout and character development is balanced enough so it doesn't degenerate into a goo-fest.What I like about the movie is that characters and the world around them are comfortable with our hero's powers and responsibilities, which helps give the movie a genuine comic book feel. Whilst the characters themselves are vulnerable enough to make them human. You get the feeling that the director (Tim Story) and writers (Frost and Payne) wanted to make a superhero movie, and were prepared to sacrifice the self-indulgence that has marred the Spiderman Trilogy and the turgid morality teachings of the X-men series.The characters aren't without their charm least of all Ioan Gruffudd who leads nicely from the front as Reed Richards, Jessica Alba illuminates the screen with her blend of beauty and strength as Sue Storm. Chiklis and Evans support admirably as The Thing and Human Torch respectively. The smartest touch was the return of Julian McMahon as the malevolent and diabolical Dr Doom who adds the much needed element of treachery to the movie. The Silver Surfer is the films finest work however, radiant with mystique, power and vulnerability. Tim Story does a great job of keeping the Silver Surfer's sense of martyrdom prevalent towards the end.In closing ROTSS is a credible effort doing enough to satisfy the comic book purists, whilst keep newcomers both entertained and informed. The world is saved and the next challenge awaits.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quite Entertaining and Surprisingly Delightful Fun,"I never saw the comic books of Fantastic Four nor watched the first film, but I was coerced by my friends to watch this one. And I have to say, I was quite pleased by it.OK, I'll admit though. I was one of those 17-18 year olds who went just for Jessica Alba and her glory, but it turns out I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Sure, there were cheesy dialogue here and there, but it's a comic book movie. Acting was decently done and the plot and story was sustaining throughout. There were many times when I could get a laugh or chuckle here and there.So all in all, I believe I did get my money's worth of entertainment. Of course this movie isn't an Oscar winner, but it had its moments as a fun film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cheesier and more clichéd than the first but, as such, far more memorable.","'Fantastic 4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer (2007)' is generally more interesting than the first even if it is less intelligent and takes a number of glaring missteps in terms of both its tone and treatment of certain source elements. Once the actual superhero stuff gets underway, it's just as passively enjoyable as the franchise was initially, though sadly just as camp too. It was around the time that Mr. Fantastic's computer-generated arms 'Mr. Tickled' themselves around two 'bodacious babes' and awkwardly reeled them in during a far too long and far too uncomfortable dance sequence set at his stag party that I realised what I was in for: an experience perhaps even cheesier and more clichéd than the original. That does mean that, for better or worse, it is actually far more memorable. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

On the list of the most incompetent military in film.,"While the charm of the cast is still here this one is even less on plot than the predecessor and that says a lot- While there is fun to be had and heart between the cast that is more or less the only thing that makes this movie more or less work, on all other levels it is an incompetent mess.The Fantastic 4 is facing a lot of personal drama but that has to be put on hold as a galactic villain in form of the Silver Surfer arrives to earth.There is not much of a plot in this movie. It tries to blend the personal stories of the fantastic 4 cast with a superhero story but that doesn't really work here. While the cast is what makes the movie work, the interactions between them, the rest of the movie is just dumb fluff that feels so poorly written and nonsensical it hurts. It is at its worst when it tries to be a superhero movie, which is strange since that was what I was wanting out of the original movie that didn't have the superheroes be superheroes.Because these guys are not only superheroes, they are a dysfunctional family and that aspect is captured a bit better in this movie then the first. But they are a bit more superheroes in this one, but that doesn't mean much when that is not the focus of the movie at all and that the superheroes stuff is undermined by the dumb military in this movie.Because that is the biggest gripe with this movie. The military is incompetent on all levels. Not trusting the Fantastic 4 after 1 blunder. Heiring a former criminal, letting people just walk and do whatever they want, it hurst since the catalyst for the second half of the movie is the militaries incompetence.The effects are better than the first movie but not much better. Thing still looks incredible with practical effects and the stretch powers of Mister Fantastic is better here, but the fire on Johnny still looks bad and the surfer does not look good at all.The interpretation of the later villain is also not that good. Just go for it, make it as we see it in the comics, this is just dumb.The acting is all over the place here. Micheal Chiklis still is great as thing and Chris Evans performance is way better here than in the first movie, but here Mister Fantastic and still Sue is not giving a good performance. Same for the camp performance by Doctor Doom that still feels like he is in another movie than the rest of the cast.This is a movie that is carried by the heart between the characters and that is where the movie is at its strongest. The interactions and relationship between them is strong and that is something to really like in this movie. Sadly the character growth is not written well here and the growth of Sue feels unnatural, same with Mister Fantastic and Johnny. There arcs are just not developed enough for this movie. The Surfer is cool enough, but he is a very distracting character since his voice doesn't really fit his character in my opinion.Overall this is just a very plotless mess with some heart but most of all it is uneventful, it feels like a lot of things are supposed to happen but the movie really doesn't want to move the plot forward that often and that leads to this messy feeling.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Visually Stunning, but Otherwise Not Good","Visually, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is stunning; the flight sequences were well choreographed and the digital effects that created the Silver Surfer were exceptional. Regrettably, the praise for this film stops there. The acting was poor, the plot was jumbled and rather than have a new story with a captivating anti-hero, Rise of the Silver Surfer fell back into the reliably mediocre with Dr. Doom. Not only that, but the logic behind the power transfers, Sue's blatantly obvious neon wig, and a meaningless third act death make this film borderline awful. Underneath all the chaos, there is a brilliant story to be told, the franchise just needs new direction.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Watchable But Disappointing,"Another disappointing Fantastic Four movie. The returning cast is fine, I guess, considering how the characters are written. Johnny's a bit more of a jerk, Ben's a bit dumber, and Reed has a stupid dance scene that should have resulted in someone being fired. But most of that is the script and direction, not the actors. For her part, Jessica Alba portrays Sue as less of a ditz this time around. Although the ridiculous blue contacts are distracting and unnecessary. Julian McMahon is back as someone they're calling Dr. Doom. They conveniently find a reason to allow him to act without a mask or makeup. Andre Braugher has a thankless role as a clichéd Army general with an ax to grind with Reed.The special effects are spotty. Sometimes they are passable, sometimes dreadful, but never are they great. The Silver Surfer is a CGI character interacting with flesh & blood actors in a real-world environment and the tech just wasn't there in 2007 to pull that off convincingly. At all times, you are very aware that he is fake. It's like having a cartoon mixed in with real people, a la Roger Rabbit. This is not the fault of Doug Jones or Laurence Fishburne. The biggest disappointment is in the presentation of Galactus. They obviously didn't have the budget to do Galactus properly so instead we get some vague cloud entity thing. It's the kind of thing comic book fans learned to expect from television shows like Smallville with limited resources, not a major film release.This movie is a real disservice to the original Lee & Kirby Galactus story, perhaps the best of all Fantastic Four stories. It highlights a fundamental problem with Tim Story's Fantastic Four movies. For what he gets right about the characters (the family dynamic, some of the characterizations, a lighter tone), he gets more wrong. There is never a sense of the fantastic about these films. They don't explore anything, nor do they introduce new characters, worlds, and ideas in any kind of impressive way. They're just people with super powers doing stuff. With very little effort, you could change the names and powers of the characters and not alter the story in any significant way. On the positive side, the movie does have a lot of humor and the main cast are likable actors all. I just wish they had been given a decent script and a serious attempt at making a quality FF movie instead of this. It's watchable but nothing better than that.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More of the same risk-free Hollywood hog-wash.,"Rise of the Silver Surfer brought about the 'Rise of the Demise of the Fantastic Four Film Franchise'. And it all came to a catastrophic blaze with Trank's 2015 reboot. But Rise of the Silver Surfer showed that the life left in this potential franchise was non-existent. I hate these Fantastic Four movies. They're devoid of the things that make for good superhero movies. The X-Men movies were so tastefully done, so why couldn't Fantastic Four have the same effort done for it? Fantastic Four: great team in comics, HORRIBLE in cinema. At least that is until Disney/Marvel get the film rights back for it.

The Silver Surfer is done an injustice,"OK, I am a big fan of the Silver Surfer comics, I think they are better than any other Marvel comics out there. I didn't have terribly high expectations for the movie itself but wanted to see it for the Surfer's character. I was sadly disappointed that nothing in the comic books was followed up by the movie.This, on the other hand is a great kids' movie. If I was say seven years old again I would LOVE this movie. But, it is indeed very stupid. I mean like when The Human torch is like stretchy at the end and he is flying and on fire at the same time and says ""It's Clobbering time"" was just stupid.So, overall if you are older than 7 years old only watch this if you're watching with your kid or baby-sitting or something.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An embarrassment on many levels.,"the original Fantastic Four was tired and clichéd, but there was a certain charm to it. Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer doesn't fall too short from the tree, but it doesn't quite live up to the fun of the first one either.the (thin) storyline follows around the sudden appearance of strange phenomenon around Earth. the Fantastic Four have settled into their lives, and have been comfortably embraced by the citizens into their normal day-to-day lives. the military soon comes calling, and right as Reed Richards and Sue Storm are about to tie the knot at the alter, the Silver Surfer shows up. Johnny Storm has an encounter with him, and it leaves The Human Torch in a bad fix: when he touches another member of the team, the powers are switched. the Four struggle to settle their differences, public and private, as they try to uncover the mystery of this new threat. meanwhile, Victor Von Doom has (rather inexplicably) returned, and sets up his own schemes for the Silver Surfer.I have to admit, I had low expectations for this movie. I went to see it only so that I could set up an opinion of it that's actually based on how I took the film. I'm sure most comic fanboys won't bother seeing the flick, but will set up their own opinions of it anyway. but I digress. the storyline is very, very, VERY poorly put together. we're talking worse than Ghost Rider here. the special effects are quite good, and they definitely raise the film for me. the visual fun and intense special effects are what makes this movie so damn fun in the first place (as was the case for me with the original). the characters are very badly done here, though. I wasn't too pleased with how they were played out in the first movie, but they're even worse here. Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards serves no real purpose outside of lame dramatic relationship material, and he doesn't even have the gray sideburns that he gained mysteriously in the first movie. I realize that's comic-book-geek-nitpicking, but hey, it's still really stupid. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm once again remains only to flash cleavage (and her naked body in one scene) and wear entirely too much makeup. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis don't serve up the playful banter as well as in the previous adventure, but their separate performances aren't too bad. Julian McMahon as Von Doom is little more than a throwaway character, but who really shines in this movie is the character of the Silver Surfer, largely thanks to voice-over work of Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus from the Matrix films). however, it turns out the Surfer isn't the real villain here, and fans of the comic will know why. this villain, though, is very poorly conceived. you never really see him for what he really looks like, and the way he is dispatched in Rise Of The Silver Surfer is completely ridiculous. it's flashy and cool-looking, but illogical.one really nice point about this movie that i'm sure most people won't think of: the score. it's simply wonderfully. it's well written, it follows with the appropriate scope of the film, and it sounds amazing, much better than the ""insert music here"" soundtrack of the first Fantastic Four. Stan Lee also makes the best cameo here out of all comic-related films (outside of Mallrats, of course).overall, it's a mediocre flick, one not to think about so much. especially you, comic book fans. if you all think about it, you'll be sorely disappointed with all the writing mistakes that have been made.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic Fun!,"When the first ""Spiderman"" film was released, it received general approval but some negative reviews,due especially to uneven effects, amateur acting, and cheesy design. However, out of the rubble emerged ""spiderman 2,"" a film that remains as one of the best super-hero adaptations of all time. It far surpassed the original, learning from its mistakes and cleaning up some of the cheesiness. When ""Fantastic Four"" was released, it was met mainly with disapproval and rather bad reviews, which it deserved. The effects were very cheesy, the villain was third-rate, the plot was ridiculous, the script was horrid, and the film dragged on. Luckily, ""Silver Surfer"" has pulled a ""Spiderman 2"" on us. Though not as good as ""Spiderman 2,"" it far surpasses the level of the original.The acting in ""Silver Surfer"" is far from perfect, but it's certainly passable and is extraordinarily unimportant in the film. Chris Evans brings the spirit of fun to the film, Jessica Alba brings the ""hot"" factor, and the silver surfer brings the excitement and bewilderment. The special effects in the film are dazzling and not at all hokey. The silver surfer looks amazing, the human torch looks the way he should, and Galactus, though hardcore fans of the comics may be enormously disappointed, has been stripped of the cheesiness he had in the comics. He's no longer a giant man in purple, but rather an astrological whirlwind of power. The plot of this sequel is also very good. The run time of the picture is short, so the script is beneficially tight and the plot doesn't get old. Also, there is no room for cheesy sub-plots. This is a great, fun movie that people of all ages will enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Dodge of superhero movies,"Perhaps the dopiest supervillain or superhero depending on the point in the film in the Marvel universe is the ridiculous Silver Surfer. Literally he's a spaceman on a surfboard. One imagines Stan Lee struggling with a looming deadline ahead of a beach vacation and just rolling with whatever the first idea that came to mind. Given a whole movie around this loser concept, the film had an institutional upper limit on quality. Not that it worked hard to overcome the Silver Surfer handicap. The film growns under the weight of extensive product placement for some reason mostly around mediocre products most notably Dodge motor cars (one imagines the Fantastic Four quickly tired of going to the dealer to solve minor quality hiccups with their Dodge Fantasticar). It also struggles with Chris Evans and Michael Chilkris clearly feeling upstaged by their more talented, attractive and necessary members of the foursome so much so they spend a distracting amount of the movie breaking the fourth wall. While o plot, characters, acting and advertising all come in sub optimal, it would be remiss to not notice the smaller, inferior details. Why did Costume Design just recycle the one-piece blue and black unitards from ""Stark Treak Next Generation"". More importantly, did women have to take the whole thing off in order to pee? The Silver Surfer most remains unresponsive to the hero's questions but he does answer some queries particularly around his romantic interest back home. Does he just not understand the heroes or is it that he finds their dialog not worth of responding to much like most of the audience feels about the script? The film poses many questions, the most of important of which is whether you can get some of your ticket price back. In short, keep in mind that Marvel produces so many superheroes that most won't be that good.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It should have been better,"Amid the fact that there was every opportunity to make a better movie, such as a larger budget, an interesting character that is Silver Surfer, the origin set up out of the way, and years of comic book lore to tap into, Rise of the Silver Surfer seemed to be nothing more then a slight shadow of what could have been.Now, the action was more intense then the first, I thought. What made them give this a PG was the general mildness of it all, very little or no blood. Safe for any child that can watch Y7 rated shows on Cartoon Network. Perhaps that is where they went wrong. Besides, the general fan base isn't really 7 yrs old, it's 20's, 30's, 40's, and older because they read the comics so long ago. Maybe, but then you have the short running time of barely 90 minutes. We were in and out before we even had a shot to get to know this new character suggested in the title of the movie. Or perhaps it was the fact that that when the grand finale came about we were so completely underwhelmed that we felt cheated on the setup that seemed a lot larger then it really was.It seems that I would be contradicting what I said on the comment for the first Fantastic Four, that comic book movies should not be expected to be the same. Movies are movies and comics are comics. But here... at the end of the movie,(no spoiler) it was like robbing you of something important. So diluted and so unreasonable was the ending, that everything before it suddenly becomes useless. It removes the reality of the Silver Surfer back story, destroying it and making it unintelligent. A simplified, pat ending that was probably placed there by suits that perhaps wanted to pack everything in a short movie and keep it at a lower budget then other summer blockbusters. I don't know. Maybe it was the writers, the director, I'm not checking. It's just not worth it for me to do so because I am so saddened. And I'm not even a Silver Surfer fan.Considering the relatively low gross, smaller then the first, I don't think we will foresee a fantastic four 3. So long FF. See you in 20 years when holograms are the new fad.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better but still not 'Fantastic'.,"My take: Although better than the first, it's absolutely nothing to be wild about.I wasn't exactly anticipated when I heard that they were releasing a sequel to 2005's FANTASTIC FOUR, for I didn't actually like that film. But still, I went out to see it on a premiere night during the last few days of the summer. Like I expected, the film is filled with special effects. Surprisingly though, it was better than the first film. Unlike the first, this sequel actually has a real villain, much more compelling than the banal Dr. Doom, who is still here and still played by Julian McMahon (but thankfully, not as major as in the original). The villain is actually a quite interesting character since it is actually given a back-story unlike the other characters. The comedy is is improved as well, and some are actually funny.FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER is better than the first film, but it's still not a very good film on its own. The film is still mediocre when it came to writing a story and a bunch of interesting characters. The characters here are just the same forgettable pieces of cardboard cutouts in the first film. Besides fighting the arrival of the Silver Surfer (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) who has manipulated weather and produced mayhem at the process, Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffud) and Sue Storm aka The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are getting married, and their the target of many controversies. I don't give a damn! That pathetic subplot could have been removed and still create a movie, but only less as pathetic as it is right now.As a special effects creation, The Silver Surfer is OK. As a matter of fact, had they centered the movie on the story of this character, I think it might have been better (might!). Instead, it centers on a bunch of uninteresting cardboard cutouts, not to mention the return of Chris Evans' overly annoying playboy Human Torch character. FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER is not a totally awful film, but I still can't recommend it higher than a worthy rental.Rating: ** out of 5.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Rise of Silver Surfer - but No Galactus ?,"Loosely based on FF issues 48, 49, 50 (Coming of Galactus), and issues 57,58,59, 60 (Doom steals Surfer's powers), this movie while done better than the first one, still misses the mark.It's clear that these guys don't get it about what makes FF one of the best super heroes ever to come out of comics. Unlike Sam Reimy's Spiderman where evidence that Reimy gets what makes Spiderman so cool, or Brian Singer's X-Men where his fleshing out of the characters are so perfect, these guys just have the characters doing cartwheels all the time and never get into the plot or the characters, or the timing of action that makes FF so interesting.The suspense and trauma of coming of Galactus and the Surfer in the original comic is nowhere to be found. I don't think Ioan Gruffudd would have been able to act out the stressed out Reed Richards in trying to devise a way to stop the landing of the Surfer on earth. Coming of the Surfer, his powers, and his eventual capture is so run of the mill Hollywood science fiction plot that, it doesn't have to be a Fantastic Four movie. And no Galactus on this epic episode ? What's the excuse ? Not enough time ? Well TV animation from decades ago was able to pull it off in 30 minutes, and this movie is over 90 minutes. Get rid of the phony capture and Doom stealing the surfer's power plot. That was from another story. Here the same mistake of patch work of just flashy story tidbits from different episodes like they did on the first installment is evident.Too many unnecessary scenes, and not tight enough plot makes this movie ineffective in communicating the power of the characters. I don't think the actors could carry the weight of FF characters either ( which was doubted for James Marsden when he was cast for the X-Men but was later shown that he was the ""Cyclops"" ).Better than the first, but no cigars.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fantastic Four is assumed as a superhero film that seeks to entertain without major commitments, and not try to bring depth to the plot","After the first film gross over staggering 330 million dollars at the box office over the planet, nothing more than obvious and expected a string quartet for Marvel. And this continued, again who is in charge is Tim Story (Taxi (2004) - that just making the same mistakes of the previous film, but getting to be slightly higher on some key factors.Here, the heroes are already accustomed with the powers acquired in the first film. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are preparing the last details before the wedding day. Already Johnny (Chris Evans) is still worried about getting into new girlfriends and ""sponsors"" for the group and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) is happily dating the beautiful Alicia (Kerry Washington) from the previous film. However, in the midst of wedding Reed and Sue, the Silver Surfer appears (body of Doug Jones with the voice of Laurence Fishburne), which controls the ""power cosmic"", absorbing and manipulating the cosmic energies of the universe and environment can fly at speeds virtually unlimited in your board, and announces the impending destruction of the planet. With their presence, Reed / Mr Fantastic is convened by General Hager (Andre Braugher) to locate and uncover the reason for his coming to earth. The quartet will still have to deal with the return of Victor Von Doom, Dr. Fantastic (Julian McMahon), who has a contact Srfista Silver and ends up proposing to Fantastic alliance to defeat the new threat to the planet.It is undeniable and laudable intention of the producers and writers to try to stay true to the comics. Even with the mistakes of the previous film, the story is generally faithful to the appearance of the characters. This time, the screenwriters Mark Frost (even from the previous film) and Don Payne, made an interesting mix of stories from comic to base this new adventure. References for this film will journal number ranging from 48 to 50, when it appears for the first time the Surfer - figures 57 and 60, when the Surfer is Dr. destination, and finally the magazine Fantastic Four Annual # 3 , ""The Wedding of the Year"" in October 1965 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, 1965, whose focus is the marriage of Reed Richards and Sue Storm.The early history of the Silver Surfer goes back to Galactus, the devourer of worlds, one of the greatest villains of the Fantastic Four. In the film they are keen to make it clear that he was known as Norrin Radd, a nobleman who lived on the planet Zenn-La, and to save his planet and his beloved, Norrin offered to serve eternally as a herald of Galactus, preparing the planets for its destruction climatically and geologically changing the places through which passes. And arguably the best character is the Surfer, represented perfectly by Doug Jones and merged with the voice of Laurence Fishburne. The character was created digitally and all seems very real. His facial expressions and movement is very well built and the scenes in which he participates are the Main action scenes of the film.The screenplay by Don Payne and Mark Frost based on a story by Mark Frost and John Turman is lean and has less than an hour and a half long, and bet especially in scenes of humor and the action scenes. It should also be noted the small number of action scenes, and a series of events that affect the flow of the plot, to be placed in a well-spaced. The climate is less ""juvenile"" than in the previous film and earns a more adult by its theme. The big problem is that there is a strange atmosphere throughout the film, because even before a real and dangerous threat against the end of humanity, still jokes are inserted all the time, immediately breaking the tension created some opportunities. Incidentally, in the mood, alumas scenes work well, like dancing in the disco elastic Reed during his ""bachelor"", their ""soft legs"" when you're about to get married, the fight grooms Reed and Sue, the scene in which Reed faces General Hager and Sue is ""thrilled"" with the courage and decided to air her future husband. But to remember is that the script has very weak dialogues and totally predictable.But some errors and problems are clearly evident, for example, when the Thing exchange powers with Johnny and suggests that rather have her old body back. In the first film, Reed had already managed to return to human form to it, then why did not he reverts to human form? If at the end of the first film he accepts who he had come to be assuming his new responsibilities, that he wanted to stick around to be human again. Another point worth mentioning is the speed with which Reed, Mr. Fantastic, develops equipment and technology that even the U.S. government and all its technology, can develop. In just a few days it can develop what was requested by the General Hager.The special effects are even better and well applied without exaggeration. Disappointing it is the final fight against Galactus. For those who followed the reading of clashes Fantastic Four against Galactus, the end is well below expectations. No one in the cast stands out, only Michael Chiklis again protrudes slightly with the Thing, and Jessica Alba again for its beauty abysmal. Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom is, as before - ham, expressionless, is ludicrous and yet presented with a horrific end to your villain.The soundtrack of John Ottman not supreende, and the photography of Larry Blanford contributes to the film, especially in its final half hour. Coupled with the well-chosen scenarios and a competent team of visual effects, especially in the composition of the Surfer, the delivered product is visually beautiful and attractive. Even in smaller quantities, the errors are still seen with the naked eye and compromise the final result, but compared to its predecessor, is the best script, the effects and brings the great Silver Surfer. Director Tim Story is still in a good mood the cult of celebrity and notoriously can better develop the characters.Has dramatic depth (despite the imminent end of the world) and it is an error of direction, but it is assumed as a superhero film that seeks to entertain without major commitments, and not try to bring depth to the plot (as in ""Spider-Man"" and ""Batman"" director Christopher Nolan) - the vision that we have regarding the film should be more flexible and be seen as just a fun and passenger entertainment, as indeed he was conceived.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Safe Bet for Some Summer Fun,"You went to see Spiderman 3, you were disappointed. You looked forward to the clever dialog in Ocean's 13 and you were disappointed again! Now that you've had enough of films that just don't live up to their hype, Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is exactly what you need to rebound and enjoy the rest of the summer. This is the quintessential, action packed, save-the-day flick that has everything: A wedding, a misunderstood villain, one unfathomably gargantuan and evil force, and a family-like group of heroes working together to save the day. The film is perfectly paced; It's not so fast that you can't keep up but not so slow that you regret not sleeping through the first 20 minutes of the movie. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm keeps the dialog witty and easy with the aid of his easy to bruise rock-buddy Ben Grimm. You might not leave the theater awed and inspired I'll give you that, but I bet that you'll feel that $10 you just spent on the last 1 hour and 45 minutes is well worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The series is heading in the wrong direction.,"There's little reason to recommend Rise of the Silver Surfer. It's missing even the goofy charm that made first Fantastic Four a decent popcorn movie.The problems begin with the casting. Its much more apparent here than in the first movie, that these actors really don't fit their characters. As much as I love Jessica Alba, she's no Sue Storm. She tries hard, but she never comes close to being anything more than a pretty distraction. Dr. Doom is smarmy, but not sinister or intimidating. Johnny seems bland, The Thing is defined by his girlfriend more than anything else, and Reed is just goofy. Each character is basically an even more watered down version of themselves from the first movie. The Silver Surfer just flies around looking cool and making dire predictions. And let's not even begin talking about Galactus. Everyone is uniformly underwhelming.As for the story, it's more boring than anything involving FREAKIN' GALACTUS should ever be. It's short, which makes it bearable...until the ridiculous ending. Horrible. It sounds like I hated the movie, but I was just genuinely disappointed that Rise of the Silver Surfer didn't improve on the first movie, at all. Watch this if you simply must see every superhero movie (or if you must see every Jessica Alba movie), but be prepared to find little satisfaction.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

All that money on special effects. . no way????,"So anyway. .I heard this vicious rumour that most of the budget for this film had been spent on special effects. Nah, Hollywood wouldn't to that to us these days, not after Spiderman 3.Actually I had a hard time watching this film because the cheese kept getting in my eyes, the cheese that was dripping down the screen from start to finish.I can't give it a five because it didn't interest me enough to warrant enough exploration of who was who and what was happening. If you are a teenager and you like the Olsen twins this might be the film for you. I went to see it with my wife because my wife wanted to see it.I'm not saying it's diabolical, it does have some mildly fun parts. The ending made me laugh, they could not have been more hokey if they had tried. I'm glad I've seen it, this way I can move on to better films.Ah well, at least they tried. .or did they?

Silver Surfer Rules,"When the Human Torch, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), first encounters the Silver Surfer he exclaims, ""Now that's cool!"" Yes, the Silver Surfer is so cool. It's this light hearted spirit and sense of wonder that propel Director Tim Story's ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"". ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a light year's improvement over the original ""Fantastic Four"". The Silver Surfer is the iconic figure that transcends to almost the spiritual in pop culture. Well, perhaps that is a bit much. Admittedly, the tale of the Silver Surfer is the stuff of classic mythology. Possessing the power to transform matter and energy in the cosmos at will, the Silver Surfer has few equals. Is the Surfer the World's destroyer or savior? As embodied by Doug Jones and voiced by Laurence Fishburne, the Silver Surfer is a mysterious paradox. The Surfer provokes unnatural disaster upon earth, and bares a calm and noble presence. The Fantastic Four seem no match for the powerful Silver Surfer. So what remains is distinguishing his intentions. The Silver Surfer ominously says, ""All that you know, is at an end.""This time around the storytelling by Don Payne, Mark Frost and John Turman is engaging, compelling, with a humorous feel for pop culture celebrity. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is also funny, in particular Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. As the story opens Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to marry Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) in what is tagged as the ""Wedding of the Century"". Theirs is a rock star's wedding. The Fantastic Four have attained rock star status. In fact Johnny (Evans) has incorporated the 4, and is even considering NASCAR-like sponsorship for their uniforms. In a hysterical touch Johnny's date confesses in an ""E!"" carpet interview that dating the Human Torch requires ""Fire proof lingerie and a lot of aloe."" The Thing, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), has settled into a stable relationship with Alica (Kerry Washington), who is blind.On the eve of the Richards Wedding, General Hager (Andre Braugher), enrolls Reed into discovering the source of a series of unnatural events taking place across the globe. Genius Reed soon deduces that source may be an anomaly of vast cosmic energy. Upon further examination: this propagating energy anomaly has left 7 destroyed worlds in its aftermath. The cosmic anomaly is the Silver Surfer, and he becomes an uninvited guest at Reed and Sue's wedding in New York. During Johnny's encounter with the powerful Silver Surfer something goes awry. In the meantime, arch nemesis Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) is resurrected. The Fantastic Four are coerced into an alliance with Victor to battle the Silver Surfer. Of course Victor can not be trusted.The compelling story is the Silver Surfer's. The Silver Surfer is the herald of Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds. The Surfer is bound by his word to Galactus. In a great scene with Sue, the Silver Surfer concedes, ""I have no choice."" What choice does the honorable and benevolent Surfer have, being that he has given his word to serve the malevolent Galactus? This is a hero's conflict with no easy resolve. ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a great hero's story with engaging heroes. Chris Evans is awesome again as Johnny Storm. This time around he tempers his flip charm and flashy charisma, with his fear of ending up alone. Ioan Gruffudd has a newly commanding presence. He mutes some of the dorkiness of the character, and embodies leader. Jessica Alba, stunningly beautiful, to her credit plays Sue Storm straight and true to her character. Alba has an endearing vulnerability, and a surprising strength. Michael Chiklis is solid as Ben Grimmunfortunately his talents are not adequately leveraged. Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne together bring the enigmatic Silver Surfer to life. The Silver Surfer is such a noble and charismatic force. And the Silver Surfer gives the movie its spirit. ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is awesome summer entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tries but fails,"Rise of the Silver surfer is very ambitious in its attempts to portray a threat to the world. The newest character Silver Surfer is simultaneously portrayed as a villain and a hero, I found his character very dull. We got Dr Doom back but he barely has a role and posses no real threat disappointingly, the dialogue and plot are worse than the first and the ending is very weird.2/10: Has average cinematic moments and boasts good effects but it's not much of a film",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"fantastic four? So far, these films are not giving these characters credit","firstly, I agree with a few comments I have read saying the silver surfer deserves better. The surfer was not given as much credit as he should have. Of course, fans of the Fantastic Four will know what it means when the Silver Surfer comes along (hint hint) but not enough respect to such a character was made. So far, I have not been impressed at all with any of the two films, neither the first or the sequel. As comics to films go, so far Fantastic Four has to be one of the worst for holding the attention. Of course, we are always rewarded at some point at the end of the film, but I was nearly ready to fall asleep at a few points! I sat wide awake through all the relationship and talk dribble of Spider-man 3 for Christ's sake. And this film is worse than worse. You would do better to read the good comics (or even the cartoon series!) Of course, it is nice seeing these comic characters being brought to the big screen and seeing them in action, but this film did not deliver on what I was expecting, or what I thought it was going to be.I give it 5/10 very average. But I would not purchase it on DVD. If I was you, do not even pay to go and see it at the cinema. Maybe rent it someday for a quiet weekend. You'll sleep quickly - trust me",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worse than the First,"Just watched this again and it's worse than I previously believed. Johnny has lost maturity in the sequel rather than gain it, and when his character started as an overgrown teenager thats bad. Sue has become less interesting since she seems to be there for the sole purpose of getting the Alba drool-monkeys in the theater. Reed is more of a nerd and less of a man than in the first, and he was a wuss to begin with. Ben, well he's the only one of the four who seems to be stable. Doom is back, if any one is surprised they must never have heard of the F.F. As before hes a far more interesting than the heroes, but not by much. The Surfer is well, lame. He's a bit too quick to turn on his master and I can't believe Galactus became a space cloud. I could have written a better adaptation in about 5 minutes. Special effects, yeah they are mostly good ones. But thats really the only thing this movie has going for it. Don't pay real money to see this.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fantastic Follow-up!,"The sequel of Fantastic Four is way better than I expected it to be. With all the negative reviews, I thought that this movie would be a piece of crap. The story starts when Reed and Susan are about to be married. Then, an unexpected visitor from outer space interrupts the proceedings. The four heroes along with the military and the venomous Doom must stop the mysterious Silver Surfer from destroying the planet. The acting in this film is great and possibly better than the first one. Doug Jones/Laurence Fishburne did a great job as the Silver Surfer. Ottman's music is good with a couple of great tunes. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm is hilarious. I hope that there is another sequel to this thrilling, great special-effects film. I rate this film a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
just a little better than the first film,"This movie was very average. The special effects were OK, certainly nothing great. The story may have been a little better than the first film, but still it's nothing great. An alien, referred to the Silver Surfer, because he gets his power from a surfboard comes to earth. They learn that once the surfer is on a planet for 8 days, that planet is destroyed. The surfer is far more powerful than the fantastic 4, but they devise a plan to separate him from the surfboard. Dr. Doom comes back and very predictably is after the surfboard. They learn the surfer really doesn't want to destroy earth, but is forced to by another entity. The fantastic four persuade the surfer to help them out and try to save earth.The acting is not very good, and there is no suspense. It's just not well written.FINAL VERDICT: Not really worth seeing. I just saw Transformers, and it's a much better film, both in plot and special effects.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sci-Fi Highschool comedy,"There have been a LOT of Marvel/Mutant/Superhero-movies produced lately, and the quality ranges from ""really stinking bad"" (Daredevil someone?) to ""Whoopaaa!"" (X-men 1). So is the sequel to the first mediocre Fantastic 4 movie a new blockbuster? Unfortunately, the answer is NO. There is no tension in this film, what so ever. Despite the fact that the world stands before a great peril, there is no feeling of despair, no sense of danger or even some signs that the members in the fantastic four feel a little uncomfortable.Effects are good and the Silver-Surfer himself looks really cool. Jessica Alba is so over-the-edge sweet that you could slice her up and sell her as candy. But in the end, this is nothing than a Highschool old fashion comedy about the nerd and the good looking girl wrapped up in a little Sci-Fi and spiced with some nonsense science.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Light fantastic,"Undemanding, sit-back, in-flight entertainment, which is in fact where I viewed this comic-book sequel. I am a comic book fan (more a DC than Marvel guy, I must say) and so can accept this type of fantasy film if the notion takes me. The Fantastic Four seem on the whole to be a much lighter subject than such complex individuals as the troubled Batman and Spider Mans of this imaginary world and so the film must be accepted at a much lower level. The characterisations are about as thin as comic-strip paper, the humour forced and of course it's product placement all the way but the story rattles along with special effects (of a decidedly mixed quality) in almost every other scene. The actors barely merit mention, playing their clothes (should that be costumes) adequately and I also thought the Stan Lee cameo as stilted as it was unnecessary. As I stated above, the SFX are good only in patches, the computer generated Silver Surfer fairly leaps out of the screen and comes off best overall but Mr Fantastic's stretching capabilities seem to, well, overstretch the director and his team. In summary, I think I'd have preferred to have read a half dozen or so FF mags in the time it took to watch this big-screen adaptation but I can't and won't complain overmuch.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yuck!,Yuck! This movie was terrible. As a long time Fantastic Four fan I am very upset with how they have handled all of the movies so far. The first movie wasn't terrible but it wasn't very good either. The acting is sub par except for Michael Chiklis who is okay as Thing. The plots have been mishandled too. The only good thing about this movie is The Silver Surfer who is handled well and it is an interesting plot within this movie. Other than that they need to go back to the drawing board or just stop ruining this fond childhood memory of mine! I find they don't really understand where they are going or should be going with these characters and with the rich source material that they had at their disposal.,2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good enjoyable movie. The best of the summer sequels so far!,"I'm a big fan of the comics, and was really looking forward to this, and I was not disappointed like I was with Spider-Man 3. This is a GIGANTIC step up from the first film. It's got everything, Action, Comedy, Drama, Romance, you name it! The acting is pretty good, Chris Evans does a great job as Johnny Storm and Michael Chiklis is perfect as the Thing. And the Silver Surfer, oh man was he awesome. He was the best part of the movie. He was spectacular! The effects were great and his story was great, and they have set it up for a possible solo film. I'm not going to give that many spoilers but, You do NOT see Galactus like he was in the comics (Though sometimes you see what appears to be the shape of his helmet), but I don't really think it was that big of a deal. They did a good job with it. They had some corny lines in this movie but it wasn't too bad. The first half of the movie is a little slow, but it gets better and better, the last half was great.Lets put this simple: This movie was good. It was the perfect summer film.

A grossly underrated Fantastic experience!!!!,"Off late, especially with the relatively recent success of The Dark Knight, the general perception of audiences seems to be that the darker and more 'realistic' the tone of a superhero film, the more success it attains. While this is certainly true if you consider the two Nolan-directed Batman films, the first two X-men films, Burton's 1989 Batman film and a few others I could name; the truth is that it is not merely the dark tone that makes the film successful but the little things like plot construction, storytelling, characterization etc. which are oft overlooked these days. Another factor to be taken into account is whether a dark tone suits the character. Batman and the X-men may be dark because that tone suits the world they inhabit and the kind of stories that can be told with their characters. But try making Superman dark, and you'll find the result is not all that endearing. Which is why, I've never really understood the criticism directed towards the Fantastic Four films in general, and this one in particular for their 'campiness' and 'unrealism'. After all the Fantastic Four have always been campy and fun, because they were created in an era where comics were supposed to be campy and fun. After all, you cant expect a franchise which revolves around a family of celebrity superheroes constantly bickering with one another to be exactly dark and serious can you. And as far as the unrealism bit is concerned, the Fantastic Four have always been fantasy characters: they have always been about breaking the barriers and exploring new worlds of science and mysticism. They were never meant to be all that realistic in the first place. Which is why I think this film, while certainly not one the epic scale of TDK, is definitely one of the better superhero movies of all time. The campiness and the humour is present, though not over the top. The plot is simple, yet effective. The special effects are outstanding. And even amidst all the humour and fantasy, we have a few 'down to earth' character moments which remind us that our heroes are, after all, ordinary people with their own likes, dislikes, fears and anxieties. Reed Richards(Ion Gruduff) is torn between his dedication to science and to protecting the world. Sue Storm(Jessica Alba) is concerned about the effect of the team's very public superhero lifestyle will have on her future with Reed. Chris Evans does a great job as the Ben Grimm, interacting well with other characters and generally doing a good job as the resident strongman of the team. But as with the first film, it is Michael Chilkins who steals the show with his portrayal of Johnny Storm. The character is developed much further from being the shallow showman and exhibitionist of the previous film. While those external trappings are still present, even emphasized in the sequel, Johnny is portrayed as being a lot deeper. We empathize with him over his 'alienation' from the team due to his abnormal 'power problems', understand his frustration when he learns that Reed and Sue secretly plan to end their superheroic careers, and his feeling of guilt when he realizes he is continuously letting down his friends due to his hot-headedness. Johnny greatly grows as a character in this installment, though of course, it is Reed and Sue who remain the 'real' protagonists. The film does have a few flaws though. One of them is the Silver Surfer. Not so much the portrayal of the character (Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburn do a great job on that and the effects are spectacular), but I often thought that the Silver Surfer's background could have been expanded upon, given that he is the title character and the perceived 'villain' for much of the film. His origins and his connection to Galactus could have been brought out more clearly. Also, as in the previous film, the climax, though excellently filmed, could have been more elaborate. We have Johnny Storm acquiring the powers of all his teammates and fighting Doctor Doom but the main antagonist, Galactus, appears for all of three minutes as a giant cloud and the whole 'end of the world' thing is over before you know it. If the Silver Surfer is not the villain, then Galactus is, but the Fantastic Four don't even face him, which does not lend too much credibility to him being the primary antagonist. So is Dr. Doom the real villain then. It seems likely, but then again, Doom does spend most of the film working with the Fantastic Four to capture the Silver Surfer. Basically, we have a good plot, good dialogue, characterization etc. but no clear focus on the antagonist. Otherwise, this film is truly a fantastic experience!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Granted, it's over the top action and fun, but that's what FF always was to me. Dynamic movement, explosions and cosmic adventure. In many ways, I think this movie succeeded in ways that Spidey 3 failed - most importantly, the way it used multiple antagonists and tied them together. The film was never boring. The Silver Surfer looks amazing, and the voice is perfect!Certainly, this is a far better outing than the first Fantastic Four film, and I look forward to more.

Surprisingly good...does exactly what a comic is supposed to do.,"I stood in my living room and clapped when FFII ended. Not because it's Godfather II, but because --- as when I'm reading a good comic book --- I was on the edge of my seat. The movie was well-written and interesting (even if the dialog sometimes sputtered). The story line was good and the characters had some depth. It reaches toward complexity: It's a story of love, free will, science (and science fiction), good and evil, and even a doomsday scenario. Good work. It's clear to me that the writers and directors understand what comic books are all about: tightly written spectacles that keep you on the edge of your seat while tackling serious philosophical questions.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More precious than the first!,"Marvel Comics fans, wait no longer! ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" has sailed on in. Reed Richards aka ""Mr. Fantastic""(Ioan Gruffud), Sue Storm aka ""The Invisible Woman""(Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm aka ""The Human Torch""(Chris Evans), and ""The Thing"" aka Ben Grimm(Michael Chiklis) are back again to save the world from evil. This time the menace is known as the Silver Surfer aka Norrin Radd. However, the real threat isn't him, it's his master Galactus: The Devourer of worlds. When the group encounter strange phenomenas in certain parts of the worlds, the closest thing that can happen, will certainly hit home. I liked the part when Johnny Storm went after the Surfer and the touch affect his powers. When he touched his sister, he was out of sight, she was just hot. The embarrassment occurred when she landed naked, as usual! The real cool scene is when he got Thing's power. Ben Grimm got the last laugh. The bachelor party scene was cool. Reed really got the party started when he loosened up. The return of Dr. Victor Von Doom(Julian McMahon) was inevitable. He's back to his old schemes as usual, wanting more power. I liked it when The Torch got all the powers of his teammates and said the Thing's quote, ""It's clobberin' time!"" The next thing would the attraction of Skrulls. Johnny really put a hurting on Doom. And for the Surfer, Susan really got through to him. And he did return the favor to her when Doom downed her.

Best Comic to Film Adaptation...I know that's a polarizing opinion,"I am a well-read guy, in comics and literature, and I watch and make and own a lot of films, and I can confidently say I disagree with you. This movie knew what it was, pure popcorn comic book style family entertainment. It was able to take me back to being a kid again, something that none of the Spider-Man or X-Men movies were able to do. It reminded me of watching hours of cartoons as a kid and I mean that as the highest compliment. I know the first Fantastic Four film was terrible and poorly conceived, but this one really nailed it. It was tight, didn't stray from the narrative it was trying to tell, and kept to the main characters. I was constantly entertained and amazed by the performances, the witty banter and the amazing visual effects. I did not go into this movie expecting to like it. I am a cynic when it comes to film, I can pick apart Schindler's List or Gladiator to death. But not this film, it had a youthful spirit and energy and did not take itself seriously at all. I had a wonderful time watching this movie and again watching it twice on DVD. I don't know if it's a love it or hate it situation, but I loved it. I would recommend it to kids of all ages and comic book fans looking for that one movie that doesn't take the source material and try and turn it into Shakespeare. Not that there's anything wrong with Hamlet(especially the Branagh adaptation) or Romeo & Juliet(the Olivia Hussey one), or Macbeth. It's just that Spider-Man, Daredevil, Superman to some extent and X-Men have all tried to make us believe they are something they aren't and that takes the fun out of them. I don't include Batman in here because I believe that the story of Batman and the film adaptation in ""Begins"" is complex and articulate and I still found it thoroughly entertaining. But the point is these aren't hard stories to tell, and I like my authors to be straightforward with what they are trying to get across, which is why I'm such a big fan of this film, entertaining from beginning to end. Made me forget that I'm such a film cynic. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Silly, fun, and pretty to look at","You know, I could easily examine Rise of the Silver Surfer from the pessimistic side and claim that it's script was fatally flawed, that it was full of improbable ""deux-ex-machina's"", or that it was hammy and clichéd.But after a summer of bloated, incoherent screenplays (Pirates 3), passive and dull screenplays (Shrek 3), or sugary and self-indulgent screenplays (Spiderman 3), F4-ROTSS was positively refreshing. It was a straight, coherent story, with its tongue firmly in it's cheek, and it didn't over-complicate things with too many characters or too many plot turns.ROTSS knows exactly what it is - a simple, special effects driven, comic book panel - and sticks to its guns. It's dumb fun, fast and pretty, and it never gets much deeper than that. But in all honesty, what else are you looking for in a superhero summer blockbuster?

It was fantastic for me.,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is surprisingly good. It is not great but I would have to say it is probably the most entertaining of the big summer blockbusters of 2007 that I have seen so far. It a time filled with overlong, overwrought and overstuffed action movies is a breath of fresh air. It is fun, quick paced and has a breezy 90 minute running time. It is true to the spirit of the original Fantastic Four comics, from what I have read of them- it doesn't take itself at all seriously, it is fast paced and is a platform for whatever crazy and wacky ideas the writers could come up with for the superheroes and the uses of their powers. The movie is very jokey but a lot of it actually funny, even the slapstick kind of stuff involving the Four swapping powers. I even got a chuckle out of some of Johnny Storm's smarmy one liners and the interactions between him and Ben Grimm are generally pretty entertaining. Everyone fits there roles quite well and seem to be having a good time. The acting isn't great but everyone brings what is required to their roles. Even Jessica Alba doesn't suck to badly- they easily could have gone down the whole angry wife/fiancé route with Sue Storm and Reed Richards but they don't go overboard on the melodrama. The characterisation is fairly lightly etched but at the right level for this kind of movie. Each of the characters has a personality but the makers don't try to turn it into a character piece and get bogged down with it. The Silver Surfer comes across a but of a selfish dick though- he was perfectly willing to help Galactus destroy those other planets draws the line when a woman on one particular planet reminds him of his own girlfriend? The action stuff if pretty good as well.The sequence with the Human torch chasing the Silver Surfer, as seen in the preview, is great and the battle sequence at the end involving two souped up multi-powered individuals is great fun. Even Galactus looks pretty cool, although is there was one element that could have had a bit more screen time it was the presence of Galactus, who's arrival and dispatch is a bit too quick. There is a lot material in this movie and at times in does seem a little rushed, hurrying from one plot point to the next but on the whole the movies swift pace is an asset. A slower pace is the kiss of death for silly, fantastical movies like this. There are some plot concerns, such as the fact that Galactus is willing to give a minion of who's loyalty he cannot be assured the capacity to destroy him but I was well inclined enough toward the movie to let it slide. It isn't a deep or a powerful movie but it is what is set outs to be, and what I wish more summer blockbusters would aim for, a fun movie with no delusions of grandeur.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Is this sequel an equal to the first film? Or, is it superior? Check out my review to find out!","""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (2007), the moment I finished seeing the first movie, I hoped that there would be a sequel. So, you can imagine how excited I was when this film was first announced. On the day I went to go see this movie in the theater, I didn't think this would be as good as the first film, as most sequels fall short. But sure enough, it took me by surprise. Not only is it every bit as good as the first movie, it's even better in some aspects! How about that? ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, a powerful being known as the Silver Surfer comes to Earth along with the planet-eating Galactus, and it's up to the Fantastic Four to stop them and save the world. Now, for a movie that's 92 minutes in length, a story like this may sound a bit too complex for that runtime. But, the writing and execution is so expertly done, that every second is not wasted and everything is resolved at the end, leaving you satisfied and then some! I won't go into any details regarding the plot. But, I can assure you, that you will be invested and intrigued all the way from beginning to end. There's always something going on, and you will be on the edge of your seat all the way through to the end credits. It's easily one of the fastest 90 minutes you will ever spend watching a film. When a movie goes by fast, then you know it's a winner! As far as the acting goes, it's just as strong as the storyline. Every cast member from the first movie returned, along with some new faces. A notable addition, is Doug Jones as the Silver Surfer, who is dubbed by Laurence Fishburne. When I saw that on the cast list, I thought that would be unusual. However, Laurence Fishburne's voice coming out of a powerful character like that really works. It was a wild card, having him dub Doug Jones' on-screen portrayal. Sure enough, it works brilliantly. Laurence Fishburne has a great commanding voice, which is perfect for the Silver Surfer and gives the character a great presence. The whole cast nails their respectable characters, but in my opinion, their performances are even better this time around. All of the acting is on-point, and you'll find yourself caring personally for each character and you'll want them to succeed. Their on-screen chemistry is nothing short of impeccable. All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give the film an excellent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are very well-done and still hold up to this day. A lot of them have improved since the first movie. Also, there are a few of them that are even better than a lot of the effects in recent films. How ironic! Finally, the soundtrack is very well-done. John Ottman returned to write and compose the film score. Once again, he nailed it! The music sets the perfect tone for the story. John Ottman is an outstanding film score composer, and this movie is no exception of that. ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is a phenomenal superhero film. This movie achieves what very few sequels do. It surpasses the original film! That's right, this movie is even better than the first one. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're a huge fan of the Fantastic Four and haven't seen this movie, or the first one, go see them today! I promise that you will not be disappointed with it. The first film is amazing, but this sequel is far superior. It is fantastic! (No pun intended.) If you don't see these films, look out for Galactus!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved it,"First f4 was below average but f4 2 is a big improvement from its predecessor. Its really hilarious entertainer. I didn't get bored a single minute. I loved scenes like Reed's dance in bachelor's party, sue touching Johnny and turning into human torch, Ben touching Johnny and turning into human torch and Johnny becoming thing and Stan Lee's cameo(it was so funny). The best scene is were Johnny combines all the powers and fights doom. I really loved this film. So sad that this franchise got scrapped.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty awesome,"I really liked this sequel, it was really entertaining with some pretty good action, awesome special effects, and it also has a few good laughs in it too thanks to Chris Evans who plays the human torch. But I really enjoyed this film altogether, this is another film that I was able to watch in the middle of the night at like 3 and I didn't even once nod or think about falling asleep. Overall I give this an 8 out of 10, the same as I gave the first one too because they are both great superhero movies and some sequels don't quite live up to the original but I have to say that this one definitely lived up to the original. I would recommend this to all action fans and of course to all fans of superheroes and marvel comic characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best comic to movie title.,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is the closest thing to the comics. After disappointments (as a comic fan) with such films like X-Men and Spiderman finally Marvel had released a decent comic to motion screen movie.Fantastic Four portrait the story with humour, romance and a realistic approach even though the story is 'farfetch'. With excellent acting and great on screen passion Fantastic Four was a dream come true.After an unsuccessful first film - even thought it was a great set-up to the story - and a better later release with the extended addition. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a great addition in the history of film. And hoping for a third movie with the Inhumans, a man can dream.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Screw the critics, this movie's awesome!","Probably to say F4-2 is better than the original ain't saying much but after the massive disappointments that were 'Spider-Man 3', 'Pirates 3' and 'Shrek 3', 'Silver Surfer' was a pleasant surprise and a great time at the movies.Personally, the only redeeming grace of the original were the Fantastic Four themselves, particularly Evans and Chiklis. But when you put these likable characters with a much better script and amazing special effects you get the first truly enjoyable film of the summer.Now it wasn't perfect, I hate Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. I hated him in the first one, and I hated him even more in the second one. And despite the world coming to an end, there wasn't really any tension throughout the entire movie.But I have to say that Evans (Torch) and Chiklis (Thing) were fantastic, Alba and Groufford were better than the first, also Kerry Washington (I love her) was pretty good too in this one.As for the Silver Surfer, I thought the effects were amazing and Fishburne was the perfect choice for him. As for the controversial Galactus (a storm cloud?) I thought it wasn't bad. It looked like a Thundercloud had sex with a Kraken, but it looked good.All in all, I enjoyed myself. I say: catch a matinée (I did, only $4), turn off your brain and have fun. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun sequel,"The second Fantastic Four movie is all-around a fun action-packed adventure flick but not a substantial improvement over the last film. What's very prominent in this film (more than perhaps in any other Marvel Film) is the element of campy comedy which undoubtedly is what keeps the film afloat through it's less action-packed segments.All in all, it's nice to see the movie carries the torch of the previous one rather valiantly though you are left with a feeling that they could have done more to spice up the film. In all characterizations were okay and it's also nice to see some more character development for Johnny but the rest of the team weren't as prominent for some reason.The action is great, the comedy is nice and the plot and cast are solid. On all accounts 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is a good (but not great) comic-book movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More enjoyable then Spider Man 3,"The Fabe four(Jessica Alba, Ioan Grufford, Michael Chiklis, and Chris Evans) return in this entertaining sequel. The up coming wedding to Sue Storm and Reed Richards is interrupted by an alien being known as the Silver Surfer. But when Johnny flies up to it, he is soon grabbed by the surfer. and when the rest of the team members touch him he switches powers with them. But when they learn the every time the Silver surfer passes through a planet after next, eight days later the planet gets destroyed. It is up The Fantastic Four to get to bottom of this before it is too late. This was a good live action comic book movie. The performances and the effects never seem to wear themselves thin. If they do a third one, I hope it will be the charm .",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very Entertaining,"'4 : Rise of the Silver Surfer' is what a good slick entertaining movie should be. Of course it could be better or might not win awards, but it is fun to watch.Similar other 'comic' movie sequel out this summer was slow and drag. 'Silver Surfer' has no such problems.On this site the current rating is 6.3, which is underrating it. It deserves minimum 8.To all who have not seen it, I would suggest not get biased by negative reviews.I recommend it to anyone who just want to watch a FUN movie !",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great fun movie suitable for the whole family.,"Compared to other super hero adventures that came out this year (and even last year.. Spiderman 3, Ghost rider, X-men 3, Transformers...All disappointing) this film actually delivered what you expected. I fully expected this film to be a fairly straight forward special effects/humour driven movie and not to be taken too seriously and that is what it was. Unlike Spiderman 3 and Ghost rider, which should have been much darker/serious films but ended up being fairly cheesy affairs (was there really any need for the whole singing and dancing thing in Spiderman?) this film was just good fun and I came away satisfied. Recommended for super hero fans, probably won't appeal to those that don't appreciate the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie was better than the first of course. And this movie is,"Look, For people like this Saar Vardi, who has not one brain cell working for it at all. Needs to lighten up.I saw this movie and it was great. It was not mindless at all, maybe for someone who mainly just sits here listening to bombs go over and woman and children crying then maybe it would be.This movie was better than the first of course. And this movie is wonderful and great. And I think people need to stop posting things like that person did! If you are going to bash the movie and hate it, then why the hell watch it in the first place? I am correct.And trust me tons of people loved this movie than the number of people like that guy who seemed to dislike it.To him and others go get bent.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Short, sweet, fun and more dazzling.","""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is the sequel to the 2005 box-office hit where not only are all four heroes back in town, but they get their first PG rating in comic book history.Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffard), Susan Storm/Invincible Woman (Jessica Alba), Ben Grimm/The Thing (Michael Chiklis), and Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Chris Evans) are back where after saving the world from Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) in the original movie, the quartet heroes have became international superstars where fans young and old take an admire in them. After going home, things are not really back to normal as plans change for Reed and Susan's wedding when an enemy known as The Silver Surfer has plans of ridding planet earth once and for all unless the famous four members do something about it.While many comic book movies from the Spider-Man trilogy, the Blade series, The X-Men trilogy and others have been over 100 minutes long, somehow this sequel manages to be under ninety minutes while never disappointing fans of the movie and the comic series. There's laughs, thrills, tears and cheers in every direction where there's nothing wrong with this picture at all. I don't know why the critics dissed this film since most of them probably never read a comic book.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Passed my expectations.,"To tell you the truth, I thought this movie would suck.I have 2 reasons why I thought this movie would hit rock bottom: I haven't seen the first and I wanted to see a different movie.But I wasn't disappointed.Just like the first, this movie was packed with both action and humor.It's also more tame than the first.So this movie would make a really good family movie.The special effects were also great.This is the kind of movie that's called a ""boom-fest"". I'm sure you know what that means.You know, a movie with tons of action and mind blowing special effects.If you liked or loved the first movie, then I highly recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The greatest comic book hero of all time finally gets to the big screen - in a BIG way,"The second installment of the Fantastic Four series finds the Four at odds with each other - dealing with celebrity status is not as easy as it may seem - and dealing with both an old threat (Dr. Doom) and two fresh ones - The world-devouring Galactus and his Herald, Norrin Radd - The Silver SurferFans of the Silver Surfer, which was introduced by Marvel in the early 1960's, will find his big-screen look to be extremely well done. For many, the Silver Surfer is the top-dog in the comic book universe - Marvel or otherwise - and his big-screen debut has been anxiously anticipated by fans the world over. The CGI work is perfectly executed by Weta (Lord of the Rings, King Kong) and his character is true to the comic.There are, however, aspects which are not true to the comic - I will not name them here; the detail required to explain would constitute a spoiler - and so as it is with most comic book films, it will be up to the individual reader/viewer to decide how all that matters to them.The film picks up right where FF #1 left off which is good; only a short amount of time has passed. The thing that make the Fantastic Four unique is that they are out in the open - no secret identities. That makes them targets by the supervillan criminal element as well as devoted fans and paparazzi. It's refreshing, but they may have gone a bit overboard here. Still, it had to be explored because these are not aliens but humans with superpowers and ultimately, they must live their lives the same as the rest of us. Hopefully in the next film, they can concentrate on the superhero aspects only.This film was way too short. They could have added another 30 minutes or more quite easily. If there is one basic negative it is that so much more could have been done and that several scenes were rushed.The story is solid, the effects are excellent, the characters are people we care about. And the Surfer is perfect. Kudos to the producers for tapping Laurence Fishburne for the voice. Absolutely Perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not the greatest film the genre has produced but still a step up above the original,"The long awaited marriage of Mr. Fantastic Reed Richards and Invisible Woman Susan Storm is abruptly put on hold when the U.S. Army recruits the Fantastic Four for a mission to track down an astonishingly powerful cosmic being known as the Silver Surfer. It's a race against time for the heroic foursome when they learn that not only does his presence on Earth cause a drastic and threatening change in the environment, but that all of the planets he visits unexpectedly die eight days later. Sequel to Fantastic Four is never truly spectacular or awe-inspiring, but the story is interesting, the script much better than the first, and there are plenty of exciting action/effects sequences. Too corny at times, much like its predecessor, but pretty good entertainment for fans of this popular genre. **½",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A victim of Marvel's success,"This film tells the story of the four superheroes who fight against a mysterious but powerful enemy on a silver surfboard.Superhero films, especially Marvel films, have come a long way in the past yen years. When the first ""Fantastic Four"" was released ten years ago, it was just another blockbuster film. This sequel was also unable to create much shockwaves. In just a few years, Marvel films have become sensations. The films have become very entertaining, and yet every film seems to surpass the previous one. A Marvel film opening is certainly an event in itself.With this background, I'm sure if I watched ""4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" when it was first released, I would have enjoyed it a lot better. The film mixes action with quite a lot of comedic scenes. It also has a lot of eye candies, which should be a recipe for success. This film has fallen victim of Marvel's success.However, I guess viewers are all very spoilt. I find the comedic scenes too ridiculous. The silver surfer look so fake that it looks like a B movie computer graphic. The plot doesn't provide enough thrills either, because a collapsing London Eye just doesn't make the cut anymore.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heybuddymovies #7 worst comic book movie,"I really liked the first Fantastic Four, it had great themes of family and heroism in the midst of struggle. Jessica Alba, like always, was miscast, but I liked the rest of the cast in their roles. It wasn't a perfect movie at all, but was good summer fair and one my son will be familiar with when he can watch it. The follow-up a few years later was just awful. The cast seemed to have lost all the chemistry they had in the first film and now just seemed to be going through the motions. Although the Silver Surfer effects were great, the story surrounding him took a much loved Marvel character and watered him down. Not only that, they took one of the strongest villains in the Marvel rogues gallery and turned into a very scary, extremely menacingcloud. This killed off this franchise, but I am sure there is a ""reboot"" in the making.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
it's a great movie,"I had seen this movie when it hit the screens and saw it again yesterday. in the meantime many comics became movies, but it is still very rare to see something equally entertaining.All these fans who blame movies like these should think twice. They all compare the movie to what they understood from the comic books and try to spot differences to blame the movie. I tell them ""forget the books when you see a movie! You should encourage these movies if you want to see more comics movies"".The movie itself has an interesting story line and the characters look fantastic as they are portrayed. There was a lot of action (almost too much) with very interesting parts that we have not seen in other movies.The only negative point is the looks of Jessica Alba with extremely dyed hair and too fake blue contact lenses. If they wanted a blonde with blue eyes, this is what type of actress they should find, or else leave her the way she really looks and we will have to deal with it.I would be happy to see a 3rd one and close it there as a trilogy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
