"Dark, Stylish, Visually Amazing .... and not really for young kids.","First - if you see this movie, try to see the 3D version - not all presentations are in 3D. Second, know that this movie is way too dark (IMHO) for kids under 10. Not only could the visuals be too intense, but the pacing is not that of a children's show.OK - that said, this movie is great. The strength is in three areas: visuals (scenery, characters, and little 'details'), style (this is movie is simply a work of art - a very dark and offbeat style) and emotional impact (the film visually evokes a lot of childhood feelings about growing up).The basic setup: A little girl and her parents move into a big, mysterious old home. One night, she learns that a little door in the house opens into a passageway to a parallel world. In this world, there are alternate versions of her parents, friends and everything ... as she journeys back and forth, she learns more and more about this world ... and the story progresses from there.If that sounds a bit too simplistic, there's more to it in the full story. Plus, it's presented in a serious and dark tone - which adds to it's mystique. The only area I can knock it is in a tame use of 3D. There are definitely some spectacular 3D parts, but the way it's used in general makes it fade into backgroundIf you're drawn to the visual aspects of movies, then this is must-see movie for 2009.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Instant Classic,"Feisty eleven-year-old Coraline walks through a secret door and discovers a parallel reality. That reality is sort of similar to the life she already knows yet deeply unsettling in a number of ways. Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) begins a journey of adventure and self discovery when her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) relocate the family to Oregon from Michigan. No one in this new space has time for her so she spends her time exploring her new neighborhood with an talkative local boy named Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.). After discovering the odd neighbors all of whom are true characters, she is still bored somehow.All of this immense undertaking is courtesy writer and director Henry Selick, director of Nightmare Before Christmas, and the well crafted adaptation of Neil Gaiman's international best-selling children's novel. To Selick's credit this is the first 3D stop motion ever made; stereoscopic 3D. Selick himself worked on the film for three years. The style is stunning and the story is an unwavering fairy-tale nightmare that has some genuinely scary moments. is a masterful movie and an exciting tale of mystery and imagination.In the rotting nooks and crannies of Coraline's new home the real story begins and where she discovers a hidden doorway behind the wallpaper. Inside is her alternate space where there are doubles of her distracted parents now lavish loving attention on Coraline, the oddball neighbors are friendlier, and her pesky friend long longer speaks. Only her parents' eyes now black buttons give a clue that something isn't quite right.Selick has created a world as much for adults as children as there are references dotted throughout that the young won't understand. The imagery, however, is very child like. Both talents live side by side and bodes well for Selick's previous work in Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach and even Monkeybone. His work has always been fascinating. Gaiman is to be credited with the story for sure, but this is Selick through and through. This film is sure to become an instant classic and as well executed as this movie is it should be.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A masterpiece,"""Coraline"" is simply one of the best animated films ever made: The plots is brilliantly developed, the animation is detailed and beautiful to look at, the characters are fascinating and interesting, and the world created by Neil Gaiman and Henry Selick it's simply captivating, but mysterious and dangerous and well.Clearly influenced by ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Coraline"" is charming and macabre at the same time: At first ""The Other World"" seems like a dream come true, but there is also a constant sense of danger in the air.Dakota Fanning makes a great work as the main character, and Teri Hatcher is flawless in her role of the Mother (And the Other Mother as well) of Coraline, not to mention the excellent performance of Keith David as the cat.""Coraline"" is one of the best movies of the recent years, and it is the best movie of Henry Selick as director since ""The Nightmare before Christmas.""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
What an artistic movie,"The Movie Coraline is an animated film well worth watching more than once. SPOILER ALERT The movie starts out introducing Coraline, voice actor Dakota Fanning, who is new to the Pink palace and is soon introduced to the black cat, voice actor Keith David, and Wybie Lovat, voice actor Robert Bailey Jr., who both are stalking Coraline. We then meet her mother Mel Jones, voice actor Teri Hatcher, and her father Charlie Jones, voice actor John Hodgman. Corallines' new life is shown to be less than wonderful as she meets her other tenants and is unable to realize her dream of gardening. Soon she discovers another world, which is much better in every way tailored specifically to Coraline based on information gathered by a spying Coraline doll carried by Coraline unknowingly. The other mother quickly turns villainess, as she is unable to get Coraline to do what she wants. With the help of the black cat, Coraline is able to escape the other mother and return home saving other children's souls who were less fortunate than she was. As well as her parents who were trapped to lure Coraline back to the other world.The movie end with Coraline now happy with her real world and realizing she had everything she needed there all along. The theme of wanting more than what you already have and not seeing how good you have it is common among films today. However, the creative imagination of Coraline takes a spin and makes a very unbelievable situation seem plausible. The motif of the movie is seen often as the theme is drawing on what is real and what is too good to be true. When the sound and lighting are as controlled as in Coraline the Director can really impress upon the viewer a believable world that you can see yourself involved. The songs used make the world's first the regular world and then the other world seem like a place of dreary and boring plainness and then a world of pure imagination yet also terror. When the other world is dissolving the technique of fading the edges into white is pure genius.The angle also helps you see through a subjective viewpoint in the majority of the scenes, even though it is not truly the camera angle but how the slides are drawn to show certain angles. The theme is so crucial in Coraline because few people would think the way Coraline is acting at the start of the movie might even be bad but as the movie progresses you see how she is flawed in her original outlook and judgments of her parents and new neighbors.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline.,"As a Neil Gaiman fan, I was, of course, very happy with the book ""Coraline"", and was extremely excited to hear that a movie was being made for it. I had very high expectations from director Henry Selick after seeing 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach'.I was not disappointed.It followed the book surprisingly closely, though there were a few anomalies (the character of Wybie, for instance, didn't exist in the book). It had that Tim Burton-esquire feel about it; terrifying, but in an entertaining sort of way. There were one or two scenes which were a little over-the-top for younger children, but that's to be expected.You could just tell from the opening scene alone that you were in for a treat. Hauntingly beautiful, well choreographed, and, plain and simple, a bit terrifying; it really hooked your attention and promised a good time.However, there were two problems throughout the movie that I could spot:One was that some scenes were a little choppy in the animation; almost like they hadn't quite taken enough pictures to make it run smoothly. Unfortunately, with stop-motion animation, this is difficult to avoid, and it isn't overly distracting anyway.The other was Coraline's mother was a little... angry. Yes, she's supposed to be constantly frustrated and such, but I think she went a little overboard. Fortunately, Teri Hatcher redeemed herself with her portrayal of the Other Mother, which was brilliant.Coraline earns a 9.5 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very enjoyable fantasy with superb animation,"Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" is a smart adaptation of Neil Gaiman's extremely popular award-winning novella. Selick's screenplay is excellent and faithful without being a carbon-copy of Gaiman's story, and Selick adds some of his own dialogue to the film, so his contribution is most certainly not only visual, and chooses which dialogue to use from the novel wisely. Less of a horror story than the novella and more of a dark fantasy, ""Coraline"" features a well-written and well-drawn lead character and brings the novel's bizarre world to life without compromise. The film's fantasy world grows more bizarre each time we see it, and is as discomforting as it is fun. I missed the singing rats from the novella, but this was more than compensated for by the visual splendor of the garden scene, and there are numerous other examples of the changes from the novel making total sense as Selick's vision of the story differs from Gaiman, but doesn't betray the original work of art, only compliments it. The voice cast is very good and one cannot praise the spectacular animation enough. I was very pleased with the 3D presentation here, it was very, very rarely (only once or twice) used as a 'cool effect', and overall was very tastefully used to give the visuals more depth. Perhaps the first really good film to have a wide release in 2009, and looking at the next few weeks I see more than one film I'm moderately interested in, so this might end up being a pretty good year.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Creepy, in a really creative way.","When i saw a teaser of this film i didn't imagine it would be a fantasy/horror movie for kids. That's great because there aren't many, and it must be difficult to display a colorful world with the right amount of frightening elements not to leave a child having bad dreams up to adulthood.Coraline is a girl who wishes she'd had more attention from her parents, a prettier place to live and better neighbors. After she discovers the entrance to an apparently enhanced version of her reality, she'll soon find out that too much perfection can't be real.Good and imaginative story, delighting visuals, creepiness from the beginning and a couple scary scenes make this an enjoyable film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderfully imaginative animation;  a visual masterpiece,"Henry Selick, the director of "" The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"", once again takes us to a world full of imagery and wonder...but this time...some of it is actually frightening. It was filled with such magic and enchantment that I completely forgot that it was a dark tale..until the occasional scares filled the air. It has some highly fun and amusing characters in it also, and that is the strongest thing of the movie. After viewing it, I came to the conclusion it was basically an ""Alice in Wonderland"" tale (girl entering new and strange world, plus the cat that talks makes it obvious) but this world has a dark twist. Filled with a great cast and terrific visionary, I feel this movie is fun for all ages (who says kiddos shouldn't be scared?)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Curious, bizarre and dreamy","When it comes to visuals, nobody does it quite like Henry Selick. In unimaginably original and absorbing fashion, Selick gives life to a written fairytale, just as he meticulously gave birth to the figures that inhabit the world of Coraline. More than any traditional fable of say, Hansel and Gretel, Coraline evokes more similarities to Guillermo Del Toro's, Pan's Labyrinth in its curiousness, bizarreness and dreamy essence.Such material almost seems to discover Selick of its own accord and with his past visions, James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare before Christmas, his use of stop-motion technology and now 3-D, perfectly portrays the mood and atmosphere of the story on screen. Yet, there is such a thing about being too quirky and outwardly eccentric and it is this self-awareness and bizarre coldness that keeps Coraline from reaching the heights that it may have been destined to acquire. This is however a strong contender for this years Oscar ceremony and I truly hope Selick will finally be recognized for his accomplishments in the fields of animation, stop-motion and film-making and storytelling as a whole.Peppered with well assigned and memorable voice-work, the stars anchor the film further yet into such a memorable fantasy. Staring as the scrappy youngster Coraline is Dakota Fanning, who proves she is a very capable voice actress. Moving with her writer parents to the somewhat eerie Pink Palace Apartments, Coraline feels isolated both from her mother (Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) who are buried in their work while being separated from her friends back home. She entertains herself by visiting her odd neighbours, and avoiding the only other kid nearby, Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.). One night however, a small door in the wall of the creaky apartment seems to call to Coraline and a wonderful alternate world reveals itself. This land of fantasy is filled with kindness, gifts and love (even though its residents have buttons for eyes); the opposite of the world Coraline has grown to hate. But soon a sinister essence begins to show itself and the young heroine must choose between this new world and the one she wishes to leave behind.Of the few problems that impede Coraline, one of the most detrimental is the somewhat solemn and depressing mood of the film which is sure to put off some children, even if not the accompanying adults. Coraline's parents are distant and somewhat cruel to their daughter as they bury themselves in work and neglect her desire to simply have fun. Even worse, is that there is no catharsis to this character flaw at the finale, and it left me somewhat emotionless. There is also the aforementioned issue with the sometimes hugely apparent, self-referent wackiness, although I won't hold that against Selick and his personal vision. Above all, Coraline differentiates itself from other stop- motion films and will hopefully anchor itself as this generations Nightmare. Parents and older children will be engrossed by the visuals and those older will be given plenty to admire, even love and those younger will be given a film they can love more with each passing year.7.5 / 10.0Read all my reviews at: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Henry Selick's latest film is a delight!,"Almost 3 weeks ago, I attended a screening from Ain't It Cool News to see Henry Selick's latest film, 'Coraline.' I was excited because the screening would showcase the film in 3-D technology, and there was the chance to do a Q&A with Director Henry Selick (unfortunately due to bad weather, Mr. Selick did not make it to our screening).Before going in to see 'Coraline,' I had read the book on which the film was based. While many acclaimed it for it's storyline, I found it rather dull and predictable. I've been surrounded by fans of Neil Gaiman's work, though so far had never picked up a book written by him (though 'American Gods' did pique my interest).Going into the film, I was not quite sure what to expect. I had had tastes of the film from the trailers, but the general consensus was that Henry Selick had tarnished Gaiman's story, turning it into 'Disney fodder.' The truth is: the film manages to be both charming and creepy.For those not in the know, ""Coraline"" tells the tale of Coraline Jones, who moves to a new town and a house with several strange characters. As well, Coraline's parents just seem to have no time for her, and so she takes to exploring her new abode by herself. In her exploration, she uncovers a small door in the house, which seems to lead to nowhere. But upon revisiting the door late at night, it opens onto a parallel world that is much more whimsical and fun than the real world.The one difference is that in the 'Other World,' almost all the inhabitants have buttons for eyes. But still, the other parents in this world pay attention to Coraline, and the rather blasé atmosphere of the real world is electrified with color and interesting flights of fancy. It seems just so perfect...or is it? Henry Selick manages to take Neil Gaiman's story, and crafts a world that just seems to take great advantage of stop-motion in a world where the obvious choice would be to go for a totally computer-generated world. Seeing minute details such as Coraline's clothing made of actual material makes the world seem even more magical, where invisible giants manipulate the Lilliputians in this miniature world.Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, and a number of other vocal actors give voice to a number of wonderful characters, with Hatcher really doing double and triple-duty with her vocal talents. Fanning on the other hand, fleshes out a character that seemed rather dull in Gaiman's work. Her voice gives Coraline the life that I didn't think was possible.One unsung hero (along with the countless animators who will be passed over in the press junkets) is the composer, Bruno Corlais. Mr. Corlais had never crossed my ears until the screening, but his music lends a touch of brilliance to the film, and makes it seem almost like a European production. Growing up in he US in the early 80's, I saw a number of stop-motion productions from Europe that played on the Nickelodeon show 'Pinwheel.' Corlais' music just transported me to that simpler of times when music didn't need to be 'commercial.' His score really helps to establish the world as well, and uses some instruments that may sound foreign to American ears.And if anyone is questioning if the 3-D is worth it-it is! This isn't the fly-in-your-face #-D that was seen 2-3 decades ago. It's subtler, but gives dimension to the miniature world of 'Coraline.' I think if you showed this film to a child in 3-D, they'd go home dreaming of creating their own little worlds of stop-motion puppets.For the year 2009, 'Coraline' so far (as of 2/6/09), is my first enjoyable film experience. I'm hoping my other upcoming film hopefuls (Watchmen, Up, Transformers 2) will also make me feel as positive.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another New Standard In Artwork,"Well, it's happened again: another animated movie that can I describe ""the greatest-looking animation I've ever seen!"" (This has happened several times now in the past few years, and especially when them available on a stunning Blu-Ray disc transfer).You literally have to see this animation to believe it.....and I'm talking about the 2-D, not the 3-D (which is not even in the same ballpark.) Forget the 3-D glasses and watch this as you would any other movie....and get the Blu-Ray, if you can. You'll be extremely impressed at the colors and detail, and just plain blown away by it all.Not only to the colors and detail dazzle, but the inventiveness here is really fun to watch and items change from one form or color to another. It reminded me of the Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"" but with more sophisticated art.....but the same cleverness.To me, all of this made the story almost secondary but the latter is very interesting, too. The story is unique; quite different, with a good message getting everything you want not always being as attractive as that sounds. Once ""Coraline"" meets here ""other"" parents, you'll really get hooked into this strange story filled with weird images and characters.I only wish the Coraline had been a little bit nicer kid since it's easier to root for someone when they're likable but the story should keep you guessing and in suspense. That made the last half of the film very easy to get engrossed in because so many bizarre things happen here, you don't know how it's all going to end. Thus, I found myself not being concerned about her personality flaws. The minor characters in this story, by the way: such as ""Mr. Bobinsky,"" ""Miss Forcible"" and ""Miss Spink"" - are a real hoot.I'd say this film is more for adults than kid, especially if one appreciates great artwork and creativity.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderfully atmospheric with exquisite visuals,"Adapted from Neil Gaimon's book, comes Coraline, a truly wonderful animated film with lots going for it. The atmosphere was wonderful, people may find it too dark, but I for one loved how dark it was. And of course the visuals are absolutely exquisite, I loved the backgrounds, character designs and the darkly bold colours. The music is nice and quirky while having an appropriate atmosphere, while the script is intelligent and well balanced and the story is well paced and compelling with very few dull moments. The characters are great, I love Coraline especially because she is very inquisitive, and I like that in a protagonist, and the voice acting is superb especially from Dakota Fanning and Keith David. Overall, loved the atmosphere, loved the visuals, loved the flick. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dark and inventive film even if it is perhaps too scary for particularly young children who will not understand the context and only see images,"I had not heard of the book on which this film is based but the involvement of Selick was enough to convince me that it was worth a look even before the uniform spread of five star reviews of it starting appearing in the media. I wanted to see it even more when some of the same media outlets starting having ""complaints"" from parents who had taken their toddlers to an animated film safe in the knowledge that NOBODY had ever, ever made an animated film that wasn't aimed at toddlers. Well, actually it turns out that, as well as countless other films, this is not a film for very young children – by which I mean children who are not yet old enough to be able to cope with a narrative and be able to take their heads into a story, there is not a specific age on that, which is why generally one expects parents to do the job of weighing that up on behalf of the humans they created.As I'm not a parent I'll not pretend to be able to advise others but I certainly know that the film will scare kids because it is dark enough to make me enjoy it on that level as an adult. This is not to say that it is not a family film though because outside of those being overly protective, this is the modern equivalent of a Gothic fairytale or a ghost story around a campfire – something that will chill and grip a child with a fear but not to the point where reason or hope goes out the window. As such it is a great film because the story is strong at the core with an engaging scenario that reminds me of the ""ideal"" world of David Lynch, where the darkness is only just below the surface. So it is for Coraline where the supposedly perfect family behind the door turns out to be much more sinister. Throughout the telling the delivery makes it fun and engaging – with a patient pace that isn't ever slow but never seems to be rushing things. The ""message"" isn't rammed down our throats but is there for children old enough to think through what they are watching.Although I didn't see it in 3D the film still manages to look great. Whether it is the warmth and softness of the perfect family home, the weird and wonderful creatures or the effects in the later reveals of the ""other"" mother. It all looks great with the animation being technically impressive but the imagination also being a big part of it. Some of the images will be too dark for younger children but, aside from providing age-appropriate scares for older children, it is well pitched. The voice work helps things without being particularly distracting in the way that some of the ""who is that"" voice work in other animated films can be. Fanning seems to have gotten past her precocious-sounding stage and does a solid turn in the title character. Hatcher is better though, capturing sweetness while being sinister and easily being evil later. Saunders, French, Hodgman, David and McShane all do good turns but again do so without being themselves, if you know what I mean.Coraline is not for everyone and should certainly not be seen as being for all ages simply because it is animated. It is an engagingly dark fantasy with content and imagery that provides an effective Gothic fairy tale for those older children able to process it beyond what they see. Of course it is another sign of quality that, in the absence of any child of any age, adults can still easily enjoy it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Dark and Creepy,"When Coraline moves to an old house, she feels bored and neglected by her parents. She finds a hidden door with a bricked up passage. During the night, she crosses the passage and finds a parallel world where everybody has buttons instead of eyes, with caring parents and all her dreams coming true. When the Other Mother invites Coriline to stay in her world forever, the girl refuses and finds that the alternate reality where she is trapped is only a trick to lure her.""Coraline"" is a dark and creepy animation that follows the style of Tim Burton in ""Corpse Bride"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" with non- likable characters. In addition, there is no subtle message for children. Therefore, it seems to be primarily recommended to adult audiences. The nightmarish environment is supported by awesome cinematography and a great music score. None of the characters is totally likable .My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Coraline""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fascinating visuals and imaginative film making.,"Coraline is a film released in 2009 and directed by Henry Selick, who is famous for ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (1993). Coraline uses an animation technique called stop motion (stop frame), where it manipulates photographic subjects such as clay dolls or stuffed animals by moving them one frame at a time, so that it appears as if they move by themselves. The expressions of characters are rich like a human being.The story starts off with an old house where Coraline moves in with her parents. Coraline finds no interest in the house, has no friends, and feels neglected by her parents. While she is looking around the house, she finds a small door blocked by a brick. However, only during her sleep, she goes through the door into another world, where another nice mother and father look after her. The ""other"" parents look the same as her real parents and they are way too nice for Caroline, except that they have button eyes. When she realizes what the other mother wants, she tries to escape from other mother's desire in the evil world and fights with the other mother in order to get her back to the reality.Overall, the visuals of the film were imaginative and fascinating, but the story was still one you can predict. And this film is easily compared with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which is better. So, I would say, this film is not something you want to watch in a theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Coraline was an interesting, if not truly thrilling, suspenseful stop-motion animated film","With Henry Selick as the director, you know, the man behind Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, I expected a special treat when I watched Coraline especially in 3-D. Don't get me wrong, I did like the images that were presented throughout the movie in the rare stop-motion animation style in an era where everything else that's animated is usually done by computer. And there were interesting characters that made one want to get involved for the whole picture. It's just that after a while, there seemed more style and not enough substance to really keep you involved in the story with your eyes and ears thinking awesome the whole time but your heart wondering if there could have been more to the characterizations. In fact, since this was based on a novel, I'm sure there were some cuts that had to be made to make a certain running time. But like I said, while there wasn't enough intensity to make this truly thrilling, Coroline still was pretty exciting at certain points and many young children watching this will not get bored when the climax comes. So on that note, I am recommending Coroline for animation buffs and anyone who doesn't mind if their under-12 children holds on to them for a while...",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Visually OK, Otherwise Weak","While the animation is quite good in spots, the film itself lacks warmth or chemistry. Much of the voice acting, particularly that of Dakota Fanning, is flat and sounds forced. While the 3D was interesting enough, several scenes felt like they'd been inserted for no other reason than to stick something in the audience's face. Example: the banana slug scene, which added nothing to either the story or character development. Parents should take note: many children under 9 or 10 in the theater in which I saw the film were scared to tears by the villain; I heard quite a few ""Mommy, I'm scared! I want to go!"" and similar complaints resulting in young children leaving the cinema. All in all, Coraline is visually nice, though not particularly noteworthy (old videos for the band Tool did better with the same sorts of material, for instance). The story is an interesting one, but this adaptation will likely leave most viewers over the age of 15 cold and those under 8 too scared to enjoy it. This is certainly nothing on par with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and even ""The Corpse Bride"" was a stronger animated film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An instant all-time favorite,"First off, the visuals in Coraline are absolutely, undeniably breathtaking. I managed to catch this film in 3D, and I have to say that I admire the way that it's used here, as it doesn't rely on constant ""flying off of the screen and into your face"" moments. In fact, this is probably the most effective 3D movie I've ever seen, right up there with 2007's Beowulf (which, coincidentally, was also co-written by Neil Gaiman). That said, I'm sure that Coraline looks almost just as beautiful in 2D, as nearly all of the environments are just so incredibly lush, and the ones that aren't are bizarre and spooky.Ontop of being one of the best 3D films I've ever seen, this is also one of the scariest animated films - period - that I've watched. Seriously, there were several kids in the audience screaming during the movie's opening credits (which involves a cloth doll having her innards removed and replaced by The Other Mother, and is definitely one of the more creepishly enjoyable moments of the film). I'm not sure if I would recommend Coraline to anyone under the age of 6.As far as the story and characters go, and for somebody who hasn't read the book, I was thoroughly impressed. It's an involving, sophisticated fairytale with a ton of heart, and one that I'm sure a lot of adults will enjoy. Ontop of Coraline being such a lovable protagonist, The Other Mother is brilliantly frightening in all of her forms, rivaling some of the best animated villains before her. Another one of my favorite characters was The Cat (voiced excellently by Keith David), who is used as a great ""tool"" near the end of the film. XD About the only problem that I had was that Coraline's real parents treat her with such disdain throughout the beginning of the movie. Again, even as somebody who hasn't read the book (though now I'm really wanting to), I still felt that that was a little...off.Overall, Coraline is an excellent work of art that surpassed most of my already high expectations. Seriously, go out and see this movie, folks - in 2D or 3D. I'll definitely be seeing it at least a few more times while it's still in theaters.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Classic Masterpiece.,"From the magic that perfect stop motion effects bring the audience, to the fusion created by the reality projected by a typical little girl, who lives with the illusion of a fantasy world that completely envelopes you, CORALINE stands, thusly, as a TRUE classic animated movie creation. Perhaps the first time you watch this movie, you might perceive a basic story about a girl whose parents don't really pay her enough attention. But after a series of events she learns the value of the family she has. After having the opportunity to watch this movie more than once or twice, you enter a universe with infinite possibilities for understanding the development of the story. So, every time you watch CORALINE, you are going to find out new things about the comportment of the characters, and some scenes that may seem ""irrelevant"", but take on the importance they deserve upon deeper analysis. You can create different hypotheses about the story threads, and maybe the ending just isn't what you imagined. You can compare this movie to any quotidian situation and that will help you realize that we each have a lot in life, yet we are blind to so many of the simple things. CORALINE provides us the opportunity to experience a new ideal life that we could look forward to, but that we just maintain as an imaginary ideal world in our mind. CORALINE has more cryptic story threads than you might notice in a first viewing. Your perception of the characters will probably change...Perhaps they aren't who they seem at first glance!

However, this is not a criticism for the permission to go a little deeper and darker allows the filmmakers to present the audience with a unique animation with a great adventure. Of course, I would not advise young children to watch this for it is pretty dark for them and some scenes may be a bit too much for them but for older children, teens and adults, they will be able to handle what ""Coraline"" has to offer. The titular character goes on a journey to appreciate her family and the real world. A lot of great, amusing characters and a great adventure. It is unusual and twisted but it's still a great watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Boring, then Horrifying.","I am a fan of the new wave of 3D films that are getting released now a days, and this is honestly why I didn't walk out of Coraline. The first 2/3rds of this film are absolutely dreadful, nothing happens, the story goes from one disjointed vignette to another. All of the characters are annoying, absolutely no one you could cheer for in the bunch.Then, it becomes the most horrifying film I've seen since the Excorsist. I mean truly disturbing, a couple of weeks ago I saw My Bloody Valentine in 3D. I think a small kid, 10 or 11 years old, has a better chance of watching that one and not have night mares. I honestly may have nightmares after watching this thing. Which is why I give it a 5, if the last third had been like the first two thirds I'd be giving it a 2, and 1.5 of that would be for the 3D.The only film to come close to being as disturbing as this one in the past 30 years is Hostle, but believe me, this one is worse.So, to sum up, boring as hell, cool 3D, deeply disturbing.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline Review (Spoilers),"Before I begin my review, I would like to say that just because this is animated, it isn't exactly for little kids. Also I will be revealing some spoilers.Coraline is a masterpiece. Directed by Henry Selick (Nightmare Before Christmas) the film was released in 2009 to positive reviews and was a success.The film's animation is absolutely amazing. Seriously, there is so much attention to detail in this film, and it blew my mind! The character designs are very good as well.The story follows Coraline Jones, an extremely bratty girl who discovers a small door in her new home that leads to a parallel universe. The inhabitants have button eyes to top it off, and if that's not creepy enough, it turns out this amazing world is just a trap.This film is creepy. If you have young kids who are scared easily, please watch it before you show them. It's just a very creepy film, and can be very scary.Overall, I love Coraline and it will remain one of my favorites for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"2d is beautiful, 3d is full immersion!!!","To watch this movie in 2d is to watching the 7 star version. To watch in 3d on a 65 inch Panasonic Plasma 3d TV and the 3d BluRay version DVD is mind blowing and a feast for not only the eyes but for touch...yes, some of the scenes were done so well it felt like you could reach out and touch them in my living room. I would say they were even better than Avatars 3d which up to this point I thought was the most spectacular...but this stuff is just so good, so real, a whole different kind of TV. 2D Blu Ray even though it's super sharp, super colorful, just cannot compare to the added visual power of 3D and that's where the movie takes off...forget the storytelling, forget the characters, even though many were quite interesting, and sit back and enjoy immersion TV...some day they will make a 3d movies were the story is equal to or better than the visuals and then it will be a new dawn in television.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Could watch this over and over again,"One of my most watched films as a kid, and happy to say it never gets old. This film, based off the book, tells the story of a little girl named Coraline, voiced by Dakota Fanning, who moves with her family to a new home. When exploring the house, she stumbles upon a small door that it blocked off by bricks. Later that night she is woken to find the small door open and leading to another side. After crossing the portal, she meets her ""other parents''. This secondary world is wonderful at first but isn't what it seems.I am a fan of thriller and horror, if done correctly. Every aspect of this film was done correctly. You're set in this eerie tone right from the start. The soundtrack adds a ton too. It is mostly a simple humming that carries the character's journey. As the story progresses, the music becomes more intense. I also enjoy stop- motion animation. It is so original and fits perfectly with this story.The character designs are spot on. My favorite character is ""The Other Mother"" or the ""Beldam"" depends on where you are in the film. She is just creepy as hell and gives you the vibe that something is off. And yet, she is able to lure you in and gain your trust. Her design also changes like a shape shifter as the story unfolds. There is so much more lore than I knew existed about this character and story overall.In a way, the Beldam reminds me of the Pennywise character from the ""IT"" franchise. Keep in mind this is all a kids movie.The film is here to teach our protagonist a lesson about the value of family and taking things for granted. Coraline starts off as an ungrateful child, who is resentful of her parents. She later is handed with everything she can dream of, and still it isn't enough. Only when losing what she holds dear most, she is able to overcome the Beldam.I love this film so much. Its mixture of horror elements with a heart warming story. From the atmosphere and tone, to the animation and score. The characters are all voiced acted superbly. This being a kids movie does not take away the enjoyment from adults. It is a lot deeper that comes to the eye and is a thrill of a watch every time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too scary for anyone under 12.,"This is a beautifully-drawn and imagined world. However, the 'other' world Coraline finds herself in is actually quite terrifying to children.

"Gorgeous animation, but the plot was a little choppy","despise the fact that I am a stop motion freak and am dieing to buy this movie on DVD, I can easily see why someone would dislike Coraline. The film is definitely worth watching and I would never say it's bad or OK. I would say it's a pretty good film, but the whole film just feels like it's a short story with one or two creative concepts with a bunch of uninteresting aspects added so the movie wouldn't be too short.I watched this movie with really high expectations, which is probably why I was slightly disappointed at the end. I was mostly disappointed that the best scenes in the whole movie were spoiled in the trailer. If you watch the film and than watch the trailer you can tell they had to spoil the best parts of the film in order for the trailer to get you interested in the movie. For those that have not seen the movie and have not seen the trailer, I warn you not to watch the trailer, it will make the movie much more interesting and unpredictable if you don't.The plot seems to have a pattern where basically two ideas in the movie are repeated constantly through half of the movie. I wish they added something to the plot that made you more interested in the constantly repeating ideas. I can see they tried to do that a little but it didn't do well enough.There is something about the pace that bothers me also. The movie is too fast pace in some scenes.Coraline is one of those films that has it's best moments in the middle of the movie. Unfortunately the exciting middle is TOO much more interesting than the beginning and end. So after the exciting middle was over I didn't really feel very interested in how the movie was ending, the last 20 minutes of the movie just seem like it was something they made up at the last minute so the movie wouldn't have an ending that comes too soon.The music and animation really keep this movie on it's stand. I love the music at the main titles, it's creepy but relaxing at the same time. The end credits is like a fast moving energetic version of the main titles. Coraline isn't a musical, but it does have two short songs, which works perfectly for the movie. The animation is the best thing about the whole movie, which is probably why the movie doesn't have that good of a story. The story was okay but just by a few points I would sadly have to put Coraline in the category of ""movies that focus too much more on animation than the story"". However, it's well worth watching just to see the amazing images and flawless stop motion.So all in all, worth seeing. Just keep low on the expectations and avoid seeing the trailer.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline - A Darkly Whimsical Masterpiece of Stop-Motion Animation,"""Coraline"" is a visually stunning and darkly whimsical stop-motion masterpiece. Directed by Henry Selick and based on Neil Gaiman's novel, it follows Coraline Jones, a curious young girl who discovers a secret door in her new home. Through it, she finds an alternate reality that seems perfect at first but hides a sinister secret. With its imaginative storytelling, beautiful animation, and eerie atmosphere, ""Coraline"" is a captivating adventure that appeals to both children and adults alike. As Coraline delves deeper into this other world, she must summon all her courage to save herself and her family from its evil clutches. The film's richly detailed animation, coupled with its hauntingly beautiful score, creates an unforgettable cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visually stunning and intriguing: A review of the movie Coraline,"I recently had the chance to watch the movie Coraline, and it was an enjoyable experience. The animators have done a fantastic job with the animation, and it was a visual treat to watch. The story was dark and intriguing, and the well-developed characters made it easy for me to connect with them. The voice acting was exceptional, and it added a layer of depth to the characters.However, a few shortcomings kept it from being a perfect movie. Some slow moments dragged on too long, and it became tedious to sit through them. Additionally, some parts of the story felt predictable, and I could guess what would happen next. I think they could have expanded the ending to provide more development and a more satisfying conclusion.I recommend watching Coraline to anyone who enjoys dark fantasy movies. Although it has challenges, it's worth watching, especially if you appreciate beautiful animation and well-developed characters. Overall, I would give Coraline a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Coraline is an imaginative, creepy, and wholly unique animated experience.","Animation is a contentious medium. Some consider it to be exclusively for children, while others insist that it can appeal just as much to adults, if not more so. Personally, I agree with the latter, and I can offer films like Waltz with Bashir and Grave of the Fireflies as examples. Coraline, from the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas, is a film that I feel bridges the gap between children's entertainment and adults' art especially well. On the one hand, it is a stop motion feature about a young girl who discovers a fantasy world from inside her home, but on the other, it has garnered huge critical praise, and almost anyone who sees the film as a child is completely terrified by it. Who is it made for, then? I'd say that it's for exactly the person who wants to watch it.Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) has just moved with her family to Oregon from her home in Michigan. Her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) ignore her and spend their time writing for a gardening catalog, and the neighbors – an elderly pair of former actresses, a crazy man who claims to train mice for a circus, and a boy named Wyborne (he goes by ""Wybie"") who follows her around – are all a bit strange for her liking. In her new home, though, she finds a small door that leads to a world almost the same as her own, only better.Here, her parents pay loads of attention to her, the actresses are beautiful acrobats, her crazy neighbor actually has a circus of kangaroo mice, and Wybie can't talk! After a few trips to this world, she is just about ready to stay, until she hears the catch: she must gouge out her eyes and replace them with buttons. Her parents have also been captured, and so she must defeat the monstrous Beldam who controls the fantasy and set things back to the way they were.It isn't often that a movie captures me as fully as Coraline does. The characters, story, animation, music, overall design, and little details in the world and between characters all come together to create one of the most unique movies that I have ever seen. Coraline herself is a wonderful character, and we get to watch a bored girl with a poor attitude develop the strength to accept that while her world is not perfect, it is what she has, and she can love it for that.This film sets up its macabre and charming tone from the opening shots – under fairly creepy music a hand of needles empties a doll and builds a new one, before sending it floating out of a nearby window. For lovers of stop motion, Selick's past works, or creepy movies in general, this is one that simply can't be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Interesting, unique film","Coraline is not your average animated film. It is far darker than any animated film I've seen, definitely not for younger children. This film focuses on a pre-teen girl who has just recently moved to a new place with her parents. She discovers a new world where she has everything she could ever want. Wonderful nice parents, great food, beautiful surroundings.... She starts to visit this place regularly, through the little door in the house, and before too long, she begins to realize that this new place might not be so great after all. This place turns out to be a dark place full of trouble. I liked Dakota Fanning as the voice of Coraline, and I also liked Teri Hatcher as the voice of the mother. The animation is done well. The writing is fine, it's not great to be honest, but it's certainly not bad. It's just that I was expecting more than what I got. The plot was interesting, but I do think that the film had more potential. Overall, I suggest Coraline mildly, it's not the best but it's still pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hansel and Gretel without Hansel. And without imagination.,"* Just to get this out of the way: I did not view this in 3D, thus cannot comment on that aspect.When you go and see a PG-rated animate film, what do you expect? A few laughs, a fun main character, something to keep your kid's attention, a creative story, and, possibly, that nostalgic feeling of childish wonder. Fantasy writers seem to think they understand this wonder-filled feeling more than anyone else, and thus I've yet to see a single fantasy writer who didn't pump out a generic coming-of-age, horror-teamed, Disney Land-inspired children's book at least once before the end of their career. Neal Gaiman, the writer of the original Coraline children's book, is no exception. He's also no exception to the unwritten rule among such generic fantasy writers that this children's book that I just described has be as unoriginal and predicable as humanly possible, otherwise it's too much for the children reading it to comprehend. Or, more likely, they just lack a single creative idea within their heads. I've read a lot of Gaiman books before, and this lack of imagination seems to be something that is contentious among all his works. Simply put, I could write up a page-long list of other authors that pre-date Gaiman and write the exact same stories he does, and they all think they're oh-so-original. I can also come up with a page-long list of movies that pre-date Coraline, but tell the exact same story. Is it so much to ask for a little creativity these days?The setting for Coraline, the film, is completely generic for modern fairy tales like this. A big house. Coraline, the character, is also completely generic. An adventurous little girl with a slight punk edge. The secondary character, again, are all generic. Weird little boy, cat, unloving parents, fortunetelling old ladies, acrobatic old man. So, from the set-up alone, it's impossible to ignore how cliché and imaginationless Coraline, the film, really is. You've seen this a thousand times. You saw it with Alice in Wonderland, you saw it with Narnia, you saw it with The Corpse Bride . . . and if I had to, I could list at least thirty more. This is completely, wholesale unoriginal material, and that's apparent from the first five minutes.The story is even more generic. It's Hansel and Gretel, minus Hansel. The generic main character finds a wonderful place filled with everything she lacked at home, and then things go wrong. Oh my! Who would have guessed?! I realize I'm criticizing this movie from the point-of-view of the bitter old man that I am at heart, but even my little sister, who I took to see this, admitted Coraline was completely predictable and forgettable. It's exactly what you expect. If fantasy writers understand children as well as they think they do, then why don't they give them a little more credit that they know what stories are repeated to the point of nausea? Seriously. In my theater alone, I heard countless little kids telling their parents how bored they were. At least half the families there left the theater before the last thirty minutes. If you want horror-themed animated movies that aren't just rehashes of the same predictable plot, I suggest A Nightmare Before Christmas (obviously) and Monster House (severely underrated).Another problem with the boring factor. The movie repeats itself constantly, and you'll see the same exact scenes play out at least three times each by the closing credits. It drags on and on.Coraline does have some entertainment value, and I will give it that much credit. The first thirty minutes were very well-done, if not severely predictable, like the rest of the film. The animation is well-done, if not average for the bar set by Tim Burton animated movies. The animation does have a slight unique rag-doll quality that was pretty cute for the first ten minutes. Some of the sub-plots are very interesting to watch. But none of this makes this memorable. It will pass time without too much problem, but it's nothing you're going to remember the rest of your life, because, as I said, the story is so unoriginal.I realize this review is going to be unpopular, and, quite honestly, I don't care. I have standards, and I'm not going to lower them just because this is a children's film. I've seen countless children's films with originality and real imagination, but Coraline just doesn't have any. It's generic coming-of-age horror with a generic character and a generic moral that you've heard in fairy tales before you were old enough to talk. So, really, what's the big deal? What is everyone raving about? Even if you were to only focus on the positive, it's hard to ignore that hollow feeling in your gut. The one that comes when you realize the movie you think you enjoy is just another generic rehash. That certainly isn't the magical feeling you're supposed to get when you watch children's movies, now is it?3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Button Wholes,"I believe that the lucid imagination puts their own markers in the public conceptual landscape.Regular readers know that many of these for me are films that anchor personal structure. But I have some books that do this as well, and probably at a more fundamental level. One of these is ""Alice in Wonderland"" and it is a minor game to recognize that work in contemporary copies.This film is blatantly patterned after Alice. The two worlds, the vaginal transition. Mirrors, small doors. Animated flowers. Wicked queen. There's the business of returning to the origin by walking away and even the cat that advises. All of those bits are here, plus a dash of ""Pinocchio."" But there is another influence that may not be so obvious to you.I encountered a very special piece of stop-motion work a couple years ago: ""Blood Tea and Red String"" which is also derived from Alice, has this surrogate ragdoll notion and also supports a storyline of capture for love. The stylistic elements in this later project clearly were influenced by that film which I gave my highest rating. So in watching this, I touched two of my most important markers, plus having the folded notion of one world similar to the other, but more magical except for artificial eyes. Its an example of Ted's law, one which may help to extend or better understand it.The dimensionality of the thing — advertised heavily in my area — was trivial, uninteresting. It was a compelling show, owing to its structure. But you'll do better to go to the sources, I think.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
Darker animation the way Tim Burton would like,"I've heard of this film for a long while, but never had interest in watching. Only yesterday, with nothing else to do, I ended up seeing this story about Coraline, a young girl who feels ignored by her parents and enters a new world where apparently everything is perfect, the way she would like her world to be.But appearances can deceive...'Coraline' is far darker than your usual animated film. There is the distinct feel of a Tim Burton story and that is no coincidence: while he himself had nothing to do with this film, Henry Selick, who worked with him in 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach', is the one behind 'Coraline'.Unlike those two films, though, 'Coraline' actually managed to captivate me to an extent. The animation is faultless, and the story is deceptively dark yet charming. There is a good diversity of characters who are mostly very well thought-out, even if they tend to get too goofy once in a while (plus the rather pointless inclusion of Wybie, who does little for the film).Most children will not understand, or even notice, some of the darker implications the plot contains; meaning it can be enjoyed by both adults and children alike.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Darkness is not enough,"""Coraline"" has an appealing dark sensibility, and avoids the formulaic nature of so many popular films. But there's no point in being dark if you can't also be interesting, and even unpredictable films must make some sense in order to be satisfying.I haven't been this disappointed in a film in decades. It provided no dramatic momentum for ages; and even after the plot got going, none of the characters was likable enough to invest in. The three characters in peril are never really explained.The 3-D technology was wasted.The film carefully sets up a parallel universe, but then fails to make sense of the parallels, in that the parents are equally weighted in one world but wildly out of balance in the other, with no real reasoning for the discrepancy.Other reviewers praise this as a movie for ""kids who think,"" but it's more likely to be tolerated by the kind of kids who will stare at anything that passes before them. The ones who pay attention will be alternately bored, confused and creeped out. Others also praise the movie for being so ""visual,"" not noting how clumsy and redundant it is at delivering information visually and then again aurally -- the equivalent, for instance, of showing the handwritten note and then having a character read it out loud. A step backward for animated film.I did enjoy the voice work of Teri Hatcher, whose acting I have never had cause to notice before, and Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French did their best to drag in some entertainment, though their characters' voices could hardly match the less-enjoyable grotesque images.I have nothing against Neil Gaiman; I am a huge fan of ""Stardust.""

After four viewings, I can see this film is flawless. The story never gets dull or predictable. Every child can relate to the ""grass is always greener"" syndrome and every adult can relate to being a child. The dialog is so sharp it hurts. The voice actors are astounding. The animation is the best I have ever seen next to Little Price and that comparison is not fair but that specific film did not exist in 2009. (It was released in 2015).I loved the cat. This could be the only film in history that not only has a cat co-star but the cat always acts ... like a cat.I will see this film several more times in the years ahead.

Imaginative creepy,"Coraline is a blue haired girl who moves into an old house with her parents. Her parents are busy writing and can't be bothered by her. She's restless and bored.

Following some mice in the night, she finds the door mysteriously opened onto a portal to a copy of the world except better. She finds her parents are more attentive with buttons instead of eyes. She finds the world full of color and magic and everything is what she hoped for in the real world.If there is one problem in this movie, it's that Coraline is a bit of brat especially with her parents. She doesn't treat the neighbor boy Wybie that well either. However the Other world is just so infinitely fascinating and at the same time creepy.

There's no place like home.,"If Edward Gorey's American Gothic could be married to Tim Burton's ghoulishness, then what would emerge would be Caroline, a film with the demanding psychology of Neil Gaiman's prose married to the wild imagination of James and the Giant Peach's convoluted film director, Henry Selick.Yes, 3-D-stop animation Coraline is not for everyone, but aficionados of the eccentric should love the complicated story of a young girl, Caroline Jones (Dakota Fanning) thrust Alice-in-Wonderland style into a parallel universe where the mother ( Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) she might have thought she wanted are nightmarish knockoffs she needs to run from.Although the film shows how Caroline, and by extension all children, must have wit and courage to fight the forces of evil, it also emphasizes the need to accept the eccentricities and remoteness of nerdy, bright parents who may have their own demons to fight before the end of the day. The Wizard of Oz in spirit influences this film with the parallel universe motif of characters patterned out of real life and the universal message about the goodness of going home.This sometimes macabre and challenging animation is mostly not for children and a puzzler for adults who may not want to be challenged at a time when they struggle with financial monsters threatening their real homes.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Visually Stunning, this film is definitely meant for the 3D screen","I went into Coraline hoping for an enjoyable film, but not particularly expecting a masterpiece. I'm a Neil Gaimon fan, but in my opinion the majority of his talent isn't in producing something amazing, but in not producing stuff that's bad. Previous films I've seen based on his books have been charming, creative and fun, but nothing has really been breathtaking.That being said, Coraline is more of the same. Which isn't to say I don't fully recommend it.This film is absolutely pleasurable to the eyes and ears, particularly in 3D. It's soundtrack is surprisingly lovely and dreamlike and the animation is gorgeous. Like most things written by Neil Gaimon it's very imaginative and charming, as well as bizarre and creepy at times.However, like most things based on stories by Neil Gaimon it does seem to have a slightly weak story. Although the visuals flow beautifully the story doesn't. It starts off fine, if not a bit predictably, but seems to almost get lost a bit as it goes along. It's also a bit anticlimactic.I still think it's one of the better animated films I've seen in theaters as of late and it is magnificent in 3D. I'll probably go see it again.

My seven-year-old left the theater in tears and didn't want to sleep by himself. Because of the depth of the action sequences and the rich textures in the animation, it's too much for some younger viewers to handle.Second, what in the world is up with the big-breasted naked woman??? That was traumatic, even to me! I can't believe this got a PG rating, knowing that young children were going to be drawn to it. I'm no prude, but that was not something I wanted to expose a seven-year-old and a 13-year-old boy to. Especially in 3D.Third, the mechanics of the plot were never really revealed. Why buttons? I left the movie with more questions than I had going into it.Overall, this was just not a good movie-going experience and I wish I hadn't wasted the money on it.

The black buttons Mom and Dad 2.0 have in place of their eyes. Maybe it is a bit yucky. Only now, Other Mom's insisting that Coraline has the same operation. And when she resists, things suddenly turn very nasty. As that mysterious talking cat (Keith David) warned her all along, ""You probably think this is a dream come true - but you're wrong."" And when Mom No.2 transforms into the awful spider-hag we guessed she was all along, Coraline must get herself, her real parents and some other trapped souls the heck out of this poisoned domain, before her eyes get poked out with sewing needles. Button Moon it ain't.This reviewer bows to nobody in their admiration for the works of Neil Gaiman, from the 'Sandman' saga to 'Stardust'. Though some may quibble that Coraline hasn't an original bone in its body - referencing everything from The Wizard Of Oz to Snow White's witch-queen and Alice's enchanted gardens (along with many elements from Gaiman's own Sandman novels) - there's only a handful of plots in this world, and the wise ones know it's all in the telling.As a weaver of myths and spinner of stories, then, Gaiman is at the top of his game, man. Director Henry Selick isn't exactly a slouch either when it comes to fashioning astounding vistas. Contrary to popular belief (and its, er, title) Tim Burton didn't actually direct Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - it was Selick; another ex-Disney animator like Burton, and the chap behind the James and the Giant Peach adaptation.As expected - but even exceeding expectations - Coraline, the longest stop-animation feature to date, and the first to be shot in 3D, is technically brilliant. From the minute curl of an eyebrow to the sheen of dust on a window, the gilding and frosting is unprecedented. If the set-pieces (including that enchanted garden with its snapping snapdragons and praying mantis tractor) overwhelm with their ingenuity, the sideshows featuring Coraline's bizarre neighbours are hardly less impressive: a phantasmagorical big top of circus mice; a bawdy burlesque voiced by our own French and Saunders, featuring lithe young trapezists bursting through the skins of old ladies with bosoms like gas balloons, for an audience of flying Scottie dogs wearing harnesses of angels wings. It's a stream of consciousness turned loopy, feral and dangerous.And Coraline is terrifying. Unlike, say, WALL-E, which also springs from an essentially depressing set-up, this film isn't interested in charming your socks off. Like its eponymous heroine, it knows exactly who it is, and if you don't care for it, you can go to blazes. Or Hannah Montana: The Movie. Coraline has no warmth, no charm, no cheer - and it likes it like that. Its primary purpose is to make you crawl under a popcorn box, or tickle the same part of the brain that likes tiptoeing down the creaky cellar stairs - then bolting up the same.Why? Because kids can't get enough of it. Because, in the face of all currently received wisdom and advice - the kind of stultifying over-cautiousness that led to the likes of March Of The Penguins being saddled with a 'mild peril' warning - kids love 'icky stuff' and they love being scared out of their wits. As Gaiman argues, and everyone from Angela Carter to the Brothers Grimm would surely agree with him, this is healthy stuff, an important part of a child's development.Much less healthy, in fact, is the presence of local boy Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr), short for ""Why Be Born?"" of all the lovely things - a totally unnecessary addition to the source. In the original, Coraline calls on every ounce of her own courage and initiative to defeat the button-eyed 'Beldam'. Here, it's the otherwise entirely useless Wybie who saves the day, as if a mere girl couldn't be trusted to be self-sufficient. It all seems horribly representative of an increasingly reactionary, anti-feminist stance in American-made dramas, and which now appears to have extended its pernicious reach to family cartoons.The much-vaunted 3D is similarly problematic. Coraline's palate is vivacious and bright, but those dull grey glasses automatically cast a pall over proceedings, rendering clear scenes gloomy and muddy: a truly crackpot interference. Sure, it's meant to be dark, but not like this. The technology isn't nearly exploited enough anyway: after a tease of an opener in which sewing needles are perilously thrust towards the eyes, it consequently drops in and out, so that you might find yourself constantly taking the glasses off and on to get the most out of the picture. To be continually reminded of a technical process is not exactly ideal for such a supposedly immersive feature. But perhaps it should have dispensed with it altogether; Coraline's world is audacious enough on its own terms without further feathers and bells and whistles.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredible. Best movie I've seen for ages.,"A girl discovers a universe where her parents treat her like a Queen but all is not as it seemsVoiced by Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, John Hodgman and Robert Bailey JrWritten by Neil Gaiman (Novel)Screenplay written by and also directed by Henry SelickAt last a great movie!The whole thing is just incredible from the story to the voice actors to the unbelievably good animation. Right from the beginning credits ( which are superb by the way) this movie sucks you in and it doesn't matter how old you are. Neil Gaiman is gaining a top class reputation as a writer and this has all the hallmarks of his imagination. I haven't read the book or most of his books, so I don't know how it compares to the novel, but this works brilliantly as a movie in it's own right.I am in my forties but I enjoyed this movie just as much as any kid would. In my opinion it manages to create a magical world within a magical world much better than anything I've seen from the hands of Tim Burton or anybody else.It's fun and totally hypnotizing.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One Extraordinary Stop Motion Film,"Coraline is one of the biggest highlights of a stop motion animated film. It plays out being an extraordinary stop motion animated film that demonstrates expectations and reality and give it a horror twist to make the movie engaging and worth it. The story is very unpredictable, the characters give out great personalities both the real world and the buttoned world, the horror aspect is thrilling, and the animation is amazing that makes the movie both fun and scary. This movie is a must watch for not only stop motion fans, but even those that would like to experience an animated horror film. I know it is rare we would get those, and this one is definitely it. Not only is this one of the best stop motion animated films, but one of the best movies Liaka has produced. This is one dream world that is worth exploring.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
dark . and  useful,"a dark film. creepy, seductive, far to be comfortable but useful. because its theme is one of the most common in every day reality. parents too busy, solitude of a child, temptation of alternatives who, at the first sigh, seems be ideal. Coraline is special for the exploration of well known cultural references and, in same measure, for the science of detail. because it is a film about illusions. a film for adults because it reminds more than presents. because it is an ironic portrait of a society for who to escape from yourself is more interesting than to live.in same measure, it is a beautiful animation. and this is one of the basic motifs to see it. because it has the gift to present the ordinaries details in the perfect light.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Great visual experience, but...one-dimensional point","I was very pleased to see this movie, because it has the same visual effect as many master-pieces of Tim Burton. And I was not disappointed about that segment of movie. Also, the music fits perfectly and gives the right sense of atmosphere during the whole movie.But, unfortunately, in the end, we got just one-way-message... to the kids. It made me wonder something about most modern parents and how they treat their children. It is obvious that they have to work to provide good life for their kids. So, it means, there is no specific ""punishment"" or valuable lessons for them because they simply have to do their jobs. I think that's very important for all parents to spend time with their children even when they have to work. But, in this movie, we have the opposite situation. The kid will learn the valuable lesson, but not the parents. They will survive the same situation as the kid, but in the end, they won't be even aware of anything they passed through, I think that screenwriter could find much more realistic solution both-for the kid and the parents.After all... could have been better-7",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Eerie without the feel,"Henry Selick is a stupendously imaginative film artist. His stop motion movies are pure eye candy, full of magical and bizarre settings and characters. Coraline takes it all even further. It is a beautiful, surprisingly colorful world filled with incredible set pieces and settings. There are some slight annoyances, like some over animated characters that have just too many moves or facial expressions. I'm not quite sure how to elaborate on this, but when, for example, Caroline follows every single word with whole range of different facial expressions, just so we could gasp some more at the animators brilliance, she loses some part of her character in the process. But, that is not the main problem of this film.Main problem of the film is the screenplay. I have come to know Neil Gaiman primarily through his Sandman comics, and one thing I can say about him, is that he is too imaginative for his own good. Every single story line he wrote in there was brilliantly simple to start with, full of eerie, magical mythology and characters, some very, very nice fantasy for young adults. But then, he would continue on, and stuff every story with just to much intellectual mambo-jumbo. He would put artificially intellectual words into characters mouths just so readers would go on and say: woow, this guy is really well read. And I am aware that some teenage emo girl will fall in love with this paper thin kind of intellectual snobism that is wrapped in eeriness and cool blackness, but in all honesty, it is quite tiresome after some time.And that is true in Coraline's case. Story line is fantastically beautiful on paper, girl finds a door in her house, door leads to ""other family"" with buttons for eyes, cats can talk and she is surrounded with nice and yet creepy characters. There isn't much for an older viewer to appreciate apart from visuals. Coraline herself is somewhat annoying character, you don't quite care for her, and all the wacky characters don't serve much purpose. Of course there is some Shakespeare quoting thrown here or there (it is a Gaiman story after all), just so older viewers could think that they are watching something deep, and that is not quite the case. Movie is trying really hard, but, once again, apart from brilliant visuals, there isn't much going on here. Even though there is something going on all the time. It is quite a feat, I must admit.And, as always with this kind of movies, little details are it's best part. Is it the piano that plays the father or angel dogs, it is little things that Gaiman always excels at, and Selick really lifts it way up high.All in all, this is a poor man's Alice in wonderland, minus the genuine originality and plus forced eeriness and narrative spices without flavor. It is not bad by a long shot, but I kind of feel that this movie should be watched inside it's young teenage target audience to really be accepted as a masterpiece. And I know if I was fifteen right now, that I would be in love with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Lack Luster Emotionless Film,"Coraline starts off fast and ends rather quick. The voice over work didn't reel anyone of the 250 people in the theater into the story or character. Sure the kids enjoyed it, but kids today also enjoy cartoon network shows.....This movie had alright visuals and a rather cheap and shallow plot. It throws you in and your only ankle deep. Yawns broke out early and the whole time we all thought....when will this get good? It never happened. The whole climax near the end came way to quick, there was no DEPTH at all.Sadly this is a huge let down, I expected more from the director of A Nightmare Before Christmas.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant animation,"Having seen ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" many times and loving every minute of it I was keen to see Henry Selick's latest stop-go animation story. When I learnt that the film was based on a book by Neil Gaiman I was even more certain that I would enjoy it. When I watched ""Coraline"" I was not disappointed in the slightest. I hadn't seen a 3D film since the awful Jaws 3D so wasn't sure how the 3D would work here, thankfully it felt immersive rather than just having the occasional item appear to jump out the screen. Watching on DVD meant wearing red/green glasses which obviously had an effect on the colour of the film, while many colours appeared washed out others appeared much more intense such as Coraline's blue hair and yellow coat. Thankfully this just had the effect of making the film slightly more creepy.The heroine of this film is the eponymous Coraline, her family have moved from Michigan to rural Oregon. She is bored there and her parents are too busy to do anything with her. While exploring the old house they have moved into she finds a small door; at first it is bricked up but later as she is asleep it opens, she wakes up and follows a mouse through the door. When she get to the other side she finds herself in what appears to me her own house but it isn't quite the same, everything is slightly better. When she goes downstairs she finds her mother cooking, at least she thinks it is her mother till she turns around and reveals that instead of eyes she has two black buttons. After initial concern she begins to love the new world and is tempted to stay until she learns what the price of staying is... to have her eyes replaced with buttons. Things then get creepier as her ""other mother"" is determined that Coraline will stay.As one would expect from the creator of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" the animation is fantastic, be warned though this is a much darker story which parents might want to watch before letting younger children view it, while many children will delight in its creepiness others might have nightmares. The voice cast did a fine job notably Dakota Fanning as Coraline, Teri Hatcher as her mother and French and Saunders as the two ex-burlesque dancers who live downstairs. I certainly recommend this film for adults and most children, just remember it might be a bit scary for very young or timid children.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Show to young children at your discretion,"This film is legitimately terrifying. I'm 14 now, so when I watched Coraline I was only about 7 years old. I'm very sensitive to horror anyway, so my 7 year old mind was severely affected by the movie. I had nightmares for weeks. Having said that, this movie is absolutely amazing. A dark, gritty plot, superb animation, excellent voice casting and a strong message are some of the things that make 'Coraline' a must for any child who enjoys a good scare and a guaranteed good time for adults and teenagers. If I hadn't been practically traumatised at 7 years old by it, this would probably be one of, if not my favourite animated movies. It's one of those movies that you feel compelled to call a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The creepiest PG movie ever,"Since the Brothers Grimm penned their morbid fairy tales (and probably before), children and adults have escaped into fantasy to safely explore the dangers of reality. Tales such as Hansel and Gretel, and in the last century The Wizard of Oz, have provided imaginative worlds with dangers at every turn. The purpose of such tales was always to warn, educate, and provide a backdrop for moral instruction.Such is true of Coraline, a cinematic fairy tale crafted by writer Neil Gaiman and director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas). Based on a book by Gaiman, this visually astounding stop-motion masterpiece is a reminder that not all fairy tales have wistful princesses and happy musical numbers (sorry, Disney). This is a return to the creepy morality tales of yore, and while young children may have nightmares from the unsettling mood and tone, older children and adults will likely delight in both its imagination and its message.Coraline's title character is a plucky and resilient child (expertly voiced by Dakota Fanning) who has moved to a dusty, lonely old house in Washington with her parents. Both are neglectful in their own way: her father is caring enough, but is constantly aloof, while her mother (voiced by Teri Hatcher) is so busy that she hardly notices her daughter, and is often annoyed by her when she does.One night, Coraline discovers a portal into a parallel existence: same house, same parents, but here everything is exactly as she wishes it were in reality. The dreariness of her true home is replaced by vibrant colors and spectacle. Her neglectful parents are replaced by updated versions who live only to lavish her with affection and wish-fulfillment. Soon Coraline begins to greatly prefer the alternate life to her actual one. It's all seems perfect, but she (and the audience) cannot shake the unsettling suspicion that something isn't quite right. Only a sage old black cat (who is realistically silent in the ""real world,"" but suavely vocal in other) seems to understand the dangers behind the seductive facade of Coraline's dream world.To say more would be to ruin the surprises, but suffice to say that the film contains excellent messages for those who look for discussion points to share with their children afterward. The dream world serves as a perfect metaphor for the cunningly disguised lies of harmful people, as well their tactics of using subtle counterfeits to grant people's wishes in the short run, while slowly entangling (and later chaining) them in the long run.As my mother always said: ""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."" With regards to Coraline's dream parents, they may be seen as a practical warning against slick strangers who might lure children away by promising them exactly what they want (much like the ""candy man"" character in Chitty Chitty Bang-Bang). The black cat, whose warnings initially go unheeded, may be seen to serve a similar purpose to parents, friends, and teachers. He is a wise, caring character who sees and understands things that the protagonist does not yet comprehend, tries to keep her from harm, and helps her when she is in peril.Furthermore, the film not only reminds parents of the need to give their children attention and affection, but also helps children understand the stresses of parenting and the need for gratitude for the parents they do have.In addition to serving as a lasting morality tale, Coraline is a terrific artistic achievement. While computer-generated animation is en vogue at the moment, the terrific and nearly seamless stop-motion animation here is something different and gorgeous to behold. The film is currently showing both in 3D and as a regular feature; I recommend that you see it in 3D if possible, as the richly designed sets and characters were meant to be experienced in that format. Far from a mere gimmick, the 3D in this case actually brings more life to the story, revealing layers and depth that were actually created by hand and filmed, one meticulous frame at a time.Parents should be warned, that while the film contains no real violence, it is full of unsettling images and a creepy atmosphere that will doubtless give nightmares to little ones (much like the wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz, though this is a good deal scarier). There is mild profanity. A scantily-dressed and buxom elderly woman, though a clay-animated figure and far from titillating, may be offensive to some. That said, for older kids, teens, and adults who possess rich imaginations and an appreciation for this type of film, Coraline is a terrific night at the movies, and worth the added fee to view in 3D.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline,"Coraline is such a fun little flick. I guess you could call the film a Grimm's fairy tale of sorts for children, and it also serves as a good cautionary tale about being careful for what you wish for. The stop motion animation gives it a very otherworldly feeling. The movie is also very unsettling and this is coming from an adult. Show this film to a spoiled child and he'll walk the straight and narrow I assure you. On the plus side, the film has got a stellar cast. Teri Hatcher is great in duel roles as both Mel Jones and the Other Mother. Dakota Fanning also does solid work as the titular character Coraline. Lastly, you have the always reliable Keith David as the voice of The Cat and he's always a MVP. The Cat serves as Coraline's guide to the other world. Definitely check this flick out if you love stop motion animation. I do have one caveat though, I wouldn't show this film to any child under the age of 10. Unless of course you want to scare them straight.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Stitched together comfort break,"There's some nice animation, even some occasional decent 3D visuals but nothing is sustained for long. It's a shame, because the lasting effect is one of disappointment not enchantment. The story is flawed which makes the denouement tame and limp. As a modern day 'fairy tale' it is anodyne and overly domestic in scope. The parent characters are recognisable modern harassed 'knowledge' workers - freelancers chancing their arm in a sea of competition, looking for a utopia that doesn't exist. As their daughter, Coraline inevitably shares their idealism and is set on a journey to re-conceive her life experience. Oh it's so droll and ultimately boring. Who ever animated the facial expressions got it spot on - perhaps they spent a lot of time looking in the mirror? A lot of navel gazing, methinks by all involved. A decent film for a young person. Nah, not really. Pretend you're back in the fifties and wear the goggles for the 3D - it's sideshow at the funfair experience. It'll remind you most of Comfort adverts.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Mature Story and Disturbing Imagery:  Not for Young Kids,"I have been curious to watch this animated film since I saw the trailer since late last year. I do not think it was ever shown locally in the theaters though. Anyway, I was finally able to watch it this Christmas Day.Coraline is a feisty pre-teen girl who is exasperated by her parents' apparent lack of concern and attention for her. She was thus easily enamored and tempted by the seemingly ideal ""Other mom"" and ""Other dad"" whom she met when she crawled into a small door in their house. That is, until she knew what this would cost her. Will Coraline be able to rescue herself and her family from the clutches of the evil witch?From the trailer, I kind of knew this was not really for kids. The shapes and the colors indicate a dark and sinister plot. And watching it just confirms this suspicion. What drew me to watch this was the amazing artwork and animation work. I did not know before I watched that the story was based on a work by Neil Gaiman, and the director was also the one who directed ""Tim Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas."" So you can sort of get the drift of what I am saying. The story is mature and the imagery is disturbing. The technical aspects of this film are undeniably exceptional, and the main drawing point.The primary lesson I picked up is not necessarily targeted for kids though, but for busy parents. Parents should get their priorities straight first, and give their kids the time they need. I must admit I was uncomfortable watching these scenes of parental insouciance and neglect. I shudder at the thought that my kids would see these scenes and, God forbid, identify with poor Coraline. The lesson kids will get that they should love the parents they have may be a belated realization.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Parents consider reading the story first...,"First off, as a parent I echo the sentiment mentioned here and by Sam/Hannah's Dad to me, that this film is not for all kids. Indeed the theme that the Mom/Dad you want might not be the Mom/Dad you need is a mature one, and the fearful factor of a child abduction by the ""other mother"" is scary, even if you are not in a blended family.Stepmothers rarely fare well in reality and fantasy, and mirror-mothers less so.The idea of sewing buttons in the eyes, to make allegiance to the mirror mom complete, well that is pretty horrific concept. But done with stop-motion animation this is not a ""Chainsaw Massacre."" I had read the story to my boys when they were six, and decided to watch it this year around Halloween when they were seven. Watching it in our home on a small screen I also think is less assaultive than seeing it on a big screen. In general, my guys are a little more attuned to the macabre and we definitely talk about how TV is not real, etc...So it worked very well for us, and maybe you as well. The movie introduces a new character who was a hit with the twins, WhyBe added humor and also a role for a boy. (All those great Ghibli films always seem to have a strong *girl* as the lead...and here of course Coraline is the *star*).The film looked great to us. I just asked one of them what they liked/remembered and he cataloged quite a few specific images (from the garden, the robot, the bat/dogs, the walls that became mouths...which I didn't remember) and so on. I sometimes forget how visual the little guys are. And this film has plenty of trick-or-treats for the eyes. Also if you read the story first as we did, it might help your kids that then they know a happy ending of sorts is coming.As always, I'm grateful for something my kids *and* I can enjoy that is not pathetic pablum.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I Never Got This Film,"Considering its unique subject matter, and peculiar sense of style, one would expect something more original, or at least exciting from such a film, but sadly this flick has very little to offer. Coraline was always one of those animated films I never really understood why people enjoyed. I enjoy the company Lakia itself, producing one of my personal favorite animated flicks Kubo and the Two Strings as well as my guilty pleasure Halloween favorite Paranorman. However, when it comes to the discussion of Coraline, the film that put Lakia on the radar in the first place, I just don't see what this film has to offer. Besides the fact that it borrows from countless other films, including Alice in Wonderland, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and even Being John Malkovich this film is incredibly formulaic, somewhat corny, confusing, and clearly odd without any sort of purpose. I am all for unique and different creative visions, especially when it comes to film. But despite the potential this film has in its visual style and concepts, it doesn't feel rather unique at all. Instead, it feels like a dull eccentric adaptation of a story we have come to see dozens of times before, and personally, I don't find something like that very enjoyable. I enjoy stop motion, and think it is an incredibly unique piece of art, but something just seems off about the way everything moves in this film. Like ragdolls being played with by a toddler. It can be entertaining at times, even earning a chuckle or two, but sadly it isn't consistent enough to be enjoyable, or all together worthwhile.

"Beautifully Original, Though a Little Dark for a PG-Rated Movie","This movie is a perfect example of Laika's originality, uniqueness, slightly unsettling mind.

One of my favourite films!,"This is an absolutely outstanding movie which is one of my all-time favourites. Films that are adapted from books are always hard to stay true to because if you filmed an entire book it would be hours long. But even though there isn't everything from the book in the film, it is brilliant. If you liked The Nightmare Before Christmas, then you will love this!The story is of a young girl who moves to a new home and discovers another world inside a little door, where everything is better but this wonderful place isn't exactly what it seems.I remember watching this film at the cinema and my mum got up to go to the bathroom and I went with her, I waited outside the loos and she said ""Aren't you going"" and I said ""No I just wanted to get away from that film"". No don't be put off by that comment because it was the first creepy film I'd watched and I was about 7. But I was determined to love this film for what it was, so I watched it over and over and I am no longer scared by it!The animation is stunning and the work that everyone has done on the film is magnificent *small applause*. It is so amazing that everything is made by hand and they have been so creative with what they use; the blossoms on the trees are painted popcorn and one of the flowers is a dog toy that has been cut in half.I would say when Coraline realises what is really happening in the Other World, the scenes become a little disturbing but I would just watch it because it's a great film.I don't want to put you off this film because it is wonderful! I am so glad it has been the start of a new journey for Laika as well, with films like ParaNorman and The Boxtrolls following after it.

"Enchanting Start, Uneven Finish","Enchanting Start, Uneven Finish
Coraline starts off as a wonderfully dark and whimsical tale that immediately drew me in with its stunning stop-motion animation and eerie atmosphere. The first half of the film is a masterclass in storytelling, setting up a world that's both mysterious and captivating. Coraline's exploration of her new home and the strange characters she meets along the way is filled with a sense of curiosity and underlying tension that kept me hooked. The visual details are rich, and the animation brings a magical quality to the mundane, making even the simplest scenes feel special.However, when Coraline discovers the other side, the film's mastery starts to wane. While the concept of the alternate world is intriguing, the execution didn't quite live up to the promise of the first half. The story begins to feel predictable, and the initial sense of wonder and suspense gives way to more familiar horror tropes. I found myself less engaged as the plot unfolded, with the pacing becoming uneven and the tension dropping off.That's not to say Coraline isn't an enjoyable watch-it's a visually stunning film with a unique style and a memorable protagonist. But as much as I loved the setup, I couldn't help but feel that the second half lost some of the magic that made the beginning so special. The film's darker elements are still effective, and there's a lot to admire in its ambition, but the narrative could have used a bit more depth and surprise to match the brilliance of its opening act. Despite its flaws, Coraline remains a creatively bold film that's worth seeing, even if it doesn't quite sustain its initial enchantment.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Eyes or plastic button?,"Did you ever have a rag doll? Whatever is the answer you're probably going to like this move... Its all in rag style and its completely in stop motion... Its similar to the nightmare before Christmas but yet different...This is the longest stop motion move so far, you will see that there is lot of work put in to this! Most of the kids will like this movie and find them self in it... Its artistic and visual style is great and and actors are good for kids movie... But the place that this movie really shines its story and message that movie refers... It has some small flaws, but they are passable... After all its kids move it doesn't have to be perfect!

NOT FOR KIDS! But best movie i've seen in a while.,"Disney is hard for me. Fairy tales and happy endings can bore me quickly (Frozen, any princess films, most superhero films). I like the edgy style that Tim Burton and Henry Selick embrace, but i admire strong family values we expect from Disney. This film is a wonderful blend of both worlds.The film begins dingy and foreboding, like The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Unlike most films of this nature, the creep factor is introduced and interrupted by a heartwarming interlude. But once the plot twists, the creep factor immediately jumps and remains high for the rest of the movie.I highly recommend for anyone who loves Tim Burton (lord of the bizarre) or for those who enjoy a good scare.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The movie was just as good as the book,"This is the first time I ever admit that a movie is just as good as the book. Don't blame me for always assuming that the movie tends to ruin the story, just look at the pile of examples, like Eragon, Harry Potter, Spiderwick, name others.While the book felt a little slow and melancholic, the movie felt quite upbeat and fun to watch, despite the dark setting. I enjoyed both as two different stories. The book, despite being slow, kept me wondering about what will happen next without falling asleep. The movie, on the other hand, still has Gaiman's Coraline, but has its own colours, and there were nothing left unexplained.I'm not going to babble about the detail of the story, but I might be babbling about some other movies for comparison, so please excuse me. Well, here's the thing, the reason why a movie could ruin the story is that too many scenes from the book were deleted and left unexplained, I mean, someone who haven't read the book can't actually enjoy it as it has holes from the original story. It's a trick, I suppose, so that the viewers want to read the book, but it could be backfired as well. People, who are disappointed with the movie might become unwilling to read the book, I'm one of those people.And then, here we have Coraline. I think everyone can enjoy it without ever having or willing to read the book the story based on. The plot was flawless and neat, even additional characters didn't look like sticker, everything blended in nicely and seamlessly that you might forgot that it was based on Gaiman's book.Overall, it was a really nice movie. Nice and imaginative plot, cute stop-motion animation (not to mention, neat), and safe for any ages. You might ended up glad because you have watched it, or curious about the book. I'm telling you, both are good, you wont regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Scary!,"I would dare to say this is actually scarier than most films in the horror genre, which might be odd to hear when we consider that it seems like an animated fairy tale for kids. Yet, this film aroused sharp feelings of fear within me, and I think that's because of how real it feels. Also, the button-eyed people are just terrifying.One of the biggest triumphs of this film is that it looks and feels incredibly real despite being animated. The realism captured with the animation is on a level that I can't recall ever having seen. No animated film in my recollection has managed to look this crisp, textured, and bright. The animation style is also very unique which results in a film that is truly one-of-a-kind. It's not often that I view a media form which I can't draw any sort of reference for. I simply have never seen anything like this, not even remotely.The story itself pretty good, and moves along quick enough, however it does suffer from the usual error of giving the protgonist too much help in very unlikely situations. The ending wraps up in an all too convenient way that just isn't very believable and it's not entirely clear how Coraline's parents were kidnapped out of the ""real"" world or who the mystery children were who lost their eyes. These are sort of superfluous details that we are expected to just accept as part of the story, but they matter.All in all though this is a really enchanting film, and I use that word in the most literal of sense. It's magical! I also like that it is not completely sanitized of nudity or scary themes that would absolutely not fly in today's world of political correctness. Children can handle films like this. In fact, I think this film could be a classic for children because it's just scary enough to be deeply unsettling but not so scary that it would traumatize a child.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A tasteful child's horror story.,"Coraline is by no means a child's film. Despite the impression it is, and the advertisements aiming for children, i doubt there would be a boy or girl under 12 to watch this and not toss and turn at night. Hell, I'm praying i don't do the same. Yet, through its darkness and horror like storyline, it still remains to me, to be one of the best animated children's films that i have seen in a long while.Nowadays, the genre is so full of CG animation, with the ever endless same story lines, but this movie puts a little twist in the usually bland and often forgotten category. Admittedly, i was extremely shocked to find that the director of this movie was not Tim Burton, as the disturbing images and stop-motion animation would have had me believe otherwise. However, even without Burton's absence the film does itself proud in its own right, and the fact that it is stop-motion i feel really helps to bring out the fright in this tale, as the jittery movements and exaggerated body parts support the macabre atmosphere.The film is based around a relatively isolated house, which has been broken up into separate apartments. The angry and upset Coraline has just moved in, and is unhappy with the lack of attention she receives from her work ridden and economically unstable parents. This leads to the discovery of a small doorway which leads to a parallel world, where everything that appears to be wrong with her current life is right.As always, everything seems fine at first, until things inevitably slip and a more chilling atmosphere descends on the film. Overall however, there are some dark elements, and very adults themes. That is not to say, however, that it is any less of an interesting, and visually treatable picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who the heck had the idea to compare this to Wall-e,This movie is just so creative and awesome!It's a Halloween classic with a incredible plot and relatable characters!I am a REALLY coward person and this is the most scary thing I can see or else I'll be traumatized and I felt really nervous watching this movie but not nervous enough to scream out loud!This movie isn't so scary for kids I first watched this movie when I was like 10 and I didn't get THAT scared!Stop-motion is one of the best animation style that exists I don't care about 3D anymore I want stop-motion!Laika is such a underrated company people prefer watching Pixar or Disney then Laika well guess what?Laika is awesome!I would choose Disney over Laika(of course) but I still love it!I love this movie because it has a dark tone with an interesting plot!,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Intriguing, good characters, but still missing something","I was drawn to this movie due to the fact Henry Sellick directed it who brought us the timeless classic Nightmare Before Christmas. Coraline has many of the same elements Henry Sellick uses in his movies but it was still missing something to me to make it a great movie.Henry is a master at creating unique characters that amaze the audience. Coraline is no exception as the different characters and amazing scenery is what stuck out to me the most. The plot of the movie was also on point about a young girl escaping the real dismal world into a fantasy world where anything is possible. Many other aspects of the movie make it great as well like the amazing score and art direction but the pace of the movie is what slightly bothered me.Some scenes in the movie to me were drawn out too long and the point some of the characters were trying to make were halted for some unnecessary scenes. I guess with the many different characters in the film, there needs to be a lot of screen time to get their story across, but some scenes to me were not needed and dragged the film a little longer than it needed to be.But overall, Henry Sellick still proves he is a master of creating unique characters, stunning imagery and developing a great musical score to make any movie of his a must see. While Coraline has some flaws, it is still a good movie and a recommendation for anyone whose a fan of his work. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
great movie,"This movie shows reality and an alternate reality. When Coraline Jones voiced by Dakota Fanning, moves, her parents seem preoccupied and she is left to explore her new house. Since she is so bored with everything she wanders off and meets Wybie, who leaves a doll that looks exactly like her with her mother. and finds a brick door and enters it.. On the other side of the door, she finds her ""other mother"" voiced by Teri Hatcher, who looks just like her real mother. This alternate reality is more exciting and the ""other parents"" seem to be attentive to her and she likes the attention. She keeps going back and forth between both realities and begins to notice changes in the other mother.
The lighting fluctuates between drab and illuminating depending on which reality she has entered. The music is also the same way. It is dark at times and then it becomes happy. This is due to the dark overtone of the movie. It reminds me of the movie A Nightmare Before Christmas, which is also directed by Henry Selick. He is a great writer/director.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but...","When a child's parents doesn't pay enough attention to a child, they're bound to make up imaginary friends. These imaginary friends will also have a perfect world - escapism for the child, and a world he secretly longs for. This is the main premise of 'Coraline'.While there's much to love about the film - like the stunning animation - there's also some issues. What is the target audience? Children will love the animation and the cute little girl in the lead, and the cat (although the cat is a horrible looking thing!), but will they understand what the film is all about? Adults might understand the premise better, but will they relate to the characters as children would?This animated film has a very dark theme, with evil lurking around every corner. Some scenes might even give very young kids nightmares. Parts of the film reminded me of 'Pan's Labyrinth'. I must be honest, though, towards the end I found it difficult to understand what was actually going on. The film became very weird. After encountering ghosts of previous child victims, Coraline is given an adder stone - similar to 'Ouija' - to find their real eyes (now having buttons for eyes). Ghosts, witchery, evil spells, luring children - these are all themes not really suited for a young audience.'Coraline' certainly is magical and mystical, and the animation is beautiful.

"WONDERFULLY... ARGGH! SO AWESOME, loss of words","OK, we're gonna take a stab ( or well woven needle hand) at this movie. I hearted it. I hearted it for the movie's heroine, for the eerie, tangible dark balance of the movie ( for every fluffy cotton candy canon, there was a dark rodent or spooky part to even the movie out) for the beautiful animation and artistry, and for a quipy script. I've read people's review saying the movie had no heart, and that is a lie. This movie has a strong message about family, and even had a scene that made me teary eyed, and I'm like 25 ! lol Another high point was the soundtrack and 3-d vision. Both were pulled to such high quality, it just enhances the experience.

"I know it's only the beginning of February, but this may already be one of the best movies of the year","Here's the deal. I'm an elementary teacher. This is a movie based on a popular children's book. Of course I have to see it. I hope everyone appreciates that. So I dragged along a date to pick up some 3D glasses in a theatre full of bawling children... who quickly settled down once the story line got going.This is quality that has not been seen since ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". ""Coraline"" is an absolutely spell-binding story with a solid foundation in childhood innocence combined with the eerie and bizarre. I loved the book, and this for the most part stayed very true to the book--most differences were more of expansions of the story than glaring changes. Coraline and her family move into an apartment building full of strange characters. Coraline is sad and bored and her parents just don't seem to have time for her. The only other kid around is weird. So when she stumbles upon a passage way to an alternate and magical world controlled by her Other Mother, Coraline is understandibly thrilled. And then the horror begins...The animation (or rather, stop-motion) is incredible, and I don't think the movie would have been the same with any other medium. I loved the cast. The soundtrack is properly creepy. This new 3D program is far from gimicky. But still, what truly makes this movie is the haunting story and that is probably what will hopefully make it memorable.I don't know if I would be bringing the babies into this film, but I did read the novel to my first graders last year and they enjoyed it. Frankly, I would prefer to think of this as a family movie rather than a ""kiddie film"" as I consider the novel a children's novel. It's one of those stories that will appeal to all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Henry Selick's animation masterpiece,"Henry Selick, director of cult-classic and animation masterpiece THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, offers up another piece of animation magic and proves that he can do so without the creative help of Tim Burton. Of course, working from a story written by graphic novel wizard Neil Gaiman certainly has its advantages.The star and titular character of the story, Coraline, is the perfect imaginative kid for a perfect imaginative tale, set in a similar vein as the children from Narnia or even Dorothy Gale if both were re-imagined by the aforementioned Tim Burton, even though Gaiman is absolutely no stranger to all things eerie as this tale clearly shows. Coraline, voiced by Dakota Fanning, is a bit of an A-type brat and ignored by her typically over-worked 21st Century parents who spend more time in front of a laptop screen than listening to their only offspring. And so the tale begins.Coraline is whisked away into the troublesome but adventuresome (and aren't they always?) ""Other"" world where, at first, her Other-Mother and Other-Father treat her to a royal treatment, one not used to back at her real home. Then, as is apt to occur with such fairy tales, the young girl indeed finds out that strange things are afoot at the Circle K. Meanwhile, the viewer is whisked away into yet another gorgeous world of stop-motion animation where Selick's imaginative realism borders on pop-art candy for kids and something more sinisterly macabre that would certainly induce nightmares for the under-10 crowd, which includes ghost children, a wanna-be mouse-circus ringleader, and retired actresses whose age could be counted like the rings of a tree.As it is easy enough to imagine, the promises and threats of the Other-world soon have real implications in the real one. Selick treats the viewer into stunning images of cobwebs, raindrops and creepy spaces along with a fun cast of characters, including a know-it-all cat perfectly voiced by Keith David. Aside from the goth-lite plot and a nearly-too convenient wrap-up, Selick does his very best to keep the craft of his animation at the peak of its form while also using it to benefit the story, something that Burton seemed to forget in the not- quite-as-hip CORPSE BRIDE (2005).Fun, beautiful to watch and perhaps mistargeted to a kiddie crowd that Pixar usually caters to, CORALINE is a winner. And, perhaps if released in Pixar-free year, would have been an Oscar winner as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"great animation, no story",There are no words to praise the artists enough however it was all in vain because it is a collection of strange different creatures serving to a movie without story. It takes you half of the movie to figure out that it would probably take you and Coraline nowhere. when you are eager to know the purpose of it all the director takes you to useless chases and after a gross scene of old lady with bare BIG boobs there you find the very ugly skinny mother who wants to put buttons on her kid's eyes. I had lots of fun enjoying the making of the puppets and movie. Great art direction. Great soundtrack. Some changes between scenes are just amazing but none of the amazing animation could stop me from being bored with the lack of sense and story. If it was bases on Alice it was very badly made. If it is any consolation I also did not like Tim Burton's Alice.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Creepy,"When people think 2009 in animated movies, they probably think of Pixar's Up, it went on to win best animated feature and even got a best picture nomination. Well as great as Up was, I have to disagree with the Academy, because Coraline was my favorite animated film of that year. This has to be one of the creepiest animated films I have ever seen. According to Doug Walker, Don Bluth had a saying that you can show kids as much dark stuff as you want as long as it all leads up to a happy ending. If that's true, than Coraline is like a modern day Don Bluth movie.OK, negatives first, Whybie got annoying at times, it has a few immature moments that clash with the dark tone and it doesn't work, and it might be a little too dark for kids.This is a creepy flick, the colors and lighting really add to the dark atmosphere. The relationship between Coraline and her parents is actually really good, that is how kids really act, granted real kids might swear a little more, but this film shows a real relationship between parents and kids. The characters are a lot of fun, and acted very well. It's pretty funny at times, and even has a catchy song from the other father. Plus it's nice to see animation that isn't computer generated in this day and age.Coraline is one of the creepiest, and best animated films I've ever seen. It ranks up with some of Disney and Pixar's best flicks. Although I actually think it might scare young children, so if you have a child under 10, you might want to watch it with them.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Be careful what you wish for.,"A young girl walks through a secret door in her new home and discovers an alternate version of her life. On the surface, this parallel reality is eerily similar to her real life - only much better. But when her adventure turns dangerous, and her counterfeit parents try to keep her forever, Coraline must count on her resourcefulness, determination, and bravery to get back home - and save her family.It took me about a month to watch this but I finally did and I would like to say, it was worth the wait. To start things off, I would like to say this is a disturbing movie, more for the adults than to the kids, actually because of the subject matter. Is this a movie too scary for kids? It depends. If your child loves to be scared, probably like you were when you saw ""Jaws"" and ""The Poltergeist"" when you were a kid, this is the perfect movie for them.The movie isn't scary, per se. It just has a lot to do with the mind. The movie is disturbing because the story itself is disturbing and if you can't tell by now, that's a rare thing. The movie is also, technically, very beautiful, including the 3D to heighten up the senses. The designs, the sets, the look, etc. is all very beautiful and sometimes very elaborate.As for the movie itself, I was moved by parts of it, disturbed by parts of it, thrilled by parts of it, and humored by parts of it. The voice cast is good, although nothing special to mention about. However, there are some parts where the movie moves slowly. After all, the movie runs about 100 minutes, longer than most animated films. The film isn't perfect, yes, but it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and the best 3D movie I've ever seen! It's quite incredible. Well done, Henry Selick!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Coraline is visually stunning, narratively incredible","From Henry Selick, the visionary director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach comes the film adaptation of Coraline. The story of a young girl who finds a world all her own until her dream becomes a very realistic nightmare.Dakota Fanning voices the young Coraline and brings spunk and personality to a young heroin. Teri Hatcher in the villainous role of Coraline's alternate mother is simply marvelous. A terrific voice-acting performance and not since Ellen Degeneres have we seen an actress so involved.The rest of the usual suspects are there, Jennifer Saunders, Keith David, and Ian McShane. The story is very well told and in my humble opinion, not suitable at all for children. This is a lot even for me.

High fantasy at its best,"Worth seeing again in 3D. It is a masterpiece. Brothers Grimme meets Tim Burton. Feels like a fully realized, High Romantic tale from Hoffman. Uncanny, amazing and haunting. The world building is on another level and the 3D feels less like a gimmick than a a completely new dimension. One could write a psychoanalytic essay on the parent child relationship and how it is all meticulously estranged in the ""fake"" nether world parents. Yet it never becomes a simple morality / didactic / cautionary tale of of how children ""ought"" or ""should"" behave. Coraline's plight is at once every girl, and unique to her own particular character in this particular circumstance. Nor are her parents the typical evil step parents. They are sympathetically neglectful. This all combines to create an intense degree of audience identification with her, as if we could all fall pray to a similar temptation. I could write a book on this and have to stop myself. Suffice to say, if you've already seen this, see it again in 3D. If you haven't seen, run - don't walk - to the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An amazing animated film that is not for young children,"Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is an adventurous young girl who is absolutely miserable in her new town. Her parents, Mel (voiced by Teri Hatcher) and Charlie (voiced by John Hodgman), are more wrapped up in their gardening catalogue than they are in how their daughter is doing which makes her susceptible to Other Mother (also voiced by Teri Hatcher).The story is populated with quirky characters. April (voiced by Jennifer Saunders) and Miriam (voiced by Dawn French) are two former burlesque performers. Wybie (voiced by Robert Bailey Jr.) is the grandson of the building's owner who has a connection to the goings on there. Mr. Bobinsky (voiced by Ian McShane) is training circus mice that apparently talk to him. These actors also voiced their counterparts in the Other World.I do wish the rivalry between Other Mother and The Cat (voiced by Keith David), a nameless neighborhood feline that is a persistent thorn for Other Mother, was played up a bit more. I am unfamiliar with the Neil Gaiman book upon which is this is based so I do not know if there was more there than here but it just kind of was a thing in the film. I do not need an entire backstory. Just enough to give me direction. Does not hurt things. I just feel it would have been interesting.This is definitely one of the weirdest and creepiest animated films I have ever seen. Laika knocked it out of the park with their first feature. The film is a dark fantasy with its main setting being an old mansion that has been divided into smaller apartments. The film barely ventures beyond the building's grounds and yet still creates a rich and intricate world. There is just so much detail.The detail is intense for an animated feature. For example, Mr. Bobinsky is wearing a Russian Hero Medal for Service at the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster. This medal is unique as it is the only medal in the world awarded for participating in a nuclear clean up. In a nod to themselves a bit and in their quest for detail, Laika had references such as the Oregon Shakespeare Festival noted in the background. I have read that ""trolls"" is slang for friends in Michigan where Coraline is from and she uses that in Other World when looking at a picture of her friends. That is serious detail.The story is strong and there is a dark atmosphere throughout the film. This is definitely not a movie you pop in for the kids and forget about. I am not saying it is going to traumatize them or anything but if they are very young you might be giving them a nightmare or two. The imagery is intense and mildly disturbing. The pacing is slower and much less frenetic than in standard animation. There is no chaotic finale though the ending is exciting.And that is why I love it. It is a more mature animated feature than what we normally get and it is done in stop motion form. It is an adult film.The core of the story is the grass is not always greener. Coraline is presented with the life she wants. In the Other World, Coraline gets the type of mother she wants, the type of father she wants, and the type of neighbor she wants but it is not as good as she thinks it will be. And that is not just because it is an illusion created by a dark creature. She realizes the imperfections and shortcomings are what make her life special and good. She understands by the end that as imperfect as it was, it was just what she needed and wanted.In a day and age where people are pushing for strong female characters, Coraline is one. She is intelligent and independent and a bit fearless though her fearlessness is what causes her problems. She alone though is the one that defeats Other Mother and saves her parents and frees the spirits of Other Mother's previous victims. The only point they fall short is when Wybie, who is not in the book, is important to the resolution at the well when in the book Coraline accomplished it all on her own.The inclusion of Wybie was one of a handful of additions to the story in order to stretch it out into a feature film. Selick felt he could only get about 47 minutes if he was 100% faithful to the book and with the permission of author Neil Gaiman, he made some changes which mercifully are unnoticeable. Often additions are noticeable even if you are not aware of what they are as they slow the narrative.Coraline is an amazing animated feature. It is enjoyable by both children and adults though if you have very young children be there for them the first time you let them see it. Regardless of your age, you will not be disappointed in this.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Coraline... Everything's right in this world, kiddo.","Coraline: 7 out of 10: Whom is this movie for is a question that dashed through my mind while watching it. It is too scary and adult for most children. The film is full of High Octane Nightmare Fuel and retired adult entertainment stars with naked elderly puppet breasts... come to think of it that is High Octane Nightmare Fuel as well.As for the adults in the audience, I fear that in my case the film was too distant. I never felt emotionally attached to our plucky protagonist. In part because she is not a very nice girl (nor terribly plucky now I think about it) and partially because the film seemed to place her and her predicament at a distance.On the other hand, I was floored by the sheer artistry of the film. Visually this is simply one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. Director Henry Selick who helmed such stop motion masterpieces as James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas has taken his art to a new level. Words simply cannot describe the visual delights that lie inside Coraline.While I found the story somewhat distancing I also recognize the depth of the tale. Coraline’s two universes mirror each other in a complicated web rather than a simply black and white as one might expect. The ocean here may not be that wide but it is amazingly deep. To bad the water was a little cold for this swimmer.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Masterpiece,"Almost 10 years on now, I fully recognise Coraline as one of the defining points in my life. Coraline is a film loved by critics and hated by parents. It's use of creepy imagery, it's groundbreaking animation and simple yet powerful plot trap you into its horrifying web of a message.I don't feel I need to explain the story, IMDB can do that for me, all I will say though is that the film is a phenomenal moral tale about parenting. In a similar way to the way Spirited Away goes about its fantastic analogy, Coraline uses simple ideas for great effect.And of course, parents hate it. Why? It might be down to the fact that the film includes some horrifyingly tense and scary moments that, as a kid, frightened me. I was nine when I watched this film (yes guys, that does mean I'm only 18 now) but the effect of this film grew on me by each day I thought about it and to this day it still gets better.In the same way The Twilight Zone encapsulated kids of the 60s and Doctor Who had our parents hiding behind sofas, Coraline is an extremely important story psychologically for children and is thrilling to watch. The moments of my childhood I remember with film feature things like the melting faces moment in Raiders of the Lost Arc, the Rabbit Massacre in Watership Down and of course, Coraline escaping from her Spider Mother.It's the buttons, it's the tapping of the needle legs, it's the screaming children who've lost their eyes, the rats made of sand and the stitched mouth of Wyborn (can't remember spelling) as the mother makes him smile.Every element of this film is designed to scare, thrill, entertain and push the boundaries of what is acceptable. The parents are wrong. Coraline teaches an important lesson about fear, that we need it and need to learn about it.If you're a parent and you're wondering if you should show this to your kids, do it. It's one of the moments in film that affected my childhood and turned me into who I am today. For a film to affect me this much after ten years is incredible and I wonder what I'd be like if I hadn't seen it. Maybe I would not like horror movies? Maybe I wouldn't like movies in general? This film taught me what film can do, it's power to make people feel. I remember my sisters reaction (she was only 7 so maybe she was too young). She cried that night and wouldn't go to sleep. However all these years later, she considers the film to be as good as I do.

"Good, but not exactly the masterpiece everyone makes it out to be.","Yes, I know I may get flamed for this, but Coraline was an okay kids movie and was better than average. Out of all the films being released in 2009, this is the best kids movie I've seen (I also haven't seen Up yet).First, the visuals are fantastic. The storyline? Tightly woven and very strong. Characters? Creative, interesting, and very fleshed-out...except for Coraline. I couldn't stand her (especially at the beginning, though she did get better) and Dakota Fanning's awful voice work nearly ruined it for me. Everyone else's voice acting was near perfect, except for hers. The major drawback to this film was the casting of Fanning in the lead role.I'm not saying I don't like this movie, I do. It's just nothing special to me, either. I love dark fables like this, but I don't know. I just feel like it's a bit overrated. Still, though, it's better than average and is definitely one of the better films of the first half of 2009.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Snapshot of Childhood - And Nightmares,"'Coraline' is a film that has caused many kids sleepless nights after first watching, for good reason. I would call it a children's horror film, and one that it doesn't rely on cheap scares at all; it develops the scary aspects in a real, spooky, and disturbing way, and is much more competent at being frightening than the vast majority of modern day adult horrors. The film has a simple but intelligent plot that teaches an equally simple but effective message: ""Be careful what you wish for; value what you have."" The characters are all interesting, real people and the plot is driven by real human drama and interaction. The animation is absolutely superb, and brings the film so much life in everything from its fantastical to 'boring', realistic moments. The score compliments the film very nicely and captures the exact mood of ambling childhood (and its darker elements). There is intrigue in every pebble of the world drawn; the feel of being an irritated but curious child is everywhere. And I think it's this that makes the film so scary, especially for kids. Everybody can see themselves in our protagonist Coraline, and when her life feels so much like so many kids', the possibility of a dark turn seems very real and very frightening. Even during the happier moment of Coraline's other world there is danger and spooky little aspects. It never feels safe; once it gets going the film feels like you're trapped in a nightmare without any chance of escape - a nightmare, that for kids, hits a little too close to home. I couldn't recommend giving this film a try more, but if you're considering a family movie night with kids younger than 10, just be wary. I wouldn't say don't watch it, because it's fantastic and I'm not in favour of not showing kids scary (though appropriate) media. Just be wary, because it's a truly frightening film that will stick with you.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's not just a movie it's art,"Coraline is one of my favourite films. I have watched it multiple times. I have the DVD of it. I wish that I could have watched it in the cinema, that would have been an amazing experience. If you have not seen it, I would absolutely recommend watching it. It's spooky, it's dark it's twisted. Some of the characters in it are strange but wonderful. I find stop motion interesting. This film took about 4 years to make and I think the time was worth it, as it is a spectacular film. Horror, stop motion, and fantasy all come together in this movie. It's magical and creepy. They're also funny moments in the film as well. I would rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing soundtrack and details. Exceptional Animation,"I love this movie the details are exceptional ! I have watched Coraline for the first time when I was probably 9 and some of the scenes was scary for me back then and i have to mention that i love horror movies since i was a child. I am not so sure if this movie is suitable for every child but i have have to say that i loved this movie as a child and still love this movie as an adult. There is so much details that you can realize after watching it multiple times , i have probably watched Coraline for 15-20 times it is a comfort movie for me. I love the soundtrack to it adds so much to the movie and some of the parts are gibberish and it suits the movie so much. The fact that the movie is stop motion and all of the things are handmade and takes so much talent, time and work to make a movie like this. I think adults would like this movie either.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful stop motion, excellent YA story, perfect movie","CoralineThe first stop motion animated film from Laika, Coraline received a 15th anniversary screening in the theaters, that included a short documentary at the end about updating the puppets for preservation.Based on the novella by Neil Gaiman, the film was expanded upon to fill a feature length time frame, and directed by the same man that did Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. I noticed his style right away, but with more vibrant colors and stylized puppetry.As a story for a young adult audience, the themes are very dark. Coraline is a young girl with workaholic, boring parents whose mother takes not so subtle jabs at her father. They have recently rented space in a home with three other tenants; two below and one above. Like one would expect in a thriller such as this, everyone, but Coraline's parents, is eccentric.What I love most about this movie is how it treats Coraline with respect as a young woman of intelligence, bravery and wit. She is neglected and acts out to show creativity in a world of drab and dreary. Her parents are experts in botany and gardening, but her mother hates dirt and mud? Her father can't cook, but does so anyway, making the most disgusting kinds of ""food.""Coraline is lured into another world, through a small door in the study, where everything she experiences in the real world has become the opposite. What child wouldn't want to stay there? I related so much to this, having wanted to escape so many times, but only having a bicycle and a library card to do so.The creature that ultimately reveals it's a charade to get Coraline to stay, with grotesque buttons sewn upon her eyes, helps Coraline realize that her regular family does indeed love her. Giving her everything she wants isn't necessarily what she needs.The story is exciting, hilarious, scary, but solved due to the creature's inability to say no to playing a game. She cheats at the game, but Coraline ultimately wins and gets to go home, along with the three spirits trapped behind.I can't say enough good things about this film. I wanted to see it again immediately after I left the theater to look for details I may have missed. The filmmakers attention to detail leads for a perfection vision of a movie made in an era of computer generated imagery doing everything. It's even mentioned in the documentary that CGI does not denigrate the work done in stop motion, nor does it speed up the process, but there's something satisfying in knowing that the film is shot with cameras and physical objects.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline (2009) One of Laika's best.,"Coraline is a stop-motion film done by the famous Laika studios, that aside from Box Trolls creates wonderful films with intriguing stories and amazing stop-motion effects. It is also directed by Henry Selick, the director if the Nightmare Before Christmas and is based on the book by the master of creepy and weird Neil Gaiman. 
Coraline is about a bratty girl who is being ignored by her work-a-holick parents and hates the new house they moved to; especially the boring and strange neighbors. However, Coraline then finds that there is a magical world behind a small door where a woman, who looks like her mother with button eyes, gives her everything she could ever want and more. As things go along, everything starts to take a turn for the worst as she discovers that the 'other mother' is not what she seems. 
The film has a very tightly woven story with no too fast or too slow moments, and of course is beautiful to look at. The characters are fun and well voiced, and of course the music, composed by Bruno Coulais, is atmospheric and phenomenal. I know a lot of parents complained about this film being too scary for their kids, but hey what do parents know?",,Anonymous,Animation
Sweet Coraline,"In the wake of all the recent PIXAR family-friendly, uplifting animated entertainments, this was a refreshingly welcome alternative fairy-tale of an altogether darker hue. The eponymous heroine is a commonplace teenager, uprooted from friends of her own age, struggling to have her preoccupied parents pay her much notice. Worse, she has no pets, their new house is a cold, bare, uninteresting apartment in the middle of nowhere with only quirky neighbours, like the two middle-aged sisters and a Russian acrobat, all seeking an outlet or their ""talents"" in a carnival show or circus. Only a talkative young boy and his mysterious cat offer her any outlet for her wish for recognition and adventure, until, that is the boy brings her a doll which is her own image, only with buttons for eyes and she next stumbles across a secret door which provides her with a gateway to a brighter world where her ""other"" parents have more personality and more importantly time for her too. But things get stranger and darker with every midnight visit she makes to the ""otherworld""...Unlike other fairy stories, even the darker ones, this one takes frequent detours away from the narrative to introduce the supporting characters, usually in surreal situations. In this it chimes in with the unnatural but vivid world we enter in our dreams and nightmares. There are mixed-up elements present of classic stories gone by, most obviously ""Alice In Wonderland"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", the ""Narnia"" tales and others while the animation recalls the work of Terry Gilliam and artists like Salvador Dali and the darker imaginings of Van Gogh, but there's an originality at work too which is refreshing and entertaining.The music too is original and sympathetic to the production and even if the story does end up at the required happy ending, it doesn't get there the most obvious way, taking in a Harry Potter type quest to get there.The animation itself is excellent with many noteworthy sequences, transitions and backgrounds. Perhaps lacking a little of the wit and knowing humour of the best PIXAR films, this feature nevertheless shows that there is life in animation outside of Shrek, Toy Story et al.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Was The Other World a dream or reality?,"I liked the character Coraline, and the film certainly is creative. Unfortunately, for me, the movie lost some punch because I could not tell if The Other World was intended to be Coraline's dreams or her reality with dangerous things in it. Since the movie is a fantasy, I don't care which. I just wish the storyteller had chosen one or the other. If the former (Coraline's dreams), then the ending is hard to swallow. If the latter (Coraline's dangerous reality), then the movie needed to be clearer about it. After all, many of her visits to the Other World started with her in bed, implying that The Other World was a dream. Did I miss something?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Creepy, beautiful and amazing","""Coraline"" is one of the most impressive animated films I've ever seen. From the moment it begins, it's impossible not to be captivated by its stunning beauty. The stop-motion technique gives the film a unique, almost handcrafted quality, as if each frame is art in its purest form. Every character movement, every detail of the scenery, feels carefully created to invite us into a dark yet fascinating world.Director Henry Selick has created a universe that perfectly blends fantasy and reality. Coraline's world is dark and mysterious, but it also has an odd sense of comfort. It's a place where, despite the darkness, there's a certain tranquility, like being in a dream where anything is possible, yet dangers still lurk. It's curious how this film gives me a ""pleasant"" sense of solitude, as if I'm alone in that universe, accompanied only by the characters that inhabit this incredible story. It feels as though no one else is there, and somehow, that solitude is both lonely and comforting.The characters are undoubtedly one of the film's greatest strengths. Each one is unique and peculiar. Coraline's parents, for example, are a bold critique of modern family dynamics and the pressures of work. They are always busy, distant, unable to give their daughter the attention she craves, which leads her to seek attention elsewhere and meet new people. It's a very realistic portrayal of how work can drive a wedge between us and those we love most, and how children can feel lonely and neglected, even when their parents are physically present but mentally absent.But it's the ""Other Mother"" who truly stands out. She represents the temptation of what seems perfect. Unlike Coraline's real parents, who are flawed, she offers a world of pleasure and satisfaction, but at a terrible cost. It makes us think about how far we're willing to go to get what we want, and whether we're willing to sacrifice our authenticity for a life that, at first glance, seems perfect.Overall, ""Coraline"" is undoubtedly one of the best animated films of all time. It's dark, emotional, fun, engaging, and even a bit scary. I wouldn't recommend it to very young viewers, as some elements verge on horror, but for those who can handle it, it's an enticing experience. This is a film that deserves to be immortalized in cinema, not just for its visual beauty, but for the depth of its story and characters. Every frame and line of this story is art in its purest form.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Every gothic girl's dream,"This movie is every gothic girl's dream - a quirky atmosphere, a strong-willed, but misunderstood female protagonist, a dark story, Victorian architecture, French music, etc. But while the animation was superb and the 3-D experience was fun, I thought that the story fell a bit flat.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A ""Wizard of Oz""-like tale, tailor-made for the 2000s...","Adapted from Neil Gaiman's book of the same name, Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" isn't a movie I would let my 6-year old daughter watch but it's only a matter of a few years as the film is certainly relevant for an audience over the age of 10. It is also entertaining, spectacular and dark and disturbing, a little less than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" but a little more than ""Pinocchio"".This is a story about a pre-teen girl who feels (more than she is) neglected by her parents; not because they belong to the abusive sort but because they're all intensely absorbed by their personal project of making a garden catalogue and all their petty adult preoccupations regarding their new life in ""Rose Palace"", Oregon. The moral comfort of their daughter isn't the least of their concerns but surely any child would love to live near a forest with colorful and eccentric European artists as neighbors and in a house looking like the setting of a Scooby-Doo episode.But Coraline isn't like any child... the titular heroine isn't a model of extraversion, nor is she your typical shy, insecure little girl who needs the presence of an imaginary friend to feel valuable or to make up for the lack of parental love. Coraline doesn't try to be pleasant, she's a self-centered, strong-willed girl who doesn't care about befriending the well-meaning house owner's grandson ""Wybie"" just because he's the only child around. In all this unpleasantness, it comes down to her most infantile trait being the most universal one: curiosity. Coraline is intrigued and fascinated by mysterious traps and doors, including one that opens on a bricked wall.It is a well-known trope of many fantasy stories, the portal that leads to a different world materializing as a tornado in ""The Wizard of Oz"", a rabbit hole in ""Alice in Wonderland"" or a wardrobe in ""Chronicles of Narnia""... like Alice, Dorothy or Wendy Darling, there's a predisposition in Coraline to envision a better world lying somewhere. And so we understand the stylistic choices of the opening sequence, all in depressing colors and autumnal mood to better highlight the contrast with the other world, like the sepia used for the Kansas part in ""Oz"". The film is told from Coraline's perspective and it's interesting how the atmosphere reflects her mood in a binary way, she enjoys the color and reject the boring grey, like a normal child would do.The film has another similarity with ""Oz"", which is the presence of doubles for each character except for Coraline and a mysterious cat. It starts with an opening sequence involving the meticulous fabrication of a doll with hands that evoke needles and puncture. The making of a doll starts with the symbolic death of the first one emptied from her content, as if there was no possible form of life and pleasure without a necessary sacrifice to make. And with Bruno Coulais' haunting music, we suspect some creepy undertones behind the pleasantness of the doll that looks like Coraline.And so many questions come to mind: does the hand belong to an omnipotent God-like figure? a villain? is the doll a friend? whatever purpose this opening sequence carries takes its full meaning once we know who possesses these needle-like hands. Of course, some would make the immediate connection with Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the film came from the director of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" whose idea originated from Burton. Henry Selick remains the unsung hero of an oeuvre that has so many Burton vibes his name was only known by movie lovers. But let's get back to ""Coraline"".I guess there are two dimensions of appreciation : first it's a movie about a dream any child could have, better parents, living in a beautiful world full of fun and amusement. And the film follows the plotline of many tales like Pinocchio when children discover at their own expenses that for every dream, there's a price to pay. Discovering the other world through the portal, Coraline sees better versions of her parents, gentler, funnier, more dedicated to her wishes. The catch is that they are all doll-like figures with buttons instead of eyes, what starts as a cute little gimmick turns into a creepy and lifeless vision of ""forced"" beatitude.So we get the other side of the coin, and the real coming-to-age aspect of the story is when the heroine understands that she better accepts her own people with their flaws than the so-called idealized vision, it's the usual ""there's no place like home"" with a subtitle for 2000's audience: ""beware what you wish for.Coming of age is the reason why this movie works more for children, just watch the different travels Coraline makes: first she bumps into the ideal world where she sees better versions of her parents and her neighbors, it's accidental. Then it's deliberate, she wants to have fun and has the time of her life admiring the circus, the ballet and musical numbers that remind of Disney extravaganza. After that; she understands the price she has to pay for the ideal world, which means abandoning a precious capability : to see things for real... later, she has to get back to save her parents. In four travels Coraline grows up and learns more about life and herself and becomes altruistic and mature.This a wonderful evolution of character in the same vein than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and all the classic tales I mentioned, one that teaches kids about the limits of imagination and idealization and where dolls are both attractive and creepy. Horror, fantasy, and fairy tale magnificently blend in Selick's film, a wonder of animation that proves how stop motion is such an underrated genre of animation, the same year than ""Mary and Max"", another movie about a child looking for a meaning to her daily life... until finding a meaning to life itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie literally BLEW ME AWAY.....,"I'm not sure where to start. I love Henry Selick's work. The first time I saw ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" it became one of my favourite films and still is.Coraline was a film I simply couldn't wait to watch! (I am an extremely huge admire of stop-motion animation, I love it!) I was extremely eager to watch it and the more photos/info/trailers I saw, the more excited I was about it and the higher expectations I had...The truth is, I entered the cinema with very high expectations. You know how sometimes this can ruin a movie?!? You expect it to be amazing and then it's a complete disappointment?!? This didn't happen with this film, in fact it was the complete opposite! I went in with high expectations and when I came out not only where those expectations fulfilled....They were beaten! It was better than what I even expected it to be! The film was simply mind blowing and I was literally watching the whole thing with my mouth wide open because I was too amazed by it...The sets, the locations, the incredibly interesting and peculiar characters, the music... The voices all fitted perfectly... I couldn't have thought of a better voice than Teri Hatchers to play Coraline's mother...Everything just blended together perfectly. You can clearly see it's a Henry Selick film. I could see many references to ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" but all at another scale, at another level... A bigger challenge, proving what an amazing artist Selick is. It's as if Coraline is the new ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" for a new generation.The film did scare me. More than an ordinary live action film you may see nowadays. The ideal word to describe it is ""creepy"". It gives you the goosebumps. Some people say it shouldn't be a PG movie. I disagree. Kids like these things. When I was younger and watched ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" I was scared by it, I really was, but nevertheless I loved it and watched it over and over again... I think this is why children liked it and why they will love Coraline. They need those creepy moments to really give it that edge of credibility and interest. Children can associate and identify themselves's more with the story... It's not as appealing if everything is butterflies and flowers... It's a fairytale and fairy tales are dark by nature...It simply makes the magical more magical...It's beautiful...I cannot recall how incredibly fantastic the animation is in this movie. I bow to all those patient animators who spend hundreds of hours of their time creating these amazing visuals. Every frame, every shot, every movement is perfect and given 100% dedication. It's truly breath taking.Something that I rarely see in films these days is originality and this was one of the big reasons why Coraline blew me away. It managed to stay out of the ""predictable"" pattern and this is not easy, it's extremely hard to achieve... But Coraline did it...Thank you Mr. Henry Selick for making such a wonderful creative piece of art. It will surely become a classic, I have no doubt and it shows how wonderful stop-motion animation is. It's movie's like these that really inspire you and remind you how magical and moving cinema can be.ps. Watching it in 3D is a must...",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well Done and Easy to Follow,"""Coraline"" is a stop-motion movie with a touch of CGI to give it better resolution and clarity. The eponymous character, voiced by Dakota Fanning, is a little girl whose parents have moved with her to an old hotel converted into separate living units. There she somewhat befriends a boy named Wybie (voiced by Robert Bailey Jr.) who gives her a doll as a gift that looks exactly like her. If that wasn't weird enough (considering she just met him), she found a tiny door that was a portal to an identical home with her ""other mother"" and ""other father"" (copycat versions of he own mother and father except they had buttons for eyes). In this alternate dimension Coraline was spoiled unlike she was in her real home. It was a wonderful getaway, but would she be willing to stay forever?""Coraline"" was not as dark and ominous as I thought it'd be, and I liked that. The pervasive message was about being grateful for one's parents and not being wooed by material happiness. It was well done and easy to follow.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
it is good enough to enjoy,"Coraline is a dark horror fantasy stop motion 3D animation that just sticks out in your mind as one creepy movie. It stalls you and keeps you in the dark as you try to decipher where the terror will be coming from, and when it does arrive, you find yourself wishing this is one of those films that the good guy wins, although there are numerous of them this just got to be one.Coraline doesn't strike me as a film for children although it does carry a message of how you should be thankful of what you have, the grass may look greener on the other side but there may be a high price to pay to get there and stay there.Coraline is based on a book of the same name by British author Neil Gaiman (who also wrote the novel Stardust that was to a film adapted of the same name in 2007), it was published in 2002 winning the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novella, the 2003 Nebula Award for Best Novella, and the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers. It was later adapted by Henry Selick (he was also the director of the 1993 The Nightmare Before Christmas) into this movie that we are going to talk about.The movie plot is about a girl named Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) who she her parents moved into an old house that has been subdivided into flats. The other tenants were Miss Spink and Miss Forcible two elderly stage actors and Mr. Bobinski, who is training a mouse circus.One rainy day she discovers a locked door in her room, which has been bricked up, strangely as she goes to visit her neighbors, Mr. Bobinsky delivers a message to her telling her not to go through the door.But Coraline ignores the warnings and goes through the door which leads her to a parallel version of her house where she meets her other mother and other father, who were better and treated her better than her real mother and father, the difference was the people in the other world have buttons for eyes.Coraline was well received by critics and did averagely well in the box office, although the game version of the film received very poor ratings. Henry Selick will be making another Neil Gaiman book adaptation named The Graveyard Book, who knows maybe the movie will also be a stop motion animation.www.lagsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Turns out, it is very deep, emotional, makes you really think, and most of all - it is for adults. If I had watched it when I was in my early 20s, I'd probably just say that it was just a good animation. But it's so much more than that. You just need to watch it first.

A stunning 3D fantasy.,"Having already watched and loathed two movies based on Neil Gaiman tales—Mirrormask (1/10) and Stardust (3/10)—I was extremely hesitant about seeing Coraline, but was ultimately lured by the promise of an extra dimension (I'm a sucker for a gimmick).And to my amazement, I loved every minute of it.The perfect viewing choice for anyone who adores dark, twisted fantasy—or for parents wishing to warp their children's delicate minds (the film contains disturbing imagery guaranteed to upset kiddies of a nervous disposition)—Coraline is an absolute tour-de-force of exquisite story-telling, stunning 3D visuals, breathtaking animation, wonderful music, and brilliant voice-work (from a cast including Dakota Fanning, desperate housewife Teri Hatcher, and my least favourite comedy duo of all time, French and Saunders).Gaiman's freakish story follows 10-year-old Coraline, the frustrated daughter of inattentive parents, as she ventures through a mysterious hidden door in her new home that leads to a seemingly perfect alternate world, complete with extremely considerate and caring versions of her mother and father. The fact that everyone in this doppelganger dimension has buttons for eyes is a little unnerving perhaps, but Coraline doesn't mind, so long as she gets to keep her eyes.So when her new, button-eyed parents offer to keep Coraline forever, just so long as she agrees to a new pair of plastic peepers being sewn onto her head, the little girl decides that perhaps her real home isn't so bad after all. However, her alternative mother is keen to hang on to Coraline, hoping to feed off her life-force, and isn't about to let the girl go without a fight...Other bizarre and memorable characters include Wybie Lovat, Coraline's 'stalker'/friend (who helps save the day), Mr. Bobinsky, the gangly legged owner of a musical mouse circus (who provides the highlight of the film, as his talented rodents put on a spectacular show), and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two strange, old actresses with a collection of stuffed Highland Terriers (and whose past performances include the dubiously named 'King Leer' And 'Julius Sees-her').Although I highly recommend seeing this film in it's full 3D splendour—the FX definitely add impact to the visuals—Coraline's narrative is so engaging that, even without the added depth, it proves to be unmissable stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Was genuinely wetting myself revisiting this,"I was nine when I first saw this. You can work out the rest.
I can't say it's exactly terrifying in the same way as an adult, but it still has some major yikes factor for sure. It's a little hard for me to pin down exactly why, though there is a consistently strange tone present at all times in the other world and I ADORE the creepy designs and voices of everything there so much (I really hope I never meet Teri Hatcher in real life, she's so great in this film), but I certainly respect a kids' movie that really feels daring, and like it isn't afraid to be scary, even for adults at times.
Henry Selick's traditional ""everyone thinks he's Tim Burton"" animation works absolute wonders as usual, although I couldn't help thinking it did look weirdly stiff at times, like maybe they should have added in a few more frames at points, but he's definitely still got the touch for making something really off-putting.
What drags it down a little for me is Wybie, he feels like a rather pointless character, but what drags it down more is Coraline herself. Frankly, much of the time she just comes off as annoying to me. Not quite to the point that I wanted her to shut up and get eaten, but certainly enough that it bothered me.

One simple word: Masterpiece!,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. I was about 6 years old when this first came out in theaters, and though I didn't get to see it in theaters, I do remember when the DVD dropped and my grandfather (God rest his soul) rented it from a video store, and it's been stuck in my head since. I know a lot of people think that this movie is ""too dark"" for kids, and while it is a dark movie, I find it great for a kid's imagination for the magical world of the ""buttoned-eye portal"" and the stop motion animation is absolutely amazing, and could fascinate almost everyone. While also giving it a dark, horror-like story that adults can also be fascinated with. Making this, to me, the perfect combination of a children's, and an adult movie that everyone can enjoy. And that's why I feel it works. Even back when I was 6 years old first watching this, I was never scared of the movie. I always found it fun, unique, and definitely intense. This is also such a memorable film. From the characters to the music and to the simple, yet beautiful set design. This movie is honestly a masterpiece in my opinion, and I'd go as far as saying that Coraline is the best stop-motion animated film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderfully artistic with a strong story; but loses a little steam in the second half,"Coraline, an animated adaptation of the Neil Gaiman book, appropriately directed by Henry Selick, who you might know as the director of similarly scary children's films such as The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. Coraline follows suit with incredible visuals and an interesting story, but there are still a couple story issues that keep it from fully matching the wonder of the visuals. Oh, and I watched it in 3-D and will have a couple things to say about that too.First and foremost, the movie is a visual treat. All the imagery looks fantastic and imaginatively different from mainstream children's fare, clearly more in line with Selick and Burton's work. The combination of stop-animation and computer graphics is impressive, but more impressive is the art design, everything having such a cohesive look. I do have to put a note of caution in that the film does have a touch of minor grotesque/comical near-nudity in it and although I don't find it problematic myself, someone else might prefer that their children are not exposed to it. All the same, the visuals are spectacular.Also, the stereoscopic 3D effect is pretty cool, I have to admit, even if the glasses are uncomfortable and make me feel funny in my head. It certainly adds a depth to the movie and while it isn't a necessity, I liked the effect. It didn't seem to be used in a gimmicky way in Coraline, so that was nice.As for the story, it's basically about a girl who moves into a house with a mysterious door that leads to an ""other"" world where everything's super fun and nice, only that everyone has buttons for eyes. The first half is this wonderful cautionary tale about fantasy and then the story ends and a whole new story begins. This second story is where I find some fault with Coraline as Coraline has essentially overcome the major conflict of the story and so everything we watch is no longer all that thematically important. Also, the structure of the narrative hems very close to the flat nature of a fable and often had me thinking of a Mario video game, only less fun.This lack of gravity to the second half (essentially a much extended ending) pulls a lot of the magic out of the film, but I still admit that the first half was so strong that it doesn't pull all the magic out of the film.So, I have to say that Coraline is a decent flick, especially early on and I can say it's a decent film to catch on the strength of its visuals and the strong story in the first half. It does lose its way in the second half and whether that's an artifact from the novel or a matter of its interpretation, I don't know, but I don't think the let down is so great as to prevent a viewer from otherwise enjoying it. So, recommended, including for children. 7/10.One note is that there is a little bit of exposition in the middle of the film and younger children will likely get restless. They certainly did in my theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Good Animation!,"I thought that Coraline would be one of those stupid animated movies that comes out once in awhile. It took me some time to get myself to be able to see it. I'm glad I did. This is a wonderful, imaginative story behind the director of Nightmare Before Christmas. This movie has a very dark tone, definitely Anti-Wall E.The story is about a girl named Coraline. She just moved with her family and is bored with her life. After exploring the house she discovers a portal that enables her to be with the ""Other"" Mother. But is this mother any good? The movie is full of visual effects. That's the most stunning part about this movie. There is one thing I have to criticize. This movie should be rated PG-13. Coraline is way too scary for little kids. But, I'm glad I saw this. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Someone did not read the book !!,"The movie is discrete from the book ,and just disgraced the beauty of a lovely story . if you watched the movie without reading the book you may find it a little bit acceptable in case you don't care about the plot and the boredom in the first 90 mins then pushing everything in the last 20 mins .",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The BEST stopmotion film ever made!,"This movie has been a massive comfort movie of mine since the first time I saw it in 2011 (I grew up in an insane sheltered home so I wasn't allowed to watch it, until I secretly watched it at a friend's house when I was 10) and the book is my favorite book of all time. (I secretly read that while I was about 8ish)The never ending amount of detail this movie has is beyond mind blowing. Everytime you watch, you notice new things. Researching the movie shows so many new amazing and interesting aspects of the story. While yes there were changes the movie made compared to the book, this is one of those very minor times I was okay with it. The changes made sense for converting to a movie, and the changes still told the same ground breaking story. This movie I would say is a fantasy thriller, but it's by no means SCARY. Don't get me wrong, The Beldam (also known as Other Mother) is scary, but it isn't to the point where any child over 8 or 9 can't watch. Of course this depends from child to child, how sheltered they are and such. If you plan to watch this movie, (and please please do) I seriously encourage you look up trivia/fun facts on it after. There's just so much and it's so amazing.My favorite is the secret behind the cake the other mother offers Coraline on her first night in the other pink palace. I won't spoil it you'll have to look it up on your own AFTER watching the movie~Also love that they created a small character (a mover in the very beginning) for someone who worked on the movie and sadly passed away.I really could go into detail about every aspect I love of this movie, but I would go on for ages. Anytime I review a movie, no matter what I do my best to also list cons. So if I think of any I'll list those below.Cons:
This is a first.... I genuinely spent a long time trying to find something. I even watched cinema sins to try and find something.....the only sin that was even remotely serious and that I agree with that's weird is that the cat doesn't have a booty hole 🤷‍♀️ which IS weird but..... Imagining if they did add the booty hole ...makes it even weirder....",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Wonderful Stop-Motion Movie,"""Coraline"" is one of the best animated movies in the world. The movie was directed by Henry Selick, who directed Tim Burton's classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". The movie centers around a girl named Coraline who wasn't happy about moving into a gloomy apartment, and her parents have no time for her. When exploring the house, she comes across a little door that leads to another version of her world, except it is a better version of her real world, and the people have buttons for eyes. Coraline is very pleased about this world, until she learns that she needs to have buttons sewed in her eyes if she wants to stay. She also learns that the other mother is actually a witch who lures bored children into her world and eats them. So now Coraline has to find the missing eyes of three ghost children and escape the other world to get back to her real one.What makes this movie so great is of the plot was well written, the animation was great, the effects look great, and the exterior looks great. If you're a fan of stop-motion movies, you gotta watch this, its a fantastic movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Coraline, The greatest movie of all time.","My favorite movie of all time. It was my favorite as a kid since I always loved creepy and scary things, and it's still my favorite now as an adult!Everything in this movie is on purpose. The makers put so much thought into it. You could watch theory videos on YouTube for hours if you want to. Even after watching this movie a million times and watching almost every theory video there is to find, me and other Coraline fans still find new details to be surprised about! This makes Coraline extremely fun to re-watch. I recommend watching this movie, the making off, and all the theory video's on YouTube!A must watch for every spooky films lover!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creative & Imaginatice .. a Perfect Combination for a Great Animation !,"Holy camoley ! This film is by far the best animation film for 2009 ! I like everything about it; the animation, the storyline, the creative idea, the brilliant colors and great music ! This isn't your run-of-the-mill remake animation, as this film is original and creative. It also is not what animation is usually for; cheerful cuddly characters performing antics and making viewers laugh.This animation talks about serious issue, hidden subtly in its presentation. It talks about how kids (and teenagers) usually dislikes their parents and their environment, and yearn for life different from what they have. They wanted something different, and they thought the grass is greener on the other side.In this animation, it is not always so. There are baits of 'better' life when actually it is reserved for something sinister.I like the spooky feel of this animation, the dark environment and the surreal set-ups. It is cleverly woven, with art-like precision to make this film a nice watch, whilst being spooky, not gory.I recommend this film to everyone who likes animation. And to those who only began to like animation, I recommend them to give this film a try.P/S : Watch it in 3-D, so cool !",,Anonymous,Animation
Great horror film. But wait! It was supposed to be children's film,"As others reviewers are saying , a very grippy entertainer . A finely animated film with stunning visuals , unique concept and excellent editing . Even a Pixar fan can't deny that. But I find Wiby's character a little annoying . Also, the cat was not given much screen time and should have been properly utilized. But even with these little problems , this film is excellent.But then why PG. This is a dark film (I mean a little too dark ) . It has little feel of a horror film . And the biggest of all , there is a scene of a circus where a women (either Mrs spunk or Mrs forcible) is seen almost completely naked(private parts covered with glitter patches) and camera focuses on her breast moving . Otherwise , a great watch but not suitable for children.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Feels very European, a bit 'tripy' in places.","It is impossible to avoid the Alice Through the looking glass comparison but this film does have its own direction.I enjoyed this movie, although it is a bit of an oddity.The film is quite long for an animation and can be quite dark in places. I don't know if this will unsettle smaller children (although I expect as I child I would have found buttons for eyes a lot less disturbing as I do as an adult) Its Subtle colours and lack of frantic action gives it a European feel. The score is mainly gentle piano pieces and some of the sets are satisfyingly creepy.This is not a Disney movie no Elton John sound track or cloy characters. Some of the set pieces are very fanciful indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful Flick,"This odd little film turned out to be one of the best kid-type films I've seen in awhile. Mind you, little-little kids under the age of 6 or so may find some parts a bit un-nerving but older kids (like my nephew Sam who's 10) really got into it. Sam has the attention span of a gnat but he sat all the way through this, rapt with attention (which can't be said for the travesty of a film called ""Hotel For Dogs"", which found my nephew bored silly, making paper airplanes out of the empty Raisenettes box he had). Anyhow, this film has a magical, otherworldly feel to it with a great little message about ""being careful what you wish for"" throughout the movie. Dakota Fanning voices the sometimes bored, sometimes insolent, often frustrated Coraline perfectly. Teri Hatcher surprises here to, switching between the modern, impatient mother of Coraline's reality and the ""Other Mother"", a creepily saccharine character in the other realm. Ian McShane's ""Mr. Bobinsky"" is a hoot and it's always cool to see the comedic teaming of crazy Brit chicks French and Saunders as outlandish neighbor ladies with a penchant for taxidermy on their multiple scotty dogs (whether the dogs are ready to go to the ""great beyond"" or not). This film was cool and original. It may be too different for kids (and adults) who prefer the cookie-cutter Disney mold with predictable stories but for people who enjoy an interesting and darkly imaginative tale, this is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Making Up A Song About Coraline, She's A Peach, She's A Doll, She's A Pal Of Mine!","I ran out and bought this movie yesterday, first day that it was released on DVD. I watched in theaters and was kind of blown away by it. So I went out and bought it and watched it one and half times yesterday. So here it is, my movie of the day critique of Coraline. Directed by Henry Selick the very same director of the acclaimed, ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" I just knew it was going to be a real treat to watch. Fully comprised of stop-motion animation, and is the longest such movie yet. From the very first scene I just knew it was going to be a real gem. The animation is really creative and is really mind blowing, to think that each scene is handmade. I only have a few flaws and they're just personal pet peeves. I just thought that Coraline's character was a little snooty. But she's suppose to be that way, by no means is she a ""James"" or a ""Jack"". But that's all I really have as a negative comment. The music really did blow me away, a mystical and whimsical operatic tone. It really fit with the style of the movie. Coraline was colorful, beautiful, dark, and scary. I thought Dakota Fanning did a stupendous job playing Coraline, as she starts out a ungrateful, mean, rude, snooty little girl. Then develops into a more enjoyable character, risking her own mortality to save her family. And Terri Hatcher's portrayal of Coraline's ""Other Mother"" was really really great. Eerie in the beginning, and freighting towards the end. I cannot ramble on enough on what great directing, and acting was in this film. It really was a treat to watch, and a feast for the eyes at the same time. This film is really gorgeous and beautiful. And about as unique and can be, it's really original. I can't think of any movies that this story reminds me of. I loved the characters, all of them. I just thought it was really imaginative, and transports you to another world of magic, imagination, adventure and fantasy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Has a European Aura,"The stop-action is a little jumpy, but the concept designs were brilliant. The story is interesting and moves along at a clip. Visually, it stands alone within its genre. The same story could have been achieved with actors, but not the intended mood.And it is the mood aspect that will probably not find its way into the senses of most American audiences. Its aura is foreign. It embodies European-Gothic impressionism with dancing, marionette-like characters. It is dark and somewhat macabre. Even the music sounds foreign, though some of it is haunting and helps to provoke mood.Coraline is a masterpiece. It is not, in my opinion for kids under 8, but it really depends on the kid. As for adults, the film has the same entertainment value that can be found by mixing Toy Story with Cirque de Solei. If you enjoy these, you'll have a good time here.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A new Classic movie to remember,"I've always loved good kids movies, because good kids movies do more then entertain kids, they entertain the whole family (Not a good idea to bore the parents taking their kids to see a movie to tears with drek). I also have special movies of my own childhood, and I appreciate movies that really push things to the limit of what should be appropriate for children to see, old classics such as 'Return to Oz', 'A Mouse and Child', and 'Monster Squad' to name a few.This movie really seems to fit along those lines. It's not a simply happy tale like you might expect a kids movie to be, this movie has bite too it, hence the PG rating rather then a tame G rating. This movie also has some of the best work done on it I've seen in a while. I've seen stop motion before, even the latest one which I believe was the Corpse Bride. But this one was so well done, there were many parts of the movie, the majority of it, that was so well done, I could not tell it was stop motion. It looked far too good, more along the lines of CG films like Wall-e and Shrek. That takes skill and time and effort you never see in movies anymore, where making a quick buck is not the exception, but the rule.The story is simple at first, a girl moves to a new home, an old house that has been converted into a 3 level apartment, and is struggling to deal with her parents, who are hard pressed with their work and too busy or tired to deal with the attention demanding girl. She is forced to deal with her neighbors, a crazy and eccentric circus performer and two retired bickering actresses for neighbors, a black cat that gives her the creeps, and a typical loudmouthed and rambunctious boy named Wybie, short for Whyborn. He annoys Coraline (mostly because he is a boy and also because of the fact that he was raised out in the boonies, he has few social graces) but gives her a doll he found in his home, which for some reason is identical to Coraline. Not long after Coraline stumbles onto a strange small door in the gathering room of their flat, but finds the door is not only locked but leads to a brick wall. Its not until that night that Coraline follows a mouse (Her eccentric circus neighbor claims to train dancing mice in his home) to the door, but finds it now leads down a dark tunnel, which leads to a mirror image of her own home, only its populated by strange versions of everyone in her world. Mostly she finds it a dream come true, her 'Other' mother and father, everything Coraline wishes her real parents were, doting on her with gifts and attention, meanwhile her neighbors are transformed into successful versions of themselves and perform for Coraline's amusement. The only other difference is that everything and everyone in this other world has buttons for eyes, and as Coraline visits this place every night, she is offered the chance to stay and be happy if she replaces her own eyes with buttonsI honestly think this movie should be something every child should see. It has moments in it that are so dark and twisted it reminded me of such things as the Silent Hill games, so I'd say make sure your kid does not scare easily. But then again kids need something to scare the snot outta them once in a while, it builds character. Too many things now are pacified, defanged and declawed, left harmless. This movie is sweet and endearing, but can also make you writhe in your seat and even jump from it at times (the 3D does tend to help with this). Honestly I have to say that this movie spooked me out a lot more then any horror movie I've seen in recent memory. It's use of subtle changes and twisting images that we would normally find comforting and safe to be concerning and insecure. I'm immediately reminded of such films as Return to Oz where everything we remembered from the first movie was rendered stagnant, dangerous, and decrepit, leaving you to feel very unsafe in a familiar yet horribly unfamiliar environment.Hopefully, we will see more films like this, and maybe more film makers will be willing to put a bit more effort into their works, focusing on creating classics rather then market success. As for this film, I would recommend it to everyone. Give your kids a good scare, they could probably use one, as it builds character. If you are concerned about scaring your kids too badly, then make it a point to not admit your kids unless they are around 8 or 7. This story definitely reminds me of the older stories children were once told to scare them to sleep or keep them in line, though this one is far more entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It was very unique, and I mean that in a good way. The stop-motion style gave the movie a special charm. Each character and scene had so much detail, it felt like a lot of love and effort went into making it. It's different from the usual CGI movies, and that's what makes it so special.The characters were also great. Coraline, the main character, was easy to root for. She's brave and curious, which makes her a great lead. The other characters, like her parents and the mysterious Other Mother, were interesting too. They all added something important to the story.Overall, Coraline is a movie I'd definitely recommend. It's not just for kids; adults can enjoy it too.

What could I say about this movie that already hasn't been said a LOT before honestly?,"**Coraline: A Masterpiece of Animation**Henry Selick's *Coraline* is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant masterpiece of stop-motion animation. Based on Neil Gaiman's novella of the same name, the film transports audiences to a whimsical yet unsettling world filled with wonder and danger.At the heart of the story is Coraline Jones, a curious and independent young girl who finds herself feeling neglected by her busy parents. When she discovers a secret door leading to an alternate version of her home, she is initially captivated by the idealized world beyond. There, her parents are doting and attentive, her meals are sumptuous, and her room is filled with toys. However, as Coraline delves deeper into this seemingly perfect realm, she uncovers a sinister truth: the Other Mother, as she calls the mysterious figure behind this alternate reality, has a sinister plan in mind.The film's animation is simply breathtaking. Selick's team of artists has crafted a world that is both visually arresting and emotionally evocative. The intricate details of the sets, the expressive faces of the puppets, and the fluid movements of the characters bring the story to life in a way that few other animated films can match. The use of 3D technology adds depth and dimension to the visuals, immersing the viewer in the fantastical world of *Coraline*.Beyond its visual splendor, *Coraline* is also a compelling and thought-provoking story. The film explores themes of identity, responsibility, and the importance of family. Coraline's journey is a coming-of-age tale that resonates with both children and adults. As she confronts the challenges and dangers of the Other World, she learns valuable lessons about the importance of being true to herself and cherishing the love of her family.The film's characters are richly drawn and memorable. Coraline is a relatable and sympathetic protagonist, a young girl who is simply seeking love and attention. Her parents, while initially neglectful, ultimately prove to be caring and supportive. The supporting characters, such as the Beldam, the Other Mother's sinister counterpart, and the quirky neighbors, add depth and complexity to the story.*Coraline* is a film that will be cherished and beloved for years to come. It is a masterpiece of animation that combines stunning visuals, a compelling story, and memorable characters to create a truly unforgettable experience. Whether you are a fan of stop-motion animation, a lover of dark fairy tales, or simply looking for a captivating film to watch with your family, *Coraline* is a must-see.",,Anonymous,Animation

Although the script is predictable, it is original and dark in the right amount, so keeps the viewer engaged. I loved the design of the garden of the alternative world, the family of neighbors in the real world, and the fight against the witch, and the decomposition of the fake world into a nothingness that is white.

Brilliantly creepy,"First of all I will start by saying that I absolutely loved 'Coraline.' It has a fantastic look and feel to it and, despite being (amazingly crafted) 'stop motion' puppets, contains more depth and storytelling than many 'live action' films. And, if you're in the UK at least, you'll see that it has a PG (parental guidance) certificate. That translates to most people that it's suitable for kids. Or is it? The answer is of course 'yes,' otherwise it wouldn't have got that rating. However, it's worth noting that the general 'themes' are pretty dark in this movie, meaning that parents who have children who aren't really into anything too heavy may want to research this film a little deeper before deciding on whether their children should watch it or not.Many people have – pretty rightly – said that it's like something directed by (typically Gothic) Tim Burton and seeing as Coraline also utilises puppets compares it to 'A Nightmare Before Christmas.' The two certainly do share a lot of similar traits, namely the dark creepy atmosphere and pretty frightening overall feel.In Coraline, the titular character is a young eleven year old girl who moves to an old (spooky!) house in the middle of nowhere with her parents. Now, although her mum and dad aren't the worst people in the world, they're pretty busy with their jobs (aren't we all?) and don't always have as much time for their daughter as they would probably like. This, in turn, leaves Coraline to her own devices. And, while exploring her new home, she comes across a door to another world – one where everything is the same, only better. She has a perfect house, populated by different (i.e. perfect) versions of her parents who love and dote on her. Or do they? Naturally, as the story progresses Coraline discovers the old saying 'Better the devil you know,' because things in this 'other world' are certainly not all they seem (and I'm not just talking about the fact that everyone there has buttons for their eyes!).I won't do into too much detail regarding the plot, as I wouldn't want to spoil it. I will only say that the look and feel of the film is perfect, as is the acting and storytelling, making it pretty much as perfect as it can get. Also, just because the film is rated a PG, don't think that adults won't enjoy it. I often wonder whether if you were to remake Coraline with real actors as opposed to puppets, it might actually get a 15 or 18 rating, as the story would end up being something more like 'The Ring, The Grudge,' or 'Dark Water' in its theme and tone.So, if you like your horror films, don't write this one off as just another 'kids' movie' – it's so much more. But, as I said to begin with, if you're thinking of watching it with very little children, check what's in store for them before you let them watch it. This may be stop motion, but it's nothing like anything the much-loved Aardman studios have ever done!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A serious presentation in an animation,"The movie may look like it's solely aimed at kids audience with it being animated and the story base is centered on an adolescent girl, but it sure hides a very serious presentation of the story developments. Despite having so much fantasy themed developments here and there but the movie nicely incorporates significant mood and tonal changes in the mix that really charged things up as one watches this movie. The characters nicely developed in their own unique final product that adds so much nuances to the movie and enriching the story as a whole. The overall coloration really supports the whole story, and also the contrasted coloration choice in the 'other' world. I really like how the movie presented moments that might resemble horror movies' jump scares. The voice acting is nicely well. Dakota Fanning did enough in giving life to her role. Teri Hatcher really did well in livening the two opposite characters she voiced.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

But more importantly, it is in absolutely no way suited for children. It is deeply rooted in the genre of horror movies and makes ample use of fear-producing settings and techniques. Starting off in a clumsily drawn situation many children can relate to - being misunderstood by their parents - it begins to address the topic of imagination as a helper in difficult situations. Here, a wonderful opportunity lay at hand to in pictures talk to children about the themes of emotional over-strain and retreat and the dangers that are associated with it. However, the movie from then on completely fails to make use of this possibility and regresses into an imbecile fight against a fuzzily, badly painted antagonist. This antagonist is anything but stringent, it switches back and forth between different clichés and it is obvious that the makers of this movie do not have any creativity in themselves at all to create a coherent vision. To make up for this lack of imagination, the movie is filled up to the rim with horror scenes, much too much for anyone below 14 at least, I would say. Even my partner and me were stunned by such an unnecessary use of fear-creating. The psychological insight of the creators does not go any further than randomly inserting some references to the constructive and destructive side of love. When you think that you completely wasted your money, it gets even worse, as the story is from a possible closing again forced into a second rising, giving additional prove of the complete loss of creative vision and inability of storytelling of the makers. It is a disgrace how this movie is presented as being in the tradition of Alice, Amelie, or others. It is not. Do not pay to be made sit through a complete failure.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Really good, but definitely shouldn't be PG",I think this is a really exceptional movie but it's pretty scary and ASTONISHINGLY dark. Definitely SHOULD NOT BE PG. Just the dark story that revolves around it can be really disturbing if the added a bad ending. Probably should be pg-13 and if there was a dark ending definitely R.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline is an elite horror masterpiece in the mold of A Nightmare Before Christmas,"My daughter and I recently rewatched Coraline (2009) in IMAX 3D. The storyline follows a family who moves into a new, old, mysterious house. Coraline discovers a strange door, which her mother helps her unlock. As she ventures through the door, she finds an alternate reality where her ""other"" parents make all her dreams come true. But as she considers staying in this seemingly perfect world, she must decide if things are too good to be true.Directed by the iconic Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach), the film features the voices of Dakota Fanning (Man on Fire), Teri Hatcher (Tomorrow Never Dies), Keith David (Requiem for a Dream), John Hodgman (Baby Mama), and Ian McShane (John Wick 2).This film was clearly designed with 3D in mind-the effects are incredibly immersive and draw you into its universe. The animation is brilliant, creating a mysterious and creepy atmosphere that perfectly complements the story. There are some fun sequences that build intensity and charm, like the circus, slug, and theater scenes. The characters are unique and unpredictable; I especially loved the neighbors April and Miriam. The villain is tremendous and very well executed, and Keith David as the cat was a perfect choice. And who can resist Wybie? The ending delivers a classic horror punch and is well executed. There's so much to love about this film.In conclusion, Coraline is an elite horror masterpiece in the mold of A Nightmare Before Christmas. I'd rate it a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A dark but captivating animation,"A lonely girl by the name of Coraline, mostly ignored by her busy parents, finds a door in a wall which, at night, leads her to another world where she can have everything she wants. Furthermore, all people she knows from the real world have duplicates there, with buttons instead of eyes, which behave flawless when it comes to Coraline. As you would expect, what seems perfect is most likely not to be true, and the young girl is about to discover a dark secret which might affect the rest of her life.It's a dark animation which presents a post-apocalyptical world in which a lonely and unhappy girl is tempted into a dream place which seems to fulfill her every wish. It's beautifully animated, well written, with unique characters and a very interesting plot. Unfortunately, it lacks in terms of action and to my disappointment, it features a highly anticipated and predictable finale which sorts everything out almost out of nowhere and at a blink of an eye. It could have been an extraordinary piece of animation, and partly it is, but falls a bit behind the masterpieces due to its unconvincing and rushed finale but also due to its lack of action.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Up there with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""!","Coraline is one of those movies you just can't deny has something great to it.After a slow start presenting the 11-year old Coraline's family and their relationship to us, the movie takes us all the way to another world in which her family is everything she ever wanted them to be.But something is wrong and she soon finds out.When Coraline enters the other world you'll see the immense amount of artistry that's put into the design of the movie with lots of great designs of both landscapes and character design.A great debut for Laika Entertainment which puts them as a competent player in the stopmotion industry. Worth watching at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coated with a bizarre sense of imagination and nightmarish undertones.,"For Coraline Jones—an imaginative, free-spirited young girl burdened with the curse of workaholic, dispassionate and distanced parents—her life up until now can more or less be summed up as a typo; a careless error of mispronunciation or just incompetence. Life it would seem is just a series of misfortunate, boring mistakes that aren't her fault; she's lost within a world of greys and pale-skinned coffee addicts lacking her own shades of vibrancy and lust for adventure. Seeking some sort of escape from her dreary reality, Coraline finds refuge in a distant home that fulfils her every whim and desire. Yet the people who provide this—her parents who are an eerily chirpy polar opposite of their real counterparts—don't offer such a paradise for young Coraline's gratis benefit. No, they want her eyes, the key to the soul and her only way back to the smoggy and bleak landscapes of her totally boring existence.Telling this tale that will be familiar to most audiences, Coraline is a feature that mixes the absurd and artistic with the jarringly authentic to startling effect. In fact, despite the screenplay's tendency to get bogged down by the narrative's overly familiar web of themes and plot devices, the majority of the movie surprisingly transcends the usual ho-hum formula present within too many of today's children's features. Instead Coraline with its cerebrally engaging aesthetic and bizarre sense of reality offers an experience that adults will probably enjoy a little more than their younger counterparts. Yes, it's true that children will still find plenty to latch onto a enjoy here—but the truth is that Henry Selick here twists and spins an experience bursting with thematic subtext, gorgeous imagery and some wacky characters who stay true to established formula without coming off tired and mundane. Existing somewhere between the realms of Nightmare Before Christmas and Pan's Labyrinth lies the dual realities of Coraline Jones in all their mesmerizingly off-key beauty.Taking centre stage for our story is of course Coraline herself, who, despite falling a little flat at times nevertheless gives the feature a subtle sense of overriding intelligence. Indeed, there's a distinctly modern and witty prevalence to Coraline's nature that echoes last year's Juno without stuffing it into the viewer's face. While a key element to the young, adventurous protagonist is in fact her intelligence, it is instead her short-sightedness that provides the movie with its central pulling power. For Coraline, the thought of escaping her drab life on her side of the wall in order to live with her much more loving and caring family who cook her lush meals, compose songs in her name and create vast gardens modelled after her face—the temptation is almost enough to shut the door on her ""other, other Mum and Dad"" and instead live in luxury coated with a bizarre sense of imagination and nightmarish undertones.Conveyed wonderfully by a mix of creepy animation, lighting and Bruno Coulais' score however, the world that Coraline escapes to at night often carries with it an ominous, sinister underbelly hidden from clear view. In this world, dreams indeed come true, but rather than play the piano itself; the piano instead plays you. It is during these segments that the feature takes its most compelling form, mixing surreal imagery with awe-inducing set pieces combining otherworldly music with the bizarre, contorted animation style that Selick is distinctly known for. The only problem with such moments however is that they only draw attention to the extremely dry and monotonous nature of Coraline's reality; at the beginning of the movie we see her decree her new home as utterly boring, and yet it isn't until the later parts of the film that we truly emphasise with her. Of course, such a polarising element is a double edged sword that conveys the movie's central themes with poignancy, but perhaps with too much of a vigour (or lack of such).Despite the many instances of jarringly unsettling gloom and doom however, there exists a prevailing sense of whimsy charm to much of Selick's feature here that has been hidden under the floorboards of all his major works. Indeed, while Coraline boasts plenty of scenes that top even the grimmest of horror movies in terms of establishing mood, atmosphere and tension—it is the central character, her struggle and the magical world that she finds herself in that makes that largest impression. Again, children will surely enjoy it on a purely ostensible level but adults will no doubt be able to latch onto the feature's thick subtext and eerie surrealism that provides something notably childish, but placed within the manipulative world of adults. In this vein, Coraline achieves a tone akin to most well known nursery rhymes or bedtime fables—cute, whimsical and told with a melancholic melody in tow; but sinister, broken and deeply rooted in the darker side of the imagination all the same.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Animation
"Why were you made? It's kind of alright, that's why.","When the title is simply the protagonists name, I cannot help but think that if that is the creativity you put into the title, how good can the movie be?But of course, I saw it because it's stop-motion.Even ""A girl called Coraline"" or ""Go ask Coraline"" would have been better.I feel that the general concept that Gaimon (pronounced ""Geimon"" apparently) has the potential to be really terrifying but neither the book nor this really tap that potential. It's not the fear factor but the darkish, fantasy ride that is the selling point here.Coraline herself has far more personality than she did in the book as a spiteful girl, helpless to the forced relocation inflicted upon her by her workaholic parents and unlike Chihiro from Spirited away, she actually changes gradually with the narrative, not all at once close to the beginning. The addition of the boy character for a foil was very prudent.Grotesque and spectacular with an OK plot, it's the sheer artistry that makes this rewatchable, not the story telling that is creepiest by far in the first act.There is a subtle pathos that this is a young girl presented with her ideal world and that world is just to get more attention from her parents.Sadly, we'll never get the creepy version of this story.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Sweet,"Sometimes it's just curiosity.A quick diversion. I'm currently in Belfast, and loving it. I've had a strange fascination with this city's history over the last forty years and it's somewhat strange to be amongst names I remember so vividly from my past. As evocative as ""I counted them out.."" to me is ""after another night of violence in "".One reason I'm enjoying myself so much is I'm staying smack bang in the centre of the city, walking distance of the recently rebranded QFT as well as two multiplexes. And this city centre is so familiar, yet so not English. (I probably mean not American.) Customary eating chains are not to be seen, or are at least few and far between.But now we have Victoria Square. A cathedral of glass and shopping topped by an Odeon in all its smelly popcorn stickiness, and surrounded by all the usual food simulating suspects. (I won't name them.)I'm nearly there. Hang on.Admission price fairly hefty, but I do get a fancy pair of spectacles. For this is Coraline 3-D. Only  not wow. For in the interminable pre-show there are trailers for any number of coming-soons – all in 3-D. I'm 58 now. I've seen it all before, but there's no denying, 3-D is here to stay.The film? It was OK.

Visually Rich and Delightfully Scary,"The first time I watched this film, I was amazed by its vibrant and beautiful colors, yet it was also very scary. I watched it as a child, and to this day, I am still in awe of Coraline's visuals. It has even influenced me in my design work. I love how the film contrasts colors to depict the real world and the illusion. The story's idea is also fresh and captivating, especially about the button eyes and the other mother, by design and story both are amazing:))))). But looking back, Coraline was truly terrifying and haunted me for several nights before I could sleep. AWESOMEEEE and SUPERBB!!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enchanting Start, Uneven Finish","Coraline starts off as a wonderfully dark and whimsical tale that immediately drew me in with its stunning stop-motion animation and eerie atmosphere. The first half of the film is a masterclass in storytelling, setting up a world that's both mysterious and captivating. Coraline's exploration of her new home and the strange characters she meets along the way is filled with a sense of curiosity and underlying tension that kept me hooked. The visual details are rich, and the animation brings a magical quality to the mundane, making even the simplest scenes feel special.However, when Coraline discovers the other side, the film's mastery starts to wane. While the concept of the alternate world is intriguing, the execution didn't quite live up to the promise of the first half. The story begins to feel predictable, and the initial sense of wonder and suspense gives way to more familiar horror tropes. I found myself less engaged as the plot unfolded, with the pacing becoming uneven and the tension dropping off.That's not to say Coraline isn't an enjoyable watch-it's a visually stunning film with a unique style and a memorable protagonist. But as much as I loved the setup, I couldn't help but feel that the second half lost some of the magic that made the beginning so special. The film's darker elements are still effective, and there's a lot to admire in its ambition, but the narrative could have used a bit more depth and surprise to match the brilliance of its opening act. Despite its flaws, Coraline remains a creatively bold film that's worth seeing, even if it doesn't quite sustain its initial enchantment.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a kids movie,First off this is NOT for kids. Teenagers more like it. I brought my 9 and 5 year old to it and didn't think it was appropriate for either of them. Seems this is grown up content wrapped in the lie of trying to play it off as a children s flick. I have not read the book myself but I am sure there are a lot more graphic scenes were left out. PG-13 is what it should have been rated with the grown up content and all around mean spirited nature of the movie. I would not recommend this to anyone bringing their kids to the movies to see a cartoon for some light get-a-way fun. Save the drama for the grown ups. I am tired of directors like this camouflaging mature material in a kids format.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Whimsical tale that doesn't have much to tell, animation similar to Tim Burton.","This is a generally visually interesting movie to watch, there's a lot of little touches here and there as eye candy but not really at the level required to prop up such a thin story, but overall the movie is pretty good and some of the scenes are really entertaining. The movie tends to have a slow pace with the storytelling developments that are similar to a young girl's imagination, brought to life through 3D animation looking like Tim Burton puppets for the most part.PLOT: Coraline a little girl with blue hair who feels invisible except to the creep loudmouth kid up the street who stalks her, a situation which really annoys her. She is totally dissatisfied with her parents choices for her, the just don't ""get"" it. They move into a large ancient pink house with a secret door in the wall.. the door leads somewhere very interesting yet there's something creepy going on... hmmmmm.. oh but the door beckons... and it's a welcome escape from this drudgery...plot development is thin and generally slow, a lot more effort could have been put into the richness of the script but there are some good animation scenes that show effort in that area at least. Worth a peek if you don't mind the slow pace, see it in complete darkness or in 3D as well for full effect. Some rather trippy scenes, but not groundbreaking.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Laika's Wonderful Debut,"While there aren't really that many mainstream animation studios that specialize in stop-motion today, the one notable standout besides Aardman is Laika inc. This studio constantly keeps pushing the limits of what stop-motion is capable of while also telling powerful gripping stories with dark themes and intriguing characters. So when their first feature film came out in 2009, it was inevitable that it would get an Oscar nomination. Coraline, based off the book of the same name by Neil Gaiman, was directed by Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick, and what a bang up job he pulled off.The story itself focuses on a little girl named Coraline Jones who moves into a new home with her family. Once in it, she discovers a parallel world hidden behind a secret door. While the world seems bright and cheery at first glance, it actually contains a dark and sinister secret that Coraline must face to get back to the real world. With a premise like that, there are bound to be some dark obstacles on the way, and the film never shies away from showing the true horrors from the alternate world. From Coraline's other mom and dad, to the buttoned eyes on everyone, to the neighborhood cat who might know more than meets the eye, this film creates a prefect contrast between the real world and the sinisterly dark surreal world.As for the characters, Coraline herself does start off kinda moody like any child, but she still remains likable enough to sympathize with, and her encounter with the supernatural makes her become very brave and worth rooting for. Her real parents may seem rather moody and slobbish, but they're only looking out for what's best for her, and it's hard not to feel sorry for them given how hard they work to support themselves. Also, Coraline's other mother is one of the creepiest villains in cinema history, as she seems trusting at first, but then becomes one of the freakiest creatures ever conjured up in cinema. Other characters like Wybie, Mr. Bobinsky, April & Miriam and the cat support Coraline to help confront her fears in the alternate world (especially compared to their heinous alternate forms), and they're memorable enough to leave an impression from their eccentricities alone.Even for a first time feature by a then brand new studio, the animation is very impressive. It's able to create a unique contrast between the gloomy real world and the alternate world. While the alternate world looks somewhat colorful, bright and creative at first, its true colors shine with many neutralized and grim backgrounds and colors that really help bring out the dark atmosphere to all new heights. The characters themselves look somewhat grotesque yet still look appealing, the character animation is very smooth and lively, and the sets look fantastically well crafted. Even the effects (which were either done by hand or on computers) stand out from how vibrantly sketchy and twisted they look.When I think of a dark fantasy film for the whole family, this is what I think up of. A film where its creativity in visual imagery starts off sweet and charming, but then takes the huge risk of showing a whole new world with disturbing creatures to show kids the meaning of fear. And what really helps are the fantastic surreal imagery, the spooky voices, the spot-on music score and the film's message to appreciate what you have because the grass is always greener on the other side. This frightening yet well executed message can stick to any person for how simple yet effective it is, and for it's mature honesty, that is why this film remains one of my favorite movies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The same happens with CORALINE, just that she says people as how she wants them to be. Having said that, this is by no measure bad cinema ad in fact it's interesting too. Just we need to be patient.The whole animation is done like the ones we used to see in our childhood and those were puppets used in stop-motion cinema, so we have wooden made faces here and not the standard animation. Well, the design and the look is not so appealing or to say the least gorgeous as it is old fashioned. Yet, a few aficionados of those good old times may like this.The cinematography is good and at times is just awesome in terms of the way we are revealed those things what Coraline sees in her adventure. The costumes too are well suited too, to make it look a but creepy and something that we are certainly willing to know. Above all, acting and the concept is one thing that ail make it a watch, if all else is something that we are not much interested in. Dialogues are just there as if we speak lines naturally and at times out of place too, so much praise to writing here.So that's mostly about it, a good animated film that is not a must watch but not a must miss either.

Breathtaking,"This film is probably the most creative and imaginative film out there. It combines a childlike whimsy with a clever twist and a creepy touch that makes it so unique. The visuals alone with impressive stop motion work, stricking charactures, and use of colors and textures make this film a work of art. Combined with the music that is a little like a querky french lulaby for some scenes and a jazzy fanatsy in others Coraline feels like a vibrant journey that is both dreamlike and a little nightmarish.
Henry Selick creates two worlds in this film. The first a realitic everyday world where hard work and responsiblity rule and where a grey hue and sense of gloom hangs over everyone and everything in sight. In contrast Selick creates another world through a small door in the wall that is a magical dreamlike world packed with vivid color that holds a kelidoscope of wonders. Selick places careful clues throughout the film that foreshadown the danger that awaits in a the seemingly perfect other world that can only fully be appriciated if the film is re-watched (I've seen it at least 20 times by now and am still noticing hidden images.) His attention to detail is impecable. Even if the button eyes make you feel uneasy this film is a must-see, there are few films that can come close to the fantastical masterpeice Henry Selick has created",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm Selick's OTHER Classic,"""Coraline"" fits in well in the proud tradition of child traumatizing animated films. It is a PG-rated movie that absolutely earns that rating, unlike a ""Tangled"" or ""Frozen"" which should get a G-rating. For some the creepiness of this movie is what keeps them away from the film. But that is exactly what makes this film so captivating and memorable.The stop motion animation works perfectly with the creepy aesthetic of this film. Stop motion always worked better for Halloween than it did for Rankin Bass Christmas. The film was originally released in pre-Avatar 3D. There are a few scenes where you can tell that it was framed to look impressive in 3D. This can be a little distracting at times, but it can lead to some entertaining visuals.There are some stretches where the movie can feel a bit like a video game side quest. There is a detour that feels like it is just padding the runtime. There are two female characters, April and Miriam, who have a scene that is just...too much. I find myself skipping it every time I go to watch it. The movie also loses some momentum as it gets to the ending.But with those critiques out of the way, if you like creatively scary animated films, this is the film for you. The animation, voice acting, and music are all top-notch. This film is a terrific start to Laika's animation studio.If you're tired of your old boring nightmares, then this is just the fuel you need for some new night terrors.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A wonderful step into the future of animation,"A young girl (Fanning) finds a secret world where her reality is changed into everything she has ever wished for.Marking the dawn of a new age Coraline brought neutrals and fans into theatres across the world as we viewers start to implement ourselves in the new 3D age.Though not the first 3D picture this was marked as the first stop motion animation to be shot entirely in 3D and what an accomplish this is. Plaudits all around the world rightly justified the achievement made in order to adapt the Neil Gaiman novel. The effects really are superb. Back over a decade ago Selick's renowned picture The Nightmare before Christmas was likewise a sharp advance in the animation world.The days before Pixar are almost forgettable exempt for cartoon Disney. And rightly so that picture still remains a classic, and where this doesn't have the panache of that hit, it should be praised for the breathtaking visuals and bewildering dark plot.The impressive title sequence with all the knitting works a treat as we see the scale of the task of 3D working away magically. And though we don't know it yet this little sequence shapes things to come.The first couples of plot events are pretty standard social setting with Coraline isolated and looking for things to do. And at first the blue haired child is certainly aggravating. Her constant whining and bothering with her parents are reminiscent of today's modern youthful stereotype. Nevertheless Coraline's curiosity and imagination are to be admired and as the plot gets darker and more dangerous, the title character becomes easier to watch. The collection of characters together make interesting viewing as ""The other mother"" demonstrates a delicious slice of hidden evil whilst it is wonderful character development regarding the father figure in both worlds. The black cat is great fun for the kids as well.This concept regarding the two worlds is highly imaginative and a wondrous challenge to tackle as we viewers join Coraline as she tries to decode her own reality and desires. The weaving of emotions into dreams makes everything juicy and springy. The contrasts of positives and negatives, dreams and nightmares and good and evil are all present with a script thriving on drama and fantasy.The scene settings are picturesque to capture the plot's ever changing moods whilst the lighting and animation consistently spill the goods.However given everything that works in the making of this, there are still a few major doubts. For one the plot isn't what you would describe as excellent as the dialogue in the action sequences make for questioning. There can also be too much talk at frequent significant stages where more action would have been better placed. And in all honesty, a large proportion is conventional fantasy and drama. The kid hates her family, wants escapism; the bad people are egotistical and script-fully inevitable.Though the original nature of his previous smash is missing Selick really has created a spellbinding picture, and let the animation development continue.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Horror Fantasy Gem,"Based on the book written by Neil Gaiman, ""Coraline"" (2009), is the movie representative of the saying, ""be careful what you wish for"". It is a dark fantasy children's horror directed by Henry Selick, and though the target audience is older children, the film can disturb adults just as much.We are introduced to 11-year-old girl, Coraline Jones, an only child that is given the bare minimum of attention by her busy parents. With hardly anyone or anything to entertain her at her new home, she is seduced by the Other World, a magical place accessed by the small door in her house. She is greeted by her Other Mother and Other Father who are the complete opposite of her heavily-occupied parents and willingly entertain her to the fullest. This captivating place attends to each and every one of her desires, and with each visit, she is even more tempted to stay at this dream come true of a place. However, little does Coraline know she is walking straight into the lion's den as this enticing place is not what it appears.As a horror fantasy, Coraline perfectly executes the rollercoaster ride of emotions you should receive - from the increasing feeling of impending doom, to being overwhelmed by the stunning and meaningful visuals. Every emotion is enhanced by the voice acting, music, lighting, and colors that wonderfully compliments each scene.Even without knowing the genre beforehand, the audience will know Coraline is a horror. Coraline perfects the must-have element of a horror movie: making the viewer uncomfortable from the sense of foreboding. The suspenseful atmosphere the movie builds from the start keeps you uneasy until the end where only then you can finally breathe in relief. The opening scene has music that makes you curious and interested in what's to come, and the scene is accented with an eerie green tone. The contrast between the scene that is happening and the beautiful, yet dark, music plants the seed of feeling unsettled in the viewer, and the clear foreshadowing of upcoming danger from various characters only adds onto that feeling.The voice acting could not be more perfectly executed. When warning Coraline about the potential danger she is in, the characters' voices subtly change to something more serious in contrast to their usual quirkiness, and it is emphasized by the low piano music played in a minor key. In my opinion, the most notable voices were The Cat and The Other Mother and Father. Just from The Cat's voice, he gives off a feeling of sarcasm, intelligence, and a relaxed sense of confidence. When he hints at the danger that Coraline is walking into, you can't help but believe he is telling the truth, despite how sarcastic and rude he is. The Other Mother speaks in a mother-like tone for the majority of the movie, so the few times when her voice naturally changes to something more sinister, it precisely strikes fear into the hearts of the audience. This is the same for the Other Father. He usually speaks in a carefree happy tone, so hearing his personality and tone almost flipped, it shows us that everything about this world is not what it seems and that Coraline really is in danger like the other characters warned. When the climax happens and the audience realizes what the danger is, the music adds onto the anxiety and fear by playing its loudest most impactful piece that forces the viewer to realize the direness of the situation. The usual voices we hear during this time could not sound more haunting, truly making Coraline a horror movie. We know something bad is going to happen soon - it's just a matter of when.Unexpectedly, the fantasy aspect works in amplifying the horror. In a world that seems to be a dream come true, it's hard to expect something bad is going to happen, yet it's a feeling we can't get rid of when watching this film. Coraline goes above and beyond to make any person want to leave their world and go to the magical place she is frequenting. The visuals keep you wondering if everything was really handcrafted or if it's all secretly CGI but the behind scenes prove the former. You can take a screencap during any point in the movie and show it to someone who has not watched it and they will get the gist of what is going on. This is because of the lighting and colors. In the Other World, everything is vibrant, magical, and void of everything that may be deemed boring. The combination of color and lighting in this world brilliantly captures the main feeling and focus of each scene. It is often orange and bright which is convincing enough to show us that the Other World is fun, warm, and perfect, just what Coraline wants. Coraline boldly plays with various colors and is not afraid to dim the lighting just enough to amplify the horror effect. In Coraline's world, everything is mundane, dull, and gloomy. More often than not, the coloring is a cloudy gray, sometimes with cool blue undertones, to show there is no place that is fun in her world. I believe this extreme contrast in color and lighting delivers the temptation of staying in the Other World.Coraline is a classic stop-motion horror fantasy gem that I recommend to everyone regardless of age. For those who want a unique take on horror fantasy, Coraline is made for you. It is a movie with layers of depth - the type of movie where no matter how many times you watch it, you will experience the same ride of emotions and even discover something new. As I watched the movie, I could not help but feel there was no ""wasted"" scene - all scenes were necessary for the story. The Other World's elements that make anyone want to stay there adds to the horror simply because they do not change even after we realize the danger. With every part meticulously crafted with symbolism, music, colors and lighting that pairs perfectly with every segment, Coraline will leave a lasting feeling of creepiness for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some magic lost in translation,"I absolutely love stop motion animation so I feel almost guilty not loving this movie. The book is wonderful and they do nail a few scenes but mostly it felt like it was trying to copy the book exactly instead of making it its own. The voice acting is great and in theory I didn't have an issue with the addition of the neighbour kid. He never seemed to quite mesh with the story and I don't know that it even needed him in order to smooth out the story with exposition.So much time and effort went into this but I was not really floored by the visuals or the story execution. As much as I love stop motion, it has so much time required to make it and then you have to make it a good movie too. This one falls into the same category as Anomalisa in that it is visually impressive but falls flat as a complete story.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best animation ever!,"There are many amazing animated films out there and I have seen a lot still, in my mind, Coraline is one of the best. I must have watched it a thousand times ( not literally of course) and I enjoy it every time. What is it about this film that stirs me. I think one of the reasons also is the unique music. It awakens something in me that's ancient and mysterious. Put it together with the amazing animation, background location and story it is an eternal winner. Sort of reminds me of Pan's Labyrinth just not as severe in plot!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline,"Coraline is a journey of the imagination. With great visuals and highly creative story telling this movie will be sure to be one that has a great following of salivating fans. With an endless number of twists and a story that draws you in, Coraline delivers an exciting three dimensional experience. The film is a masterpiece. You will be amazed by the 3d, the story and the great visuals. One minor warning would be that the movie is not really one for children. A cartoon it may be, yet it takes a mind that is developed at least to the age of twelve to really get something out of it. This was proved to me by the 8 year old sitting next to me who was watching and continually asking its mother, ""what happened?"". Also there is a moment of near cartoon nudity. Pasties, I think they call them? But a great movie for teens and adults for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

GREAT movie - but could've been more scary!,"It's Halloween evening and we've done loads of spooky activities which include watching the new movie ""Coraline"". Now, if you expect this to be like ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" then you will be disappointed. It takes at least 40(+) minutes for the plot to darken and have capability to scare. The thing to do is to just bear with it and patiently give the film time to hot itself up because it's quite spooky when it does. Even when it isn't scary, it's good fun to watch. At the same time, though, it's not too scary for children of at least 8.Coraline is not the gentle, innocent girl you may expect - she's extremely fiery and with spirit.It's a great film - nice to see it done traditionally with puppets - but not for you if you want to be scared out of your wits.

Disturbing & creepy animated feature...,"1st watched 10/18/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir- Henry Selick): Disturbing & creepy animated feature from the Director who brought us ""The Nightmare B4 Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" This story is about a young girl who is not happy with her current life and the lack of attention she gets. She is given a doll that looks suspiciously like her by a neighbor's grandmother and then while asleep is introduced to another world thru a hole-in-the-wall where everything is the way she'd like it to be(except everyone has buttons for eyes). She likes this other world until she's told they have to give her buttons for eyes as well, and she would prefer this not to be done to her. At this point in the story, this alternate world becomes very evil and the other world's mother is revealed to just want to possess her(which she's apparently done to many other children). This is where the story becomes out of whack and never really recovers. I think the other problem with this movie is the lack of humor. There aren't any characters that provide this, so you're treated with this crazy girl's mixed-up reality that goes haywire but nothing brings you out of it. The animation is really well done and very unique at times but the story doesn't have much of a heart. What's lost is the ""why"" behind everything. The girl really doesn't learn any real lessons and no characters are very interesting except maybe the cat that talks in the alternate world. So basically, this movie is technically well made, but not a good movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Eerie and Beautiful,"I was eleven when this movie came out, I loved it, but getting older I have really come to appreciate the eeriness and beauty of it. This movie is definitely one of my favorites. I basically have all the words memorized. ;P Coraline and Nightmare Before Christmas are my two favorite stop-motion movies. This movie is has such a beautiful eeriness to it, it's hard to explain. Basically every adult I know has said this should be PG-13 just because of how creepy it is. Let's get into details then, shall we? The animation is beautifully done! The movements of all the characters is great and all the extra background stuff is great too. The voice actors do an amazing job at putting emotions into their characters voices and I applaud them for that. The visuals are stunning, especially in the garden scene, and the web one towards the end. The dialogue is great. I love that they really captured the essence of Coraline's age. They did good at writing how an eleven year old would act in this situation. The music is STUNNING and probably one of the best parts of the movie. It has a child-like quality but was dark and creepy at times, which is the perfect blend for this movie. And it was placed at the right moments. Props to Bruno Corlais for that. It's hard to explain how amazing this movie is, but I gave it a shot. I recommend this for anyone who wants to see a movie done right. It truly is beautiful.

Good on the Art but Who is the Story for?,"I have to give kudos for the creativity design of this movie, as its full of neat animations. But it fall short on story.

I might be biased towards having meaning in Stories, even OK with some good one time watches. But this, I could not recommend. I'm not even sure who their target audience is.Kids? No.Adults? No.Its too light for Adults and a bit weird for kids.But if your up for something a little different, and keep your exceptions kinda low, it is a light fun adventure with a bit of mystery to enjoy.

Another Ho-Hum Derivative Fantasy,"If imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, then ""Coraline"" delivers high praise to quite a few books and stories. However, the imitation here seems to be the result of a paucity of ideas on the writers' part. Examine almost any plot element and without much work you'll find the classic from which it was plucked. The well into which something evil is thrown - Tolkien. The door in the wall - Alice in Wonderland. The mice - Cinderella. The form the witch ultimately takes - Snow White. And on it goes.I love movies, but this one was so dull I found myself getting up to work on a project in the next room.

Every Story Has Two Sides To It,"""You probably think this world is a dream come true, but you're wrong,"" said the cat to Coraline. This warning to Coraline (Dakota Fanning), in the film Coraline (2009), is something she has had in her head since the beginning. The director, Henry Selick, has made other mother movies that are also stunning. Richard Roeper compares Henry Selick's work: ""Writer/director Henry Selick follows The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach with another meticulously crafted visual gem."" This movie is visually stunning which intensifies the creepy scenes and leaves the audience frozen.The movie Coraline is all about a girl who moves into a new home with her father and mother (Teri Hatcher). He life is boring and dull and her parents pay no attention to her. Coraline is not able to do what she wants and explores he new house and finds a small door. However it is all bricked up, but that night she finds the door again and the bricks are gone and she goes through. Coraline gets to the parallel world and meets her ""other"" mother (also Teri Hatcher). Everyone in the world has buttons instead of eyes. Her ""other"" mother and ""other"" father treat her as though she is the best thing in the world. Coraline is amazed with this other world and when she falls asleep she wakes up back in the real world. She thinks its all a dream until the next night where she goes back and she is faced with more wonders made by her ""other"" mother. She loves this world and never wants to go back to the real one.To make a good horror film it was said that, ""[ . . . ] by the time you get to the climax [ . . . ] your familiarity with the beast allows you to assess them in a different way"" (Fear in the Dark: A Spine-chilling History of Horror Film). Coraline fills this criteria and is a good horror film. I don't think it is for young children or people who are looking for the biggest thrill but it is creepy in its own way. Overall Coraline sends great societal messages and a cute but creepy movie to its audiences and both children and adults with love the horror and thrill for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline deserves a sequel!,"I really enjoyed this film and time and time again i come back to watch it because it is too entertaining.

Selick does a great job with the telling of this story and not once do i ever lose concentration from this film because every morsel of this film is good.The intricate characters like Mr. Bobinsky, Ms Spink and Ms Forcible give the film a quirky tone but also makes the story interesting and not stale if we only had one character to focus on. I also have to say that the music in the film is brilliant and the animators of the film did a remarkable job.One issue i did have with the film is that there wasn't a back story to how the other world came to be but i guess i am just being fussy because the film didn't really need any extra padding.So go see this film, it deserves a watch, or maybe a few watches",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A story told best this way,"Neil Gaiman is the Tim Burton of literature. While Tim Burton is making movies like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Corpse Bride"", Neil Gaiman is write novels such as ""Coraline"" and ""The Graveyard Book"". This is not a better person to bring this story to life than Tim Burton collaborator, Henry Selick. Coraline Jones is a young girl who feels neglected by her parents and doesn't want much to do with her neighbors Miss Spink, Miss Forcible, Mr. Bobinsky, and her new friend Wybie. While exploring her new house, she escapes to a strangely sinister, yet perfect world. She finds better parents, better food, and a better home. The only strange thing is: everyone has buttons for eyes. The more she spends time there, the more she realizes that it is not what she wanted. In this spooky tale, you will find great lessons of thankfulness and appreciation. However, it is not a movie you will want to be showing to sensitive or easily frightened children, as it is creepy and filled with abnormal images. I have read Neil Gaiman's original novel and, because it is such a visual and imaginative story, I think that it works better on screen. The stop-motion animation captures it better than another other form of storyteller could and it looks absolutely stunning.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beautifully Done Yet REALLY Trippy,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was visually dazzling, had a great cast of actors, and had a wonderful plot to it that taught a valuable lesson: things that seem too good to be true really are too good to be true, and never trust a stranger, no matter how nice and sweet they appear to be at first. I will admit that the movie is quite trippy, and even frightening in some parts, and certainly not meant for kids under the age of 10.

It uses fairly deep characters, with good character development to incise. And pulls this off without a hitch. It doesn't shy away from a few minor 3d scares either...something that i liked in monster house.All in all i think this movie works on many different levels. Kids and adults will enjoy.

"Mad, scary, wonderful- welcome to the world of Henry Selick","I was enchanted just by what I saw in the trailer- it just looked...weird. And weird is what I love. When I finally watched the film I was taken away to a strange, wonderful land- I feat only Guillermo del Toro has managed before. It was just so...imaginative. Every individual thing was so...individual- straight from the imagination of a genius, and I loved every minute. At times, maybe it goes a little over the top, and perhaps it is a bit long, but I'm willing to venture it's better than anything Tim Burton has every done. The difference is that I don't think Burton every quite gets it just right, and this really hits the spot. It's scary, really quite scary at times, but that's fine, I think children should be allowed to be subjected to that, was there never a film that terrified you as a child? But not only that, it's just a fascinating, mystical place, and the whole thing is just wonderful. It's worth watching just because it looks amazing, but with the plot and the imagination of a genius in there too it makes Coraline one to watch with the whole family.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great adaptation of another Neil Gaiman book,"I had never seen the film adaptation of Neil Gaiman's book, but after watching the trailer, I became curious. So I bought the movie on DVD, and after I watched it, I loved it. Henry Selick, the director of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, made the film in stop-motion animation, but I am not really interested in that film.Coraline Jones and her parents settle in Ashland, where they live in the Pink Palace Apartments, a converted mansion that they share with retired actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, as well as Russian circus performer Mr. Bobinsky. Coraline meets Wybie Lovat, whose grandmother grew up in the house. Together, they explore the area and stumble upon an ancient well on the hill above the house. Wybie is surprised that Coraline's grandmother agreed to rent to the Joneses, as she usually tries to find tenants without children. Coraline's mother gives her a ragdoll that resembles her. Intrigued, Coraline stumbles upon a small, locked door concealed behind wallpaper. Upon opening it, she discovers a hidden passageway instead of a solid brick wall, prompting her to crawl through it. On the other side, Coraline discovers the ""Other World,"" where button-eyed doppelgangers of her parents reside. The ""Other Parents"" seem warmer and more attentive than Coraline's real parents, particularly her ""Other Mother."" Coraline spends time with the fantastical Others, but when she falls asleep, she returns to her normal world, raising tension between her and her mother. During her third visit, a black cat warns her that not all is as it seems in the Other World.That's all I could tell you, folks. You'll have to see the film to find out how it ends. I am thinking of reading the original book. I know that is a bit unorthodox, but that's me. This is an awesome movie, very well written, and the animation is excellent.

One of the best movies I have ever seen.,"What a truly spectacular CGI masterpiece. The acting is superb, the effects are dazzling and the plot/storyline is placed together sensationally. Dakota Fanning leads the cast as an intelligent 11-year-old girl, who comes across a secret door that leads to an alternate universe. Teri Hatcher plays Coraline's hard-working mother, as well as Other Mother and she plays the part extremely well. Teri's performance is amazing, as is the rest of the cast.Whilst the target audience is probably for kids under 15, the story certainly relates to adults and is enjoyable for an all-round audience.The film is probably inappropriate for little kids, due to some scary and disturbing scenes, and some of the violence depicted exceeds a PG level. Coraline is a true masterpiece and is absolutely spectacular.Highly recommended!! You could probably benefit from reading the book before seeing the movie. A family/kids movie at its best!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Target Audience? Who Cares!,"Watching CORALINE, I was enthralled and puzzled. ""Exactly what audience is this type of animated feature shooting for?"" I asked myself. And it's not an easily answered one. On the surface, Coraline is an children's adventure story; the story of a little girl exploring her surroundings and finding a kind of Tim Burton-esquire rabbit hole leading to an alternate reality. But dig just a bit deeper and you hit a rather frightening layer closer to the truth behind what might be perceived as a kind of heaven and hell. But which is heaven and which is hell? These are the questions that linger throughout the film...Coraline's transplantation into a new home leads her to explore its surroundings. First bumping into Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr., THE HAPPENING) she learns that their new house has a history. Death has lurked not far away and looking at the landscape one quickly gets a sense of foreboding. A black cat (voiced by Keith David, CRASH) adds to this sense.Coraline's parents Mel (Teri Hatcher, THE DEAD GIRL) and Charlie (John Hodgman) don't have much time for Coraline, as they are trying to meet a literary deadline. So Coraline is left to her own devices and soon discovers a doorway to a much happier, alternate reality. Trouble is everyone there has buttons for eyes. But why? The reality is rather frightening and ghostly. So this isn't something young kids are going to enjoy nor understand. But it does have appeal. And, dare I say, it has appeal on a more intellectual level, even though much of the story can be dissected rather easily. But what parts aren't can, and will, linger in your mind for some time.This isn't WALL-E or some other cutesy Disney film. This is raw, unforgiving storytelling within a stop-motion animated feature with a clever design and nightmarish qualities. Think of it more along the lines of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas and you'll be closer, but not quite there.The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually. And when you see Coraline's Other Mother and Father on the downside of the rabbit hole, you get a knot in the pit of your stomach that tells you everything may not turn out well for our heroine or her family and friends.The voice actors all do an admirable job with special nods to Teri Hatcher as both Mel and the Other Mother. Her digression into this dangerous character were well played. And a big thumbs up to Keith David as The Cat. His voice was PERFECT and you really can't tell who's side he's on ...if any.This is something to watch and ponder. But not with the kiddies. This is a thought-provoking animated film for adults and teens.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Totally stunning visuals and a strong story give this film high, high marks","Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is a young girl with less-than-perfect parents. Her mother (Teri Hatcher) and dad are work-from-home writers trying to put out a gardening catalog, giving very little attention to their pre-teen daughter. Dad does the cooking but meals are less than optimal, also, as shopping sometimes gets rushed or overlooked. Then, too, they have moved their household to a fabulous old Victorian mansion in the sticks and Coraline misses her friends and former city abode very much. One day, her parents, working feverishly on their catalog, encourage, er, demand that Coraline explore her new house, for it has many rooms, nooks, and crannies. Finding a secret door, Coraline is perplexed to discover that the wall behind the door is bricked up. Yet, at night, a mouse draws her to the doorway and, lo and behold, a secret entrance has appeared like magic. Crawling through a tunnel, Coraline finds herself in an alternate world, where her new mother and father shower her with terrific meals and fun things to do. But, strangely, both of them, while looking like their real world counterparts in most ways, sport ""button"" eyes. Since Coraline finds a mysterious doll in her room, who likewise has buttons for eyes and Coraline's features, this is a mystery. But, because her second set of parents are so doting, Coraline can't wait to get back to their world the next night, even though she receives warnings from the neighboring ladies, a young country boy, and the eccentric Russian man who lives upstairs. Is this really a perfect world that Coraline has entered? Not on your life! This is a great film with absolutely stunning visuals, enhanced by 3-D glasses, if you are so fortunate to see such a showing. It would be difficult, indeed, to find a more colorful or imaginative animated film in all of cinema. Most viewers will be oohing and aahing at every turn. The story, too, is strong, interesting, and, even a bit scary for the preschool crowd, without someone's hand to hold. All of the actors voicing their parts, from Fanning to Hatcher to Ian McShane as the Russian man, are very fine, also. In short, Coraline is a terrific film for virtually everyone, young and old, following in the footsteps of such movies as Fantasia or The Nightmare Before Christmas. It is well worth the effort to bundle up the family and march on over to the nearest theater, for it is a ""big"" screen film in the scope of its breathtaking animation and it will generate contended sighs all around.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a trip?,"Coraline (2009) -What the actual f<<¥ did I watch?It was like the 'South Park' (1997-) creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, got Tim Burton high on Crystal Meth and they all made a film together that they thought would rival 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993) for it's dark oddity!The doll butchery within the first minute was absolutely terrifying. I don't look forward to the nightmares that will follow purely based on that opening sequence. Surely this film was not made for kids?I found myself making note after note as I progressed through the film, because I had to see it to the end to say I had, although it was a close call about turning it off, even from the outset, but with every new scene there seemed to be another WTF moment that I had to jot something down about.Initially the style of the art and the cartoon quality reminded me of 'The Moomins' (1977-82), due to a slightly Scandinavian appearance and it was obviously very similar to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993) and 'Corpse Bride' (2005). I was surprised to find that it wasn't one of Mr Burton's efforts at all.Something about it also reminded me of 'Pan's Labyrinth' (2006) and I thought that there might have been some inspiration from the artwork of Van Gogh or Edvard Munch thrown in there too.I definitely felt that the writers and artists had been pinching bits from all sorts of other sources, because there were also definite hints of 'Beetlejuice' (1988) with the parallel world reminding me of the sands of Neptune.And the game idea towards the end was akin to Dorothy taking on The Gnome King in 'Return To Oz' (1985) or more specifically the book 'Ozma Of Oz' by L. Frank Baum.I was really not sure that this one would interest kids if they could get past the terror of it in the first place, because it was just a bit too cerebral and far out. I didn't think that the characters were bright or interesting enough and they certainly weren't appealing. The two old ladies, Miss Forcible & Miss Spink, played by Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders were reminiscent of the Aunt's of 'James And The Giant Peach' (1996), while Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.) seemed to have a permanently broken neck. What was that all about? And his silent equivalent in the parallel world was absolutely terrifying, truly freaky.I suppose that I was intrigued by Coraline (Dakota Fanning) as a character and what would eventually happen to her, because surely neither set of parents, from ""Our World"" or the magical one, were fit to look after her and actually those from this realm were really quite awful, neglectful and absent. It was no wonder that Coraline was so keen to explore ways to escape and found the other world through the door in the wall.Sadly for her, it didn't appear to be a tale of ""Careful what you wish for"" or ""The grass is greener on the other side"", because both sides were pretty lousy options and I struggled to find any moral to the take at all.Some of the animation was more thoroughly thought out and better than other bits too, especially when it came to the movements.And the button eyes of the second family were scary as. I have a friend with an actual phobia of buttons and watching this I could see why.Everyone was so odd in their shape and general appearance, which didn't work as if had with Tim Burton's previously mentioned films, because this collection of ""People"" weren't essentially monsters in the underworld or a fairy land.The cat was evil and nasty to look at, perhaps he was meant to be an example of not judging a book by its cover, but I wasn't sure that much thought had been put in to the films moral philosophy as much as just making things as weird as possible.It was also hard to see the second house that Coraline visited as magical, because her actual home and environment was so odd to start with.I actually thought that it was a bit like a drugged up 'Beatles' music video, a modern take on 'Yellow Submarine' and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the whole production team had been high as a kite the whole time that the film was being made.I did have to see it to the end for the sheer spectacle of it all and it was definitely not made for children. It might have actually just been made for the producers, writers, etc's sake. A passion project maybe, because I can't imagine who they were targeting with this loopy mess.With some correction to the story and a clearer idea of whether it was for children, teens or adults (It would be a terrifying horror film if made with actors instead of animation), there might be potential for some of the elements explored, but not in its current state, as far as I'm concerned.It was probably a bit too surreal for me and it did freak me out. When I've tried to find words to discuss it with people, I've been too flabbergasted and struck dumb to get the words out, because it almost angered me as much as it confounded me.I've seen films of the Horror genre that didn't weird me out as much as 'Coraline', but I'm sure this film won't do that to me again, because I can't imagine a situation when I would ever put myself through a repeat performance of it.455.81/1000.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic adaptation of the book,"I took my whole family to see this movie last night, and everyone was in love with this movie. My two boys, aged 13 and 11, had both read the book and this is the first movie adaptation of a book that they were not disappointed with. The work was amazingly creative and a joy to watch.Definitely not a ""little kid"" movie, but quite suitable, I believe, for over 10 years old. The theater I saw the movie in did not have the 3-D support, and I think it was just as well, I don't get the new trend toward 3D, and it probably would have made it scarier.The claymation in the movie was a lot richer than the CGI films of recent times, but it was a bit choppy at times.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply amazing!!,"I have read the book multiple times and I have to say I haven't gotten tired of it. It has a magnificent and totally original storyline.And so does the movie. But, I have to say, that I'm 14, and even though it was rated PG, I STILL was creeped out a little bit. The friends that I saw it with were creeped out too. I would say 12 and up... not for children.But back to the review. I LOVED IT!! I didn't want it to be over!!!! Almost nothing was changed from the book, except for some events that happened and different times (like when Coraline receives the stone with the hole in it), AND for the Wybie character, which wasn't even in the book at all, and I thought there was really no point to it. And why the crazy old man was blue I'll never know....The animation was almost perfect!!! For a stop-action or stop-motion (whatever it's called) film, the flow of it was seamless. I loved the movie. Everything about it. If it got off track from the book, it somehow found a way to get right back on track. This movie was a visual masterpiece. I still can't believe someone actually made this into a movie, seeing as the book wasn't so popular, so a huge thanks for the people that made one of my favorite books to one of my favorite movies =].I think this movie definitely deserves on Oscar!!!! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Henry Selick and Neil Gaiman team up to give us a pitch perfect marriage of dark fantasy and stop-motion,"In the Pink Palace Apartments, young girl Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) has moved from Michigan with her mother (Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) with Coraline having left behind her friends and feeling disillusioned with her new home filled with eccentrics as her parents focus on deadlines for their writing. After meeting a weird kid named Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.), she's given a strange button eyed doll that bears a striking resemblance to her. In the midst of exploring the Pink Palace, Coraline comes across a small hidden door just big enough for her but has been strangely bricked off. Later at night, Coraline comes to find the door unblocked and leading to another world with a duplicate of the Pink Palace complete with its own denizens such as The Other Mother (Teri Hatcher) and The Other Father (John Hodgman) as the world is seemingly brighter and more fun than the real world, but overtime a dark undercurrent becomes impossible to ignore.Coraline is a 2009 stop-motion animated film from noted director Henry Selick and based on the 2002 novel of the same name by Neil Gaiman. Gaiman met Selick in 2002 just as he was finishing Coraline and having been a fan of Selick's work, the two collaborated on a feature film adaptation together. Establishing themselves at Portland, Oregon based studio Laika, Coraline was a massive undertaking requiring at its peak some 450 production staff and utilizing 3-D techniques and three dimensional printing to get the look for the film with many of the characters designed by Tadahiro Uesugi. Coraline became a sleeper hit in its day earning acclaim from critics and audiences and $124 million against a $60 million budget and put Laika on the map as the premiere studio of stop-motion films. Coraline is regarded as a modern day classic and rightly so.First and foremost, the animation used to bring Coraline's world and characters to life is beautifully done and rich with life. After the misfire of Monkeybone, Selick couldn't have picked a more perfect project to showcase his talents in the field of stop-motion with every corner of the Pink Palace teeming with detail while its eccentric denizens are brought to life in a manner that effortlessly draws you in. Both the real world and the other world are a solid showcase in creating a contrast between the real world and fantasy world in a manner that reminded me of prior examples such as Wizard of Oz and Labyrinth. The masterful animation is matched by the strong characters and writing of Neil Gaiman which have been masterfully adapted by Selick. Coraline is a fantastic child character and perfectly voiced by Dakota Fanning as she feels like a real child who is caring and ultimately good natured, but still has a bit of an abrasive edge to her and some of those youthful eccentricities. The movie also features a solid ensemble playing duel roles in both this world and the other world including Teri Hatcher who plays two rich characters in Coraline's mother and The Other Mother with some strong work from Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French and Ian McShane as various versions of eccentric Pink Palace residents. We also get some solid work from Robert Bailey Jr.'s Wybie (an original character for the film who expands the scope of the story) and Keith David is also very fun as The Cat (who's something of a Jiminy Cricket to Coraline only way less condescending).Coraline is one of those movies you just can't help but describe as ""perfect"". It's a modern day fairy tale that still feels timeless while taking place in the here and now and is beautifully animated, written, and acted with no real weakpoints I can speak of. I've gassed on long enough, just go watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated films in history that mixes fantasy with horror,"A fairly fresh and original film that respects the essence of the original novel, Coraline moves away from what is already common in animated films. It is not a children's film as it goes far beyond that. It is a film that apart from offering comedy and fantasy, it is also a horror story that shows us from the perspective of a child when a beautiful and beautiful dream turns into a dark and gloomy nightmare. The story of this movie would be rather scary from the perspective of children. We see how Coraline, feeling that her parents underestimate her, decides to venture into a beautiful fantasy land, but behind that beauty something evil is hidden. The animation helps a lot by giving the film a rather gloomy and macabre tone when it turns nightmare. The soundtrack is spectacular that accompanies the environment very well. Coraline is undoubtedly one of the best animated movies in history that makes a very good combination of fantasy and children's fear making it a quintessential animated horror and fantasy movie. My rating for this movie is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disturbingly Scary,"this film appears to be a sweet, innocent children's film that is suitable for all young audiences, when in fact it is dark and disturbing, and frankly, if a young child went to see this film, they would definitely have nightmares to say the least! the ideas are twisted and spooky- for example, the sewing of buttons in place of eyes, sewing a childs lips together to 'keep him quiet', plus a visually frightening set of characters- both the 'other mother' and the 'other father' become weirdly distorted as the storyline collapses towards the end. throughout the film, there is a foreboding theme of feeling trapped- as Coraline becomes imprisoned in the 'other world', and is locked into a doorless room with ghost versions of the other mother's previous victims. this will no doubt unnerve the audience. these are just a few examples of many disturbing scenes from the film- there are plenty more! in short, this is still a reasonably good movie, but however the rating should be at least a 12.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Solid story makes this more than animation...,"...the script, esp the strong characters make this a movie using animation as a media to deliver this amazing story.When you get the DVD, make sure to discover the behind the scenes production features. U can then appreciate the hard work done for years to create this masterpiece.Another thing that made this movie special is the production team down to all the nitty gritty details on decorations around the scene - down to details and not exaggerated. They didn't just show up there to earn a pay check - they wanted to be there to create history/magic.Like many great art, this movie can inspire & entertain audience at different age according to their own experience & how daring one is to his/her own imagination. To me, I am most attracted to the strong character of Coraline; the imagination journey of Coraline; the dark side of the story from ""other mother""; how the ""other world""(psychological world in my own interpretation) seems more powerful than what we see / touch daily.All in all, best movie I've seen since ""The International"".",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline,"One of the most unique movies.I've liked this movie ever since I was little, it was intimidating to watch at times but that's what made it special, what gave it its engulfing feel and engaging story.

The design, music and animation is superb and something movies lack nowadays, now movies are perfect but this movie has imperfections which is what makes it so natural. It shows how you can't just judge of appearance, people can be deceitful and manipulative just to get their own way. Overall one of my favourite films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Tale of Wonder and Horror!,"I remember when I read the book ""Coraline"" and I was thinking how creepy the book was. But, when I saw the previews for this film in 2009, I thought that there were going to be drastic changes to the film from the book, such as the film being on a lighter note. Well, I actually saw the film and I was so surprised at how dark and scary it was, just like the book. Truth is, I actually love this movie because it stayed true to the book and the animation was beautiful. I especially love the main character Coraline as she was truly courageous and has a lot of spunk. Other characters that I have enjoyed greatly were the Other Mother, because she was truly scary, especially towards the end of the movie and Mr. Bobobinsky, the Russian circus performer who was weird yet entertaining to watch. I would strongly recommend anyone to see ""Coraline"" because it is definitely one of the top movies of 2009 because of its creepy yet adventurous plot and interesting characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Laika's 'Coraline' Challenges Pixar's Dominance,"Last year, 2008, DreamWorks Animation Studios pulled a fast one on all of us by offering up an animated film that seemed poised to steal the coveted Best Animated Picture award at this year's Oscars, Kung Fu Panda. Awards king Pixar Studios, however, wasn't about to let that one go unanswered, as they subsequently unleashed their greatest masterpiece yet, WALL-E, the critical darling of the year and would-be Best Picture candidate.This year, freshly-minted animation studio Laika has delivered what is likely to be the greatest blow to Pixar in many a blue moon, Coraline. Director Henry Selick, known for his The Nightmare Before Christmas job, improves on his previous effort with superior animation, pacing, and storytelling. Selick has crafted here an entrancing and original piece of art that, I believe, will reign supreme in next year's Best Animated Feature Oscar category. Coraline manages to be quite subtle in its first half, with a slow-burning tension and quiet, offsetting realism most films only dream of achieving. The anticipation builds as a bizarre and charming cast of characters are introduced, with purposes not entirely disclosed until we reach the wholly surprising final half. This set-up is incredible, and the multiple payoffs are even more so.At precisely the moment the audience is begging for the characteristic grotesqueness of Selick's stop-motion animation features, the film explodes in a torrent of surreal, chilling, effectively creepy sequences that are relentlessly inventive. From a very mysterious, shadowlike feline, to the frightening spider-themed villain. From a walk around the circumference of an imagined dreamland, to a haunting circus tent, to a nightmarish garden, the settings here act as their own characters with astounding effectiveness.This film has an extraordinarily classic feel to it, which may elicit audience members to reach back into their subconsciousness, asking themselves, ""where have I seen this movie before?"" You haven't, you only think you have because the story is so intrinsic that it feels like an amalgamation of every children's story you've ever heard in your life. No, this film is strikingly original, and it feels right at home tucked into the recesses of our mind where those other disturbing and unforgettable tales reside.With haunting intensity, Laika has managed to craft here one of the greatest animated films of the decade. As we continue to follow Laika's future projects, I am hopeful that the added competition exhibited by animated films in recent years will allow some of our finest filmmakers around to pump out more and more masterpieces. My prediction for 2009 is that Laika's Coraline will outdo Pixar's newest offering, Up, in critical praise, and end-of-the-year awards.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Until about three years later when I saw it again, and wow it sure is an amazing original piece of cinema. Coraline is definitely one of my most rewatched movies due to the fact that it's so well written. It's one of those movies that have a simple plot/conflict yet executes it so well.

Why did nobody tell me it was this good,"I've always been a fan of the ""lost children"" genre of stories, which is oddly common. Alice In Wonderland was my favorite book growing up, and it still is now that I'm 20. And for all this time I've been fascinated by Alice in Wonderland-esque stories of people being lost in their own minds, in supernatural mazes, in alternate dimensions, in their dreams, wherever as long as it's weird and interesting. And judging by the popularity of these stories, I'm not the only one. For some reason, this idea of wandering off into the enchanted forests and dark swamps of imagination is appealing to a whole crowd of people.But this, this is the magnum opus. I never watched Coraline as a kid, and I feel like I was robbed. I would've absolutely LOVED it. The atmosphere is perfect, the visuals are awesome, the music, the pacing, it's all so good.

Beautifully creepy and startlingly scary,"Coraline is one of those films that adults will enjoy a lot better than the kids. Full of creepy imagery (the spider lady at the end terrified the dickens out of me) and even some sexual animation(Miss Spink's and Miss Forcibles's routine), this was not created with children in mind. Despite that this film has all the visual flair and edgy music to create a world of darkness within.Coraline is a bratty, tomboyish little girl who wants nothing but to go back to her old town. She certainly does not like living in the Pink Palace, and her neighbor Wybie (short for Wyborn) is a pest. Her parents love her, but are such workaholics that they don't even pay attention to her. Who would blame her when she wants to go through the little door she found in the living room. Unfortunately, it's bricked up, until night that is, where it leads her to this other world.There she is greeted by her Other Mother and Father, perfect replicas of her parents but better looking and with buttons for eyes. The world on the other side is perfect with every detail of the real world made better and brighter. Even the neighbors are more exciting. But as Coraline soon finds out, there is more to this world than first appears.What helps this movie a great deal is the visuals and music which work together to create this impression that we are in the middle of a nightmare. In the real world, colors are dampened and animation is somewhat sluggish, but in the other world, colors are bright and the screen bursts into life. Yet, as this other world begins to reveal its true intention, the colors dissolve into shadowy blues and edgy, fluorescent purples. Some of the imagery is mesmeric, almost like you are going on an acid trip, and the character design has all the distortion that made the characters in Nightmare Before Christms memorable. Coupled with music full of dreamy choral interludes and hallucinogenic strings and you have an atmosphere that keeps you on edge.This is one of the films that you want to take home, turn the light off and watch. Taffy monsters, a praying mantis tractor, a jumping mouse circus, all are freaky and disturbing in just the right amount. Voice work was excellent, and Dakota Fanning was the perfect choice for Coraline.

Terrifying and Beautiul....an instant magical classic,"Having just watched Coraline it is with out doubt a magical film.The story centres around Neil Gaiman's beautiful story telling of 'Coraline Jone's' a feisty, very grown up 11 year old girl imaginably voiced by Dakota Fanning who has just moved to new town and house along with her parents voiced by Terr Hatcher and John Hodgman who seem to have no time for there daughter their busy stressed out life's.So it is here that Coraline sets about exploring the new house which appears sometimes creepy at times and discovers a secret door which upon opening takes our heroine into another parallel world. This new world seems exciting, magical and full of vibrant colour unlike the drained out real one she is used to...and this new world seems perfect...or it would seem? It is here that Henry Selick jaw dropping and exquisite stop motion animation takes place and in my book this even better than The Nightmare Before Christmas - and one that's gives Pixar a run for their money. The arch of an eyebrow perfectly expressing a character's attitude, the shine on the icing of a cake making it look edible and this will shine Oscar time next year.As we are entering the year of 3-D films (and I cannot wait to see what Avatar as to offer) I recommend you seek out a cinema that is showing it in this as this adds another magical dimension to the film.Yes as some reviews might say on here the film may appear a little scary at times for children...but does it? Because as children we all know when we were younger we used the dream about that other magical world...and this film is also not just for children.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece,"This movie is delightfully creepy. Amazing animation and storyline. Just a fantastic movie overall. This movie is honestly scarier than almost all horror movies.

Best animation for awhile!,"Let's start with Henry Selick, he has immense imagination compared to some other directors; a great example would be 'Nightmare before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach' after that both i had high expectations of this movie. After i watched the movie trailer from 'Coraline' , i had to see this animation movie. And i can tell you that this was actually one of the best animation movies i have seen for awhile.Absolutely i wasn't disappointed.The music of this movie was top class! For the movie ""Coraline"" i would give 10/10, that is pretty rare from me, but the movie is just perfect! there is nothing to polish of this movie! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A feast for the eyes and the imagination.,I took my eleven and eight year olds to see this and they loved it. There was not one single scene that I thought inappropriate for them. It was so much deeper and more thought provoking than the usual Disney schmaltz (although the kids love that stuff too). I would recommend it to anyone with a bit of imagination who was to watch something that makes them think a little bit more than the average cartoon. Our family love Nightmare Before Xmas so this was definitely a film we were looking forward to and we were not disappointed. This is up there with animated greats such as NBC and Spirited Away. There were certainly some Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass themes but generally a nicely conceived world for young and old minds to explore. We will certainly be buying the DVD to watch again and again.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Boring movie with really, really unlikable characters, bad for kids and adults alike","Like others said, really dumb characters and boring overall. People are praising it merely for the visuals (which, aside from the character designs, aren't that great).Coraline has to be the most stupid, annoying, bratty, nonsensical character I've seen in a movie. She's constantly reacting ridiculously to insane situations. Was she meant to be low-key mentally challenged or something? Because otherwise she's just plain badly written. Very unlikable and constantly putting herself in danger because she's that stupid (and badly written).And again, overall very boring, with no redeeming qualities, and by all means - not for kids, not only for it's ""horror elements"" but out of fear that such arrogantly dumb characters may influence your child during a crucial developmental period.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is going to be a timeless classic.,"I thought this movie was fantastic. Coraline was directed by Henry Selick, who is also the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas, a visual masterpiece from the talented world of Tim Burton. I was very excited to see this because Henry has worked with Tim before, and both of their works are always AMAZING.I loved how they did it in stop motion animation and it was incredible in 3D, very real.This movie is about a young girl named Coraline who is a little bit neglected by her parents. She's a little bit of an outcast, she's her own person. They've just moved into a new house and she gets no attention from her parents. She discovers a small door in her house that takes her to a different world, like a parallel universe. That seems amazing, but of course, nothing's ever what you think.I recommend going to see this, it's funny and interesting, and kind of has a feel like Alice in Wonderland and The Nightmare Before Christmas all in one movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Thou art alive!,"Even though the soundtrack includes a children's choir and a They Might Be Giants song, please don't bring toddlers to this movie, unless they are into hating their mothers and burning their dollies. Coraline excels at the bizarre and grotesque, and touches on the scary, even for us grown-ups. While I applaud most movies with ""facial structure supervisor"" and ""puppet wrangler"" in the credits, the 3D mastery and attention to detail in Coraline make this film visually orgasmic, from the dust on a car to the elaborate psychedelic garden to the drunk neighbor's billowing repulsive gut you can almost smell. A subtle theme, as one character in the film articulates, is in the realm of ""thou art alive; thou art still living"" but the real take-home message is this: Even though your parents may be neglectful and mean, at least you're not threatened with eternal damnation in a home with a woman claiming to be your mother who really just wants to steal your eyeballs and sew buttons in their place.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Coraline learns that a perfect life may not be all that it seems...,"I think Coraline was an absolutely fantastic movie, but I do think it's important to remember just because it's animated doesn't mean it's great for all kids. This is along the lines of Corpse Bride and The Nitghtmare Before Christmas, not any Disney film. It's sort of a kids movie for the child still living in a 30 year old. It's a wonderful,colorful, and exciting adventure of a young girl with dark, almost morbid twists. It has very interesting animation and an eccentric collection of characters. I didn't get to see it in 3D but I heard it's great! Go out and support Neil Gaiman and buy this book and his many others!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The dullest animation ever made,"Neil Gaiman isn't doing very well in regards to his film adaptations, with this following on from the disappointing MIRRORMASK made a few years ago. CORALINE is the most dull, uninteresting and downright annoying animation I've seen in recent years, which is a surprise given that it was directed by Henry Selick, who made THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas so endearingly odd all those years ago.The problem with CORALINE is the dumb Americanised storyline and the irritating characters. The titular character, complete with Dakota Fanning's whiny voice, is the worst offender, but even the likes of the normally reliable Ian McShane come out of this badly. The only one who fares well is Keith David playing a cat, but then he's barely utilised.The animation was apparently done with stop motion, but you can't tell. There's none of the endearing jerkiness you expect from stop motion, instead this looks and feels like just another soulless CGI monstrosity. In addition, the storyline is extremely slim and stretched to breaking point by an over-long running time, and the visuals just aren't there. CORALINE is a film I can recommend to nobody, unfortunately.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful, Haunting and Memorable","""Coraline"" makes a nice companion piece to ""Mirror Mask,"" with the stop-motion film skewed to younger viewers than its live-action sister, but with no less bite, or visual flourish. There's no question ""Coraline"" should be viewed in 3D if possible; it's stunning, although digital animation has come so far recently that it makes one wonder if anyone notices that this is puppet stop-motion work--for all the incredible, painstaking artistry in ""Coraline,"" would anyone but a professional know the difference between this and digital, or care? It would be a shame if not.Matters of plot seem to be a mere inconvenience to the film's authors (try describing it: ""A little girl finds an alternate world where people have buttons for eyes and there are these dogs with wings, but you have to collect magic balls so the kids can go to heaven because the witch, who is sort of like a spider, is your Other Mother who lives in a world through a tunnel in the wall. But the neighbor upstairs is an acrobat!), but the plot is secondary to the jaw-droppingly beautiful set pieces, and fortunately doesn't get in the way of the overall experience.The universe of the film is visually splendid, oddly familiar while at the same time feeling alien. After an obligatory set up concerning a discontent little girl with a strong personality and singular point of view, we're thrust into a breathtaking alternate reality where All Sorts Of Things Happen and Problems Must Be Solved, with a host of memorable characters, human, animal and otherwise, along the way. Like ""Silent Hill,"" which ""Coraline"" resembles in some places, the film is something like a hybrid between a video game that one plays and a movie that one watches...there are clues the protagonist needs to pick up and something like a ""big boss"" character that needs to be defeated. It's a style of film storytelling that was ahead of its time when it premiered and even now may not be for everyone, but is definitely unique and worth checking out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watching This is Like Eating The Perfect Cuisine,"Have you ever order something that sounds ordinary in a restaurant, and don't think much of it and then after your first bite you find out that not only the food was excellent, it was something familiar yet very satisfying. That is how I feel about this movie.WOW is just a word I have to use when describing this movie. I thought it would be just another kids movie. Boy, was I wrong. This is NOT a children movie at all. I think kids will be absolutely terrified by it. Even me, a 24 years old fine young lad is creeped out by it.That said, I love this movie so much. I think this is one of the best movie that has come out in years. That was not very easy to say since I'm very picky and critical in terms of movies. I can't describe how satisfying watching a movie like this is. There was no boring moment for me. The pace, the plot, the characters development, the familiarity, it was all perfect, just perfect.I have not read the book before by the way, I didn't even know there was a book until I read someone say it in IMDb. Doesn't matter, the animators were brilliant. The story complex yet familiar and satisfying. It smashed all my expectations away.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Kids will be frightened out of their wits, ie., they will LOVE IT! Superb storytelling.","Right from the opening credits, you know you are in for a visual animation treat which uses the same stop motion capture animation technique as in Nightmare Before Christmas.But it is the storytelling and creepy tones of the film that sets this apart from other children's animated films. I would say the tone of this film is quite similar to the great Miyazaki films such as Spirited Away. And if I was to make a comparison to an American animated film then I suppose the superb Monster House would come closest. There are plenty of humour but played out in an innocently naturalistic way, no slapstick.The story starts out in a very Alice in Wonderland way with our antagonist, Coraline, bored out of her wits because her parents have no time for her and trying to get use to her new lonely dwellings in a house that has only 3 eccentric neighbours including a little boy who stalks Coraline. Coraline is rather ungrateful and not very understanding of why her parents cant give her undivided attention. She then finds a portal through what seems to be a parallel world but a world where her parents have all the time in the world for her and gives her anything she wants but is it all too good to be true for little Coraline? The story then continues to get creepier and creepier until it becomes downright frightening! Yes kids will be scared out of their wits. That is to say, they will love it! This film is a masterpiece of children's storytelling. Stunning visuals of both the whimsical and hellish variety. I was enthralled, entertained and frightened as much Coraline was in the film. I truly hope I can expect more films like this from Sellig.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Wonderous Visual Feat!,"Coraline- ****/****It is ironic that I found a more satisfying experience in terms of pure storytelling craft in a (supposed) children's film, than I do in most films released these days. Henry Selick's Coraline is a dark, stop motion fantasia. The film's roots can be traced back to the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm and the works of Lewis Carroll (as a reconstruction of the fairy tale it recalls the wonderful Pan's Labyrinth), fine company indeed. By essentially reworking Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the film begins with a predictable premise, but creates two separate worlds that are presented in enchanting 3-D.Coraline Jones is a young girl who has recently moved to the Pink Palace, an apartment house inhabited by wild characters. However, Coraline is a bitter little girl, who is constantly feeling ignored by her workaholic parents. While exploring her new house, Coraline encounters a mysterious door leading to an alternate world, where everyone Coraline knows is changed to fit Coraline's image of what they should be. However this quasi- Utopia is revealed to be a much more sinister place than Coraline first thought.Make no mistake, this film belongs to director Henry Selick, who has wrought not one, but two fascinatingly designed worlds, and as the film drives forward Selick continually ups the visual ante, making even the most tired clichés breathe with vibrant, rich life. This is a film with visual wonders to nourish the eye, visuals that follow the story all the way with its darkest implications.Some have taken the film's script to task. Indeed, Coraline may have benefited from the touch of a writer strong enough to match Selick's visual artistry, but as it stands Coraline is competently written, or at least written well enough to render the script a non-issue.When it comes down to it, this is a visual film, as most animated features are. In its own plucky way Coraline is as great an achievement as Pixar's Wall-E. Some have complained that the film could lose ten to fifteen minutes, but I disagree. This is a film that I wish was lengthened, allowing this world to be presented without the machinations of plot. I want to be immersed in these worlds, even as the darkness inches closer.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A beautiful masterpiece in every sense of the word.,"Coraline brings back Henry Selick (director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach) to direct this amazingly scary enchantment. Coraline is full of wonders that you wouldn't expect to see in any ordinary movie. It is exciting, fun, somewhat scary but for all its worth an amazing thrill ride. Coraline is a movie where you truly have to appreciate art. For Coraline you have to use your mind to understand some of the visionary art that is used in this movie. For example, in this movie you will see a mouse circus. That doesn't sound like much, but when you see it you won't believe your eyes. Coraline is a movie that little kids probably wouldn't want to see (probably because of the scary scenes). But it is still a great movie that just about anyone could enjoy (espically with the 3D). When it comes down to visionary art, great story, an amazing cast, and something thats a little dark so adults could get into it. Then watch Coraline, with Henry Selick being the director he won't let you down. Like I said earlier Coraline isn't any ordinary movie its better.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Technically immaculate, daring 3D adventure","Coraline Jones moves into an old, pink house with her neglectful, condescending parents and finds a door to another world - a world that seems insanely perfect, including the presence of loving, attentive parents with buttons for eyes. And then things get weird in director Henry Selick’s highly imaginative fantasy, filmed in dazzling 3D stop animation.There’s so much to like about this movie, but if you weren’t a fan of The Nightmare before Christmas (also directed by Selick), you may as well stop reading: this is not the movie for you.There are two other tenants in the apartment house: an elderly British couple, stars of the stage (played by Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French of Absolutely Fabulous) and a Russian acrobat who’s all limbs and belly (played by Ian McShane of Deadwood). All the tenants are oddballs who, one would think, would provide the bored Coraline with plenty of stimulation, but they’re a bit self absorbed - the actresses constantly competing with each other for any purpose, and the acrobat constantly working on his act with trained mice.When Coraline stumbles upon a locked crawlspace door, she’s immediately intrigued, but unlocking it reveals only a brick wall. But then that night she’s awakened by a mouse under her bed who leads her back to the door, which, when she opens it, now shows a tenuous pathway to another, far-off door. Being the curious little girl she is, Coraline goes through the door, emerging in an exact replica of her own kitchen. Except different. The mother in this room is cooking, for one thing, which her real mother never does. And when the mother turns to greet Coraline, there’s another, even greater difference: she wears two black buttons for eyes. Gasp! Seems that this new world Coraline’s discovered is perfect in every way, with wonderful, caring parents who dote on her every whimsy. Not only can her mom cook, she cooks everything Coraline wants. And her dad is a musician - the piano plays him! Oh, it’s madness, I tell you, sheer madness. Then there’s outside! In the real world, it’s a desolate yard, unencumbered by plant life (the irony here is that Coraline’s parents are gardening writers), but here there’s a magnificent display, a visual cacophony of light and flowers and birds and bees. It’s astoundingly rendered in stop-motion animation, and it’s even more wondrous in three dimensions.But things aren’t as they seem. The stark beauty of this other world and the kindness of the Other Mother are mere props in a greater play. The question posed is this: Will Coraline decide to stay in her new world, even if she must sacrifice to do so? Beyond the impressive cinematography (by Pete Kozachik, who was nominated for The Nightmare before Christmas), there’s also excellent voice work offered by Dakota Fanning as Coraline as well as Teri Hatcher (as Mother and Other Mother) and John Hodgeman (the IBM guy in those currently ubiquitous Apple ads). Fanning in particular was a good choice as the hurting, neglected Coraline.Coraline is brilliantly conceived and stupendously executed. It has all the mystery and show-stopping magnetism of The Nightmare before Christmas, and it has even more heart. Know why? Because more so than Nightmare, this is a tale about love and redemption; you root for Coraline not only because she’s a psychologically lost girl but also because her antagonist is so hissably awful. The villain here is really a symbol for the feeling all kids have at some point of not being wanted or appreciated; Coraline must slay that dragon to survive.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Bold and Refreshing Break from ""Madagascar""","(I haven't been compelled to write a movie review since The Dark Knight. This movie, however, inspired me to play the role of the critic yet again.) Today I've come to a fantastic realization: animated films are getting smarter. With the development of GCI films, filmmakers have found a new way to produce bizarre and creative fairy tales for adults to enjoy as well. Shrek was, essentially, a grown-up fairytale, with a few jokes about bugs and farts to appeal to the kids. Then, the always-brilliant Pixar gave the world Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and WALL-E. Even Seinfeld's under-appreciated Bee Movie was directed towards adults. Of course, the world is a ridiculously narrow-minded place. If it isn't rated R for excessive potty humor and sex jokes, adults will instantly classify any and all animated films as ""kid movies."" That's why intelligent animated scripts are directed towards children.The latest animated film to win my semi-adult heart over is the brilliant, beautiful, and downright terrifying stop-motion movie, Coraline. It was directed by Henry Silick, the genius who gave us James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas, and based off of the equally-chilling children's book by Neil Gaiman.Coraline centers on a curious (and somewhat lonely) 11-year-old girl with a name that is almost always confused with the name ""Caroline."" After she and her parents move to an apartment in Oregon, Coraline is forced to count leaky windows and creaky doors to subside her horrible boredom. Her parents are working for a gardening magazine and basically neglects their daughter, forcing her to explore her new neighborhood with a talkative boy named Wybie. Her new neighborhood is filled to the brim with interesting and bizarre characters, each of them having no time to listen to this girl.After Coraline finds a mysterious door underneath the wallpaper, she stumbles into a world that almost mirrors her own, only everything is much more appealing and downright fun! Her button-eyed Other Parents cook, sing, and, most importantly, give Coraline the attention she's always wanted. In fact, everyone in this new world seems to love Coraline. However, it doesn't take the girl very long to realize that her Other Mother wants her to stay in this seemingly-perfect world. Forever. This leads to a series of strange, magical, and frightening events that Coraline must overcome, leading her to the conclusion that maybe her ""boring"" real world isn't so bad after all.The story is one that I think children's movies should be made of: great dialogue, a relatable main character, and a lesson that's subtle, but efficient. The movie treats children with respect, not dumbing down the story to make it ""more appropriate"" like many other kid's movies today. Instead, Coraline follows in the footsteps of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, where the dangers are real, deaths do happen, and the filmmakers are not afraid to shove it into the kids' faces. Children hate being treated as such, and with movies like Coraline, they feel like they're watching a genuine film instead of just another kiddie movie.This being said, this movie isn't necessarily for younger children. It does have many frightening moments in it, ranging from creepy ghost kids to a giant, lanky spider-woman who attacks with metal claws. The opening of the film deals with someone ripping a doll open and ripping it's stuffing out, a scene that, combined with the eerie background music, is one of the most spine-tingling moments in the film. There is also a moment involving an elderly, yet ridiculously-large-chested, woman that will no doubt result in many parents covering their children's eyes, if not walking them out of the theater altogether. It was definitely awkward and not really necessary, but it hardly distracted from the overall feel of the film.The film is in 3D, but it's in such a way that I've never seen before. There are no pop-out gimmicks in the movie, allowing the 3D effect to act more as an enhancer rather than a crutch. After seeing it in 3D, however, I honestly can't picture seeing it in any other way. The entire movie is absolutely beautiful, the stop-motion so flawless that a quarter way into the film, I forgot that it was stop-motion and not only accepted Coraline's crazy world, but believed it. If you look back at Nightmare Before Christmas (or even the more-recent Corpse Bride), you'll notice minor lighting or movement inconsistencies. Coraline has seemed to perfect the stop-motion format, and the 3D gives the audience the ultimate viewing experience.In all honesty, this is not a film that can be described in one review. You won't be able to fully appreciate the story and the art direction if you only read about it. This movie is one to be experienced, especially in 3D, if you have the chance. Coraline, like Silick's previous films, is an instant classic and the first must-see film of 2009.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Greatest Animation Film Ever but not for Kids or Pixar Fans,"I normally do not like animated films and I have been disappointed by most of the critically acclaimed animated films to come out the past few year.

Ahead of its time!!,"Rating: 9/10
REwatched on August 17th 2024 (second watch)
Format: 3D Regular theatreThe first and only time I ever watched this film was surprisingly back in 2009 in theaters when it first came out. I remember I was about 6 or 7 years old and I really thought that this film is so unique in its own way and is different than any other animation film at that time. Even though I might have not fully understood the story, but I remember thinking how cool the visuals were and how unique and complex this story is. 15 years later...I got the chance to revisit this film the same way I last did, which is in the movie theatre. And, I am 21 now.Coraline is truly an animation film that is ahead of its time. The stop-motion animation style of Coraline felt like it fit the whole story of the film. Everything related to the visuals is absolutely stunning and almost reaches the level of perfection to me when it comes to an 'animation' film.The film really takes its time to tell its story. Which is perfect for its runtime that is 1h 40m. However, in the beginning it felt a bit slow and dull, until things got heated and the events started to evolve. The many different hidden details and theories makes the story very well detailed and enjoyable. Lastly, the music score of this film is literally perfect for the vibes and story of the film. The spooky theme that you would only hear during halloween season. Or the calm but spooky jazz theme to showcase the visuals that give a sense of comfort towards the characters...but we all low key know that it won't end well and something is sus about them.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Coraline, along the same lines as a bunch of other movies, but nowhere near as good.","This is basically the stuttering, stumbling, non-sensical version of Pan's Labyrinth. A movie that feels a LOT like Tideland, but where as Tideland stayed odd the whole time and kind of found itself at the end, This movie just keeps getting more odd, and NEVER finds itself. Henrey Selnick once again is extremely unimpressive, and once again tries to rip off Tim Burton's visuals and music... it doesn't work.About the point where Coraline's in the dream world and the two fat ladies are wearing pretty much nothing, I turned and asked, ""What the hell am I watching?"" This coming from a person who, as mentioned, sat through Tideland. COMPLETELY pointless and Definitely NOT a kid's movie in any way.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

A masterpiece,"There is some movies in stopmotion, I have already watch all them, Coraline is the best in it's use. It's beautiful, we have to admit that make a movie in this way is pure art, and so much difficult that I think in the people behind the scenes every time.I'm watching so many movies that sometimes I think I'm losing the art to admire the details in, but this was different; already in the beginning I realized that the story and characters would be interesting, no sooner said than done. Wyborne is so adorable, even if his creation was to Coraline uses him like a stairs to talk. The pun that Coraline make with his name is hilarious: Wyborn-Why-were-you-born. And, of course, Coraline is different, she is somethink lost in her own mind, angry and stubborn, but is perfect to the movie; Dakota Fanning was the right person to dub her, and did it in the better way.Why am I giving 9 stars and not 10 to the movie? Well, the problem with children's movies is that the critical moment is always slow to unwind and tiring to watch, but I understand that it is for childrens and have to be that way, I don't like, may I'm wrong.

Not a Great adoption but it's okay...,"I don't know how many of these reviewers actually read the book before watching the movie, but as of me (as I've read the book recently) the movie was an adoption of ""CORALINE by Neil Gaiman"". The book was pretty impressive, but the movie was kinda off as there are literally too many details that have been adopted wrong, which kinda made it bad experience, as a person who read the book I'd say every detail that was in the book was really pretty important as they're the actual key of the whole book. And the movie was a bit speed going where it should've been more detailed, slow where the parts were not much important. And there are some adoptations that made the whole movie upside down like the neighbor guy, and the ending was a bit low standard, I mean when the book had such a pretty amazing ending why would someone adopt a new kind of ending? A little disappointed with the whole movie but it's great too! I liked it anyways even with all the faults. I would totally recommend it if you haven't read the book, if you did.. then you'd be craving for details like me😅. Go ahead and watch it without hesitation. It's an awesome movie. Have a great time watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Cinematic Experience Far Exceeding the Purview of Mere Children's Entertainment,"Henry Selick's ""Coraline"", a phantasmagorical tapestry woven from the threads of stop-motion animation, presents a cinematic experience far exceeding the purview of mere children's entertainment. It's a baroque masterpiece, a chiaroscuro composition that oscillates between the beguiling and the unsettling, ultimately delivering a profound meditation on the yearning for connection, the deceptive allure of escapism, and the inherent fortitude of the human spirit. To merely categorize it as a family film is a crass simplification, akin to classifying ""Hamlet"" as a play about a prince. ""Coraline"" is a meticulously crafted allegory, a visual symphony that resonates with the primal anxieties and aspirations latent within the human psyche.The film's foundational narrative, predicated on the liminal space between reality and illusion, sets the stage for a journey into the uncanny valley. Coraline Jones, our protagonist, a precocious and intellectually inquisitive eleven-year-old, finds herself transplanted into the peculiar world of the Pink Palace estate, a microcosm of neglect where her preoccupied parents, mired in the intellectual quagmire of their professional endeavors, fail to provide the emotional sustenance she craves. This emotional void becomes the fertile ground from which the insidious fantasy of the ""Other World"" blooms.Selick, a virtuoso of stop-motion artistry, orchestrates a visual feast that serves not merely as a backdrop but as an active participant in the narrative. The attention to detail is breathtaking; the tactile quality of the meticulously crafted puppets, the subtle nuances in their expressions, the painstakingly rendered environments - from the mundane austerity of the real Pink Palace to the decadent, hallucinatory whimsy of the Other World - are all testaments to Selick's commitment to his craft. The animation transcends mere technical proficiency; it becomes an expressive language, capable of conveying a spectrum of emotions with an almost visceral immediacy. The subtle shifts in lighting, the manipulation of color palettes, the gradual descent into the grotesque - all these visual cues function as a sophisticated form of visual rhetoric, priming the viewer for the escalating tension and impending dread. The juxtaposition of the real world's muted palette with the Other World's initially vibrant, yet ultimately synthetic, aesthetic serves as a crucial device. This contrast, however, slowly and subtly decays as the narrative progresses, the colors becoming increasingly lurid, the smiles of the Other Mother chillingly fixed, the landscapes mutating into a distorted reflection of entrapment.The screenplay, derived from Neil Gaiman's acclaimed novella, is nothing short of exceptional. Its strengths lie not just in its fidelity to the source material, but in its shrewd adaptation, maintaining the core themes while expanding upon certain aspects to enhance the cinematic experience. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and imbued with a genuine sense of childlike wonder and nascent skepticism. Coraline's interactions with the eccentric tenants of the Pink Palace - the aging actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, and the enigmatic Mr. Bobinsky - add a layer of levity and mystique, providing an essential counterpoint to the encroaching darkness. The character development is nuanced, portraying Coraline as a flawed but ultimately resilient individual, grappling with the complex realities of adolescence and the corrosive nature of emotional isolation. The exploration of this isolation is particularly poignant, resonating with the viewer on a deeply empathetic level.However, one of the film's greatest achievements may lie in its sonic landscape, masterfully sculpted by the composer Bruno Coulais. His score is not merely a supporting element, but a dominant force, amplifying the emotional impact of each scene and contributing significantly to the film's pervasive atmosphere of suspense and dread. Coulais's musical palette is vast and versatile, seamlessly transitioning between ethereal melodies, haunting contrapuntal lullabies, and jarring dissonances. The use of a children's choir, a Hungarian symphony orchestra, African instruments, and toy percussion, in particular, adds an unsettling, otherworldly quality, perfectly capturing the film's underlying themes of otherness and the blurring of reality and illusion. Coulais's ability to evoke both beauty and unease is remarkable; he allows the music to guide the viewer through the labyrinthine emotions of the narrative.The voice cast, each a virtuoso in their own right, imbues their characters with remarkable depth and authenticity. Dakota Fanning's performance as Coraline captures the character's blend of vulnerability and defiance, making the audience invested in her survival. The supporting cast lends weight to the film, and their performances work in tandem with the visuals to create a truly unforgettable story.""Coraline"", at its core, is a sophisticated exploration of the human need for connection and the dangers of succumbing to idealized fantasies. The film's masterful blend of genre elements - horror, fantasy, adventure, and thriller - ensures that ""Coraline"" remains a thrilling, thought-provoking, and enduring cinematic experience.The film's ending, while resolving the central conflict, leaves a subtle aftertaste of lingering unease. The Other Mother's defeat does not erase the scars of the experience, nor does it fully guarantee immunity from future temptations. Coraline's triumph is a testament to her courage and resourcefulness, a triumph that, while cathartic, is also tinged with a mature understanding of the complexities of the world. For the reasons stated above, ""Coraline"" earns a score of 95%, and warrants inclusion in the canon of animated masterpieces. It's a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled, reminding us of the enduring power of imagination and the importance of confronting our deepest fears. This film serves as a potent reminder that, sometimes, the most extraordinary adventures are found not in escapism, but in facing the realities of the world, even when they are less than ideal.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A new vision,"I have NEVER had a cinematic experience like the one I had today viewing ""Coraline"".The plot is a little weak, and ultimately predictable, but don't let this discourage you from seeing it at your local Cineplex.Go see it in 3D and see if you agree. Every time I thought I had seen the most fantastic visual, they threw another at me.It was a most memorable visual feast. I would NOT recommend taking your children under 10, as they would be bored by the story line.

Although, children can still watch this great animation.I might rewatch this movie with a friend because I liked it a lot. I recommend to this to everyone, especially to adults.

Awesome! This Is A Real Decent Masterpiece,"Such cartoon movies are a real Feat to make, and one can only wonder how much effort, labor, pain was used to make such a tremendously great, funny, dark, serious, deep, decent and thoughtful work as Coraline is. I applaud to Neil Gaiman for his outstanding book, an yes, I do ch her for this cartoon movie that is a true work of Geniuses. Odd, weird, off the beaten track, often hilarious, this movie holds well and stands alone as a visual treat for eyes and a decent food for thought. Coraline, voiced by impeccable Dakota Fanning, is a really smart, brave, sarcastic and cool young girl who is not idle or cowardly, and who goes through all the ordeals with a head held up and with hew unique mix of curiosity, inquisitiveness, valor, fervor and great humor. She shines all the time of the film, thus making this excellent work even better. This is a very unique film with all its unusual characters, such as a sarcastic Cat, or funny busy Parents, or some evil guys, or even very funny Russian man as well, is a great example of nontrivial approach to a movie making.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Dazzling, Frightening, And A Truly Amazing Film","Coraline is a stop motion animated movie based off the novel by the genius author, Neil Gaiman. Directed by Henry Selick(Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach) Coraline expands the story from the original book and makes it into it's own glorious movie.Coraline Jones has just moved into a new house called the Pink Palace. The house is split into three ways; the main house, the attic, and the cellar. Coraline shares the house with her strange neighbors Mr. Bobinsky who is training a group of mice for a circus, and Ms. Spink and Forcible who were once great theater stars. Coraline's parents are making a catalog for a botanical magazine and are much too busy to satisfy Coraline's boredom. She befriends a neighbor boy, Whyborn(Whybie) Lovat whose grandmother owns the Pink Palace.One night Coraline is awoken from her sleep by a mouse and is lured to a mysterious tiny door in the wall of her living room. Using a button shaped key, she opens the door and goes through a tunnel to a parallel world of her own. There she meets The Other Mother who looks the same as her regular mom but with buttons for eyes. The Other Mother makes fantastic food, and shows Coraline many wonderful things. Such as an actual mice circus from the Other Bobinsky, a show by the Other Ms. Forcible and Spink, and a magnificent garden tended by her Other Father. But everything is not as it seems. Coraline soon realizes the only way to stay in that world is to let the Other Mother sew buttons into her eyes. Soon Coraline discovers the true intent of the Other Mother and the once wonderful world becomes distorted and terrifying. Coraline needs to escape from The Other Mother and get back home to her real parents. If they're even still there.Coraline is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. It's dark and beautiful style amazes me every time. This whole thing was done by hand for many years and you can tell everyone put their heart and soul into it. The voice acting is also great. Dakota Fanning gives Coraline a spunky personality, and Teri Hatcher's voice performance made The Other Mother all the more horrifying. The rest of the cast is great as well with actors like John Hodgman, Ian McShane, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, and Keith David bringing life into their respective characters.If you get the chance you should buy the 3D version. Unlike most films the 3D version was made before 3D TV's were available to the public and instead comes with regular red and blue 3D glasses. This makes the visuals feel a little weird at first but the 3D is some of the best I've seen. Overall, you owe it to yourself to watch Coraline. Either buy it from your local store or rent it from somewhere. It's an experience you will not soon forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
WHAT A MOVIE,"This movie is not for a very young audience. I watched it for the first time when I was an adult and I liked it but I didn't love it. I have seen it multiple times now and every time I watch it it changes. It isn't just the little details that I catch upon re-watches but sometimes the entire meaning of the movie changes. Last time I watched it I decided that it was about the deceiving affects of certain drugs, and before that I decided it was about the duality of man. Coraline is such a interpretive piece of art. It is super impressive. I really can't give this movie enough credit.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Genuinely creepy,"Henry Selick's animated rendition of Neil Gaiman's novel spins the tale of a young girl who finds a 'better' version of her own world after passing through a mysterious passageway in the wall of her new home but, as the posters warn ""Be careful what you wish for"". The stop-action animation is excellent and the figures (especially Coraline), though not realist depictions of people, have tremendous personality and appeal. The open scene, the methodical deconstruction of one of the mysterious dolls that populate the story, is creepy almost to the point of disturbing. Danny Elfman's score is perfect for the film and the voice talent, especially Dakota Fanning's Coraline, is great. One of my favorite of the 'new wave' of animated films, along with Selick's equally striking ""The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993). All in all: a fun, if slightly unsettling, 'late night in a dark room' movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Piece of Art,"I watch this film every Halloween because it is perfect for the occasion. This is a piece of art that everyone needs to see. I wouldn't call this a kids film because it is quite creepy, but more of an adult animation. Stop motion has always fascinated me. It takes so long and requires so much patients that is a talent it itself. Something that blows me away about claymation is the world that the director and art team create. Most of the time in these films it is like nothing you have ever scene before. I am just obsessed with this type of filmmaking and can't get enough.

Not to mention the gothic witch demon. The dark spiritual vibe going on throughout will only frighten the life out of your kids. It's way too dark to be a kids movie. I'm shocked. It's borderline abuse letting your kids watch this horror. If your gonna let them watch this you might aswell follow on with The Exorcist, then maybe Nightmare on Elm Street.Maybe this is one of those indoctrination movies designed to fk up kids heads, like MK Ultra or something, haha.

Very Much Neil Gaiman,"An adventurous girl (Dakota Fanning) finds another world that is a strangely idealized version of her frustrating home, but it has sinister secrets.Although I have only read a fraction of Gaiman's work, I think this really captures some of his themes. The focus on childhood being a fantastic age, and the idea of other worlds just beyond the horizon. Mix in the very appropriate Selick-style direction, and you get just the right feel.I would also like to give a shout-out to John Linnell. Without knowing his involvement, I immediately recognized the voice and that made me love the film all that much more. If it is in fact true that They have more tracks that were never used, I do hope they see the light of day. They Might Be Giants is ridiculously prolific, and more often than not succeed in creating wonderful sounds.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A dark fairy tale.,"Coraline is a modern day, adult fairy tale. Neil Gaiman is known for his imaginative, genre-bending tales, and Coraline is no exception. It shifts in tone from whimsical to frightening to somber, but it's all presented in a truly engaging manner.Even if the story wasn't as good as it is, Coraline would be worth seeing for its strikingly beautiful art style and fluid animation. It's different from that used in The Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride, but it does remind one of them.Kids may like this film for its pretty images, but it lacks the snappy humor and wackiness that many modern fairy tales have. It takes a older child or an adult to appreciate the subtleties, melancholic sensibilities, and depths of Coraline.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Actress,"I read the book, well listened to the author read the book (awesome reader by the way but preferred him reading The Graveyard Book), and enjoyed it. The movie takes a few unnecessary liberties, such as the creation of Whyborn, but there all tolerable. What I did not like about the movie was Coraline, I hated Dakota Fanning whose voice I found extremely annoying and it took me till the end of the movie to get over. I also fault Dakota Fanning for making Coraline unlikable character with her guttural sighs and screams, which I found to be obnoxious. It is worth watching as it is visually interesting but parts of the movie I felt were a bit too campy for my taste and did I mention how much I did not like Coraline's character?",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Eerie yet enjoyable,"There's a balance of intrigue yet eeriness in this film. Caroline's less than happy to be moving into her new home. Her parents are apathetic, her neighbors are strange and the only person her age is a boy named Wybie(he's an addition to the film). As if things couldn't get any more boring, she discovers a secret room which leads to an alternate universe at night.There she meets her ""other"" parents and neighbors. At first, this's exactly what she wanted but slowly and slowly things get strange and ominous. There's a sense of where you want to leave but feel you can't for some reason. Will Caroline escape it will she be forever trapped in the rabbit hole?The animation is interesting. It has a gloomy feel to match the sense of boredom and dread Caroline deals with throughout most of the movie. At night though, everything's vibrant and dream-like. It's both amazing and a clever ploy to lure anyone in. The characters are interesting. They really work well off each other in their dialogue and interactions.If you like claymation and dark movies, I recommend it. Come on down and see for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fantastic stop motion film,"Coraline is an extremely clever and creative film, a good adaption of Neil Gaiman's best selling children book. It's very well-paced has great characters you can relate too (older people will relate better with the parents and kids will love Coraline's strong willed and curious nature!) the models for each person are ingenious. Additionally, the music is very well done and you can see a lot of effort went into shooting the film and making each puppet, Coraline's puppet had 15,000 different faces all hand painted.The story is very interesting and I haven't seen anything quite like it before or after the film came out, the other parents are very unsettling, but not too outright scary for kids, be careful with younger children though.

Carroll-ian,"There's a reason the eponymous girl is repeatedly misnamed ""Caroline."" ""Coraline"" is thoroughly a rearranging of Lewis Carroll's Alice books. I haven't read Neil Gaiman's novella, for which this stop-motion animated feature is based, but I'm familiar with ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There."" Since reading them, I've been seeking out film adaptations and other pictures that are heavily Carrollian, of which this is one.Coraline is Alice, then. She's guided by a black feline, as Alice was guided by the Cheshire Cat. The cats' disappearing acts, along with the talking, rather give this one away. A white mouse serves as the White Rabbit--leading Coraline through the rabbit hole behind a tiny locked door. The two burlesque actresses living beneath Coraline's family in their Victorian house have their similarities with Tweedledee and Tweedledum. And there's the circus performer Mr. Bobo living upstairs--""Bobo"" as in ""the Dodo,"" reportedly to be the caricature in ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" of its author, whose stammer is said to have caused him to introduce himself as Charles ""Dodo-Dodgson."" Meanwhile, the surrogate authors within this story are occupied by Coraline's parents, although they only write for a gardening catalogue. In the end, like Alice afore, Coraline will be the one to tell the story. Apparently, the boy, Wyborne, isn't in the literary source, which really does raise the question: Why was he born? And, of course, the entire narrative otherwise is entangled within a web of dreams, with the other world being a looking-glass version of the one outside the door. The snow globes, dolls and button-eyed doppelgängers further add to this reflexivity.There's some clever self-reference here, too, with the puppetry and doll making to the movie's stop-motion animation. Also notice the focus on the (surrogate animator's) hand in two sequences. Besides, more so than traditional or CGI animation, stop-motion is a closer mirroring of our own world in some ways. It exists as a solid, three-dimensional body outside of the picture, with only the puppet masters responsible for its movement hidden by the illusion of motion pictures. It's a dreamworld where puppeteers play with dolls for us to see.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too many logical fallacies in the characters to make the plot work,"Finally i saw this movie, and i cant help myself writing a short review with some viewpoints i didn´t find in the review list.I started to read the book as a child, but stopped because i found it to disturbing. I decided to watched the movie to see what actually happened.Many good things to say about this movie, as a lot of people has pointed out. For me a movie is more or less ruined when the plot doesn´t really make sense. In this movie its mainly Coraline making a lot of decisions that doesn´t make sense. She is too daring, naive and she is taking chances that is not realistic considering the danger. The concept of the two worlds is never really explained, and Coraline isn´t really asking too many questions about them either. She just does something really risky and suddenly it kind of works out. The logic around the Beldam joining this game is also failing.I expected something more complex and not easy and illogical solutions to make the plot.(sorry about language, im not englishs)",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

So Ugly,"For some reason I just can't get into this film. I tried to rewatch and I just wasn't feeling it. It's kinda Roald Dahl, kinda Tim Burton, kinda Alice in Wonderland, but not quite reaching the quality of those tales. It's very odd because on paper this sounds like the kind of film that I should love.Something about the setting is so drab and ugly that it's offputting. I don't see why her normal human father needs to look so hideously monstrous. It's actually disgusting to behold him in his flip flops. I don't understand why her normal human mother needs to be so cruel and borderline neglectfully abusive.I find the character models very ugly and basic and Coraline's voice is annoying. I don't understand why she isn't instantly terrified by her alternate button-eyed parents.I'm sure more interesting things happen in the plot after the first half hour but it just wasn't enough to engage my attention.

"The film ""Coraline"" is rated PG and it is a Family/Fantasy film","The film ""Coraline"" is rated PG and it is a Family/Fantasy film. I feel like this film would be suitable for more older children, because of some of the scary scenes and how it deals with the challenges of change. The film ""Coraline"" is a stop motion film about an eleven-year-old girl who is an only child and she is forced to move from Michigan to Oregon with her parents for their new job opportunities. Coraline has a hard time adapting to the new environment and she feels lonely because her parents work all the time. The theme of this film is ""be careful what you wish for"" style of someone feeling something is better on the other side and then this film delivers them on that other side. This stop motion animation was made from clay and took four years to make. The film Coraline use the old-fashion techniques of stop-motion is similar to the film ""James and the Giant Peach"", which was also directed by Henry Selick.Coraline who was played by Dakota Fanning finds herself in a new home and area where she doesn't know anyone. At her new home Coraline meets a black Cat, who is played by Keith David and a neighborhood boy name Wyborne Lovat (""Wybie"") played by Robert Bailey Jr. (Selick, 2009, 04:20 to 5:28). These key characters lead her on the journey to the other side of a world that mirrors her own just with slight twists from her current reality. Simple things like food tasting better or more attention/responses from her parents was attracting her to continue to visit this other world. Later in the film, the new mother in the other world attempts to keep her on the one side and that causes a domino effect of events as Coraline just wants to get back home to her real world.The director did a great job showing the differences of the two worlds. In the new world Coraline's room was clean with everything unpacked, versus reality in the old world her room was not clean or unpacked yet. The things that she wanted to change were perfect in the new world but some oddities would peek out of other random areas. Like in the new world the picture on the wall showed a kid with ice cream cone and the ice cream was on the floor but in her original old world the ice cream is still in the cone.The theme of the film Coraline is about how people try to escape their reality and then realized later how we all should be careful what we wish for, because things can be worst. In the reality/old world Coraline tries talking to her mother and father, but both of them were busy working and asked her to go find something to do. But when Coraline goes to the new world, she is clearly trying to escape her reality where she is getting showered with attention. At scene (15:27) the director shows the audience how bad Coraline wanted to receive more attention from her parents. The film juggles the challenges we all have in trying to get everything we want, and then no matter what level you reach we still don't feel happy. In the end, her reality is the best place and only place she wants to be and she comes back more grateful for what she has. If you are a fan of ""The Wizard of Oz"", you will love this film as the theme of the child wanting to escapee their home life, but then they take on an adventure but at the end of the day they just want to go home to their family. I give the film Coraline an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A classic,"This movie is one of the prettiest and most interesting looking stop motion animations out there all of the set designs and character designs look and feel amazing, eerie and in an uncomfortable sense beautiful. This movie is absolutely terrifying no matter the age however, it manages to still be pg it is the perfect way too make a kids horror movie, instead of being mild and have no to very little scary elements this film goes as scary as it possibly can it's sure to scare kids just like any horror movie should but it won't scar them. Every character is also very fun and likeable and the amount of details and hidden meanings is really admirable, you can just tell in every frame how much love, care and detail was put into this masterpiece and it deserves to be seen by everyone. I will say the story does suffer from a bit of filler but this is a small nitpick as the filler is horrifying and of quality as the rest of the film and really adds to the experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
bloody brilliant mate,"This film is great honestly. Its memorable, It's unique, and the animation is mental. I have no clue why this isn't rated higher, I absolutely love it; it switches from happy but still a bit uncanny to surprisingly dark and ominous surprisingly fast which is unusual but works out great for this film. However, I can't review this without mentioning the artistry of this movie though, the animation it almost prefect to the point where you can barely tell that it is a stop-motion animation and the soundtrack, although subtle, definitely enhances the experience by a lot.Proper wicked, it has to be a 10 no doubt about it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

outshines the competition creating jaw-dropping surreal backgrounds and astonishingly alive figurines,"Coraline has been created as a result of cooperation between animation genius Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) and English iconic writer Neil Gaiman (the movie is based on his award-winning novella). The lovechild of these two individuals is a hypnotic stop-motion animated tale that combines old-fashioned storytelling and astonishing visuals. Selick approaches Gaiman's novella in an uncompromising way. While he adds his own elements to the story, he maintains the dark, gloomy atmosphere keeping ""horror"" overtones in the right place. As for the plot, this is basically a new version of Alice in Wonderland. It can't be regarded as a shortcoming in this intricate fantasy though: Coraline is simply too engrossing for that. The main point of the movie that can be summarized by the tagline ""be careful what you wish for"" realizes itself in a clever script being tight and well-paced with every detail relevant later in the movie. The characters are often freakishly bizarre, which fits the story perfectly and makes for some incredibly inventive scenes. The movie can be described as a triumph of imagination as Selick presents the spectacle enhanced by superb 3D effects. Selick outshines the competition creating jaw-dropping surreal backgrounds and astonishingly alive figurines. His level of precision and overall scope are just admirable. All in all, Coraline is exceptional in its depiction of wonders that traditional stop-motion technique of animation can bring.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Creepy and charming stop-motion gem,"Based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, Coraline was a 2009 stop-motion animated feature from director Henry Selick. Released in 3D, the film made the most of the revived gimmick and it was a bigger hit at the box-office than expected.Selick being the quiet maestro behind Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, there was a good chance that Coraline would impress animation-wise and, indeed, this was a gorgeous-looking movie with excellent stop-motion work, stylish gothic visuals and a colorful palette. This earned the film several Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, and rightly so. Coraline tells the story of the titular little girl (voiced by Dakota Fanning) who moves into a new house in a new neighborhood with her work-focused parents who don't exactly make her the centre of attention.Coraline's Alice-like curiousness leads her to uncovering a small door in her bedroom that appears to lead to another dimension, one not unlike her own world but with a few key differences: her parents and eccentric neighbors focus on her and nothing else, plus they happen to literally have buttons for eyes. Initially, Coraline embraces this other world, that seems a lot more inviting than her own dreary reality, but things take a worrying turn when her ""other parents"" demand for her to accept having buttons sewn where her eyes are.This is a much darker film than you'd expect with the whole buttons-for-eyes thing a constant threat to the main characters and some surprisingly gruesome imagery thrown in. That said, there's also a lot of fun to be had with the film's goofier characters and its twisted sense of humour. Coraline's neighbors Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Forcible (Dawn French) all provide some welcome randomness (mice circuses, stuffed dogs, near-nude theatrical performances) throughout.They're a likable bunch and there's a point to them being there but, to nitpick slightly, it would have probably been better had their scenes been blended into the story more organically, rather than just having Coraline going to their homes back and forth.This is, in fact, the film's only (minor) flaw: it feels a tad distracted at times and parts of it (ghost children etc.) don't feel quite as necessary as they should feel. Everything else is so good, though, that this is unlikely to tarnish such a beautifully animated, emotionally rich and charming film.With Coraline, Henry Selick perfectly captures the unsettling tone of Neil Gaiman's work and delivers another stop-motion gem that, while it might be a bit too scary for younger viewers, is simply a treat that's well worth revisiting.Just very good.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Predictable, but fun nevertheless","The story isn't really a big mystery and you will have figured out, where it all heads after a few minutes. But the journey is it's own reward in this case. The visuals are really great (and I only watched the 2-D version) and the voice cast they assembled, fits perfectly into the story.It is like a fairy tale, so the lack of story surprises shouldn't be bothering you, but you should bathe in the visual surprises the movie has in store for you. Much love and surely a lot of work has gone into the animation of this movie and it translates onto the screen.

a lot of Michigan people move to Oregon,"Full disclosure: I haven't read the book on which Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" is based (I haven't read any of Neil Gaiman's works, in fact). That said, ""Coraline"" is one impressive movie. This story of a girl who discovers a passage to a parallel universe that isn't what it seems reminds us that animation doesn't have to be ""cute"" or ""nice""; after all, it's just another type of filmmaking. The stop-motion animation creates a mind-bending, eerie feeling throughout. Of course, it helps that the movie has a clever plot and good voice work.I watched the movie in 3D and then watched the featurette about the production. It was quite the involved process, which only makes one appreciate the movie even more.One mistake that I noticed was that they gave Bobinsky a middle name. Instead of middle names, the eastern Slavs have patronymics (so instead of Alexander, it should've been Alexandrovich).All in all, it's one fine movie. A real credit to the dark fantasy genre, and far better than Selick's most famous movie (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" had a neat plot, but would've been better had it not been a musical).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Extraordinary Name = Extraordinary Adventure""","Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.I really wish more movies would follow this simple and great movie structure.

While there is a lot left unexplained, there is plenty that is exampled about the Beldam and her world.The movie also reminds me a lot of ""The Wizard of Oz"" in a few different ways so its good that there are family friendly movies of this quality that make vague callbacks to classic movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
one of the finest animation of the year,I'm back after long tour of North India and confused among all the heap of DVDs lying on my table from a month or so and than I found this fine animation film. I'm impressed by the wonderful imagination world of story writer and Director Henry Selick.Coraline is a sweet little girl whose parents are busy in their own world and don't pay much attention to her. So she felt bored and neglected in her newly shifted home. One night the girl discovered a secret magic window leads her to different world. The fantasy becomes her other home with replica button eyed parents fulfilling her every demands. She meets her weird friend Wybie and flexi neighbor Bobinski in this other world too. It becomes routine matter for her to witness this other fantasy home at night and returns to real world in the morning when she wake up. But as the story progress it intrigues you completely as in the case of cute Coraline who lured away by the scheming of other fantasy home. All glitter isn't gold always.The blending of graphics and animation is full of innovation and originality and shows pool of creativity and that's make the film different from all other earlier seen cutie animation flicks.Recommended to all animation lovers.Ratings-8/10,8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Masterpiece of Storytelling,"""Coraline"" is a visually stunning and emotionally engaging stop-motion animated film directed by Henry Selick. The story follows a curious and adventurous young girl named Coraline who discovers a secret door in her new home that leads to a parallel world, where her ""other"" parents are more attentive and loving.

A  wonderfully whimsical ly cute  feast for the eyes with a somewhat touching message,"There comes a time (well MANY times really) in a percosious tween's life when he or she feels lonely, bored, ignored or all-of-the-above.""Why don't my parents listen to me?"" ""Why can't I ever get anything want?"" Sometimes we just wish our lives were full of magic, joy and indulgent parents...That's the perfect life! Or is it? The lush, exuberant stop-motion vehicle ""Coraline"" asks these questions, telling a tale of a wayward bored blue-haired little girl whose emotionally-distant preoccupied parents move into a dreary seemly-ordinary ancient house, that is a tunnel to an alternate world, discovered by the disenchanted girl.There is never a dull moment in this film....The colors & animation techniques pop right off the screen (and I didn't even SEE this in 3-D! I doubt there's much of a difference) I don't know if it's too late for this to be an Oscar-contender but it definitely deserves a nod.Now does this has any ""re-watchability"" appeal?...I'm not quite sure; time will tell.But I enjoyed myself in the theaters & for a family or just an animation fanantic such as myself this is a must-see.However, you may want to keep the very ""small"" and/or ""sensetive"" children home with the babysitter, because there are many parts (including the climax) that would probably frighten kids under those 2 categories...Also a very ""cheeky"" (and flabby) scene involving the two resident eccentric retired burlesque/circus performers of the Pink Palace may be inappropriate as well.Other than that, the film is perfectly innocent and you just might walk away appreciating your ""real"" parents & kids more than you did before walking in the theatre.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visual Masterpiece,"First let me profess my love for just the look of the film. Unlike Selick's work with Nightmare Before Christmas (Which was more of Tim Burton's vision) This is more colorful and artistic. The 3D is spectacular and makes one believe that 3D has a true future in cinema. We have little Coraline who your basic little girl who moves into a new apartment with her neglecting parents. She then finds a portal within the apartment that leads to another world completely opposite from her own, and when she thinks that this world that she found is her dream come true, it turns into a nightmare. Now we have seen this story many times, and that can sometimes bring a movie down, but with this movie it's done so beautifully, that it's easy to forget all the movies that had the same premise. Now please note this can be very disturbing for little kids, this is a very tight PG rating. Some parts can be overly creepy, which got my little cousin crying and wanting to leave. Overall It's and an amazing accomplishment, for 3D, and for For cinema in general",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A film to only be seen once.,"Coraline is a one time film. I would recommend you watch this on TV or at the cinema but do not buy the DVD. I bought the DVD and once i watched this once i have never watched it again as it is boring!

Nothing like the Moon,"Henry Selick again brings a tour-de-force by way of fascinating innovation in ""puppetmation"".The story, adapted from a fine Neil Gaiman work, features feisty 'tween Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning), fresh from Michigan and taking up residence with her independent journalist parents in ""The Pink Palace"", a landmark on the edge of nowhere. The only other kid for miles, Wybie (Robbie Bailey), is a rambling nerd with a strange pet cat, her mother (Teri Hatcher) is absorbed in meeting her deadline, her father (John Hodgman) is, well, simply absorbed, and her neighbors are elderly oddities, especially Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane, in a role that suits him), a former acrobat from Russia with an appreciation for stinky cheese. Things aren't necessarily bad, just weird and dull.That is, until Coraline unlocks a door in the house far too small for most humans, and discovers another world, where another family awaits, similar to the first family, but with everything Coraline misses. All too soon, the lines between fantasy and reality blur, and Coraline is forced into making a decision that will either change her life or end it.The usual nitpicks may rear their ugly heads when comparing the film to the novel, but in general, this is a great adaptation, in that it captures the essence of the story. Reality and fantasy blur as quickly for the viewers as they do for Coraline, which helps to plunge us into the urgency. The flowing animation, some of the best I've seen for stop-motion OR go-motion, rivals the best CGI; even surpasses it in digital! Details are well-pronounced, from Coraline's wardrobe (as well as the other characters'), to the evolving garden outside, to the near ever-present moon, which plays a peculiar role in marking time and stretching the suspense. Again, the film is best experienced in digital, and a worthwhile experience in 3-D, if you can plunk down the extra cash.While the pace may drift in a few places, that is certainly a minor gripe. If you like a good suspense story, there's really no reason to stay away from the Pink Palace, unless of course, Grandma tells you to.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

What bothered my daughter were the spooky images of the ""other"" family's crossed out eyes. It ended up scaring her. What bothered me was those two weird sisters that did their little musical number with the fat one wearing little more than a thong and nipple flowers. I almost regurgitated my popcorn at that point. I know they tried to send the message of ""be careful what you wish for"" and being happy with what you have, but this left me feeling nauseated, disappointed and wanting my money back.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creepy - in all of the best ways,"A little too spooky for the under-10 crowd. Younger children could be frightened by overtly threatening nature of the last third of the movie, but the older viewer will be able to appreciate that the truly unnerving part of this film is actually in the middle, beginning with the little hints that something is not quite right with this world. This feeling is enhanced by the dramatic irony (that Coraline does not yet recognize her peril). The scenes with the silent Wybie were, to me, the best in this regard.My favorite quote (and it's not even in the IMDb quote list): Coraline, to herself, watching the cat disappear with the rat in its mouth: ""Gooooood Kitty.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline,"Coraline is a stop motion and three dimensional animated film based upon the book of the same name by Neil Gaiman. The story focuses on a young girl named Coraline, who has just moved into a dark and dreary town with her two parents, who pay little to no attention to her at all. When Coraline goes to sleep she dreams of an alternate version of her new home and a much warmer and kindler family. Coraline wishes she could live in this dream world permanently, but as she soon discovers it really is not as it seems and there is actually a lot of danger lurking in this seemingly happy and carefree world, Coraline must eventually save herself and save the day and all of this is done in fantastic animation complete with 3D glasses the theatre gives you to view the movie in. There has been a lot of animated films as of late and for the most part they do not really appeal to me and for the most part I do not end up seeing them. I also do not care much for 3D animation all that much. I find it feels too computerized and I miss the days of hand drawn animation. Even the stop motion animation used in Coraline and the director's other film The Nightmare Before Christmas, I much prefer to 3D animation. It just looks a lot more interesting and I do not know if this is just coincidence, or not, but the stop motion films seem to have better stories and more originality than I find the 3D ones have. I also like the new computer type animation where the director films live scenes and paints over them with a computer program as seen in films like Waking Life. Back to Coraline now. The film with it's visuals, animation and the 3D glasses that accompanied the film made it a visual feast and it was a complete pleasure to look at and I really enjoyed that aspect of the film. Coraline's story was full of dark and more grim story telling, but I have always had a fascination with that kind of material, so it pleased me to no end. I also found the film to be fascinating, it moved along quite well and I wouldn't normally comment on something like this, but I found the voice actors for the film were really very well suited to the characters they were playing. Coraline is a film for anyone who likes the unknown, or mysteries, or for fans of 3D, or just animation in general I think it would be hard for anyone to not appreciate something of this film's top notch animation and the wonderful storytelling that went with it. This film has tons of excitement, great visuals and is all and all a very entertaining night out at the movies, which is often needed in the dark and grim months of the winter, much of like where Coraline lives. This film is highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Stop motion animated film offers scares and delights,"""Coraline,"" is a fantastic mix of the traditional and the cutting edge. Utilizing beautiful stop motion animation and presented in 3D, in some theaters, the film offers a time-honored message in a state of the art package. 3D has advanced to the point where it actually serves the story as opposed to being an end unto itself. In the opening credit sequence, we see long, spindly iron fingers above the screen as they construct a button-eyed doll. There is menace in these metallic hands and the three dimensional effect adds to the sense of dread. The hands seem close and capable of reaching out to us. When the characters on screen stand outside a doorway, the viewers are tempted to lean forward in order to peak into the room. The 3D is effective and enriching.Coraline (Dakota Fanning), the pre-teen heroine of the film, is moving into an apartment complex in the filled with eccentric neighbors. Her parents both write and leave Coraline feeling alone and neglected. She hates her dad's cooking and misses her old friends. And then she finds a mysterious door in the wall and while playing one evening chases a little mouse through the door and into a mirror universe that looks similar to her own, but seems better. The food is better, the world never boring, and her button-eyed Other Mother and Father give her everything she wants.The film, based on an excellent novel for children by Neil Gaiman, has a strong message at its heart. ""Coraline"" posits that hedonism is both empty and dangerous. Also, in order to fully indulge you must become blind to the suffering your pursuits will cause. It's a bit surprising that in a package as cutting edge and fantastic as ""Coraline"" that we are essentially being presented with a traditional moral warning. The film is not heavy handed, however, and your pre-teens will not quickly pick up on the message. In the context of the film, the message is completely sensible.The animation on display is excellent, but as the movie showcases its character design and animation set pieces the story loses some momentum. Once Coraline discovers her quest, however, the movie becomes engrossing and tense. In fact, the film's extended climax will likely be too intense for the very young. The voice work is delightful with Terri Hatcher surprising in two roles as Coraline's mother and the film's villain. She is obviously enjoying the role and it enriches the entire experience. Also listen for a cameo by John Linnell of ""They Might Be Giants."" The artistry on display is delightful and the film offers a unique animated experience.

"Beautifully Animated With An Engrossing Story, But With A Rather Stale Protagonist And Lacklustre Jump-Scares","Pros:
1. The animation is really beautiful, and its unique imagery still holds up 11 years later.
2. The sharp and luxurious colour palette for the button world, in contrast to the dull colour palette for the real world, help to convey Coraline's (Dakota Fanning) feelings towards each world.
3. The score is both mystical and adventurous, which perfectly compliments the world.
4. Dakota Fanning and Keith David (The Cat) give great voice-acting performances.
5. The sound design is fantastic which enables the world created to come to life.
6. The transition to a more horror-esque theme is expertly and seamlessly done.
7. Despite the horror and disarming atmosphere, the movie displays a heartwarming message of cherishing your family, which is what you want from a kids film.Cons:
1. Coraline, as a character, is a little stale and two-dimensional as she's only inquisitive because her parents neglect her.
2. The jump-scares, although well-placed, don't land and thus feel underwhelming.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An animated masterpiece,"Narrated in such a way that brings up all your favorites. The Nigntmare before Christmas, scissor-hand, corpse bride.Excellent animate, funny dialogs, creepy in some points even for the adult ones. The music keeps captivating you through the hole movie.It s a very well constructed story about a girl moving somewhere else when suddenly-in her own place-something really weird is starting to unfold and confuse her to the point that she must take some decisions for her-and others-life.The script is well-written though i have not read the book, but i can tell for sure that from the start to the end your eyes are stacked to the screen to see what is going to happen next.9 out of 10 and too bad this movie didn't come in air on winter. It is a really winter movie just to enjoy it with a cup of hot chocolate. A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creepy and Characterful,"Extremely late to the party on this one. Only *checks watch* eleven years. EXISTENTIAL DREAD. Laika's first is a characterful whirligig of unnerving imagery - even going into it knowing that Coraline would be quite unsettling didn't prepare me for some of it. I'm genuinely in love with the idea of this haunted vaudeville clambering into the hearts and minds of children and the breathtaking scale and mind-breaking detail of the confection is legitimately stunning. Although the additions to the novel are likely necessarily there is a notable lag around the 80 minute mark where the, almost stop-and-click style, fetchquests feel quite perfunctory. It's an absorbing and entertaining project though and certainly a very solid foundation for Laika's later stop-motion triumphs.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tragic Adaptation,"I read the book years ago and found it charming. This is just... Awful. Disturbed, uninteresting, and just plain bad. Coraline on the book was clever and likable, this Coraline is a whiney brat with no redeeming qualities. The animation is disappointing, considering it was made by the makers of A Nightmare Before Christmas, jerky and unimpressive for so many years of work. It doesn't follow the book in any meaningful way. I regret watching this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
wow,"I have no idea how this film was even selled as a kids movie... Im not complaining tho, Coraline its probably my favorite animated movie of all time. The story is incredibly original and the animation is beautiful but disturbing at the same time. The film its incredibly smart and the soundtrack is the definition of ""ICONIC"".The disturbing scenes are scary without needing jump-scares or extremely grotesque images, they only need the vibe, story and a little touch of suspense and there you got it. A timeless masterpiece that traumatized a lot of us when we were children (in the best way possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best (non-pixar) family films in years.,"Coraline is visually arresting and somewhat twisted, but what would you expect from the minds behind the film? Neil Gaiman's voice has always been a bit Gothic and warped, but it adds to his appeal. You can see a Henry Sellick picture a mile away, even if many confuse him with Tim Burton simply because Sellick directed a Tim Burton written film (Seriously though people, the film would not have been the same without Sellick. Give him some freakin' credit!) and had it be his biggest success, and truly his best film. Until now.I didn't really know what to expect going into Coraline, although I love Neil Gaiman, I have yet to read the novel, but I did at least figure the film would be good if it stayed to his distinct style. Thankfully, it did although much more in the vein of his more lighthearted stories such as Anansi Boys than the neo-Gothic of American Gods. The film is still plenty dark though, just enough to grip an older audience and put a little fear into the younger ones, but not enough to scare them off. Just as the dark parts are engaging, the humour isn't half bad either. There are several scenes that are chuckle worthy and have that distinct Gaiman-bite that made his more comedic pieces so much fun. A lot of the humour comes from the titular character, which makes her a bit more likable, considering that she's not your typical heroine. Rather than being brave and abstractly noble, shes a little brat. Well, okay, so things change for the climax, but Coraline is portrayed a bit more realistically when it comes to the way your typical spoiled 8 year old would be. Dakota Fanning does a great job playing Coraline as well, and is probably a better voice than live actress.In the end, Coraline is a highly entertaining film. It has amazing visuals, a fun, sometimes twisted and creepy but imaginative story, and great characters, each with their own quirk that makes you glad they came onto the screen. It's nice to see a family film that takes a few risks and delves into a darker territory, but it knows where to stop without going to far, and it knows how to please a fully adult crowd as well.Here's to another Neil Gaiman-Henry Sellick collaboration in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fond Memories,"I can still remember the day I first saw Coraline.I was in the theatre. It was one of (if not THE) first films I've ever seen in Real-D 3D. It had on the poster that it was From the Director of The Nightmare Before Christmas so I, like many others, incorrectly assumed it was a Tim Burton film.
Although it easily could've been a Burton film, it wasn't.Based on the equally unsettling Neil Gaiman novel of the same title, Coraline scared me witless in the theatre. It made me laugh (see: Sirens of the Sea) until I cried with my immature, adolescent sense of humour at the time, and, when it needed to serve up the tension, it delivered on every count. This movie was even more intense than any horror movie I've ever seen in a theatre.Even the home experience doesn't fare out much better. It's not a movie I watch too often because it is so dark and intense. It may have been billed as a children's movie, but it's surprisingly dark. Especially when you consider the old saying that your eyes are the windows to your soul and what it really means in relation to the movie. But that's as far as I'll go on that.I can't in good faith give it 10/10, however, and it's just because of the stop-motion. It's a little unfair to compare this film to The Nightmare Before Christmas, but the posters themselves made the comparison, so I will to. Nightmare was so meticulously and perfectly done, but it was a much more toned-down simplistic style. It wasn't trying to be flashy. Coraline, on the other hand, was a lot more ambitious and undoubtedly more difficult to convincingly pull off. It did its best, but there were a few moments that were in desperate need of some touch-up (a scene of Bobinski walking and the mouse circus show, to state two of the most cringey moments looking back).Overall, this film is commendable for the high level of ambition of the project alone. The team behind Coraline really weren't afraid to stretch the limits as far as they possibly could, and what they ended up with was a beautifully twisted fantasy that is fun to revisit from time to time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brilliant aesthetics and low-octane nightmare fuel,"Some viewers found the pacing of this film slow. I disagree. While little outright action or drama occurs in the first half of the film, it is loaded with foreshadowing, setups, and I was riveted by the beautiful worldscape, quirky and amusing secondary characters, and dazzling musical score. For much of the film, I wanted to crawl down the blue tunnel to the Other World. I drooled and licked my lips when the breakfast was frying, and I could almost smell the luminous moving flowers. Then I tried to cover my oh-so-vulnerable eyeballs.Mark my words, this is not a fantasy adventure film. It's aimed at kids. It has tolerable amounts of whimsy in it.Its genre is Surreal Horror.It's not a spooky comedy, like ""Monster House."" It's not a musical with vaguely creepy trappings, like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" It is a HORROR film. Personally, I found this film had nightmare fuel, cut with whimsy to reduce its carbon emissions. There is nightmare fuel, but just enough for a quick trip to the nightmare convenience store for a gallon of nightmare milk. Most viewers, however, have milder tastes, and find that it is quite nightmarish enough.Yes, it's a horror film. That doesn't mean its not for kids.Kids, if you like to be scared, go. If you enjoy films that take their time, that plot and hint in the darkness while the weave a web of enchantment around you, see it. Just be warned that this feature may be too scary for adults. If you have doubts, leave your parents at home.This movie has a message about a appreciating the parents you've got. The more introspective parents may notice that it also carries a stern lesson for adults. Listen to your kids and pay attention, or they'll find somebody ELSE who takes an interest, and that person might not be friendly. Don't lie to your children; it's wicked, it teaches them to mistrust you, and they'll find the truth eventually. Don't think that the words ""I love you"" are a cover-all excuse for your mistakes and manipulations.Coraline is where the Beautiful meets the Sublime. It's too scary for kids under seven or over thirty.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Very good! BUT, It just wasn't creepy enough!","First Id like to say I didn't read the book but a friend I was with did, and she enjoyed it. I myself liked it very much. I saw it in 3D, while nothing to fancy with the 3D, some scenes were out of this world in 3D. I sat there with a.........WOW face on. Just all the colors and the animation is great. I wasn't expecting to like the animation all that much, because the preview didn't do much for me, but it really WOWed me, especially in the garden scene, just wonderful. The characters, acting, music especially etc were all great but I had a few small problems. 1-It just wasn't creepy enough! I really wanted to feel sorry for Coraline and see her truly horrified, because some of the events in the movie would kinda freak a kid out. 2-It seemed kinda rushed. Just went swiftly from scene to scene even with a 1 hour and 41 minute run time. But in conclusion, I liked it and will be buying the DVD and it really is a good family movie. Kids shouldn't get scared. Again, great movie so go see it. :D",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Gothic Animation,"What do you get if you mix together the Wizard of Oz, the Chronciles of Narnia, Spirited Away, Alice in Wonderland, The Amber Spyglass and Tim Burton? You get Coraline, a big screen adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novella.The last film based on the work by Neil Gaiman made the very enjoyable Stardust. Whilst Coraline has a similar theme, it is so very different at the same time.Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) is a young adventurous girl who has just moved to the rainy state of Oregon. Her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) are writers and are too busy to spend time with their daughter or do the activities she wants to. Her mum is cold and irritable at times whilst her dad is kind-hearted but a bit hopeless. The neighbours include a local boy Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.), the formers actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) and the gymnast Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) who training mice to do jumping tricks. Coraline is bored, frustrated and ignored, but she discoveries a magic door to another world. There it seems perfect, with her parents doing anything she wants, like cook nice meals and see magical performances by the neighbours. But every time she wakes up in her own bed and she has to face to reality of her own world. She longs to go back to the Other World, but she gets warned by the black cat (Keith David) that the world was not as it seems, and she soon discovers that it a very dark place indeed.The animation is beautiful, with fantastic puppet, stop-motion which can rival Aardman Animation. There are lovely subtle touch and the designs of sets and characters which makes the film worth seeing in itself. It clear that by the style of storytelling and animation that the director Henry Selick was from the Tim Burton school. Even the opening is like a Tim Burton film. The story itself is wonderfully original, but because it Gothic feel and be scary at places it is not advised for young children to see this film. It is a good to see a young girl as the lead protagonist.The voice acting is good. Dakota Fanning shows why she is one of best child actresses around. Teri Hatcher is good and shows her range in this film. It's good to see French and Saunders in an American film and carrying on her double act with a love-hate relationship. I also enjoyed Keith David as the cat. But the performance I enjoyed the most of Ian McShane who had excellent comedy skills and very different to his role in Deadwood. His character's appearance also reminded me of Dr. Robotnik.I saw the film in 3D which made for increasing viewing and was stylist, but the novelty worn off because of the power of the story-telling. It would easy enough to watch it in 2D.This is the first animated film I have seen in the cinema since The Increadibles, and it was a good choice. It good to see an animated film made out of love and not just a cheap cash-in.A lovely, 4 out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Classic Art Direction, Mature Use of 3D, Not Quite Perfect","Good day for Dakota Fanning fans, as she stars in 2 new flix opening this week; Coraline's the one to see 1st; Push (which I rated 7) is the one where you get to see HER.Tim Burton's name appeared in front of 1993's The Nightmare before Christmas (7), but it was director Henry Selick who did most of the work. Selick's back with another round of the fiendishly painstaking technique known as stop-motion animation, this time of Neil Gaiman's novella, winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for 2003.1st off, the film is an absolute visual delight, wonderfully well realized. 2nd, it's an even richer story than the novella. 3rd, it uses 3D effects tastefully; there are no yo-yos, lances, or pickaxes poking out of the screen at you.The Jones family is newly moved into the Pink Palace Apartments, and Mom and Dad, both gardening writers, are frantically trying to meet a deadline, so they have no time for Coraline. She pokes around on her own, meeting the eccentric nabors, and eventually stumbles onto a secret door that leads to an alternate universe where her Other Mother and Other Father are much nicer and more attentive. They encourage her to stay permanently, something that will happen if she lets them sew buttons into her eyesockets, just like theirs. At this point, Coraline is understandably totally creeped out and wants to get back to the normal world, but Other Mother is, shall we say, both persistent and resourceful.The art direction here will certainly go down in the history of cinema as a classic. That the film itself falls a tad short of that pinnacle is due to a slight distancing of Coraline from the audience; she is somebody we watch, not somebody we identify with, and that makes a difference just significant enuf to keep this otherwise excellent effort from my top score of 9.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Puts Some Magic Back in Animation,"I've had a lot of respect for the Pixar folks over the past several years. I enjoyed THE INCREDIBLES and WALL-E and to a lesser extent FINDING NEMO and RATATOUILLE. CORALINE is a different class of movie altogether. While Pixar has been breaking barriers in realism, CORALINE follows Alice down the rabbit hole into a world of fantasy. And it's a fantasy land I haven't visited in a while: a welcome change. CORALINE's world is designed to beguile her with wonder and Henry Selick manages to beguile the audience with wonder too. This is the first 3D movie I've seen that actually knows what to do with the process. While the story is as classic as a trip down the rabbit hole or to Oz, its sinister twist and vivid imagination make it a fresh experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline VS. The Wall,"I decided to watch Pink Floyd's THE WALL with my friend, who had just watched CORALINE for the umpteenth time, and wouldn't you know that old classic film is still showing itself in modern movies. I mean, a modern kids' movie is the last place you'd expect to see a drug and violence littered psychoanalysis, or is it? A rough, short list of visual comparisons: ~ The evil mother in CORALINE vs. the evil wife Silhouette that appears on pink's hotel room wall after his fit of crazy rage. ~ The two Ladies in the play Coraline goes to see, a haggard fat one and the other with tits that outweigh the rest of her body, bare a striking resemblance the Pink's wife and mother waiting backstage during ""the Trial"" ~Other images in CORALINE that appear in THE WALL include a praying mantis, originally used as a symbol for women after Pink flips out and later as a mechanical planter in Coraline's garden. Also, the image of the brick wall that separates Coraline from her dream world likewise separates Pink from the real world throughout THE WALL. Not mention all the flowers and who yet knows how many other images. ~Quick note, people who worked on CORALINE also worked on THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, namely Henry Selick, and Jack Skeleton's head looks quiet a bit like the little doll caught in barbed wire during ""the Trial."" ~This is just an ""at a glance"" comparison, but we agree there are too many similarities for it to be coincidence. Some of these animation directors must have been sitting around, watching THE WALL, letting those pictures seep in and influence them 25 years later. So once again, no ideas are original, but they can sure get twisted, can't they?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved It!,"We weren't quite sure what to expect with Coraline. We knew it would be good since it was a Tim Burton film and we ended up being very pleased with it. It was definitely what you'd expect from Mr. Burton. It had a great mix of humor, dark situations, and overall weirdness. It would be a little too creepy for children who aren't able to distinguish fantasy from reality, so I would recommend it to children 7+.The film is done in claymation, but it is done so well that after a few minutes, you hardly notice it. Mr. Burton did a wonderful job on all of the characters. He did a great job matching personalities and looks to each of the characters and they are characters that anyone can relate to. The music was absolutely wonderful and quirky and carried you through the scenes. I would love to see this in 3-D. Adults are able to enjoy this just as much as children and I am very pleased with this film. It's original, creative, well-done, and worth a look. Definitely worth a purchase.

Dark and magical dream,"Coraline Jones is a girl who is bored with her life and wants to find some excitement. Her dream comes true when she finds a secret door in the new house she moved into. Which takes her into a alternative universe where everything is just the way she wants it, but all isn't what it seems. I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman but from what I heard and read it follows is pretty closely. This is a film that kids and even adults can enjoy, it's atmosphere is a bit dark and kinda like watching a crazy dream come to life but you just can't help but be enveloped in this world. The whole premise was hauntingly pretty to look at and it's even choreographed really well. For me it was like watching a very dark version of ""Alice in Wonderland"". I am not a fan of Dakota Fanning, but she really does shine in this film and her voice acting is superb. ""Coraline"" is a film for all ages to enjoy and have a good time with.8.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mother didn't like it.,"'Kid-friendly horror' is an interesting, if somewhat oxymoronic, concept. It isn't a genre - or, perhaps, idea - that's explored all too often. 'Coraline (2009)' is probably the first, and most effective, example of it that comes to mind. It confidently walks the tightrope of being tame enough for (older) children yet strong enough (to more than likely) scare those children just the right amount - all while, of course, being narratively and aesthetically appealing enough, in a creepy kind of way, for the adults in the audience, too. It's definitely a difficult thing to accomplish, yet the piece does so with ease. One of the ways it does this is by focusing on the adventurous, 'face your fears' aspects of its genre. This, along with its engaging and believable protagonist, makes for a compelling and accessible story that isn't mired in jump-scares, an oppressive atmosphere or gore. It's never dour and it actually leaves you feeling quite happy. When you think back, the emotion that first comes to mind isn't necessarily fear. Don't get me wrong, though, it's very much a 'horror' movie; it fits right in with those conventions, even if it also weaves in decent doses of fantasy, comedy and adventure. Personally, I don't find it scary but I don't think I'm supposed to - I'm an adult. You have to remember its target audience. It's meant to be a gateway horror to introduce potential new fans to the genre. It actually plays into legitimate fears - based on legitimate, if short-sighted, desires - and is resonant because of it. Besides which, it's just downright entertaining and that's the most important thing. The design of the flick, which is brought to life with beautiful stop-motion, is brilliant. The initially wonderful 'other' world contorts from whimsical to creepy in incredibly inventive, world-consistent ways. There are some spooky set-pieces that feature superbly unsettling, but still suitably pastel, imagery. Plus, the colourful characters that inhabit both of the picture's parallel planes are thoroughly enjoyable. It's interesting, and almost disturbing, that the characters created by the 'other mother' are essentially slaves; they're aware of their status as constructs but don't actually want to serve their function and constantly try to warn our hero of the danger she's in, often suffering horrible consequences and losing what little imitated humanity they were initially afforded. On top of all this, the flick has strong allegorical undertones which bolster its strong central message. You come away from it feeling elated. Ultimately, it's a uniquely presented, consistently entertaining and, in many ways, daringly dark family film, one that you can watch again and again. It's just delightful. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brilliant...the best animated movie in years,"First, let me point out that this film could easily have been rated PG-13. In fact, the 2nd half of this film is more frightening than most of the other PG-13 movies out there, even though it is animated. That being said, this movie is probably too scary for anyone under about 9 years old. I also believe its story is too complex for anyone under about 9 years old. Parents will have to make their own decisions regarding this, but just don't be surprised if your child is a little confused by the story or a little bored by the lack of action scenes. This is basically a character study film aimed at a more intelligent audience with somewhat developed attention spans.One of the first things I noticed while watching this movie in the theaters (and I also have seen it about 4 times on DVD already) is how very little ""action"" is in the film, especially for an animated film. At 1 hour and 40 minutes long, it is about 10-20 minutes longer than most every other children's movie these days. Its focus is not on fun or adventure, but rather on telling a character study based on Coraline's lonely and insecure life. This will bore many kids who go to the movies expecting the loud, colorful, chase scenes that animated movies usually have to keep the attention of their target audience. No, instead of going for action Coraline is brilliant by taking its sweet little time to build up atmosphere and intensity. One of the ways Selick does this is by filming 95% of the film either inside Coraline's house or just outside the house, somewhere in the yard. As you watch the film, this claustrophobic feeling starts to build, as you realize that you are stuck in this house and in this yard, just like Coraline. This really creates the intensity and emotion, along with the fear that comes in the 2nd half of the film. The beautiful musical score contributes to this claustrophobic feel as well.Unlike some animated movies that feel like they have about an hour's worth of script material, then spend the next 15 minutes on some climactic action scene (again, this has to do with a studio dumbing down the plot to please the attention spans of the kids), this movie has A LOT of story to tell during its running time. And it's a good story. A compelling, engaging, and complete story. And it is told so smoothly by Director Henry Selick. It does not at all surprise me that this book won the Newberry Award some years ago.I'm just very pleased to see that studios have the guts to tell engaging, high-quality stories like this. Along with Wall-E, this is a positive sign that not everyone in Hollywood refuses to stifle creativity. Yes, it is scary at times, and yes parts of it are reminiscent of parts of the Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, Pan's Labyrinth, etc...but this film is still so original when compared to the crap Hollywood makes these days. This film is truly a work of art, and I hope Henry Selick starts getting more work!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Right on Target! :),"In all honesty, this movie looked only okay at first. I went into the movie theater, expecting nothing too amazing. Of course, I knew that Tim Burton was one of the big names behind this movie (he's the same guy who made ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") but I still - more or less expected an average movie. Little did I know how wrong I was.Coraline was a brilliant movie. No, not as good as Finding Nemo or Wall- E, but still an outstanding movie that I give my props to. I'm not a real big fan with the doll style of animation, but I put that aside. The story itself portrayed that good old moral, ""Be careful what you wish for"" in an amazing way that I have never seen or read before. The visuals, despite my dislikes, were very good seeing how hard it must have been. Combined with that and the music, it creates a vivid world for you to digest easily - along with your popcorn and soda or whatever food you may choose.Little kids may enjoy this movie, but I think mid-age children up will find this movie more interesting or at least get the moral better. Above all, I think this is one great movie that is a must-see for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Third times the charm,"I just got back from my third viewing of this wonderful movie. Yes, third. I saw it on opening day, and felt I didn't get everything in the movie, so I bought the book next day, read it, and saw it again the following Saturday. Loved it as much as the first time and actually understood everything that happened, so why did I decide to see it again a few hours ago? Well today's the last day it's playing around here, so if I didn't, I'd never get a chance to see it in theaters again, and I felt it deserved another watching.As for a review, what can I say that hasn't been said? Everything about this movie, from the intriguing characters to the familiar yet still interesting story to the beautiful settings to the amazing music/score(favorite part), everything fit together so well and made for a truly memorable film that I will undoubtedly be getting on DVD when it comes out. See it if you haven't, see it again if you have and enter an incredible fantasy world like none other. My only regret is I didn't get a chance to see it in 3D, although as you can see from the review, that didn't take away from the experience any.Plus, after just opening my email for it's daily check a few minutes ago, I noticed that I won a pair of those fancy Coraline dunks.

Kudos To Henry Sellick,"Henry Sellick is one gem of an animator to be reckoned with. His contribution to stop motion animation is superb. I had my world rocked big time with 'Nightmare Before Christmas',as well as 'James And The Giant Peach'. Sellick mines the harbor of author Neil Gaiman (American Gods)with the story of Coraline, a feisty 11 year-old girl (voiced by Dakota Fanning)who is very unhappy with the fact that she's been moved from her original home (as well as her best friends),to live in a creepy old house, with some pretty weird neighbors. When Coraline finds a portal into a alternate dimension with parents who seem like the ideal parents,Coraline seriously decides to cross over to that realm,for good. Somehow, something seems...well...not quite right. The film gets some good mileage from the other voice talents on parade here (including Terri Hatcher as both her Mothers). This lovingly stop motion animated feature film is available in both 3-D digital projection, as well as standard 2-D,for the benefit of cinemas that do not have the set ups for 3-D,digital projection (if you have the open window of opportunity to see the 3-D edition,by all means,do it--although the 2-D animated prints would be just as much fun). Handed a PG rating by the MPAA,this film serves up some situations that are pretty creepy & scary for the little ones (much like 'Nightmare Before Christmas'was).

Coroline. Not quite a kids movie. Not quite for adults,"I was very excited to see Coraline. It looked like a fantastical kids movie. One I have been longing to see since The Nightmare Before Christmas.I'll just get right into it and say, I was very disappointed. First off, is this even supposed to be viewed by children? I can see how it would be creepy for a child to watch and besides that, Coraline isn't a very good role model. She is a very unpleasant child, not nice at all. She is always nasty to friends and her parents, and she always has some sort of attitude. It is obvious that she gets her bad behavior from her parents. They don't seem to be the most adoring of parents. They never have any time for her and they sadly have no shame in letting her know that. Along with all of her other negative behavior, Coraline has bad manners. She merely throws things on the floor when she is through with them and is quite demanding with her parents.I wasn't a fan of Coraline, the character or the movie. Aside from all of the negative character flaws, the film was slow moving and dull. Children would be attracted by all of the colors and graphics but there isn't much excitement. Though the plot is original and interesting, it wasn't successfully carried out or developed.This is a kids movie you should skip, for the adults and for the children.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"If David Lynch Made Animated Films, They Would Be Like This","I adore Henry Selick's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and its ghoulish sense of humor, so I was prepared for more of the same in ""Coraline."" But what I didn't expect was that this film would be so delightfully disturbing and so utterly sophisticated. For anyone who wants an antidote to the typical Disney-fied children's fare available to you (and even the Pixar films aren't excluded from that description), ""Coraline"" is for you.""Coraline"" is like a David Lynch film for kids. Like Lynch films, it seems to exist in a universe of its own, where an entirely different set of logic applies. The imagery in the film can be quite frightening at times, but it's also quite beautiful in its own way. And the film's ultimate message -- that kids need to accept the imperfections of their parents and stop moping about an adult world they don't entirely understand -- is a very grown up one.A marvelous animated film.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Every Member of the Audience Held in Rapt Attention,"In spite of the fact that this movie is directed by Tim Burton, in spite of my dislike of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and that I have so far denied myself a read of Neil Gaiman's book, I was delighted by the film ""Coraline."" The storytelling is bold and confident and we get to share with Coraline the growing sense of unease as she explores her new worlds, one her new home and the other the increasingly sinister reality behind the little hidden door. The characters are sharply realized, helped out by some outstanding voice work and what a treat to encounter among so many talents, French and Saunders brilliantly paired once more. Visually we are treated to a film that can and does rise to the level of art but does not forget to entertain. The 3-D is the icing on an already perfect cake. 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Alice Darkly Twisted,"Stop-motion animation is such a laborious task, particularly when presented in feature-length, that those few examples that are finally distributed are almost exclusively works of high quality both in form and content.That's especially true for Henry Selick's meticulously crafted Gothic tales with their wicked sense of humour and their intuition for the magic of the bizarre. His latest work - a clever twist on ""Alice in Wonderland"" with subliminally menacing picture-perfect happiness replacing Carroll's liberating nonsense - succeeds in all the right departments, from the gorgeous vistas, the haunting score, the great character design and voice-work, the countless sight-gags, the well-paced narrative up to the balanced mixture of heart and brains.The story is a tad too episodic and the showdown slightly disappoints, though. But it's a wonderful pic, anyway.8 out of 10 button eyes",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Clicked a lot better on the rewatch,"I have this problem, where if something has all this critical acclaim, I almost can't watch it. Not until the heat has cooled off, and even then. The problem is I hear a lot of praise about how it's the greatest thing to ever exist, I set my expectations too high, and it never lives up to it. It needs more distance so I can make up my own mind about it.Such was the case with Coraline: I saw it was new, didn't think I understood the hype, and kind of shrugged it off.Now, with the aid of more time and distance: this movie's awesome. I don't know why, but the first time I saw it, it only registered as being a little weird. Now on the rewatch, it's like, so much more obviously a horror story? And one where parts of it are genuinely unsettling, even as an adult. I'd even be willing to call it the perfect blend of being just spooky enough that it's kind of perfect for me.Sometimes you just gotta watch a movie more than once before it clicks.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Button eyed realm,"I like watching this movie in October, it has a PG rating just for creepy and disturbing imagery which is why I like watching it.The stop-motion animation by Laika Studios is amazing just like Aardman Studios that also makes amazing stop-motion movies. Its cool seeing how much effort is put into these types of movies.Dakota Fannig as Coraline was a good character and has great voice acting, the imagery in the Other Mother world is weird but creative. But when scary stuff happens the imagery changes and becomes creepy and disturbing which I loved.I love the scary imagery and how its used in the story, I can see kids liking this movie if they can handle the imagery used throughout.

Dark and overrated,"I haven't seen this movie in a while, but I still remember being scared of it as a kid. This movie is very dark and frightening and above all, very over-hyped.

Phenomenal Visuals & Story for 10 and up,"If your children are easily frightened by animated monster dolls that's up to the parent. However Coraline does deal with more mature themes for the 9-15 audience yo and is entertaining for adults as well. I can see 6-8 and some 9 year olds maybe becoming frightened from the tone and realism that comes with Stop Motion.The story is simple clear and moves very smoothly with excellently executed action scenes, and phenomenal range of Bizarre neighbors and excellent exploration into the theoretical parallel dimension as well as some demonic supernatural force.Laika Studio's first production excellent but for their future features the horror genre is phenomenal but dark comedy can work for children as well so I am glad they lighten up slightly in they're next two features.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very imaginative! Though a bit scary for younger children.,"I was really impressed by Coraline, though I have to say I didn't expect any less from Tim Burton or Neil Gaiman. I hadn't read the book beforehand - nor had I even heard of Coraline until going to see it.The animation was beautiful! Story unique and quirky. The characters amazingly eccentric and Burton-ish. I personally found Coraline a little whiny and annoying at points but I think this only makes the film better in a way - she has her own outspoken personality making her character more developed and fun. However, I do feel it is a little too scary for...I dunno...say ages 8 and under? And I'm not one to say that often - I do believe children shouldn't be pandered so much when it comes to imaginative movies.But nevertheless, if you're thinking of renting this movie for your younger family members I would investigate the parent's guide and content. The protagonist is quite nightmarish (especially towards the finale) and the idea of the 'magic door' being in the house sounds fine but my 8-year old cousin was freaked out by that. I think every kid should have a bit of Burton to remember from their childhood! If you're looking for a similar film (but maybe a little more easy going) I would recommend 'The Corpse Bride' - equally fantastic and though it may not sound it, is far less scary.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Coraline,"This Gothic animation feature comes from Henry Selick, the man who brought us THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas (1993), which is frequently mistaken as Tim Burton's work (actually Burton is only the co-producer and co-writer, as a matter of fact, Burton directed his debut animation feature not until CORPSE BRIDE in 2005).The dark palette of our indomitable Coraline's fairytale distinguishes itself from other light- colored Hollywood cartoons interwoven with motley kids-friendly visualizations and vapidly didactic tone. Since the opening scene, my expectation of being thrilled had been hovering high, and I baldly assert that its audience's threshold age could be much older, which should had been a deadly challenge for a mainstream animation, nevertheless the film conquered its demographic range and gained a sprightly success in the box office and a nomination of BEST ANIMATED FEATURE in Oscar 2010.Speaking of the film itself, the 2-D character-designing deserves some standing ovation, the wackiness resides seamlessly inside each of them. Meanwhile the narrative reflects a deep empathy upon everyone's own grown-up issues, such as there is no unearned harvest in the world, never believe something which is too good to be true.The voice cast is superb, I even could not recognize it's Dakota Fanning if I had overlooked the opening credits and Teri Hatcher carries a nuisance between her two opposite roles as real mother Vs. evil mother.One little complain here, I am still not able to figure out the whole cause and effects of the evil mother's ""button-eye"" plan, which lacks a plausible explanation for me to digest. Besides that, the film excels in every each way to be considered a successfully unorthodox innovator in its own category.P.S. The film reminds me of SPIRITED AWAY, another master piece from Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Different Kind of Rabbit Hole,"It was just yesterday when no one would've imagined an animation studio going toe-to-toe with the reigning heavyweight champion known as Pixar, but the creative minds at Laika studios have done just that. Coraline, which arrived on DVD and Blu-ray this past July, is a work of art from top to bottom. It's a real shame that it's taken me so long to sit down and review the film, but, at long last, I was able to devote an afternoon to taking in what can only be described as a truly exquisite feature.The story follows a young girl by the name of—you guessed it—Coraline. She's just moved from Michigan to Oregon, and isn't at all happy about having left her friends and the life she knew. This should sound instantly familiar to most moviegoers, as being displaced from a familiar locale is often used as a catalyst for unrest by many writers (it's the whole ""fish out of water"" mechanism). What's especially relevant about Coraline's situation, however, is that she comes from the Motor City; her family has been forced to move because of the economy, and that's something many people can relate to. Symbolism is pops up in more tangible forms too; namely in the form of Wybie Lovat (""Wybie"" is short for ""Whyborn,"" which aptly accentuates the disconnect Coraline feels from her parents, who are constantly working in an effort to pay the bills).What makes Coraline so effective, though, is its perception of a child's imagination. As Coraline explores her early 20th century apartment home, she takes pleasure in the rusty water heater, the leaky windows, and an inexplicably small door cut into the living room wall. Beyond this door is a world that caters to all of Coraline's desires, and she discovers this through a series of ""dreams."" In this ""bizarro world"" she encounters her ""other"" family, who have buttons for eyes and pay her all of the attention she could ever want. The design of this colorful playground is reminiscent of a Disney/Burton hybrid: it's at once startlingly beautiful, but warped (and borderline Gothic) in its undertones. As the illusion of the ""other"" world existing only as a dream is dissolved, Coraline quickly becomes immersed in a very dangerous situation. In fact, I could easily see this freaking out very young viewers. It's rated PG, but there are times when the creepiness abounds and the proceedings approach horror film territory.But let me return to the beauty of the animation. For the most part it's extremely fluid, and rarely does the realization that it's all stop-motion result in a distraction. One of the best ways to describe much of the art design is to imagine a Van Gogh painting (and, toward the film's conclusion, the echoes of The Starry Night are impossible to ignore). The smooth animation combined with the stark contrast between the gray ""real"" world and the colorful ""other"" world is mesmerizing, and I can't see a youngster—or an adult, for that matter—being able to look away. I watched it as a 2D Blu-ray, although it did give me the option for 3D. From one of the very beginning, in fact, it's clear that this was a movie made for 3D: a sewing needle remains motionless in front of the camera for a good 3-4 seconds, suggesting that an ""in-your-face"" effect was the intent. This, combined with a relatively tidy conclusion, dampens what would be an otherwise unforgettable film.Still, it's more than worth your time, especially if you have children. Sit back, relax, and marvel in the beauty of what director Henry Selick has created. Just don't be surprised if said child wants to sleep with the light on afterward (you know, just in case).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animation sensation,"Without doubt the most inventive animated feature of the year. Cinematically Gothic, yet deliciously cute, designed with unparalleled creativity by Henry Selick who brought us The Nightmare before Chrismas and Monkeybone. Coraline is ten times better than either of these, and offers something for everyone.Based on Neil Gaiman's novel, this is the story of young Coraline Jones. She and her parents move into a new flat complex in rural Oregon (actually it is a very old flat complex). Coraline is unhappy and bored with the place until one night she finds a door to a parallel world and the adventure of a lifetime.Henry Selick's vision is unique and original, yet it shows hints of possible influence from some of the great artistic visions of the 20th century. The world comes to life in a very Dr. Seuss, or Wizard of Oz kind of way, and with caricatures similar to those of famed children's illustrator Tomi Ungerer (Moonman, The Three Robbers) Of course it also bear great resemblance to his Gothic classic, The Nightmare Before Christmas.Coraline is a little too dark perhaps to be a good family feature, I certainly don't recommend it for little kids, but it is perfect for everyone else.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A huge bummer!,"I can't get over how bummed I was with this movie. The visuals - as most people suggest - are tremendous (and don't believe anyone who says that this was ""CGI"", or that it was bad. This is NOT a CGI movie! It's stop-motion animation, and it looks incredible.)But that said, the story is incredibly flat, lifeless, and boring. I was shocked that this was based on something Neil Gaiman wrote (though I've yet to read it, and have read reviews that suggest the original text was terrific by comparison). Even more of a disappointment from the (usually) great Henry Sellick.I also have no idea what anyone who compares this movie to WALL-E was talking about, unless they were tying to compare it equally. WALL-E was quite possibly Pixar's worst movie, starring a rip-off of Johnny 5 with preachy nonsense about Americans becoming fat.

3-D Magic Sparkles This Dark Animated Family Drama,"20 February 2009. It's hard to separate out the visceral magic of 3-D from the amazing experience of stop-action animation in ""Coraline."" How much of a hyperjump in ratings, 3-D goes in upping the razzle-dazzle factor is difficult to judge. ""Coraline"" is an intense, emotionally raw balancing mood piece that belies the happy-thriller-horror animated world that ""Coraline"" as a young girl gets to experience as well as the audience. The animation is superb and the script and scenes are well suited to the 3-D experience without having to exaggerate and distort the special effects. The special visual experience seem to exude and evolve naturally out of the movie's plot and structure itself. The characters are weird and strange but at the same time personal and oddly familiar. ""Coraline"" like ""Spirited Away"" (2001) brings the world of rich fantasy into the movie theater in a captivating and compelling way. Yet, when all the special ""Chicago"" Richard Gere razzle dazzle is torn away along with a wonderful musical score, what is left is a more basic, simple version of the ignored young girl who looks for her fantasy dream elsewhere and lurking underneath is a more mundane, almost plodding movie experience. It would have been interesting to see more of a conflicted ""other"" mother in the climatic scene to really provide an intense interactive, memorable scene as well as parents who seem a little more sympathetic and real to offer a bit of authenticity. It is only with the fusion of the 3-D and the natural fit that the story is brought into an amazing living experience that delights. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cor-a-line,"Following in the wake of Nightmare Before Christmas. Highlighting the admirable craftsmanship of Stop-motion animation. Coraline is held in high regard by many in terms of modern animation. Combining the charm of the Light-hearted adventure of a Child's imagination with mixes of Horror elements in the storytelling courtesy of Neil Gaiman. It's an eerie Childrens story brought to life. Still enjoyed years later by both kids and adults. Its characters are likable and memorable. Caroline herself Dakota Fanning gives such an amazing performance to this character. She captures an essence that in many ways everybody can relate to in a sense. She has a very bitter attitude at the start, but never does she come off entirely as a brat. How so many when they are young may have experience. To move away leave everything that they knew and loved behind from their friends and have to make a go somewhere else. Feeling bored and in some way alone. Topping that off with Caroline's parents who are by no means bad but are so focused and devoted to their work that it can feel like they don't give her the attention that she feels she gets. The movie does a great job of transitioning between the two worlds. To just how lively and fun the other world is the garden alone is one the best highlights of the movie in just the amount of work and detail put into this world. And when you cut back to the real world everything is just so muted and mundane in a way reflecting Corline mood.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Imaginative and Ambitious.,"I went into the film as an avid fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is of course also directed by Henry Selleck and not some guy called Tim Burton like every other person seems to think, including my film studies teacher.So I was hopeful and even a little expectant in what I wanted from the film. The trailers had hinted at an eerie sub-plot to the movie and this is carried out delightfully throughout the film. But sadly this main point of story is what detracted from the film, but only minimally. The opening of the film spends too much time lumbering over character and setting, showing the undoubtedly beautiful animation at its very best. But its pace was slow, and I felt that if a film at 100 minutes running time feels slow then there is a problem.Aside from this slight lack of cohesion the film was brilliant. It picked up pace furiously towards the climax, which is easily the best part of the film. Its characters were likable, there were a few funny moments, although no laugh at loud ones, and there was an enjoyable experience for all to have. Whether its for children being immersed into this gloomy environment or for adults marvelling at how beautifully and skillfully the film was made.I came into the movie desperately wanting to love it, but came out just admiring it wildly.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I think I've attempted to watch this movie at least 3-4 times by now but I never make it all the way through. I just kind of lose interest and walk away around the same time. I don't even really know what it is about that I don't like, it's hard to pinpoint. It just kind of falls flat for me. But everyone has different interests and tastes, so this is just my opinion. I know a lot of people who love the same kind of animated movies like I do and they didn't like it either, but I know others who love it a lot. I guess it just is one of those movies that speaks to certain people.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Spook Filled Extravaganza,"Coraline is a film that pushes the PG rating. Events in it could be dark and serious at times, especially when it comes to the other mother.

It doesn't have much in other areas but still.It does seem to have a similar art style to Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas. Both are stop motion and could be ruled under Halloween. Though obviously Coraline focuses more on human designs and Nightmare Before Christmas is more about the design of the beings associated with Halloween.I do find that it is a pretty unique film with how it intertwines two worlds that seem very similar yet very different.

Luckily, the horror elements never really distract from this central theme, but instead work as an elevator for the plot, making the central message all the more important.That's why in the end, I can wholeheartedly recommend 'Coraline' to both (older) children and parents, since it has a lot of relevancy to our everday social life.Listen to your children, listen to your parents, speak clearly and there you go, you won't be eaten by a truck-sized spider in a twisted parralel-universe!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Haunting, Thoughtful and Beautifully Crafted Masterpiece","'Coraline' is a haunting, engrossing and beautifully crafted stop motion animated dark fantasy horror flick directed and written for the screen by Henry Selick and based on the 2002 novella of the same name by Neil Gaiman. Creepy and surprisingly dark and macabre at times, this animated feature is considerably more intense than what its PG rating and kid friendly nature would have you believe and that's what makes it so compelling as it pulls you into a dark and twisted nightmarish fantasy world brimming with imagination and creativity. This stop motion animated feature is an astounding masterpiece from start to finish.The Plot = A young girl named Coraline (Dakota Fanning) moves into a Victorian mansion which has been converted into apartments along with her parents Mel (Teri Hatcher) and Charlie (John Hodgman). Coraline embarks on her own adventure as she discovers an idealized alternate universe behind a secret door in her new home, unaware that it contains something dark and sinister.While there's nothing here that kids shouldn't see, the movie does venture into some pretty dark and terrifying places especially as the narrative goes on where you find out what the true intentions of the other world are and that adds a rather disturbing element to the film. The storyline has a simple fairytale element to it and the themes of finding beauty and wonder in the smallest of things and by keeping it grounded adds universal relatable appeal to it and that's what it manages to resonate with you on an emotional level and makes it a rather thoughtful yet engaging story. The animation here is breathtakingly stunning with its muted colour palette of the real world contrasting beautifully with the vibrant colours of the alternate world. The character and set designs really set's the film apart from other animated features and is what makes it so special and unique. The direction by Henry Selick is top notch whose imagination and attention to detail makes this an overall enjoyable and heartfelt rollercoaster ride from start to finish.The voice work performed by the impressive cast list is fantastic with lively characters brought convincingly to life. Dakota Fanning gives a brilliant performance as the titular character Coraline. Keith David proves to be a firm standout as The Cat. Teri Hatcher's dual role of the different versions of the mother is incredible and stands head and shoulders above everyone else in the cast. The rest of the voice actors include excellent performances by John Hodgman, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Ian Mc Shane and Robert Bailey Jr.Overall 'Coraline' is a striking and incredible stop motion animated classic through and through.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lots of art.,"I watched this movie with my best friend and his girlfriend, who said I HAD to watch it.

It ended up being quite unsettling and creepy but as an adult who's into horror, I really appreciated that side of it. The antagonist toward the end especially comes off as very scary and threatening. While the story got side tracked a couple of times in the first and second act, that doesn't take away from how well-made the movie is. The voice actors did a good job as well!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Dark animation, with valuable lessons! It is excellent!","An animation in the ""horror"" genre would have to have a good balance between age groups, that said, the Stop Motion animation model was chosen, the one made with modeling clay made frame by frame, thus generating a strangeness and a immediate discomfort.The tone of the film also needed a balance, and for that, the fantasy aura was adopted. A much more macabre and weird fantasy than usual, by the way! Increasingly obscure designs and more mature themes are dealt with.As I said above, the film brings lessons, meanings and metaphors. Subjects such as the pursuit of the perfect life, metaphorically showing that perfection is not always a good thing, imperfection is part of life.An excellent film! It shows that the fact that it is an animation is not always that the theme will be childish, or that there will be no messages. The film covers all age groups, done just right: not too dark, so as not to leave children traumatized, and not too childish, so as not to leave adults enthused.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Coraline,"The best parts of the film for me was the horror, it got me more visually engaged and made me pay attention to more things, for example the things on the walls, the shelfs and how they animated those particular scenes. The music in all the horror scenes I found more engaging than the other scenes. I think my least favorite scenes were the starting scenes, not because it was bad but because it was less intriguing from all the scenes later down the line which already had everything else as its main backing point. I think how they actually made the film was very interesting and just the amount of time making all the small movements that they had to do. For example, with the faces, how they had to make the smallest changes so it looked more 'real'. I think what I learnt in a way was just on the whole film basis and how it was made. I really liked where they looked at how the faces were made I found that very interesting. I would definitely recommend this film to others, there's so many little hidden details, and the way the film looks. It just has a great plotline and is incredible to watch.Review by Bella HB (Age 13 yrs.)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Classic spin on ""Be careful what you wish for""","What self-respecting kid hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a different set of parents - you know the kind who wouldn't make you brush your teeth or eat your vegetables, and who would let you play in the mud and stay up late at night and have every single thing your greedy little heart could ask for? Well, Coraline finds just such an alternate universe lurking in the corner of the rundown Victorian home that she and her consistently busy and utterly self-absorbed parents have just moved into - a magical world hidden behind a secret locked door where mice dance, cats talk and duplicate parents cater to a beloved child's every whim and fancy. But as the old adage says, ""Be careful what you wish for"" - and soon Coraline is discovering, much to her dismay, that this ""perfect"" world and these ""perfect"" parents may not be quite so perfect after all.Based on the book by Neil Gaiman, ""Coraline"" is one of the most enchanting and visually arresting films to have come our way in quite some time. Prime credit for its success goes to writer/director/production designer Henry Selick and his team of 3-D/stop-motion animation wizards who have created a world that is rooted in both reality and fantasy at one and the same time. The triumph begins with the heroine herself, a feisty, naturally curious, no-nonsense kid whom any viewer, regardless of age, will be immediately drawn to. As voiced by Dakota Fanning, Coraline is skeptical without being cynical, and her yearning for a mother and father who might actually pay a little attention to her could not be more universal in its appeal. Like all good fantasies made for kids, ""Coraline"" finds its truths in its central character - in a lonely child who has been ripped away from her friends, and whose parents are so intensely focused on their own adult interests that they have no time to enter into the world of childish things that naturally concern her (people can't even get her name right, since just about everyone insists on addressing her as Caroline).But all is not sweetness-and-light even in the bright and colorful ""other"" world that Coraline visits - not by a long shot. For the movie taps into many of those primal fears - of abandonment, of being seduced by evil with promises of goodies - that loom large in many of our most cherished folk stories and fairy tales. Thus, since ""Coraline"" does venture into some pretty dark places, it might prove more than a little disturbing for very young audiences. Older kids, on the other hand, will likely enjoy the creepiness and will surely find themselves rooting on this imaginative and resourceful little girl as she uses her courage and intellect to outwit those who would cause her harm.The animation is first-rate on every level. The characters, with their sharp angles and spindly protuberances, look at times as if they'd just stepped out of a Tim Burton production - and the somber, nightmarish setting, with its dark skies and gnarly trees, conveys that impression as well (not really much of a surprise, actually, since Selick was the director of Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas""). Yet, ""Coraline"" never feels derivative of other movies; it is instead a wholly original and beautifully crafted work in its own right - and one you would be foolish and improvident in the extreme to miss out on.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overrated Boring Copycat,"Those are the 3 words that come to mind. Highly overrated. Apparently there's a large audience of gullible Tim Burton fans that will rate highly anything with Burton's style.I didn't read the book and this film certainly isn't didn't motivate me to read it. When it comes to film adaptations, 2 things will generally get me to read a book: a great story or an entertaining original film that seemed over manipulated. Neither apply to Coraline.This year, there are two cartoons worth watching: Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Up. In that order. As a bonus, both are spooky, as opposed to faux horror, in their own unique ways, so if you want a little horror mixed into your cartoon, they give you that too.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Other World,"I had an impression that an animated movie should --- show heartfelt emotions --- teach values like friendship, loyalty, family bonding etc. --- have villains who can be either destroyed or transformed in the end --- have many funny characters --- have lots of ROFL momentsWell Coraline stands negative in most of the counts. Instead of big a kiddish entertainment full of life, love and empathy, this off-beat animated movie is dark. And I am happy it is so.An author and his busy wife shifts to secluded old mansion with weird neighbourhood. Their daughter Coraline feels neglected and bored. While exploring their new old house, she finds a secret passage that leads her to a whole new world which is an exact replica of her own world, but with a nicer feel. But soon she discovers the sinister intent behind the nice camouflage. Now she needs courage and some divine intervention to escape from the other world to her new world.Animation fantasy finds a new light - Black.Kudos to the team - Henry Selick(would watch more from you, Sir), Dakota Fanning(I have a feeling she is going to make it big).(originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
So good but hard to explain why,"I really like this movie but idk it's hard to explain why I like it so much. There's def parts I can explain but idk at its core it's hard to elaborate but I will explain what I can. So the animation is really nice like stop motion is usually really freaky to me but I think most stop motions do that on purpose and I'm beginning to appreciate that more but something about coraline's is very lively? Like it's able to be bouncy and stiff at the same time it's really cool to watch. I also really like the music direction in this movie like typically unless it's a focal point music in a movie doesn't catch my attention but here it does and in a very good way idk why but I really enjoyed it. I also think the plot was good like tbh I forgot it was a kids movie most of the time. I think here or there it has its kids movie moments but they aren't over baringly so, so I think it does really well and definitely suggest that people give it a try if they haven't already!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The animated kids horror that unexpectedly shocks and terrifies,"First of all, this is a horror movie that does a brilliant job on developing the plot in an exciting way. It's really unique and unexpectedly scary. I'm a horror geek, and to me, this is a masterpiece. This story follows a child's perspective on making horrifying and baffling discoveries in her house.And just so you know, this isn't the average, cheesy haunted house movie.This is something else that's is soo dark.The story is genius, and unlike most thrillers, the whole movie is exciting and scary throughout. As the synopsis promises.Take the 2020 movie 'Possessor' as an example. Looking at the sypnosis. I was surprised and was eager to watch the movie. But the development of the movie 'Possessor', was disappointing and extremely boring. Coralline is the complete opposite. Probably one of my all time favourite thriller, horrors.You Must watch this movie, I highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Words cannot express my dissapointment... this motion picture is an atrocity...,"In a lot of the reviews of Coraline (book) they call it terrifying, I couldn't disagree more, the only thing it was to is terrifyingly good whereas the movie actually had me fearing for my sanity it was so despicably awful!, so I will hand it to the movie (if it can be called that) that it is a lot more terrifying than the book.
The other parents....
NONONONONONONONONO DON'T MAKE ME TALK ABOUT THE OTHER PARENTS!
The worst and most sickening mechanic in this film is how wonderful the other parents are!!!! They were supposed to be nice, very nice, but NORMAL PEOPLE, and the same goes for the meal and all the features of the other world were supposed to be great, maybe even magical, but they had strong sense of normality to it that really made it believable, and even to some people scary, something that I feel the film failed to pick up on.
Coraline is one of the brattiest and unlikeable characters I have ever seen. That's really all I have to say on that matter, why would some writer for whatever insane studio greenlit this abomination think that making Coraline the definition of spoilt would make people 'relate' to this 'character'. I would have considered the fact that Coralines an unlikeable character and I should deal with it and that this isn't the book if it made sense for her to act all bratty, but sadly it did not as her parents did anything but spoil her.
The dynamic between Miss Spink and Forcible was disappointing due to the failed potential as although the chemistry of the characters was great it was ruined by the bad writing, this for me made it one of my least favourite parts of this sea of filth.
On the subject of the writing the writing of this film, film, is that the right way to describe it? I found that if the writers read the skimmed over the book drunkenly and the next morning put in parts that they remembered from it every 20 minutes to remind you what film you're watching it would be a truer and more believable adaptation, in fact why don't they remake it using this method.
The movie is so dumbed down to pander to the growing audience of illiterate people that I would recommend it to a two year old that has very low standards! 0.0001/10",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everything About this Movie is Great,"Coraline follows a little girl who, after moving into a new house, realizes how boring her life is. She eventually discovers a secret door that leads her to an alternate dimension where everything is better, yet as she goes there more and more she begins to receive warnings against the place.This was one of those movies where I hit the thirty minute mark and had basically solidified a 10/10.To start the visuals are great. This is a clay-mation movie though, so it's kind of expected, but there were still loads of great big visual spectacles scattered throughout. Not only that, but every character design is great. From Coraline herself to Wybie to Beldam (especially Beldam), everyone looks fantastic.The plot is, while not horribly original, presented in the best way. It's complemented by interesting and fun characters who lead it along, one of whom is a little girl who is actually smarter than most of the grown women we see in other horror movies these days, yet she's not so smart that she's unrealistic.The movie actually isn't all that scary, but instead takes it's time in building up the characters and conflict until the climax where I felt more tension than I did fear. Sure, I figured I knew the ending considering it's supposed to be a kid's movie, but that didn't stop me from getting invested. It was scary more through subtlety and knowing things that maybe the characters didn't, or not knowing things that the characters also didn't. The main villain, however, was very intimidating and creepy especially towards the end. Surprisingly, the opening sequence also managed to be pretty unsettling.I was surprised to find that the soundtrack was actually really good. It fit the movie really well and I just liked how it sounded. I've listened to it outside of the movie and still really like it.Overall Coraline was fantastic. Everything about this movie is exceptional, so I really don't see any reason why I'd give it anything less than a 10/10. I can certainly see why someone wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did, but I don't really care. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Complete satisfaction can never exist in life.,"Great story and fantastic fantasy animation. That both children and adults can enjoy this movie proves its excellence. It gives a great message and suspension for children and artistic appreciation and nostalgia for adults.Characters in the movies were eccentric but lovable at the same time. Miriam and April duo, retired actresses who still manage and try to live gracefully and pretentiously, and Mr. B, a Russian ringmaster who has ambition of training jumping mice add so many colors to the movie, making it more fantastic and dream-like.Animation is super-quality. Laika's film is different from bright and real-life like Disney, but it has its own style, a little bit dark, mysterious and doll-like. This animation work makes this fantasy movie more fantasy-er.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
