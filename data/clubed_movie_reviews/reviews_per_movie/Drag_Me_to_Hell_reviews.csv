A stitch in time saves nine,"""Drag Me To Hell"" transports to you to the era of 1980's where blood, gore, chills and likes of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" / ""Evil Dead"" spawned in plenty. And yes, for a welcome change ""Drag Me To Hell"" steers clear from the Japanese horror genre and pans out to be a very much American product. Alison Lohman ""i can shriek"" delivers the right expressions warranted for a horror movie. Anything more would have been potential overdose. Justin Long ""Keanu Reeves impersonator"" is plastic expressions all the way. Reggie Lee ""corporate pacman"" does a good job of munching up everything that comes between him and the success ladder. David Paymer ""carrot dangler"" knows how to make the rabbits dance to his tunes. Lorna Raver ""the trigger of Lamia curse"" ensures to get etched in the memory and haunt you for a very long time. Dileep Rao ""amateur spiritualist"" was okay'ish. It appears his part got hijacked by his Guru. Flor de Maria Chahua ""avenger in waiting"" has a brief but effective role. And so was her assistant.All in all ""Drag Me To Hell"" is both tacky and cheesy, but that doesn't stop it from sending shivers down the spine. The screenplay is void of drag moments ensuring the audience get fright doses at regular intervals. Good utilisation of visual effects and the background score alleviate the visual experience. The potholes in writing could have been easily creased out. Not exactly horror-comedy like ""Shawn Of The Dead"" but it does have well-interlaced comical moments between the chills.Watchable fare... and yes a few days you potentially might abstain from using the staplers.",,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi goes back to the man he used to be.,"Sam Raimi hasn't made a bad movie yet, and while Drag Me To Hell has emerged as a case of you hate it or you love it (like Apocalypse Now, Forrest Gump, and Avatar). It turns out to be a fun ride.Christine Brown is a loan officer in L.A. and is trying to get the position of assistant manager. She decides that in order to impress her boss, she has to be tougher. So when an old gypsy woman comes and asks her for a third extension on mortgage payment, Christine denies her that. Feeling shamed, the old woman puts a curse on Christine, and sends a demon after her. Her life is suddenly in ruins, but with the help of a fortune teller, and his Latin American friends, Christine attempts to rid herself of the demon, before it takes her down to hell.the ending of the film is more than somewhat controversial, and in fact you could even spend the rest of the day going over it in your mind, trying to figure out what the Raimi bros were thinking. In fact considering what they choose, the entire story is kind of pointlessly staged, but at least it is fun. Raimi takes us on a crazy ride, we the viewers are treated to a handful of shocking and humorous moments, many of which directly resemble, the Evil Dead flicks. You can tell from this that after fifteen years, Raimi is still a master at horror. He has tackled every genre but it is clear now that he is most at home with this genre. I would not say it's lovable, but it doesn't disappoint either.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Sam Raimi,People who gave this a very low score don't get Sam Raimi. I found it entertaining and I enjoyed the humour. A homage to classic horror films with a mix of humour and old school special effects.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense and Funny - Classic Sam Raimi,"The early trailers for Drag Me to Hell dubbed it as (sic) ""the return to classic horror"", and for once at least, they are correct.Sam Raimi manages to incorporate genuine thrills and terror using the old-fashioned format of surprise, misdirection and suggestion. As a frequent viewer of horror films, little surprises me, but in this film I was caught off-guard several times while watching it.While the majority of the movie is kept on a serious and foreboding level, much like the original ""Evil Dead"", Raimi can't help but throw in elements of the absurd and slapstick during some of the more horrific scenes, thus reducing the tension and echoing the latter 2/3 of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy.WHile I have nothing against the modern trend of horror movies to provide shocks merely in the form of how much blood and gore they spill, this flick was wonderfully refreshing. It's a must-see, not just for Raimi fans, but for anyone who loves a good scary story and a great movie in general.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too predictable and far too loud,"A huge disappointment in my eyes, especially after the high praise it has received from critics. Sam Raimi attempts to return to his B movie roots. Like the Evil Dead movies, it's delightfully cheesy and relentless. Unfortunately, it's also very formulaic and, much of the time, downright obnoxious. This is one film I would almost implore people not to see in theaters. At least not ones that like to turn the volume up. This movie is LOUD. I saw Terminator Salvation at the same theater, and was not nearly as deafened as I was by Drag Me to Hell. The problem: horror stings on the soundtrack. CONSTANTLY. The formula of the film is this: quiet set-up followed by sharp screech and an even louder BOO! It's the same thing over and over. I was cowering, but only because I was afraid I might not be able to hear in the morning. The story isn't bad, but it's been done before. Alison Lohman (awful) plays a loan officer who gets cursed by a gypsy after she turns her down for a loan extension. A goat demon begins to attack Lohman and, well, the rest of its intentions are included in the title of the film. Though I generally didn't like it, it's far from a bad film. In fact, I think it might play better on television (it's definitely the kind of movie that I would have caught on late night TV as a kid and loved). The séance scene near the end of the film is mostly gold. The demon itself is scary as Hell, but Raimi's way of indicating it, with sharp screeches, is what ruined the movie for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun horror from Sam,  but perspective is still needed.","Waiting for another Sam Raimi horror film has been like hoping your numbers come up on the national lottery, long, arduous and ultimately unfruitful. So it be that when one finally comes around, there is a tendency to over praise, over hype, and even be blind to actually how worthy Drag Me To Hell is. Not only in the pantheon of the horror genre, but in the cannon of its supremely talented director.So it comes to pass that myself, a Raimi fan for sure, decided to let the hoo-hah die down before venturing in to Hell with Alison Lohman and her devilish nemesis. I note now at the current time of writing that the film is rated just over 7.5/10, that's just about right where it deserves to be. It's not new or remotely ingenious, and for sure it's actually finding Raimi on auto-pilot for himself and his fans. But hey! It's still far better than the ream of remakes and blood for bloods sake cash cows that insult the genre faithful on a monthly basis.Drag Me To Hell is a comedy horror, there's nothing really scary here, it's gross at times, almost disgustingly {delightfully} so, but Raimi is reliant on fun to go hand in hand with a creeper of a story instead of a conventional boo jump bonanza. And it works just fine. The story sees Alison Lohman's Christine Brown upset an old gypsy woman and gets a curse of demonic proportions laid onto her. This set up then lets Raimi pummel Lohman with a number of excellently scripted set pieces, whilst managing to keep a mystery element ticking throughout the story. Some problems do exist, tho, certainly enough to ensure this isn't the masterpiece the desperate for a Raimi horror hoards have labelled it.Lohman does real well in relation to duality of character, but both she and her on screen beau, Justin Long, just look too young for the roles they are playing, and yes, it's pretty distracting and an itch you can't scratch. The CGI is also duff and affecting the story, particularly during what should have been a ripper of an ending. And crucially there is a familiarity about the whole thing, a feeling that Raimi and his brother Ivan have just made a collage of genre staples.Still, Drag Me To Hell makes for a real entertaining night in by the fire. Enjoy a director making a film for himself as much as his fans, a sort of roots revisit if you like. But don't expect a genre defining, or genre boosting, picture, because you may be a tad disappointed with the return. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deliciously pulpy return to horror for Raimi,"""Drag Me to Hell"" might be the victim of unfair expectations, or just plain incorrect assumptions. This might partially be down to the advertising campaign, which could lead audiences to believing this is purely serious horror, when in fact it is pulp silliness in the vein of the old EC comics, and fully aware of it. Sam Raimi, for whom the childhood experience of reading those pulp tales served as an inspiration for his now-legendary ""Evil Dead"" movies, and hence gave him his career, has made his most fun and entertaining film since ""Army of Darkness"", and probably his best since then as well (although I do need to see ""A Simple Plan"" again) in ""Drag Me to Hell"", which feels like it could be an adaptation of one of those horror tales.Hopefully audiences will be expecting something along the lines of ""Evil Dead"" mixed with its sequels when they go in, or they could leave disappointed. Unless you're scared by old women and supernatural mumbo jumbo, unless you're a superstitious person, ""Drag Me to Hell"" probably won't be giving you any nightmares. Then again, I'm not scared by anything really. Still, one can't help but feel that this sort of thing (if done seriously) doesn't belong in today's age of rationality and would work only in the 50's, or maybe even then would be too late to really pack a punch.That's why this is, like the ""Evil Dead"" movies, a cartoon. It is one cartoony horror set-piece after the other, more often than not with an overt comedic edge, and always, always with its tongue firmly in cheek. The characters are well-realized enough for the movie to be endurable, and well-played too (Justin Long is perfect for the role regardless of how limited his range is and I can't imagine anyone but Lohman playing this particular role), but Raimi doesn't really care about them. He cares more about piling on the pulp gross-outs, resorting here to all sorts of unsavory things (including embalming fluid gushing out of a corpse into Lohman's mouth, one of a multitude of things Raimi takes pleasure in introducing to that particular orifice of Lohman's body), but not much blood at all. It isn't needed either, the PG-13 rating may sound like a limitation but it's hard to imagine this movie with much more gore, although there are a few things that happen off-screen that I would have LOVED to see on-screen, but that might be because I'm a horribly sick person.Utilizing an active, expressive camera akin to the sort of thing we saw in the ""Evil Dead"" movies, Raimi stages these ridiculous scenes with gusto and passion. This is not going to terrify many people, but it is absolutely terrific at being what it sets out to be- a live action EC comic. As long as you go in expecting that, you'll probably leave satisfied. I'd like to leave you with the wise words of AV Club critic Scott Tobias: ""He wants viewers to jump out of their chairs, to laugh and scream and cheer, and to nudge each other over the transcendent ridiculousness of what they're witnessing. This is junk film-making at its finest.""",,Anonymous,Horror
Horror story with supernatural  touches  of  black humor  by Sam Raimi,"Creepy terror caused by a curse against a young woman with a bright future that goes wrong . The bank employee named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) finds herself growing distresses after she assertively refuses to extend a loan to an old gypsy woman ( Raver ), then she places a hex on her . As when a button is removed during a scuffle , a curse is placed on her . It will result in her being taken to hell in a few days time and the things get worse . Now the girl must call upon his boyfriend named Clay Dalton (Justin Long) and a spiritual adviser (Rao) to help her persuade the gypsy to lift the curse. Time is running out for the desperate loan officer as he draws closer to his own death . At a mansion reunite various mediums who are determined to save her. The psychics attempt to rid her of the strange demon , a malevolent force she is up against , leading until an incredible ending .This exciting picture is a terror story full of supernatural elements with eerie moments here and there and brief touches of black humor . The makeup and special effects vary , but for the most part, they are quite good , they are realized by Robert Kurtzman and Howard Berger . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Peter Deming who captures perfectly the peculiar scenarios . The film displays adequate musical score fitting to terror and suspense by Christopher Young , an expert composer of dark atmospheres . The motion picture is professionally directed by Sam Raimi ( Crimewave, Evil dead I and II ) who directed ¨Army of darkness¨ another horror film with humor and tongue-in-cheek . This one isn't his worst movie , but definitely not the best either . The result is better than previous Stephen King adaptation called ¨Thinner¨, that bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Drag me to the hell¨. Rating : Acceptable and passable Horror-Comedy from Sam Raimi , well worth watching for Alison Lohman fans .",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining,"Drag Me to Hell gets off to a strong start, with a young woman's stress at home and work reasonably well developed before, well, all hell breaks loose, and an assortment of colored fluids are expelled from various orifices, often from one person to another. There are a lot of squirm-inducing moments but they are spaced out reasonably well, and this is a fun film.The young woman (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer at a bank who is vying with another to get promoted at work, but watching her hopes dim as he seems better at playing political games. She also has a boyfriend (Justin Long) whose wealthy parents believe she isn't good enough for. One day at work an elderly woman comes in asking for an extension on her loan payments so that she doesn't lose her house. Fearing that she needs to be perceived as tough enough to make hard decisions, she turns the woman down, leading to being cursed and soon haunted by an evil spirit called a lamia. She turns to a fortune teller for help, but naturally the solution is not as simple as sacrificing an animal.I liked how Sam Raimi the director moved the action along, skipping unnecessary dialogue and physical movement to get from one scene to another. I thought Sam Raimi the writer (and his brother Ivan) were a little less successful in the middle part of the film, where it stalled a bit. One of the obvious solutions to attempting to lift the curse (getting rid of an object) is oddly delayed. There were also moments where the dialogue was stilted. With that said, the film holds together well, and its big scenes all deliver. Strong ending too.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sam Raimi has made his 'Jaws'.,"Drag me to Hell is, really, a throwback in so many ways to the fun of The Evil Dead 2. The camera angles, the excellent score - it all recalls how Raimi played with us in his earlier trilogy. What has changed however, is the sense of pace. We know its coming and Raimi employs all his skills to draw out the tension. The thrills are all there in place, I jumped like there was an electric buzzer under my seat. Perhaps a little too much CGI is indulged in but its easy to forgive in a film as wicked and blackly comic as this. I genuinely found the film disturbing for a 15 as well, again I think this is a mark of tension that Raimi creates with the score and camera work throughout the film. So incredibly refreshing to see a horror film with out the hallmarks of the recent saw franchise. Special mention for the ending, which has conviction and guts and was the proverbial cherry on top of the cake. throughly entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Different from what you're used to,"This was a very fun, self aware, campy yet still creepy horror flick (not what I was expecting)I thought they did a really good job at easing the viewer into the camp/ ridiculousness gradually while still being upfront with the style of the movie from the beginning. I started off open minded and gradually was like mmm idk... and then ended up really liking it. You don't see too many movies in this particular genre done this way.The acting was hit or miss for me, but in this genre you can get away with a lot more so it didn't really effect it all that much. I will say I am not a fan of jump scares at all and this was just littered with cheap ass jump scares haha but it's to be expected.Over all I think this was quite successful for what it was and accomplished just that. Would recommend for sure, esp to someone who can appreciate a more ""light hearted"" horror lol.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sam Raimi's Return to ""True Horror"" is a Triumph","From the intense opening scene to the stellar and shocking finale, Sam Raimi has officially returned to the horror genre with vigor and spark in the year's best horror film so far. Starring Alison Lohman in the leading role (Ellen Page was originally cast as the lead but dropped out of the project early in production), Drag Me to Hell feels like much more than your average, predictable horror popcorn flick. It's filled with plenty of twists and turns and, like any good ride, a satisfying conclusion. And the PG-13 rating? Forget about it! You hardly notice that little factor because of how immersed you become in the story. Also starring are Justin Long, David Paymer, and Lorna Raver.Christine (Lohman), a loan officer at a bank with a lovely boyfriend (Long), is being considered for a promotion. Jumping at the opportunity, she comes across an old gypsy woman (Raver) who requests a third extension on her house. Her boss (Paymer) tells her it's a tough decision, and its her call, so she refuses the woman's payment. Absolutely infuriated, the woman stalks Christine after work and bestows her with a supernatural curse, one which she has only three days to overcome before the spirits drag her to hell.Lucky enough to have won tickets to a pre-screening of the film, I had heard nothing but great things about it. I was hoping for the best, but I wasn't sure how the comedy and horror would mix together. Much to my surprise, the horror and comedy in Drag Me to Hell are that rare perfect mix of perfection that one craves in horror movies. If too funny, they can go overboard, but not this one. In fact, I don't think I've seen quite a proper mixture since Raimi's own Evil Dead II.Perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie is how well it's made technically. It had all sorts of interesting shots and the real work of a master filmmaker. Having both written and directed the film, Sam Raimi more than proves his worth to the horror genre despite his long absence since Army of Darkness. In ways, this is also a sort of revival of what people with think of PG-13 horror movies. Drag Me to Hell is one of the most intense, scary horror films in quite some time, despite the PG-13 rating which many tag as already crap.Drag Me to Hell is full of its epic shocks, and the less you go in knowing about it the better. I could go on for hours about the movie and spoil everything there is to know, but that would truly ruin some of its appeal. Which is certainly not to say that it is lost after a first viewing, just that it's an experience unlike any other going into this movie watching virtually no clips and reading very little about it. It becomes a truly rewarding experience.Mrs. Ganush is one truly phenomenal villain that provides plenty of scares. Lorna Raver infuses the role with an enthusiasm - an terror - that is rarely seen in big-screen baddies. She has more personality than The Ring's Samara for sure. Clay's character provides a much-needed balance between the goofy and the horrific, and helps make the film's heroine, Christine, all the more believable. It was an interesting twist to see Justin Long in a horror film, despite the nature of his role. I believed his performance and the sincerity of his character. Lohman had a lot resting on her shoulders with this movie, and she totally pulled it off with flying colors. Nobody plays the terrified, but headstrong and determined female lead better than Lohman, and she proves her worth over and over again in this movie. She totally has a career ahead of her.Overall, Drag Me to Hell did more than just impress me nonstop. It was a masterpiece of a horror movie, with unrivaled intensity, scares, and one killer of an ending. More often now, horror directors/writers seem to have such a difficult time ending their movies properly. This one has an ending which snugly solidifies the movie as an early contender for best horror film of the year. Don't miss Drag Me to Hell... you will never look at handkerchiefs the same way!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dragged to Hell:  Another Experiment in Grueling Terror,"To properly (and fairly) access my experience with seeing ""Drag Me To Hell"" Sam Raimi's (The Gift, Spider Man) much anticipated and blogged about new opus, we must first take a little trip back in time to the year 1995. As a kid, I had always been intrigued by the horror genre, most of which likely spawned from my parent's extreme hatred towards it. While they perused the Comedy and Drama sections of our old video store (then stocked to the brim with VHS tapes, I might add) I found myself sneaking off to the far left corner among the gory, trashy, at often times downright pornographic cover art that adorned the paper sleeves for films such as ""Invasion of the Blood Farmers"" and ""Deadtime Stories"".Like a college freshman introduced to mass quantities of alcohol for the first time with no guidance in sight, I was on overload. What were they attempting to keep me from? If I slid this threw the door of my old Sony T-120, what exactly would I be getting myself into? One would like to think I found the answer that day instead of being forced to watch ""The Jerk"" for the ten thousandth time, but alas, my first experience with the ""terror"" genre began that same year, late at night, in the comforts of my own bed, with a remote control, a freshly fluffed pillow and the Sci-Fi Channel.The words flashed onto the screen, ""The Evil Dead"" in blood red, bold faced lettering. As I watch the plot unfold I found myself paralyzed by the images I was seeing. Humans being possessed by demons, dismembered by their own friends, maniacally laughing in a distorted, demented all together frightening way and above all jumping out at me when I least expected it. I was changed. My outlook on movies changed. My fear of the dark was created and that was WITH commercial breaks. Of course, I have only one man to thank for getting me hooked on the ""Terror"" genre and that is Sam Raimi.After almost twenty years (since ""Army of Darkness"" the final installment of the Evil Dead franchise) Mr. Raimi returns to his old stomping grounds with ""Drag Me to Hell"", the tale of Christine (Allison Lohman, Matchstick Men) a loan officer whom forces Mrs. Ganush, a sick, decrepit gypsy woman from her home by denying her an extension on an already delinquent bank loan. As fate would have it, after work in a desolate parking garage, Christine is attacked and the curse of the Lamia is placed onto her. In the days to follow she is brutally attacked by unseen entities, experiences visions of a deformed Mrs. Ganush and attempts to reverse the curse by contacting psychic mediums. Time is of the essence, but taking the curse off proves to be much more difficult than it was to put on as we witness Christine attempt to silence it before she is dragged to hell.Earlier on, I referred to my obsession with the ""Terror"" genre. Terror differs from Horror in that its goal is to completely terrify the audience as opposed to simply scaring them. ""Drag Me to Hell"" falls into one such category. From start to finish, you make the first plunge down the drop of a 100 minute roller coaster and in the end feel as if you've been tossed around and abused by a master manipulator, Raimi. It is evident, through the use and placement of scares, gore, mixture of comedy and horror as well as pacing of the plot that Raimi didn't have to do much dusting off to get back in the game. He clearly knows that, in this genre, simplicity is often times the best course of action. The storyline and its unraveling is basic, often times boarding on naivety, but the absolute madness that ensues within its walls is comparable to a warm piece of chocolate cake.Allison Lohman (who replaced Ellen Page in early stages of development) does a fine job of portraying Christine and the character arc that she goes through. Page would have brought a bit more grittiness to the role, but that's beside the point. Lohman is able to bring the charm and diversity to the part. Justin Long as Clay, Christines boyfriend, delivers as always and manages to keep it real in a role that could have very easily turned corny had it not been handled correctly. Supporting cast, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) and Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) the Medium are both convincing in their extremely demanding parts.What's so special about ""Drag Me to Hell"" is that it knows its roots. It takes us back to the days when it was a true ""experience"" to see a horror/terror movie. When you went into a movie theater and the audience jumped, yelled at the screen and quivered in shock and disgust. At the conclusion it brought them to their feet with a standing ovation and all along with the mindset of, ""Okay, we're all in this together, let's make it out in one piece."" ""Drag Me to Hell"" is what a good experience at the movies is all about. There will be those who hate it, loath it even, but for the handful of us that were transformed into obsessed fans of this niche market by a master director, it will validate our love for the genre and will forever stand as a true testament of the best it has to offer. As for myself, for a short moment in time I was a thirteen again, curled up under my covers, frozen with fear, and loving every single minute of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overhyped,This movie isn't bad but the ratings here are way too generous in my opinion. It's too silly to be a true horror film. If Justin Long is in it then chances are it is a comedy. Except Jeepers Creepers maybe. It's a cute film but not scary and the only creepy parts are mostly just gross put moments. Fine to watch if you are bored or its part of a Halloween binge-a-thon but I wouldn't seek it out exclusively or pay to rent it.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Horror, humour and hell in Raimi's devilish new movie","Sweep aside all those Japanese psychological horrors, the torture porn and the 3-D specialities, and lets get back to basics. Sam Raimi takes a side-step and has brought us this wonderful little flick.Our heroine Christine Brown is a loans manager cursed by an old gypsy lady she refused to extend a loan out to further. Cue devilish goings on as our lead lady tries to exorcise the curse to little avail.As a horror movie it will make you jump, but really it's a bit of gross out comedy as well (watch out for the fly sequence!). You will laugh and yelp in equal measure.Keeps you more than entertained for the duration, and at heart it's a nice old fashioned popcorn horror movie that has been forgotten about of late.

a masterpiece in horror,"For those of you old enough to recall watching ""The Evil dead"" when you were a cub, you might remember what a scary and traumatic experience that might have been. I could not sleep for days and when I did, I slept with the door open with a clear path into my parents room if something out of the normal approached. Drag me to hell, drags us all back to the good old days of horror where true impactful scares are made yet the film takes you on a roller coaster ride where you just don't know where or when it will end. With a flawless story and well crafted, sound design was outstanding and therefore helped deliver the chills, this film will feel like going to a very expensive restaurant and eating meal where you feel so satisfied, you bask in the experience. You will feel the same after seeing this movie. A definite triumphant return to cinema by Raimi to a well elaborate masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi's return to his Evil Dead roots,"DRAG ME TO HELL sees Sam Raimi attempting to update his EVIL DEAD formula to the modern era, reinventing it as a teen-friendly comic horror about an unsuspecting bank worker who becomes a victim of a witch's curse. It sounds entertaining, and you'd think it would be easy for a man who once made it his job to bring fresh, energetic horror to our cinema screens.Sadly, time has passed, and nowadays the formula seems a little stale. Raimi relies far too much on CGI in this movie, so that most of the (frequent) scare scenes are fake-looking and cartoonish; sometimes making this look like a Looney Tunes cartoon done via live action. I'd much have preferred practical effects, because then the film wouldn't have been so cheesy and laughable.The mood is all over the place, too. The witch's curse storyline has real potential to be interesting, but none of the scare scenes work, mainly because Raimi goes for the gross-out over the genuinely spooky. There's a kind of infantile relish in watching a toothless old crone slobbering over her victim that makes me wonder what exactly he was thinking of. Playing it straight would have worked far better, I think.The cast is nothing to write home about, with performances ranging from the pantomime (Dileep Rao) to the decent (David Paymer). As the heroine, Alison Lohman tries very hard to convince, although she does fail to elicit much sympathy. The pacing's good, though, and there are plenty of set-pieces and jump-in-your-seat moments, so undemanding horror fans might find themselves entertained regardless. Sometimes, though, Raimi goes too far; take the goat scene: just what on earth was he thinking?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag me to Hell Premiere,"Went to the world premiere of Drag me to Hell last night at the Chinese theater....and while I had seen quite a bit of the film with no sound I was still incredible surprised, and impressed! I have always been a big Sam Raimi fan....I watched Evil Dead 1&2 and Army of Darkness religiously in High School....so to be able to work on Raimi's return to horror was an honor and a pleasure. And this does not disappoint. It was exactly what I would have expected from a master of comedic horror that got to really cut his teeth on the mega budget Spiderman series. Extremely refined...but not a product. It doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood film....yet has the production values of one.I was extremely excited when I got my invitation to attend the premiere and I was not at all disappointed. The final film is both one of the creepiest and scariest film I've seen in a while, and yet in perfect Raimi brothers style....very funny (even at times most other film makers wouldn't have been able to make it funny).I'm not going to spoil anything, but for those of you that saw the PG-13 rating and groaned let me say....don't let it deter you. As with other great Raimi films the scare is in what is NOT seen....which is what makes it so damn scary! I wish more horror filmmakers would finally realize that. There are some extremely tense moments brought on by nothing but great camera work and awesome sound design.If you want a genuinely creepy movie....and a great laugh go check it out when it comes out. You will NOT be disappointed.Oh, and none of my shots were cut!!! Woohoo!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi's return to horror,"Sam Raimi is known as one of the best horror directors around in recent years: but he had left the genre to do some small projects like the Spider-man trilogy. He returns with a story idea that he wrote with his brother wrote 10 years before filming it. He also set out to get his production company Ghost House back on track after a very unsuccessful run.Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) was a young woman and loans officer at a local branch of a bank. She has a simple ambition to become the assistant manager but has to compete with the new employee Stu (Reggie Lee). She is a kind-hearted woman, in a long term relationship with Clay (Justin Long), a psychology lecturer at a local university. Christine is told to make some touch decisions if she wants to get the job. She refuses to give an old woman, Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) an extension on her loan: a decision she regards because Ganush places a curse on the young woman. Christine ends up being haunted by a demon and she has only three days to save her soul from being taken to hell for all eternity. With the help of Clay and an Indian psychic, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) Christine does everything she can to break the curse.With the horror genre you get a number of different types: serious like Let the Right One In, 28 Days Later, the Exorcist; slashers, e.g. Halloween, Friday the 13th; gorno like Hostel, Saw; comedy, e.g. Shaun of the Dead. And of course you can also sub-divide into types like Supernatural, monster-based, psychological, realistic, etc With the best horror films there is often deeper message behind the story and often focuses on great characters. Raimi obviously knows about putting a compelling protagonist in his film and the audience will care about Christine, a decent person who ends up having to explore her dark side so that she can save her soul. Christine extremely well played by Lohman who shows she is a competent actress, playing the lost young woman who has to toughen up quickly. She is joined by a decent cast, Rao and Raver were of particular note. Raimi did not set out to make the film too serious. There is not much of message except showing someone's dark survival instincts, but trying to retains some good and don't upset gypsies. Does not treat the film too seriously with violence moments of slapstick, like Christine using a stapler as a weapon and dropping a anvil on top of Ganush with the eyes popping out like in a cartoon. Raimi deliberately makes Ganush an over the top stereotype and very entertaining, you would have to be of a very sensitive disposition to be offended. Also, there is nothing funny and more surreal then a talking goat.Raimi also knows how to create an effective creepy atmosphere, using shadows to show demon was very well done. With his experience with Spider-man Raimi uses a lot of CGI in the film. Admittedly I am a traditionalist, CGI should only be used when there is no other alternative: but Raimi is skilled to make keep the film engaging and it allows him to use to do some extraordinary things. Raimi also mixed slapstick level violence and some gross out with more realistic style which at times effective, other times, not so fitting. Raimi was even able to fit in a few one liners, particularly with Christine nearing the end of the film. Raimi also shows his skill with a few clever camera and editing tricks, like when Christine was in a rainstorm and it turns into her being in the shower, which were nice touches.Plot wises the film was a little like Paranormal Activity: but it was a lot better then that poor excuse for a film. The main reason being that there was a real threat to the main character of the film to make you actually care about her and the events of the film. The demon was actually a creepy being, not a minor nuisance.Raimi shows that a horror film can be violence but does not have to be meaningless or violent just for the sake of it. Raimi gets the balance just right and the body court is surprising low in this film.But whilst Drag Me to Hell is a good film this is really a film for fans of the horror genre. Outsiders properly won't be won over.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You'll laugh and squirm in equal measure,"This is not one of the best horror films of the '00s, as it was boasted for in some quarters, and which is probably why the film caused much division upon it's release in 2009. It was Sam Raimi's return to the horror genre after so many years, so naturally many people got very enthusiastic and probably praised the film for more than it's true sum. All that aside, and I did watch this film back in 2009 - I remember not being impressed - I think it is important to watch it now with a more neutral perspective, as is often the case. I definitely found it to be a lot more enjoyable this time around because in '09 I had viewed it surrounded by the hype that proclaimed it to be the scariest film in years. While there is jump-scare aplenty, Raimi succeeds mostly in his trademark gore-effects and dark humour.Excellent lead performance from Alison Lohman. It's unfortunate that she is now retired. She balances the 'scream queen' and dark humour perfectly. Much of the gore scenes hark back to the slapstick and mood of the 1980s, evoking Raimi's classic ""The Evil Dead"" as well as other staples like Dan O'Bannon's ""The Return of the Living Dead"". The old gypsy lady is disgusting to look at and Raimi taps in to this horror by emphasising her filth by focusing on her dentures and long, thick yellow finger-nails, as well many a scene where her mouth comes in to contact with Lohman's face. Again, this hardly triggered a scare on the scale for me, but what I did find was that the scare scenes more so had me laughing out loud, which I well suspect was Raimi's intention. There's never a dull moment in the film, so although it is far from one of the best horrors of the decade, it is one hell of a trip.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't waste your time on this,"I'm still trying to find out why everyone thinks this film is wonderful.First off, we have no storyline. We don't know if this film is funny or scary, the acting is at best 10th grade (and I'm a huge fan of Alison Lohman) I think everyone is forgetting about the fact that there needs to be a strong storyline (it doesn't have this. It has an idea, a concept, but never is fully developed, unless you think the old fashion, standard cop-outs work), good acting and most importantly, characters that you care about.The characters make no sense. The girl can kill her cat, but not give away the object to foist this horrible thing onto? Where's the logic in this? If she is so focused on herself to kill her cat, when she's stating she's a humanitarian, then she should have no trouble passing along the button to some miserable slime. So, when did she develop morals? Secondly, plot??? Story?? Hello??? Evil Dead had a strong storyline. This does not. In fact, this movie seems to have had an idea, and was made off an idea, and did a typical, Hollywood cop-out ending instead of thinking of a valid way to make this film wrap up in an intelligent way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me To Horror Movie Heaven!,"Hi! Years and years ago.....A guy called Sam Raimi made a couple of films called Evil Dead. Scary scary movies ahead of their time. But over time Sam moved away from the horror genre and directed films like Darkman and the Spider-Man trilogy. If he wasn't doing that he pasted his name on and produced really really bad horror movies like The Boogeyman. So imagine my surprise when i heard that he was actually directing a horror movie again! After seeing it last night here is my review. I do enjoy horror films......but i don't like them. That doesn't make sense but what i mean is i LOVE horror movies but all horror movies today are utter crap. The only scary movies made today are all Korean. Then America, with their complete lack of originality and money grabbing ways, make a remake with low standards. The last horror movie i went to see was The Unborn and that is THE WORST MOVIE i have seen in a long time and the worst horror movie as well. Drag Me To Hell is a breath of fresh air for the horror genre. In the films opening sequence the plot device is introduced in a chilling manner. It opens the film perfectly and the goosebumps go all the way through the opening credits. Christine has a fairly nice life until she denies an elderly woman an extension on her mortgage. Then the main part of the plot is opened in a sequence that is tongue in cheek funny and scary (classic raimi). From here on out it's scares piled upon scares. Sam Raimi doesn't follow the usual horror movie cliché of.........long......drawn-out......silences.....THEN LOUD NOISE TO MAKE YOU JUMP! He actually builds suspense with a neat little musical score. High pitched violins carry your nerves then throw them in the air! That's another thing. The film doesn't have a great focus on visual effects but the sound effects are fantastic. Tension building and atomospheric sounds and music are put to amazing use. The story is a good set up. It is an original film with an original story. It isn't plagerised or a cheap money making remake from Korea. Although the story is limited and the film run time is of average length. The film is classic Raimi and there are lots of references to other films by him. It's good to know that super massive Hollywood blockbusters haven't diluted his great direction and how he used to make films all those years ago. He keeps a good balance of humour and serious scenes by using humour when necessary and never ruining the atmosphere. Throw all this in with a disturbing shock ending you have the best horror film i've seen at the cinema in a long time! I'm sure you'll agree. Enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun old fashion horror,"Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loans officer in a fight for the assistant manager job. She is afraid that she's too nice. Her boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long)'s mother doesn't think much of her either. Then an old woman Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes in for a loan extension and her boss Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) leaves it up to her. She refuses the extension despite the old woman begging. She feels shamed and places a curse on her with her button. It's a curse that will send her to hell. She goes to see a store front psychic Rham Jas.This is a great old fashion horror from Sam Raimi. The old lady is both gruesome and hilarious. Alison Lohman is the cute perfect victim and she screams well. The story isn't anything original but it's lots of fun. There is some CGI but I really love the real effects. It's a simple thing to fire junk at a girl's face. It goes up a notch when she's screaming with her mouth wide open. That's this movie. Raimi is using every trick in his book. The only scene I have a problem with is the old lady in the tool shed. It's a bit cartoonish for an anvil to be hanging from the ceiling. Dropping it on her head looked more like a Road Runner cartoon and using CGI really limits the horror fun. Otherwise, the movie is done with a nice sense of humor. It's the blend of horror and comedy that makes this such a great ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dare I say it?,"I think I'll throw the cat amongst the pigeons by saying that I thought this movie was as good as, and possibly surpassed Evil Dead 2.I was immediately taken by the classic - and somewhat clichéd - horror title sequences and music. The films pacing was excellent and well acted. The gorgeous Alison Lohman does an excellent job as lead role, and although her character is not as hilarious as Bruce Campbell's Ash, her charisma shines through.Raimi isn't re-inventing the proverbial horror wheel, in many ways Drag me to hell is a homage to earlier horror films and their style. What sets it apart is that it takes tried and tested horror conventions and simply does them better than we are used to seeing. The formulaic drawn-out-periods-of-quiet-followed-by-a-loud-shocking-noise is used more than once and to great effect, without feeling too cheesy. There are also sequences when Raimi really amps up the creep factor i.e Christine alone in the underground car park.Having said this, the film also has a comic touch and tongue in cheek manner. Raimi understands that its futile to try and sustain complete terror throughout a feature length film (alien is perhaps the only film I've seen that manages to accomplish this)as the audience will eventually just switch off. He laces the film with humour and some of the most terrifying scenes become laugh out loud funny and vice versa.Also I think after working on three block buster films Raimi relished the opportunity for stylisation. Although there are no 360 degree camera pans and less fast zooms than in the evil dead films Raimi does indulge in some camera acrobatics, and tongue in cheek shots. i.e where a fly lands on the camera lens and leaves a dirty smear.I think most people would enjoy this film, its scary enough for the horror aficionados but has enough humour to appeal to a wide audience. I loved it.Also, I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I can say I left the cinema with my jaw hanging open.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Drag Us Home, Raimi","This much insanity shouldn't be legal...and so much fun. Thankfully, no one told Sam Raimi, who shakes off Hollywood expectation and demographic-appeal concerns with ""Drag Me to Hell,"" a back-to-basics horror flick that's one of the strongest original works of genre storytelling so far this year. To those who would bemoan or dismiss the vitality of this frequently reviled class of film...this one's for you.Confession Time: I have never been a big fan of Raimi's work; his well-regarded ""Evil Dead"" trilogy never consumed me with the same sense of ballistic fanaticism it inspires in most. I could appreciate his distinctive way of mixing the extremities of the genre (demons, decapitation, dismemberment) with gleefully broad (and outright ludicrous) physical humor, but something always kept me from fully embracing this auteur's style. A theatrical screening of ""Army of Darkness"" last year had me thinking I might have been a bit harsh in my assessment of Raimi's work. After all, even his more streamlined, serious mainstream works (the masterful ""A Simple Plan,"" for instance) contain undeniable stylistic echoes of his macabre roots.As with other horror directors whose humble beginnings have spun off into commercially and critically successful careers (David Cronenberg and Peter Jackson immediately come to mind), part of the thrill of ""Drag Me to Hell"" is to see the accumulated experience of a now-seasoned filmmaker played out in the genre he helped define. The result is classical in style while distinctly contemporary; silly and funny while genuinely jolting and unnerving; polished and slick while grungy and crude. These contradictory traits are a clear invitation for the already-initiated, and newcomers will have the pleasure of experiencing Raimi's now-highly refined joybuzzer shocks without the safety net of familiarity.The premise is deliciously simple, creating a uniquely internal logic that gives Raimi free reign to pull out all the stops: Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a promotion-seeking loan officer who, in a split-second of avarice, denies Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), an old gypsy woman, an extension on her mortgage payment; as a result, she visits a three-day curse on Christine that, if not stopped, will literally send her to hell. Supported by faithful boyfriend Clay (Justin Long, balancing the dramatic and comedic quite well) and the assistance of ""seer"" Rham Jas (Dileep Reo), Christine is driven to extreme measures in the battle to save her soul, leading to sequences that will leave even the most jaded horror hound uncertain of the outcome. In addition to the macabre elements and the suitably outlandish special effects, Raimi builds adequate suspense and even integrates some genre-crossing sidesteps (a great sequence where Christine meets Clay's parents is played liked a romantic comedy that segues into horror before once again returning to comedy) that deliver a one-two punch of terror, humor, and character development. Its initial scenes even invoke ""The Twilight Zone"" in the sense of bland domestic drama giving way to powers beyond man's ability to control.True to its title, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a film without barriers or limits; nothing is definite in Raimi's world, and in the best horror tradition, the guarantee of a Happy Ending is punctuated with a solid question mark. All the more impressive given the film's PG-13 rating; in an era where horror films are stigmatized for whatever commercially-viable moniker the MPAA attaches to them, it speaks volumes for Raimi's tact and skill the wildly creative grotesqueries that fit within the seeming ""confines"" of this rating. With a generation of filmmakers that miss the point of ""horror"" and go straight for gore, it's downright refreshing to see a veteran (who made his name in gore) embrace straight-laced fear...and succeed wildly.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Was Actually Dragged to Hell,"I saw this movie when it was first released, but after reading the poor reviews, I decided to write one of my own. Drag Me to Hell is not only the best horror movie but also one of the best and most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. This was a pleasant surprise to horror fans like me who are sick of excessive darkness and gore. Actually, I find most such movies to be disturbing rather than scary. What's so enjoyable about seeing someone's guts hang from their stomach?Drag Me to Hell manages to scare you without using gore or dark scenes. It is the nice mixture of elements than makes it scary. The story line is smooth,there are no plot holes, the heroine is absolutely likable and innocent-looking, you are engaged with the movie and feel her torment, the background music is very creepy, there are plenty of sudden jumps and scares, there is very good use of common items and elements that makes them look terrifying, there are a few ironic moments in the film to give you a break, and the ending is totally unpredictable and leaves you in a state of shock, fear and despair. All in all, it was full of jumps and thrills throughout.What more could I possibly expect from a horror movie? It was just perfect.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Unique Blend Of Startling Horror & Ludicrous Comedy That Actually Works.,"After freeing himself from the exhausting production schedule of big-budget blockbusters while he was working on those Spider-Man movies for nearly a decade, director Sam Raimi returns to a less hectic, low-budget & much simpler project and carves a thrilling mix of horror & comedy that's as jumpy as it is ludicrous.Drag Me to Hell tells the story of a bank loan officer who, in order to convince her boss that she is perfectly capable of making the tough decisions, refuses to grant loan extension to an old woman who, in retaliation, places a deadly curse on her. As the supernatural forces begin to torment her, she turns to a seer for help.Co-written & directed by Sam Raimi, the film delivers the shocks & laughs in equal doses and while the scares are spine-tingling, their impact is instantly doused by the absurdity of what follows next. Raimi clearly had a lot of fun while crafting this feature and the campy tone is evident in every frame. And if that wasn't enough, there are enough moments to simply gross its viewers out.I mean, every now n then, stuff keeps going in or coming out of people's mouth from start to finish. Characters aren't that well-defined but they are still serviceable. Technical aspects work in tandem to encapsulate the whole picture with a tense & unnerving atmosphere. Jump scares are effective, laughs are plentiful, and the slightly exaggerated performances from its cast only contributes to its wicked tone.On an overall scale, Drag Me to Hell is one of those rare entities that scores high in both horror & comedy aspects, finds its filmmaker in a much-relaxed yet creatively active mode, and is almost as frightening as it is funny. Its climax takes things a tad too far and pretty much kills all the suspense but it still manages to end on a satisfying note. In short, this unique hybrid of frights & laughter is a hellacious ride that actually works. Delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me to Hell,"I watched it alone , and i liked it. It was hilarious and scary, the movie added some cheesy effects which i thought was really stupid so it was stupid movie too. But some scenes did good job , i did excepted it but it still scared me. I hated cheesy movies such as like zombies movies or something like that, they are lame but this is one of cheesy movie and it still scared me.Now that is what it was like in way back 80's. I've watched some movies which was made back in 80's. I thought they sucked and liked new effects in movies that was made now. Now i realize , they used a mixed-up of the effects from 80's and now. It was really good, it scared me and made me laugh too. Also , i think the girl was bad-ass but her acting was not good so i give 2 out of 10 for acting. I think old lady was really creepy, so i give 4 out of 10 for her. Also the storyline was kinda stupid but good too so i give 1 out of 10 for the movie.MY friend think this movie was really dumb , i do too but it was good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Trashy fun horror/comedy,"Directed and co-written by Sam Raimi, Drag Me To Hell is a comedy/horror film from 2009 about a loan officer who makes a very powerful enemy when she denies an elderly woman a loan and the latter rewards her with a terrible curse.Raimi's return to the horror genre after completing his Spider-Man trilogy, Drag Me To Hell is every bit as violent and wacky as you'd expect from the man who brought us The Evil Dead and its madcap sequels. If anything, this is far more a comedy than it is a horror film. There are gross-out ""scares"" but those are more hilariously odd and disgusting than they are actually frightening. Take the multiple scenes in which the poor cursed heroine Christine (Alison Lohman) gets thrown up on or when she's the one throwing up various fluids, for example.Most of the scares in this movie are so cartoonish that it's just impossible not to laugh at them. Christine battles the old lady in a car at one point using office equipment and it's, for lack of a better word, mad. Although the plot itself doesn't really make any sense, it's merely a template for Raimi to then splatter with blood like a cinematic Pollock painting. This anarchy is both the film's biggest strength but also its biggest shortcoming.There's a refreshing abandon to the over-the-top sequences in this movie that's reminiscent of Evil Dead 2's freedom to just go all-out, without much concern for telling some kind of story. This makes the relatively normal setting and side characters like Christine's boyfriend, played by Justin Long, seem quite absurd as if the very idea of Drag Me To Hell trying to be sensible for a second is, in itself, weird. The film's main problem, which is linked to its disregard for plot and logic, is it throws everything at the wall and hopes that some of it will stick, and a lot of it admittedly does, but this means that some of the ingenious madness involved here can get repetitive.The sequences attempting to build some kind of a spooky atmosphere don't really work as, by that point, so much silly stuff has happened that you just can't take any of the film seriously. One wishes that a little more attention had been given to the plot and the overall mood but, thankfully, the goofy stuff here is genuinely very funny.While it may be shallow, inconsistent and dumb, Drag Me To Hell makes all that work thanks to a proudly tongue-in-cheek approach spoofing horror clichés and bringing countless laugh-out-loud moments to the table.Hugely entertaining nonsense.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Way More than Expected!,"At first let me clarify, I've watched it in 2023. So according to the time of 2009 it's damn brilliant.

"Heads off to a strong start, ending almost laughably bad","The premise was interesting and cast selection was decent. The beginning of the movie has that eerie unsettling atmosphere and some jumpscares were good. But when the exposition begins, it becomes predictable and towards end leaves you exhausted. The exorcism scene which the director intended to create tension for the characters serves as a unintended comedic scene. The climatic twist is so bad that you can see it coming half way through the movie. The gross factor though initially unsettling, it was overused to the point which made it look like a parody attempt. The CGI and VFX looks straight from a fifty thousand dollars movie, makes you wondering where the 30 million dollars were spent. The cast members Alison Lohman and Lorna raver must be credited for carrying this movie and making it watchable. Overall, an average movie that can be seen in leisure times in these corona pandemic times.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Paths, Ink","When I watch these things, I am particularly aware of what is considered scary: slimy, maggoty dead things, particularly if they are in your face; surprises from out of the blue; supernatural forces, always presumed to be evil....But most of all we fear inevitability. It is the most cinematic of horror, because the filmmaker is in control of everything that happens next. We are completely at his mercy. There is — for those of us that are serious — no escape. All he has to do is add an on-screen setup that puts the fate in the story, and a desperate, failing attempt to escape. There can be no escape.This is what film has over books. Books can explore the hidden, the thoughts, the unseen. But film can grind inevitably at a pace that cannot be altered.There is nothing else remarkable here, save the excellent use of a specific effect that always gets me: the inkflow.Yes, I know it is used all over, but we see it here in three different modes, enough to know that the director understood the effect. We even have the handkerchief (the first time) following the same motion path as the main trunk of an earlier flow.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than most PG-13 horror films...but that's faint praise,"Bank loan office Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is forced to evict old Mrs. Ganuch (Lorna Raver) from her house. Mrs. Ganuch places a curse on her and Christine's life becomes a living hell.This has been overpraised by some critics. Yes--it's well-directed. Yes--I jumped a few times (but that was from the loud noises on the soundtrack). Yes--it WAS funny. But was it scary? No. Did it make much sense? No. Director and co-writer Sam Raimi made ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2"". They were VERY gory (and both unrated) and full of pitch black humor and were genuinely scary. Unfortunately Raimi here seems to be held back by that all-important PG-13 rating. The scenes are somewhat gross and funny--but never scary. I kept getting the feeling that Raimi was forced to pull back because of the rating. The minimal gore should have been more extreme and the humor darker--but it never was. The only sequence which went full out was a truly funny and somewhat scary exorcism at the end. THAT one sequence managed to be more chilling than anything else in the movie. This isn't terrible by any means but I couldn't stop thinking of how much better it might have been if Raimi had been given complete creative control.Acting isn't really important in this but Justin Long (as Christine's boyfriend) and Raver were pretty good. Lohman is just OK but she deserves credit for taking on which must have been a VERY exhausting role. I can honestly only give this a 6--and most of that is for the direction and special effects (wait till you see the goat at the exorcism!).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi goes back to basics,"Drag Me To Hell is a welcome return to the inventive horror movie for director Sam Raimi. Even though quite a bit of his trademark style can be seen in the Spider-Man franchise, those films are so big and effects-driven that his voice is diluted. The lower-budget Drag Me To Hell is a much more personal movie. And as such contains a lot more of the things that made Raimi the tour-de-force, quirky and energetic director of the Evil Dead series.The story is basically about a bank worker who is cursed by an old gypsy woman for not extending her loan. Enter all manner of scary occult events.The story-line is pretty forgettable but it serves as a good framework for Raimi to bombard us with inventive scare scenes. As is typical, he mixes the horror with knockabout humour, and proves once again that he is one of the very few directors who is adept at mixing comedy with genuine scares. It's not an easy thing to pull off. If the balance isn't just right the horror will be diluted or the comedy will be out-of-place. Raimi though is a master at this and time and again mixes these two contrasting film genres extremely well. Happily, when the film focuses on the horror, it really is scary; the scene in the underground car-park being a standout scene. Mrs Ganush makes for a terrifying villain and her attack on the heroine in the confines of her car is a pure horror moment. When Mrs Ganush's false teeth fall out and she resorts to sucking her victim's face, we are in pure Sam Raimi territory; simultaneously terrifying but laced with a demented humour. This really sums up the film in general.Acting performances are all good and the script is solid. There were a couple of references to Raimi's past work on Evil Dead – the idea that the hero and heroine were planning to go on a break to a cabin in the woods and the recurring appearance of the battered Oldsmobile. Sam Raimi is clearly having fun on this movie – I'm not sure that the same thing could be said in the case of Spider-Man 3 – and when he's having fun, the audience is in for a good ride. This may not be Raimi's best film but it certainly is his most satisfying in a while.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"You don't like horror, if you don't like this movie","It's come to a point where I had forgotten that Sam Raimi was once an important figure to the horror genre. Sure, the ""Spider-Man"" movies were all nice and entertaining, but what really had made the man a legend was the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. When Raimi produced all these awful little horror movies (""Boogeyman"" anyone?) I was about to think we had imagined all this time that he ever had any taste. Along comes ""Drag Me To Hell"", the most entertaining horror movie in a LONG time, to prove me wrong.Let me just make a list of things that I love the most about this movie:1) The script is original, i.e. the story is not about a ghostly girl, zombies, vampires, a slasher or a torture chamber in Eastern Europe. No. This is fresh. For once a movie involving curses, séances and demons is GOOD. When has that ever happened before? The pacing is just right, the characters are fleshed out and believable. In a word: perfect.2) The cast is great. Alison Lohman is adorable as the warm-hearted main character who has so many bad things happening to her. Justin Long does a good job at portraying her loyal boyfriend. Lorna Raver is just creepy. THIS is how icons are being born. You don't just put a killer with a gimmicky mask into a below average horror movie. You need a great story and someone like Raver to create a cult.3) Raimi's direction is masterful with just the right balance between some signature tricks and very original angles and camera movements. The score is great, too. You don't think too much about it, it just works.4) Most of all: ""Drag Me To Hell"" is so much fun without ever being funny. It's almost more like an adventure movie in the vein of ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"". Sure there are jumps, sure it's disgusting at times - but ""Drag Me To Hell"" is really about the adventure, and it never makes any excuses for it. That's just adorable, and few screenwriters/directors can pull something like this off. The ending may be predictable, but it's still a pleasure to watch, especially since you're rooting so much for the heroine.Now, if there is one thing to complain about it's the CGI. Raimi makes too much use of it and it never looks completely convincing. In fact a lot of the shock sequences look rather silly. If only they could redo these scenes in question and maybe tone down the gross-factor on a few sound effects. At times less would have been more.Still, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is everything a horror movie should be, except for maybe scary. That may sound like I'm kidding, but I'm not. The cheap thrills, the good time - it's all here. Please, Mr. Raimi, PLEASE: Keep making movies like this one. In these awfully uncreative, narrow-minded times horror needs you back on board.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
fantastic and awful oral projectiles,"This film is so good in many ways that it seems churlish to be critical but I feel I have to mention a slight problem I have. This is so fast and furious that there is little time for us to become involved with Alison Lohman's character. There is all the annoying stuff at the Bank but somehow this doesn't make us particularly sympathetic. Then all mayhem breaks loose and incredibly jumpy and violent it is but for me, when there comes a pause and I'm catching my own breath, I'm not thinking of how she might escape. So then all the seeming silly fortune telling and séance stuff have no resonance for me. Mind you even if you are a little on the outside, this will still make you jump and even turn aside at some of the fantastic and awful oral projectiles. Very gooey, violent and relentless with some nice touches and a considerable nod to the much earlier b/w classic, Night of the Demon. If you enjoy violent thrashing horror you will love this, I just think it could have been even better. I've just realised that there is no sex in this movie, which I guess is a bit unusual. Possibly in the absence of character involvement, interrupted sex scenes might have done the job, not very original, I guess.

Really good camp horror,"Drag Me to Hell is a really twisted horror film that proves Sam Raimi hasn't lost most of his sensibilities from Evil Dead as he brings all the hilariously over the top and cartoonish set pieces you expect. In terms of delivering genuine scares, it's not as strong but there's a few clever jump scares.Alison Lohman gives a great lead performance, once cursed she doesn't get a break and her eventual urgency as she takes matters into her own hands is a lot of fun. Justin Long gets to take a break from being terrorised and gets a nice and simple supporting role.Sam Raimi's direction is on point, there's more than enough canted angles, whenever gore is present it's suitably over the top and it maintains a brisk pace. The music by Christopher Young is good, nothing memorable but it's atmospheric stuff in the moment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A throw-back to the 80's horror flicks,"""Drag me to Hell"" is director Sam Raimis' latest offering to the horror genre. Having already had hits with such films as the ""Evil Dead Trilogy"", ""The Grudge"" and ""30 days of night"" – it didn't take a brain surgeon to realise the kind of movie I was about to view . The story centres around Christine Brown played by Alison Lohman – Working as a loan officer in the local bank, Brown has the unenviable task of dealing with a rather dirty, disgusting gypsy woman who has failed to keep up her mortgage repayments.Torn between doing the right thing for the woman and demonstrating to her boss that she has management material, Brown decides against giving the woman a loan extension and in doing so shames' the old woman publicly. In retaliation for this humiliation, the gypsy woman places a supernatural curse on the unfortunate Brown.In 3-days time a demon from Hell will enter our world and take Browns' soul to purgatory forever. The race is now on for her to find a way of preventing this from happening and to seek redemption. After enlisting the help of a ""Seer"", Brown is put in contact with a medium that has fought this demonic beast before - On that occasion she was defeated and the unfortunate soul was lost. Will the medium be successful second time around?If you're looking for a truly frightening horror movie then this film is not for you. Think of Evil Dead and your well on the way to discovering what this movie is like. Comedic moments are aplenty and the music score and shock tactics which is Raimis' trademark provide you with enough material to look away in disgust rather than fear.This movie is definitely a throw-back to the old 80's style horror flick and if that's your thing you're going to love it. If you prefer your horror movies a bit classier and a little more believable then stay away and rent it on DVD at a later date.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Finally, something original","When I saw Drag Me to Hell, I thought it was very well-made and decent. The main reason I loved this movie because it was something original, which is rare in the horror movie business these days. So far, this is one of the best movies of the year.I had really high expectations going into this movie, despite the fact that it was a horror movie that was rated PG-13. I was excited because it was made by the same people who made The Evil Dead, which is one of my all-time favorite horror movies. Also, Alison Lohman, who plays the lead, wasn't the girl screaming and whimpering multiple times, she was someone who was determined and took risks to get what she wanted. Lorna Raver, who plays Mrs. Ganush, the villain, was creepy as hell. No pun intended.Overall, this movie is very well-done, the scary scenes had perfect timing, and the story was well-structured. It was a horror movie that knew its tone, which was a bit campy. This is definitely one horror movie to check out.Rating: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Back to Roots,"I'm a big fan of Sam Raimi's movies. I think, that Evil Dead trilogy is one of the best horror series ever and I was really looking for master's return to his roots.From the very beginning of the movie I was sitting in the chair and smiling. Opening credits were amazing and I was looking for the plot and horror situation. Sam Raimi is now the best horror director, I like his angles of cameras, close ups, fast editing and his typical original stuff with hidden evil.Of course, he didn't forget for black humor. The actors were great, music was excellent and there were so many scary moments. I really appreciated, that it was an original new movie and not remake.In the end of movie, I was laughing with my friend, because the devil speaks Czech:-)I love this movie and I'm glad, that I saw it in cinema, because this movie was created for big screen with great sound.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
drag me to pg-13,"horror movies nowadays are all pg-13. and they generally have an attractive female lead that's being terrorized by scary super natural forces. i miss the good ole' days when the villain was an un-stoppable demon that bleeds acid. i enjoy the occasional psycho-thriller, polanski style, but these modern movies try to be suspenseful by making you jump every minute with a million fake scare scenes. the gore and blood in this movie is mostly done with CGI. every time the main character gets slimed, its just special effects! why? what's with modern directors and their undying love for excessive use of computer generated graphics? is it too much to ask for some real slime? but since it's sam raimi, there are some definitely awesome scenes and it has a tight ending!

It's so bad it's good.,"The title of this movie pretty much sums up the exact storyline, it's crude in your face and doesn't try to be anything else and thats why I enjoyed this film.Watching from a 'horror' perspective I got to be honest it fails miserably. It has so many glossy Hollywood clichéd 'jump' effects it actually becomes tedious after a while. The acting is as a wooden as a pine tree and the suspense is well... zero.Thats the negative out the way, as for just a fun (unintentional comedy) action packed roller-coaster ride Drag Me To Hell is a pure riot. If I wasn't laughing I was engrossed in the lunacy of what was going to happen next.If your looking for a mindless 'horror' flick that MAY make you jump (more in laughter than anything) that doesn't take itself too seriously, I highly recommend it.7/10... for as bad as it is, it is a guaranteed fun time at the cinema.Andrew Barbarash",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Now this is what I've been waiting for...,"To tell you the truth Drag Me To Hell is a whole new experience for me. It's the first time I experience terror and comedy at the same time. And I didn't know I would like that type of mixture, but Sam Raimi is a really good director that has a way to keep serious scenes horrifying and comedy scene laughable.Alison Lohman did an excellent job playing Christine Brown. She made the character so likable, so sweet and so funny. And Justin Long did good too playing her boyfriend. Lorna Raver did amazing. She did creep-ed me out in some scenes.The film is amazingly entertaining and joyfully disgusting. The blood is little but there is a lot of goo and fluids. It has lots of jump scares with huge sounds and music. Speaking of the music it was just great and really kept you in the mood. The direction was also well done. It has Special Effects and old school crafts that reminded me of Tim Burton and Sam Raimi's older movie Evil Dead. The horror scenes were so tense and comic scenes were truly funny.All in all this film is good. It may not be for everyone but it was just right for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi delivers Evil Dead balance between shock horror and grotesque humor.,"Imagine a group of unsuspecting honest godfearing citizens and their meek housewives invited for a test screening of Drag Me To Hell in a remote suburban theater, doused in acid, and forced to watch the movie in a humongous screen that occupies their entire vision, surrounded by a wall of speakers 20 feet high, sound booming out on all directions in the levels of a Jumbo Jet taking off. No quarter asked and none given. No escape, no bejesus left in the end. This is the perverse pleasure I take from Sam Raimi's latest. The gleeful satisfaction of being scared out of your skin and watching others being scared out of their skins along with you. I'm talking shivers and palpitations and your guts relocating in your urethra, pure bodily reactions like only porn, fierce substance abuse, and meeting a gang of drunken Hell's Angels in the middle of a raping spree in a dark alley can elicit. And good horror. Inland Empire did it for me but Inland Empire is subversive and hallucinatory whereas Drag Me To Hell is a celebration of horror in its purest generic/traditional form, at once a homage to Sam Raimi's movies and those he grew up on and a beast that feels completely fresh and modern. Raimi throws every trick in the old horror book but does it with such conviction ferocity and sheer deranged pleasure you'd think he was locked up in an attic after Evil Dead for 25 years without food and water and no release until he came up with something to chill the bones of the worst sonofabitch out there. And this is what he came up with. A sheer act of cinematic vengeance. While former horror pallbearers like Romero scratch their heads trying to figure out what made their movies work 30 years ago while their fanbases evaporate in apologetic frustration, three Spider Mans later and Raimi positions himself ahead of the game. The first 30-40 minutes are pure ecstatic horror bliss. The spirit of Jacques Tourneur and Night of the Demon lives side by side with modern horror hijinks, loud jump scares around every corner, curtains blowing in the wind and iron gates rattling, old gypsy curses and Baphomet shadows swirling around, the faces of old women cackling maniacally, pure hellish Armageddon, no quarter asked and none given. Raimi orchestrates a symphony of terror playing in a feverish pitch. Even the occasional comedic relief required to break the nerve-wracking intensity and make the movie watchable is nothing short of blood geysers, toothless jaws oozing slime, anvil-smashed faces and flying eyeballs. Awesome.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good? Yes. Epic? No.,"A bank employee is forced to make a tough decision -- denying an old woman an extension on her home loan. While this may have helped her career, it jeopardized her life. The old woman, a gypsy, puts a horrible curse on the woman, where an evil spirit (a lamia) will drag her soul to hell in four days.Many of us were waiting for Sam Raimi's return to horror (aside from his production work for Ghost House), and here it is. For me, personally, it was an experience that was both welcoming and disheartening. any of Raimi's old tricks are back, but some of his new tricks are present too, much to my chagrin.A good friend informed me that the first fifteen minutes of the film are ""epic"", a word that is not to be used lightly. In this, I strongly disagree. While some of the later scenes were very intense and quite fun (the parking lot scene, for example), the first fifteen minutes were largely a waste of film. The introduction with the Mexican family serves only a minimal plot purpose, and we are treated to a bit too much bank employee exposition.What are the old tricks and new tricks I refer to? Let me lay it out for you. The old tricks include: the return of the Delta 88, some great camera shots (again in the parking lot scene), a demonic dance, a possessed goat, and a very subtle cameo by Ted Raimi that you'll miss if you don't recognize Ted's voice. Sadly, Bruce Campbell was not available for the film to make a cameo. The new tricks? Computer generated animation. I have expressed my disapproval of CG in countless reviews, but it's even more sad from Raimi, who is known for his camera techniques and stop-motion work. Sure, this isn't low budget, but animated fire doesn't scare me.Overall, while I didn't find the film to be groundbreaking, it is well worth a view. Raimi includes plenty of his splatter effects (blood, drool, and other bodily fluids) and generally gives us a good ghost story, particularly for working in the PG-13 framework (which is a mistake). The end is also satisfying. Compare this to Stuart Gordon's ""Stuck"" and it seems that Raimi has the more lasting impact on horror.As of this writing, the film is in the cheap seats, so by the time you read this, it will likely be out on video. Be sure to rent this. The film likely didn't make as much in theaters as expected, especially with the overbearing media campaign (which was enough to turn me -- a Raimi fan -- off). Let's help them recoup their losses on the video sales. No doubt the special features will make this well worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is how a Horror Movie should be..Completely Satisfactory,"I didn't't watch this movie with much expectations, regarding 'over-gore', 'over Asian mimicry', 'Saw Inspired' stuff we have been forced to see last few months, I thought this would join the league too..But, The moment the movie started, I was Glued to the seat till the very climax.The Direction and story telling is exactly on par, also Sam Raimi spends few scenes on character building.Amid all tension,the office atmosphere really brings occasional smiles..Now those reviewing badly for the movie, Guys and Gals!!! What else you want in a horror movie?? I won't put any spoilers in my review as the story is more interesting when you see it without any feedback,but I can't complete this review without appreciating ALISON LOHMAN.Never ever she looked so cute and mesmerizing,she really brought me care to her character by her innocent charm.Now when we see every other horror girl based movie starring a different actress,I think this was the pick performance out of 'em all and Sam Raimi deserves applaud too for extracting such a powerhouse talent out of her...Justin Long is better off as a Comedy guy.He isn't asked much to do and he doesn't either.Rather 1/1 performance I would say..The rest of cast did well but apart from Lohman,the real show stealer was well balanced CGI effects,not over or under-done..Well if you are a fan of horror movies with some original Direction,Good acting and a Genuine 'Twist' Ending..Go watch this one,if you watch it after many years,you will definitely regret not having watched it before...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice old fashioned horror in a mostly good movie.,"Despite the fact that this movie is loaded with special effects, it's still one that is really a throwback to the early days of horror, when it was all about its atmosphere and setting up the right tones, without ever showing too much. In this movie there also is an invisible, faceless villain, so there is no hideous monster or a masked killer but just a bunch of shadows, scary sounds and things that suddenly start to movie, or fly around.This movie sounds perfect for the lovers of pure horror, also not in the least because it had Sam Raimi, who obviously really understands- and has a love for the genre, in the director's seat. But yet I really wasn't as in love with this movie as most critics and moviegoers were when this movie got released. It's for most part still a good movie but it truly suffers from one main problem; There is too much happening.You are never given one moment of rest in this movie. This perhaps sound like a good and positive thing but it's just not for an horror movie. There is always something happening in this movie and it's basically the one horror moment after the other. First there is a shadow attacking, the next scene people are being thrown around and the next there are a bunch of scary sounds, coming from the next room. It's good for this movie that all of these things are in it but just not so soon and rapidly after each other. The horror becomes more and more ineffective after a while because of this. Perhaps they threw all of this stuff in because they didn't had a really great script to work with to begin with.The story really isn't much special and truly not something we all haven't seen or heard before somewhere, in one way or another. It's still being made the best out off, by throwing in a bunch of interesting and fun characters as well as some good humor.You could say that this movie works better as entertainment than horror really. And perhaps this is also what Sam Raimi was also aiming more towards. It's a movie that appeals to a wide audience, also because it doesn't feature that much blood, or any gruesome and graphic killings, or anything of that sort.The movie has a good look over it, despite the fact that it didn't had one of the highest budgets to spend. Most of the money obviously went into its special effects. Special effects normally really are out of place and overused in modern horror movies but Sam Raimi uses it in this movie to actually create a more old fashioned type of horror atmosphere, so it isn't as distracting or bad as you would perhaps expect from a modern horror movie. It's all thanks to Sam Raimi's directing approach and love for genre that makes this movie a good and also enjoyable watch.A good in-between movie to watch, just like this was a good in-between movie to make for Sam Raimi, who went back to his directing-roots with this movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi horror-comedy mastery,"Drag Me To Hell is irresistible fun with Raimi's horror-comedy mastery. Its basic story strikes a fabulous balance of suspense and levity. The protagonist (Christine) is a banker who's fighting for a promotion and rejects an old woman's extension to win her boss's approval. That woman then curses Christine, who spends the rest of the film escaping her impending doom. Surprisingly, this is possibly all a metaphor for eating disorders, which is fairly thoughtful. Still, the script is a standard narrative, so praise there should be measured. Nevertheless, Drag Me To Hell is uniquely funny and scary enough to deserve its cult following.Meanwhile, Drag Me To Hell is technically fantastic. The cinematography is constantly moving and stylized with intention. Dutch angles, push-ins, and lighting provide striking visuals. Plus, the editing is equally active. Even in quieter moments, match cuts and jump cuts create flair and energy. Furthermore, the sound design is absolutely electric, getting dramatic, symbolic, and distorted to heighten the demonic atmosphere. Additionally, the effects are multifaceted, the music sets a campy mood, and the direction brings everything together with a dynamic vision. Ultimately, Drag Me To Hell's simplicity is elevated by craft and enthusiasm.Writing: 6/10

Probably the hugest disappointment I've ever had with watching movies,"How can any reasonable human being give this movie a good rating? I abhorred every second of Drag Me to Hell and despite admitting that it wasn't badly made in terms of set design, cinematography, or editing, for example, it suffers from a director who can't seem to decide if he wants to make a parody on horror movies or an actual horror movie and ends up making one of the hugest pieces of feces in recent years (I could, in fact, re-use all of these words when writing a review for The Cabin in the Woods, another outrageously overrated rubbish). Limiting himself to a PG-13 rating, Raimi at least spares the audience more atrociously surrealistic CGI gore effects, but the 3rd highest as well as lowest of MPAA classifications still leaves space for idiotic dialogs, shameless copying from other horror flicks, and blatant predictability. I'm not saying that I wasn't frightened by parts of it, yet for most of the time, I was offended and disgusted by this ghastly made movie. Critics that call it ironic or even hilarious just have to be paid by Universal Pictures since there is no other valid explanation for entitling a movie 'ironic' when it obviously isn't aware of how stupid it is. And now don't come to me with ""it's only for the purpose of entertainment"" – besides all of that it's still a dull and dreary movie that is laden with tons of clichés. Drag Me to Hell? Drag me out of the cinema!",,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me Through the Laughs,"Drag Me to Hell is simply put, one of the best horror films in years. It never takes itself too seriously and lets itself take its course to where it's destined to go, a comedic-horror gem. A bit of a copycat from Stephen King's Thinner, it tells the story of Christine Brown, a bank loan officer trying desperately to become assistant manager. When a old gypsy woman comes in to ask for an extension of her mortgage, Christine decides to take control and deny her claim. The gypsy woman then curses young Christine and prolong her final days before being 'dragged to hell.'Sam Raimi, director of Spider-Man takes this on and shows he's the perfect match to breathe new life into the horror genre. Alison Lohman, who once was very promising in her outstanding performances in White Oleander and Matchstick Men, doesn't capitlize on that promise. The role doesn't demand much of her but she remains throughout the film, extremely unlikable. Even her boyfriend Clayton played by Justin Long can't give her sympathy for the viewer.The comedy in the film doesn't walk the comedic line like Old School or Wedding Crashers but recreates a grotesque new type of humor in which the audience enjoys the pain and suffering of our protagonist and you shouldn't feel guilty about either. Drag Me to Hell doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't and that's what you have to admire most. Is it Oscar worthy? Absolutely not but its definitely worth a watch if you're into the genre and you shouldn't be afraid to like, if not love it for its personality.***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Throwback Raimi horror film that twists expectations for thrills and laughs,"One would suppose if Sam Raimi really wanted to do a masterfully frightening horror film that he could easily do so -- but that would be too easy. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is like a thesis statement for why horror films should stop wasting their time with realism and trying to frighten people in the most ""realistic"" ways possible. Raimi possesses the ability to scare audiences in that way, but he doesn't see the point. Instead, the cult classic horror director of the Evil Dead trilogy continues to employ his masterful skills for the sake of audience misdirection, outrageous gore and hysterical thrills.This was my first Raimi horror film, so now I can understand why there was much clamor for him to set the Spider-Man work aside this past decade and go back to his roots. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is definitely a throwback to older horror movies and a shout out to Raimi's fans. With a classic score and even the 1980s Universal logo at the beginning, this is supposed to evoke a little nostalgia.The film follows Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a young loan officer who gets cursed by an old gypsy woman when she denies her an extension on her mortgage payments, mainly because doing so will get her closer to a promotion and she's trying to wipe the slate clean of her redneck past. The curse causes a shadowy demon to torment her for three days and on the third he will come to take her soul into hell. That and the old woman keeps showing up in some form or another to attack her.Raimi has a fine understanding of suspense and how to get an audience on edge and prey on their expectations. Horror films have such a clear rise-and-fall scene structure and so many of the same techniques are utilized that an audience can predict a film's movement. Raimi uses that to his advantage rather than just using it period. Twisting it in this way allows him to create unexpected laughs and enhance the interest and entertainment level of the story, even if the plot is quite simple like ""Drag Me to Hell.""Some people, I imagine, don't appreciate the scary parts of films being diminished by laugh- out-loud gore such as an old lady vomiting maggots and other comedic surprises, but I think it serves more as a reminder that horror doesn't have to make you wet yourself and give you nightmares to be entertaining. In fact it really celebrates the subconscious pleasure we get from scary movies to use those nerve-racking techniques to lead us where we least expect yet find quite entertaining.When you look back at ""Drag Me to Hell,"" you'd be crazy not to find it ridiculous and absurd, but it finds a wonderfully entertaining balance of horror, comedy and realism. Christine feels like a very real protagonist despite the outrageous things that happen to her. She has a boyfriend (Justin Long) who legitimately loves her and she wants a promotion like the rest of us and she has moral dilemmas like the rest of us. Even if the Raimi brothers negate that with bizarre scene climaxes, they've done their job to create a complete main character and we can't label anything with fully realized characters as pulp or trash. It seems dumb, but the intention is clear and anyone who checks their expectations imposed by the bad horror films of late will see that and enjoy ""Hell.""~Steven CVisit my site! http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Getting Dragged To Hell Was Never This Much Fun!,"Known to many for making the block-buster ""Spiderman"" series, Sam Raimi began in his career in 1981 with a wonderful little gem called ""The Evil Dead."" The 1981 horror classic featured everything a good horror movie is supposed to be: scary, gory, at times weirdly funny, and entertaining. When I saw ""The Evil Dead,"" I wondered if Raimi would ever return to horror again. 2009's ""Drag Me To Hell"" is the answer that was given. Raimi has finally gotten a chance to leave the ""Spiderman"" franchise and actually do something that old fans would remember him by. There's only three words to describe ""Drag Me To Hell"" and those words are: A PERFECT MOVIE!Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, a woman who is living a happy life with her boyfriend Clay, and she has a great job at the bank. But when an old gypsy woman, Sylvia Ganush, comes to Christine, begging for another extension on her mortgage payment, Christine is faced with a challenging decision. Will she impress her boss and win the assistant manager position or will she help Mrs. Ganush out and never be able to make tough decisions? Christine goes for the first choice. Bad mistake, because Mrs. Ganush puts a curse on Christine. It is the curse of the Lamia, a furious demon that tortures its victims for three days until it finally drags you to hell to burn for eternity. Can Christine be able to find a way to stop the curse before it's too late?Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is a superior horror film with nonstop scares, gratuitous gross-out moments, a very dark sense of humor, and it's fun to watch. Raimi doesn't just put Christine through hell, but he does it with the audience too. I was jumping in my seat so many times, talking to the screen, and I actually felt my adrenaline pumping, stuff that hasn't happened to me in a long time in a horror movie. It makes you remember classic horror film rules: If a disgusting gypsy woman with bad dentures, a blind eye, leper fingernails and endless phlegm coming out of her mouth needs your help, you don't ignore her. You help that woman out!There are plenty of slashers and haunted house movies, but there aren't so many people getting cursed. Raimi's horrific story is just a little bit formulaic, but he takes it and makes it his own. Gypsy curses have never been this violent or scary.The cast obviously had a good time making the movie because their performances are awesome. I really enjoyed watching Alison Lohman play Christine. I haven't watched a lot of her movies, but this one shows that she's very underrated and deserves bigger roles. Great job, Lohman! Justin Long has starred in another very popular horror movie called ""Jeepers Creepers."" He is also very good here as Christine's boyfriend Clay, the dude who is always telling her that everything is okay and nothing is coming for her. Hah! Welcome back to horror, Mr. Long. David Paymer is very funny as Christine's boss. Dileep Rao makes a very good psychic as Rham Jas. And Lorna Raver shines as Ganush. Raimi has created the most disgusting gypsy ever.Sam Raimi directs ""Drag Me To Hell"" with such energy and love for the genre. This is the guy who obviously always loved horror movies. He never holds back on scares and gross-outs. And the effects here are remarkable. Thank God Raimi has returned to horror.Peter Travers has called ""Drag Me To Hell"" ""horror movie heaven,"" which it very well is. You'll completely forget that it's rated PG-13 and you'll have a fantastic time jumping in your seat, screaming, and laughing. ""Drag Me To Hell"" stands as one of 2009's best horror movies in line with ""My Bloody Valentine 3D,"" ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""Friday the 13th."" Now, let's see what ""Sorority Row"" and ""Jennifer's Body"" can do.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Scared the Hell Out of Me!,"I decided to go see the new movie ""Drag Me To Hell."" Here is what I thought:For a Sam and Ivan Raimi flick, it was pretty cool!!!! I was very surprised to see that there were so many great 'jump-out' scary scenes for a PG-13 and there were some great make-up effects too. There were points where the movie scared the hell out of me and I would jump back or scream out obscenities.For those who know the Raimi bros and their unique style of horror, you'd know that there would be some pretty funny moments in any of their horror movies. This movie isn't an exception. There were several subtle humor points throughout the movie and I really enjoyed the scene with the goat (It's not that kind of scene) and the scene where the old lady attacks the young woman both alive and dead. There were some points where it was so sick and gross that it was funny. Overall it was pretty scary and pretty funny at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Entertaining , Silly and worth a watch.","They say the most influential films you will ever see are watched at the time of life when you are most likely to influenced and that is your teenage years. Back in 1983 when i was 15 years old i saw a film that not only shocked me but laid the foundations for me being the movie lover i am today and that film was Sam Raimi's "" The Evil Dead"" . Although at the time i saw this film purely as a kick arse horror movie , it wasn't until later that i saw the humour in it . Although Drag me To hell is not a patch on ""The Evil Dead"" you can see it's a Raimi movie , as it has all his brilliant hallmarks.Determined to impress her boss and get a much-needed promotion at work, Christine Brown lays down the law when mysterious Mrs. Ganush literally comes begging for mercy at her feet. In retaliation for being publicly shamed, Mrs. Ganush places the dreaded curse of the Lamia on her unfortunate target, transforming Christine's life into a waking nightmare. Her skeptical boyfriend, Clay , casually brushing off her disturbing encounters as mere coincidence, Christine attempts to escape eternal damnation by seeking out the aid of seer Rham Jas . But Christine's time is fast running out, and unless she's able to break the curse, she'll be tormented by a demon for three days before literally being dragged to hell.What i liked about Drag Me To Hell is that from the first five minutes you soon realise that this was a film that was not going to take itself too seriously . The story is not unique and the film relies more on Loud noises and quick movements to provide the scares . The main characters are plainly stupid and have no common sense , as so often they are in Sam Raimi films but that adds to the humour and shock factor and although i didn't find this scary at all , i was entertained throughout. The ending deserves a special mention also . There is a twist that i never coming and it is guaranteed to put a big smile on your face .They say the most influential films you will ever see are watched at the time of life when you are most likely to influenced and that is your teenage years.

Although at the time i saw this film purely as a kick arse horror movie , it wasn't until later that i saw the humour in it . Although Drag me To hell is not a patch on ""The Evil Dead"" you can see it's a Raimi movie , as it has all his brilliant hallmarks.Determined to impress her boss and get a much-needed promotion at work, Christine Brown lays down the law when mysterious Mrs. Ganush literally comes begging for mercy at her feet. In retaliation for being publicly shamed, Mrs. Ganush places the dreaded curse of the Lamia on her unfortunate target, transforming Christine's life into a waking nightmare. Her skeptical boyfriend, Clay , casually brushing off her disturbing encounters as mere coincidence, Christine attempts to escape eternal damnation by seeking out the aid of seer Rham Jas . But Christine's time is fast running out, and unless she's able to break the curse, she'll be tormented by a demon for three days before literally being dragged to hell.What i liked about Drag Me To Hell is that from the first five minutes you soon realise that this was a film that was not going to take itself too seriously . The story is not unique and the film relies more on Loud noises and quick movements to provide the scares . The main characters are plainly stupid and have no common sense , as so often they are in Sam Raimi films but that adds to the humour and shock factor and although i didn't find this scary at all , i was entertained throughout. The ending deserves a special mention also . There is a twist that i never coming and it is guaranteed to put a big smile on your face . clear rating",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A funny, dark, and gross horror flick.","Drag Me to Hell is not slow-paced by any stretch of the imagination. It's a literal onslaught of shocks and gross-outs. Some parts of the movie work better than others, but it was by far the most memorable of the horror movies that I've seen this year.I'm sure that die-hard Raimi fans probably have a different opinion about his unique little humorous touches, but as a casual fan I found his little flourishes occasionally distracting. I know that horror movies often benefit from some humor, but some scenes (the anvil in particular) just felt unnecessary.Drag me to Hell is also loud. I mean LOUD. You will jump. A lot. And not necessarily because you're afraid. You may just be jumping because it sounds like a fully-loaded freight train is about to come crashing from the speakers. Some of the frights are genuine, but your body will slowly become numb to the quick-cut jump scares, and by the end of the movie they really won't affect you much anymore. At least that's the way it was for me.The story is cool enough, but a few of the plot devices are all too familiar. The certain length of time to break the curse before it's too late for the protagonist, the desperate séance at the end of the movie, and the last second twist that's pretty much telegraphed to the viewer with more that 30 minutes left to go. Do those things spoil the movie? No. I actually enjoyed DMTH a lot. But these ticky little flaws stand out when the rest of the movie is so enjoyable.I thought the Alison did really well, and her beastly tormentor was suitably freaky. The old gypsy woman was a scene-stealer. She was equally frightening and disgusting. There's also a memorable goat that I would have loved to see for a longer period of time. Raimi really makes the curse seem horrible, and we can completely understand our heroine's (I use that word quite loosely) desperation to put an end to it.DMTH pushes the right buttons most of the time, and it's a really good movie to watch with your girlfriend or a few of your buddies. It's not perfect, but don't let the few flaws that I've pointed out stop you from seeing a pretty cool horror flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi's most satisfying work since Ash was last pitted against the Deadites.,"He may have spent the best part of a decade making family-friendly super-hero blockbusters, but Sam Raimi clearly hasn't forgotten how to have fun whilst scaring an audience silly: Drag Me To Hell sees the director on top nerve-shredding form, his enthusiasm for the genre that first made his name seemingly stronger than ever, and his film-making skills honed to perfection.Masterfully blending edge-of-your-seat tension with ghoulish comedy, Raimi's brilliantly inventive and witty script tells of Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), an ambitious bank employee who, against her better judgement, rejects an old woman's pleas for a loan extension and consequently becomes the victim of a nasty gypsy curse. With only three days before she is due to be dragged to hell by goat-headed demon Lamia, the terrified young woman desperately searches for a way to avoid her dreadful fate, enlisting the help of her sceptical but concerned boyfriend (Justin Long) and psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao).Packed full of perfectly executed jump scares, disgusting gross-out visual gags (eyeball popping; mucous spewing; blood gushing; maggot vomiting: it's all there!), stunning camera-work, and effective CGI, and featuring a strong central performance from lovely leading lady Lohman, Drag Me To Hell is hugely entertaining from start to finish.It goes to show that not all modern mainstream horror is bland, predictable, vacuous drivel—just most of it.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me to Hell is a perfect example of why you should listen only to CRITICS,"Drag Me to Hell is a perfect example of why CRITICS know what the hell (pun intended) they're talking about, whereas moron movie-goers do NOT.This is one of those rare instances where the critics are the ones who praise a film (I mean, holy crap ... this film has like a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes) while the general public completely pans it.Guess what?After seeing this film, I can definitely say without a shadow of a doubt that all of the critics are absolutely, 100% correct. This is easily one of the greatest horror-thrillers of all time, the scariest horror-thriller of all time, and by far the most well-directed horror-thriller of all time.It's amazing how many people claimed that this film wasn't ""scary"" at all, when in fact they were probably wetting their damn pants every time something popped out out of nowhere after the misdirection/suspenseful build-up that happens throughout the entire movie. Cheap? Maybe. Does it work? Absolutely.This film now ties with The Mist as being my two favorite horror-thrillers of all time.A great example of why critics are the only ones who should be making any comments about anything. Critics and myself, one of the few people who aren't a bunch of stupid morons who wouldn't know ""good"" from ""bad"" if their damn soul depended on it (another intended pun).Nearly ten major critics (from Entertainment Weekly to the Washington Post) gave this film a PERFECT score. Personally, I wouldn't give it higher than a 90/100 or a 9.0 out of 10 ... but it really sickens me to read what many of the movie-goers have said about this film.All those comments have done is prove just how stupid most people really are.It's interesting how a lot of people (and I don't just mean on here) claim that this film wasn't the least bit scary ... and then they turn right around and admit that there were plenty of ""jump scares"" (which I guess is the term people are using) throughout. Okay ... so if suspenseful music/tension and misdirection leading to an inevitable, shocking ""scare"" isn't what ""scary"" is, then I'd really like to know what IS.Of all of the horror thrillers I've seen in the last decade or so (1408, The Mist, The Others, Skeleton Key, The Descent, The Ring, 28 Weeks Later, Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of Wax, etc., (too many more to name ... those are just off the top of my head)), Drag Me to Hell is BY FAR the scariest. If this film doesn't qualify as being ""scary,"" then I really don't know what else in the entire damn world would qualify as such, because every single one of those other movies I just named (and pretty much every horror film ever, especially slasher-types) watch like the Care Bears movie compared to Drag Me to Hell.Honestly, do people even THINK before they post reviews on sites like IMDb and Metacritic?Yes, the movie IS full of cheap, ""misdirect and then jump out at you"" shock-scares ... that's what SCARY IS!Of course, as with all horror thrillers (including survival horror video games such as Dead Space), how ""scary"" it happens to be really depends on how, where, and when you watch/play it. For instance, if you watched this film with other people around during the daytime ... or even in a movie theater surrounded by other people, then it probably wouldn't come off that scary at all. I, on the other hand, watched this film by myself, in a dark room, in the middle of the night (I purposely wanted this type of atmosphere). Big difference. I actually considered closing my eyes at one point, but then I realized that the scares would have been even worse, as the loud, out-of-nowhere SOUNDS in this film are half the scare. At least with my eyes open I could see the nasty, crusty, hag of an old woman pop out out of nowhere and be expecting the loud-ass shriek that accompanies it.It's one thing to NOT like the film, but to actually say that this movie wasn't scary is just plain ridiculous and stems from pure bias and spite. Because I can think of no other horror thriller in the last decade or two that even compares in terms of sheer fright and tension. If Drag Me to Hell isn't scary, then nothing in the world of cinema is. I pretty much cringed for the entire 100 minutes.And yeah, there are still people who classify this as part ""comedy,"" but until Sam Raimi himself openly says that (which he has NOT), I call bull. The fact of the matter is, a ""comedic"" horror film would be quite obvious in its tone and atmosphere. I've seen ""comedic"" horror films before, and this watches nothing like those. This was a film that took its plot very seriously,where exactly did it say ""spoof"" or ""parody"" to you? Drag Me to Hell was tense and unnerving the entire time. If you laughed during this, then that's something to get checked out. Because there was nothing even remotely funny about this movie. Disgusting, shocking, and terrifying? Yes.Bottomline is, most horror thrillers slightly entertain but do not end up impressing me much. This one shocked me to the core.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Evil Dead"" it ain't, but damn fine horror nevertheless!","I actually don't even know why I'm referring to ""The Evil Dead"" in the subject line of this user-comment. Presumably because, like the majority of die-hard horror fanatics, I was really looking forward to director Sam Raimi's return to the genre that promptly made him immortal back in 1981. ""The Evil Dead"" is a timeless masterpiece and a milestone that helped determining the fundamentals of an entire genre. Even though nobody expected ""Drag Me to Hell"" to be on the same dazzling quality level as ""The Evil Dead"", it's nonetheless a refreshment to see Raimi directing a good old-fashioned grueling movie that doesn't feature any comic book superheroes in tight spider maillots, massive 200 million dollar budgets or hi-tech spectacular stunts.""Drag Me To Hell"" has a fairly simplistic plot and even regularly reverts back to some of the most ancient clichés of the horror genre, but at least the excitement is non-stop and fast-paced with a handful of authentic jump-moments. The story is a bit of a mixture between Stephen King's ""Thinner"" and the legendary classic ""The Exorcist"". Over- ambitious bank employee Christine Brown becomes the victim of a terrible curse when she refuses to extend the loan of an ageing gypsy woman and subsequently puts her to shame in public. The evil-eyed gypsy wench Sylvia Ganush (glorious role for TV-actress Lorna Raver) possesses Christine with the spirit of Lamia; a malignant and insurmountable goat- lord demon that demands animal sacrifices and can't even be controlled during professionally staged exorcism sessions. Experienced horror buffs know that a plot description like this guarantees a giant amount of sinister séances, magic talismans and hysterically rampaging witches. Especially the first half hour and the climax of ""Drag Me To Hell"" are downright fantastic and genuine 'oldskool' horror material. The middle section is more or less familiar territory, with derivative twists and irrelevant sub plots, but Sam Raimi nevertheless professionally sustains the moody atmosphere and even gradually builds up towards the stupendous finale. Obviously I can't reveal anything about the ending, but I assure it's the best frikkin' climax I saw in cinemas in decades! The make-up and sound effects are sublimely unsettling without ever becoming overly tasteless or shocking, and the acting performances are really satisfying. Alison Lohman is very good as the tormented protagonist – not at all hysterical or irritating like I initially feared – and she received adequate support from Justin Long, David Paymer and the aforementioned Lorna Raver.The only thing missing here is a cameo from ultra-cool dude and regular Sam Raimi buddy Bruce Campbell, but according to the trivia section he got in conflict with other filming responsibilities, so even that's forgiven.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Got Curse?,"I wouldn't say I'm a total Sam Raimi fan, but I do like me some good horror. For the most part, DMTH was good. Not great, not fantastic, but just good. Beyond very minor elements, the story of someone being cursed is an old one.A loan officer finds that a particular customer has placed a curse on her, for, umm, not granting her loan. That's right. She didn't steal her kids, didn't run over her family while driving drunk or stab her in the back, she was just doing her job and WHAM! got a curse. For the rest of the film, she tries to shake off this curse by magically going to the only fortune teller within a 1000 miles that can actually help her.I've read as to how funny this movie is, yet I didn't laugh much. I saw the dark humor, two in particular involving animals. (Justin Long, who is at least funny in films such as Dodgeball, doesn't have one, not ONE funny line.) But dark humor is done much better in so many other movies. And about the story line, I have to say that it kept reminding me of the Steven King movie ""Thinner"". They were both cursed, and they both had to hunt down a cure before they were gone. Thinner's curse, was of course, much better and a hell of a lot funnier. And let's not even go into the predictable ending.But I can't totally condemn the movie. There were plenty of creepy scenes, and Sam's got an eye for shots. Wait for a rental, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very well written, but based on an age-old genre","Don't worry, I'll make my negative comment (just one) quick and painless -- This is another ""someone ticks off an old gypsy, gypsy curses the person, the person suffers tremendously, the person tries the whole movie to undo the curse"" story. Aside from that, it held my interest and the acting was quite compelling. This is a movie where you're left to wonder...is any of this real, or could all of it just be psychological suggestion? Do we need to believe in curses for them to be real, and if so, do things truly happen due to a curse, or because we talk ourselves into thinking something bad will happen. As you'll see in this movie, nothing bad happens until the cursed individual believes they have a reason to think something will happen. The ending is the best part because it leaves you to wonder -- ""Is what I just 'saw' what really happened, or is it just what happened coming from the mind of the one who was 'cursed'?"" I definitely recommend this one for all horror fans, it will really make you think! 7/10 (lost 1 point for using a clichéd story line)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One Brilliant piece of art!,"I'm so sick of the same old boring horror movies where you pretty much know everything that going to happen. I went to see this movie because I've heard so much good things about and I was not disappointed! The perfect mixture of humor and horror was perfect! The sound effects was amazing and even the story was pretty clever! I loved the Evil Dead movies but this was even better! I loved how I jumped out of mu chair without any warning or buildup whatsoever! Element of surprise was great! You must see this movie! It's the best horror movie of 2009, in fact its the best Horror movie in many years! I was entertained from the very beginning to the very end. There will be people that will hate this movie simply because of the humor that is used. I really pity those.. A horror movie doesn't have to be dead serious all the way through! In fact every horror movie should be like this.. One moment you are laughing your eyes out and in the next your heart nearly stops of shock! This is how it should be and I'm so glad I finally got to see a movie of this caliber again. If there is anything negative abou this movie it will have to be that it ended too soon! It's not a short movie but it's jus that good and you don't ever want it to end. The ending was really exciting and I wish it was a bit longer. Judging by the IMDb score on this movie, Raimi will certainly make more films like this and I can't wait to see them! If you haven't seen it already. don't miss out on this movie in the cinemas. Movies like this should be seen on the big screen and with proper speakers!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Throwback to Old School Raimi,"This is a film that I periodically check out from time to time, as I do have to admit, it is fun. I actually saw it in the theater while in college the first time and then a few times on DVD. I did get the chance to check it out again on 35mm when it was part of the Horror 101 series at my theater. The synopsis for this film is a loan officer who evicts an old woman from her home finds herself the recipient of a supernatural curse. Desperate, she turns to a seer to try and save her soul, while evil forces work to push her to a breaking point.We start back in 1969. A farm worker (Alexis Cruz) and his wife (Ruth Livier) bring their son (Shiloh Selassie) who has been cursed by a gypsy for stealing a necklace is brought to Shaun San Dena (Adriana Barraza). She tries to break the curse and do battle with the force that is after him, but to no avail. The boy is taken to hell before her eyes.We jump to the present where we follow the loan officer from the synopsis. Her name is Christine Brown (Allison Lohman). She is trying to get a promotion to be the assistant manager at her branch. Her boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), is trying to decide between her or the new guy, Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee). At the moment, Mr. Jacks isn't sure that Christine can make the tough decision and that's holding her back.A decision like this is placed before her, when an old gypsy woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), comes for another extension on her mortgage. She already has had two and she is still late on her payments. Chrstine asks if there is anything she can do, Mr. Jacks tells her that the bank can make money on the fees and that it is up to her. She denies the elderly woman and when she begs, Christine shames her in the elderly woman's eyes by calling security. Mr. Jacks reassures Christine that she made the right decision.Later that day, Mr. Jacks talks to Christine about his loan she is working on. It is the biggest this branch has seen and he wants to show it to the regional manager. He asks her to finish it up that night, which would make her the leading candidate for the promotion. She is excited, but that takes a turn. She notices in the parking garage, Mrs. Ganush's car. Christine gets into her own vehicle and notices the old woman in her backseat. They two of them get into a tussle, which ends with a button being ripped off Christine's coat. A curse is placed on it and it is given back to Christine. Mrs. Ganush says the name, Lamia.The police are called and then Christine is taken out by her boyfriend, Clay Dalton (Justin Long) for dinner. Ending the night, Christine hears something that Clay doesn't. She then notices a fortune teller and decides she wants to try it. Clay is a psychology professor, so he doesn't buy into it. He does allow her to try it out though. The fortune teller is Rham Jas (Dileep Rao). He seems like a con-artist and Clay is even more skeptical. Rham has to cut his reading short as he is spooked by something.Christine starts to notice some odd things. She sees strange shadows and is attacked by something in the dark that night. She reaches back out to Rham who reveals that he does know more. He tells her that Mrs. Ganush might have cursed her with the darkest of entities. He tells her of a few ways to try to break it, but no matter what she seems to do, the Lamia is still after her. Can she break this curse before it drags her to hell?During this viewing, my thoughts were it's your typical Sam Raimi horror movie. It is gross, there are a lot of things that make your stomach turn and he pushes the limits with it. What really hit me is with these things, it really is like Evil Dead II with CGI.I do like this story though, as it isn't too complex. We have someone who did the right thing business-wise and trying to make the tough decision. What she did probably doesn't make her a good person, but I can connect with Christine that you have to follow the rules and guidelines that your job has for you. It sometimes can be sad, but your hands can be tied.Going from that, I like the idea of a gypsy curse. I don't necessarily think that Mrs. Ganush is directing her anger to the right place, because Christine didn't really do anything. I do know when you're frustrated though, you can be somewhat misguided in your decisions.The pacing of this story is pretty well done as well. I didn't have any issues there and we really don't waste any time. It is interesting that the film runs about 100 minutes, because it really drags for me. If anything, I do think they could have slowed down to help the build the tension a bit more. I do think that the curse does jump into it a little bit too fast to be honest. Some of the comedy does hurt the tension for me as well, as you know I'm the biggest horror/comedy fan. I do like how it ends, the curve there was good and I like that we didn't get the happy, clinched ending.Acting for the film is pretty solid as well. I thought that Lohman was quite attractive, but there is a depth there as well. I could actually connect with her in that she doesn't have the highest confidence. She doesn't like to tell people know, even if it is the right thing to do. There are some aspects to her past that are shown subtly early on that really help there. Long I thought was solid in support of her. I also like the comedic aspects he brings to this film as well. I almost wish they would have used more of that than some of the slap-stick things we got. Raver is great as the villainous old woman and I also thought that Rao was solid. Much like Clay, he adds a bit of comedy at times. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed for me.Now to what I had my biggest issues with, the effects of the movie. It is crazy that we have director Sam Raimi, who was the low budget master with Evil Dead. There were practical effects in that look much better than a lot of what we get here. I'll admit, not all of the CGI in this film was bad, but a good portion of it was. It really did take me out the film quite a bit. There were some practical effects, which were fine, but this is the biggest disappointment to it for me. It is shot well aside from that, I do have to commend Raimi on his eye for shots.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I would say that overall, it was pretty solid. There are some creepy things that happen in which only Christine notices it. I really like that aspect. We hear whispering that gets louder each day; there are heavy footsteps from the entity and things to this effect. It was used quite effectively I do have to say in building tension.Now with that said, I do have my issues with this film, but overall I'd say that it is pretty solid still. I like the idea of this gypsy curse and someone trying to logically deal with it. Having Clay being a psychology professor is an example of that. I do think that for the most part the pacing is good. It does build tension, but I would have liked to see the comedy reigned back a bit. The effects for the most part were CGI and I wasn't a fan. The acting is good though and I'd say that the soundtrack was used effectively. I don't think this is a great film, but it did have potential. I'd still say that it was above average overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie almost did manage to drag me to hell !!,"OK, let me first make one thing very clear : I am not big fan of horror movies and have always avoided watching them (the reason is the obvious, that is I tend to get too scared watching them) In fact, this was the first horror movie that I saw after more than 10 years and apparently it was on the day that I was alone at my house (being a teenager, that doesn't happen very often for me). Despite everything else, I had heard some really good things about this movie and so, I decided to give it a try. Little did I know what was about to come next....As the movie reached its last 15 minutes, there was a major power cut not just in my apartment but in the entire area and suddenly, there was darkness all over. It took me a few minutes to sink in everything that had just happened and as soon as it did, I peed my pants (metaphorically, of course). It was as if the movie wasn't enough to spook the hell out of me that now even the brightness was sucked from my world. I waited in silent contemplation as to what it would be like to be dragged into hell and just at that moment, the electricity was back and to my surprise, I was still alive...As far as the movie is concerned, i give it a 10 on 10 because it did manage to do what it promised ie. drag me to hell (even though Sam Raimi had little to do with it)....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dragged Me Through Hell,"Sam Raimi's earlier Evil Dead film(s) are known for being Comedic Horror (at it's best, in my opinion). His Spiderman films started off pretty good (although a little crazy on the CGI), but got boring. So with Drag Me To Hell, he's taking another shot at Horror. A shot that missed completely.I don't know what his intentions were with this film entirely, but it seemed to me like it was trying to take itself seriously as a horror/thriller, but had quite a bit of comedic undertone that came off as a back-up plan in case it didn't end up as horrific as he had hoped. Maybe he didn't know what he wanted out of this film. Regardless, the confusion is clear.The plot is there, but nothing you really need to think about. There are no real twists and turns, save for one that was totally predictable along with all the ""jumpy"" parts. The whole idea that this gypsy put a curse on this girl, as well as a young boy in the beginning is uninteresting as well. When an elderly gypsy woman puts a curse on someone, I'd be more interested in an in-depth tale of revenge rather than a stolen necklace and being denied another mortgage loan by a girl who's just doing her job.And the handkerchief creature of doom? That screeches as she steps on it? You've got to be kidding me. If you're going to do that kind of stuff, you shouldn't take ANY of the movie seriously. That would make an entertaining Horror film! But reviews I've read go on about how ""horror has finally returned"" and even Sam Raimi talked about how working on Evil Dead was a nightmare as he was constantly covered in fake blood and puss. Then don't make horror movies, you big baby! That kind of stuff is the BEST part of working on a horror movie! Now look at you, hiding behind the computer relying on CGI to please the retard movie-goers of today.I will also add that the actress did a horrible job. Although she would have done it perfectly, had the director gone gung-ho Comedic Horror like he should have. If you're going to say that it was totally not meant to be taken seriously, I repeat how many reviews I've read raving about how ""horror has returned"", and I would also like to point out how no one in the theatre was laughing appropriately, save for those who were laughing along with me at how bad it was.I knew within the first 30 minutes that I hated this movie. I felt like I was being dragged through the scenes as the girl was being haunted for 3 days, knowing everything that was going to happen, and waiting impatiently for the unsatisfying events to occur.Worst.

Complete and outstanding!,"It's the first time I do a review here on IMDb. Although I've seen countless movies (and great ones too! ;)), this one impelled me to make a review: it just BLEW MY MIND! I'm a horror movies lover and I thought that Hollywood had nothing else to offer in this genre. Think about it: ""The Grudge"" and ""Quarantine"" are adaptations (and poor ones, I might say) of the Japanese ""Ju On"" series and the Spanish ""Rec"". So, what changed in this picture? It's easy: Sam Raimi! ""Drag Me to Hell"" is not a masterpiece, but it has all the right ingredients of a horror movie: a lot of suspense, dreadful creatures, spooky situations and the most important of all - PACE! You can't take the eyes off the screen, because you're eager to see what comes next, and next, and next... Ah! But Sam Raimi does it even better: he adds the salt and pepper of his horror movies - COMEDY! The dark and gore comedy, the trademark of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, that permits you to relax and laugh of some gruesome situations the characters face, just before you jump in chair with some more spooky stuff! ;) A wonderful surprise!

Impressive Return for Raimi,"Drag Me to Hell (2009)*** (out of 4)A loan officer (Alison Lohman) is wanting a promotion so her boss advises her to play it tough in her decisions on the job. In walks a gypsy (Lorna Raver) needing an extension on her house but the officer turns her down, which gets a curse put on her. Soon the officer finds her life turning upside down as she slowly becomes possessed by a demon. The horror community went nuts when they learned that Raimi was coming back to the genre but I had mixed feelings walking into the film because of the PG-13 rating. As I walked out I still had mixed feelings on the film because some of it was downright brilliant while some of it needed some work. One thing I will say is that the movie has a very similar plot to THINNER and in some ways the two films follow the same path including a couple twists in the story. What does work in the film are the performances by Lohman and Raver. Both women are very strong in their roles and they make us care about them. You can't help but feel bad for the gypsy woman when she's begging for her home but then you can't help but hate her with the evil she turns on. Lohman makes for a good victim and you can't help but feeling for her. The visual look of the film was quite impressive and you can tell you're watching a Raimi film. The director does a great job at building some suspense and that includes an early scene in the garage, which is perhaps one of the better moments in a horror film from recent memory. The early possession scenes are also extremely well done. What I had mixed emotions on are some over the top CGI effects with one coming in the form of two eyes, which you'll know when you see. Another issue is at times there seems to be too much comic approach. The film certainly doesn't go for laughs but it does like to play a childish gross out factor including slime, worms and various other things being thrown up. It looks fake and it takes away from the suspense that was otherwise trying to be built up. There are about three different endings in the film and I didn't get for the middle one. I'm not going to spoil anything but you'll know what I mean after watching the film. The twist at the end is something I saw coming but it's good to see Raimi stick to it and not try to cheapen it. All in all I was happy to see the movie but a second and perhaps third viewing will be needed. There's some slapstick thrown in via EVIL DEAD 2 style but then there are some dark and evil moments like something from THE EVIL DEAD. I don't think the film is a complete masterpiece but it's still very impressive and I'm sure Mr. Raimi will find himself starting up a new book for future genre films to follow.",,Anonymous,Horror
Sam Raimi has done it again!,"Drag Me To Hell is written and directed by none other than the man behind Evil Dead, Sam Raimi but should this movie go to horror heaven or in the depths of Hell? The story is quite an entertaining one and has some good, solid parts however there were a couple of parts in the movie which let it down a little. The characters were written well as you followed the tormented Christine, hoping she'll find a way to avoid her nightmare from Hellliterally. Alison Lohman was brilliant as she gave out a great performance as Christine, Justin Long also did a great job as her boyfriend, Clay. The writing was very well done but there were a couple of plot holes that couldn't be ignored. The direction was great and the CGI was very well done and had made for some great viewing. The scary scenes were also well executed, there were a couple of scenes that made you jump out of your seat.Drag Me To Hell is one of those movies that you must watch in the dark on your own. The movie itself has an eighties feel to it which I loved and the acting was very good, especially from Lorna Raver who plays the creepy gypsy Mrs. Ganush. I really enjoyed this movie because I liked how it didn't focus on gross-out gore to scare you but instead focused on jumping scenes and I thought that it made a nice change to what we normally see in horror movies today. There were one or two bugs that I had with the movie and I can't really put them in my review because I would be spoiling the movie but it doesn't really ruin the movie for you. Sam and Ivan Raimi have done a great job in making Drag Me To Hell and it really shows how much attention they had put in this movie. If you want to watch a horror movie that scares you the old-fashioned way with hardly any gore, then watch this. Also, Raimi fans will be pleased.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gross and hilarious fun,"I think I figured out the recent spate of hate reviews on this movie. PETA got a social hate campaign together due to some scenes in the film involving animals that didn't even construe any cruelty towards them. I knew this was the case when one of the hate reviews (raddi8989) claimed that Ebert hated the movie, when he actually liked this movie. Go check RT for yourself. Then I clicked on other reviews w/ only 1 star and every single reviewer created an IMDb account just to boycott this film, pretty much proving that this was a boycott campaign against the film. Anyways, here's my review:Hardcore Raimi fans are gonna hate on me, but I'm gonna say it anyways: this is Sam Raimi's best work yet. The jokes don't come as often as they do in Army of Darkness, but he uses more of the story to set them up, so that when they do come, they're even more shockingly hilarious than the ones in AoD. This is definitely a more jolting horror than AoD & the Evil Deads. But Raimi invests more in character building in this film, leading us to both squirm and bust up laughing at all the punishment that Alison takes. Other contemporary horror-film directors NEED to take notes from this film. I don't expect them to make their films as funny as Raimi's, but at least learn to build your characters and make the storyline worth the journey.Anyways, if you like scary roller coasters, this is the maliciously fun film for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What has happened to the Horror genre?,"I didn't like the movie at all. Where was the horror? Simply having loud noises boom at your ear every once in a while shouldn't be the factor to make you jump. In fact you don't even need loud sound effects to creep you out. Once in a while it's okay, but not throughout the movie and for every scene. I just got bored of it. The movie was very dragging, sort of similar to it's name, I guess. And you could sorta guess how the ending would turn out to be, DUH! Horror + comedy + goo simply don't go well together. They should be kept apart in the scenes at least. It's only going to grose you out to the point where you will feel like throwing up if you're eating something. Save yourself the money and watch this sometime for free, like in a few years maybe. Oh and btw, your 13-14 yr olds might get scared with the sound effects being so harsh. So beware!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hell ain't a bad place to be!,"Sam Raimi returns to his b-movie roots. And boy is it fun and entertaining! It is a tale ripe for a gory b-movie treatment - a gypsies curse is basically as cliche as it can be..

Comedic take on demonic possession,"I almost turned the film off after watching the first 5 minutes. I was expecting something a bit more serious because when I'm in the mood for a comedy I watch a comedy. When I'm in the mood for horror I watch horror and so I scrolled down my On Demand list and was ready for a spooky evening. However, I laughed instead, all while getting the creeps sometimes shortly after laughing! Raimi can do that to you! This film threw me off, I thought Raimi was done with doing movies like this! Now even though I'm very familiar with Sam Raimi's style and loved the Evil Dead series as well as Dark man. But after seeing his film, The Gift, I expected this to follow the formula of that film, which was a serious take on the supernatural as in films like The Exorcist, and The Unborn, etc. But don't expect total macabre with Drag me to Hell. It's a film Id compare to the Evil Dead films. Typical Sam Raimi here and in the end, I was very entertained. I laughed a lot during watching the film, all while the others who saw it with me covered their eyes.Now this isn't some campy Creep show type film. I would consider this a very intelligent film although heavily exaggerated. Mediums who watch this film will pick out the subtleties and subliminal things that may or may not be scientifically explained; but that is another story. Just watch it for the make-up effects, thrills, and surprisingly great performances by the talented Alison Lohman and Justin Long. The directing was masterful, and of course, the production for this film was pretty awesome.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hell Follows,"What a fun and enjoyable horror entry from Raimi, its very much his style and therefore the movie is all over the place, not in a bad way. But in a Evil Dead way, though it doesn't reach that level of absurdity. The acting is pretty great and the lead actress gives a great performance. Music is pretty good too, the intro music gives it the right vibe.How I can describe the overall feeling I got about the movie I can only really say it's Raimi goodness. It has a really strong blend of serious, and absurd humor. And the absurd humor is simply hilarious. It does ease a lot of the tension the movie has and tries to build, so scary scenes aren't as scary anymore. But the comedy is worth it. From the eyeballs and anvil, to the bloody nose, so many ''out there'' scenes. I guess my only criticism is that some of the surrounding people don't react realistically, but it also adds to the humor like what you are seeing is ''normal'' or ''just another day''. I guess you can call the type of scenes I'm talking about as awkwardly disgusting, and they're great.Beware though, this movie is filled with jump scares, lots more than I expected. And they are sometimes very well hidden. Though most are predictable..aka sounds/music keep getting quieter and quieter until...Ending is typical horror, not surprised. Special shoutout to the boyfriend in this movie who is literally the best. Good performance from the actor as well but didn't have that much screen time.MUST watch the unrated version as it has the best scenes that add so much more to the humor.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Very Good Movie, Definitely Worth Watching!","This movie was pretty awesome. It leaves you wanting more. It was well done and to the point. I would love to see more horror movies just like this one. Way better than all of the recent horror movies that take forever to get to the action, and when they do finally get to it, it's not as good as they built it up to be. This movie freaked me out...especially the end. It also had classic Raimi scenes. Which can translate into being somewhat funny at times... But I think it works. I did chuckle at moments. Raimi does a really good job, and I hope to see more from him. The acting was good, the scenes were crazy, wild and fun. Anyhow, definitely worth watching..so check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
My ears are still ringing...,"Drag Me to Hell must be the single loudest film I've ever sat through in the cinema. At one point even the characters in the film were holding their ears and screaming. This, by the way, is a good thing.Sam Raimi finally has a break from making Spiderman films and releases the horror film he's always been threatening to make for the last fifteen years. And it's good. I'd recommend that you see it as soon as possible because it's already being hyped to death.A girl working in a bank is having one of those bad days. She's got a rival for promotion who's more ruthless than her, and apparently she's not good enough for her prospective mother-in-law. Sadly, she chooses to take things out on an old gypsy woman, and gets cursed for her troubles.Drag Me to Hell must contain a record number of jump scares, so many that you're almost de-sensitized by the time it finishes. Raimi's no fool, however, and piles on the atmosphere, crazy editing, bizarre camera angles and a total cacophony of noise to create an hour and a half's worth of scares. Throw in some gross-out stuff, and some Evil Dead style antics and you know what you're in for. It's funny and scary, as people have been saying, and I enjoyed it immensely.The only slight gripe I have is the CGI, which was terrible. Other than that, it's worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"To quote Roger Ebert, ""I hated this movie""","There's nothing original about this movie. This exact story has been done many times now and ""Drag Me"" does nothing to expand upon it; it is purely derivative. Like virtually all PG-13 ""horror"" films, it also mistakes startling people with actually scaring them. The story elements that could be frightening are depicted with such tastelessness that they end up being cartoonish. The jump scenes this film depends on are all anticipated by as much as a full-minute of lead-up, at which point they are just self-indulgent and irritating. Truly the worst thing about this awful movie is the soundtrack. I can only imagine the conversation that lead to it, but it probably involved the creators admitting that the film was not frightening and in an attempt to compensate, they made every little thing as loud as possible to squeeze every last ounce out of each jump scene. This of course only makes the movie at times unbearable to sit though, and considering how trite the story is, I can safely say that it's not worth the headache. The only thing about this movie worth applauding is Justin Long's performance; he is very good and continues to show a lot of promise.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me to the Next Screening,"It is about bloody time Sam Raimi returned to what he does best: insanely awesome, scary, tense, funny, gross horror!! Ever since I first saw and fell in love with The Evil Dead three years ago I knew Raimi was a master at scaring people one minute and making them laugh the very next. Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness only proved my theory further. But after Army of Darkness there was a long break from horror, which was not a bad thing, as he made some excellent movies in this time (The Quick and the Dead, A Simple Plan and Spiderman 2). So, after 17 years he has returned with Drag Me to Hell, a terrific comeback and one of the best (and the most original) horror movies since 2000. What makes this film so good is that Raimi knows what he is doing, what he wants and who he is making this for. As he said in an interview I recently saw, he does not make these movies for art snobs, but for the horror crowd of which he says are the most welcoming of audiences. Everything from his flawless direction, the fast pace, a strong story as written by the Raimi brothers and a solid cast combine to make this a movie worth seeing more than once! Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer gunning for the assistant manager position, but has to compete with the new guy, Stu Rubin, for it. Her boss mentions that he is not afraid to make the tough decisions, and that she should think about that while working. Unfortunately for her, the tough decision she makes involves Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) and this does not end well for her when Mrs. Ganush places the Lamia curse on her. This curse will lead her into hell if she can't find a way to get rid of it, and it does not help her boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) is skeptical.What follows is a non-stop, freaky, funny, disgusting roller-coaster ride that leads to an astonishing ending. Lohman does not get a rest as she is thrown around like a rag doll, berated, vomited on and has various body fluids spray onto her and into her mouth. All this is completely over the top, and is incredibly funny, however, Raimi does manage to pack some genuine scares. He knows how to seriously ratchet up the horror, and he knows how to work the camera to his advantage (much like he did in The Evil Dead).Alison Lohman does a fine job of portraying Christine and the character arc that she goes through. Lohman is able to bring the charm and diversity to the part, she sure can scream! Justin Long is good as usual and manages to keep his role interesting rather than clichéd, had it not been handled correctly. Lorna Raver is just plain amazing as the villain of the piece, she is just so frightening and really, kudos should go to her for her hard work. Also, Dileep Rao (as Rham Jas, the Medium) is convincing in his supporting, but important, role.Drag Me to Hell is a complete success, a fantastic movie that encompasses everything that makes horror great fun! The audience I saw it with had a great time, with scream, laughs and groans of disgust resounding throughout! 4½/5",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sam Rami's return to horror,"I am actually yet to talk to anyone who likes this movie and to some extent I can understand why, but I personally enjoyed Drag Me To Hell. The film has some flaws for sure and is far from the splatter fest Evil Dead fans would crave. After doing some much more mainstream films( including the Spider Man trilogy) this is more of a return to Sam Raimi's lower budget roots. While the budget is smaller than that of a blockbuster, this project has a decent sized budget. For a PG 13 horror film, this is much better and has more cohonies than the bulk of them. The acting is pretty good and lead by attractive lady Alison Loriman and was good at making this character sympathetic enough for audiences to care about her fate in this morality tale. Having a bad day and greed in her desire to advance, got a curse put on her which throughout the course of the picture battles for her very soul. The film is good, but not without it's flaws. Some of the goofy slapstick stuff that would work for Evil Dead don't work so well here. The inconsistent tone, does not service the subject matter as much as it would if it was stone cold serious. There is a reason why there was not any comedy in The Omen or The Exorcist and look at the impact those films had. However, as a fan of Sam Raimi it's easy to comprehend as it's part of his style and brings to mind both The Evil Dead series as well as Hercules and Xena television series. Even though bits of this border on the silly side, I still think as a whole Drag Me To Hell is a good horror film, but could have been better if it was taken more seriously and was a bit darker. Some of the digital f/x look bad as well, but I digress Drag Me To Hell is still quite entertaining and pretty good as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible,"Sam Raimi needs to give up on this genre. ""Evil Dead II"" was not funny, nor was it even a decent movie. ""Army of Darkness"" was not funny, nor was it even a decent movie. Can you guess how ""Drag Me to Hell"" came across?Sam Raimi has no sense of comedy. If you enjoy the stupidity that is the hallmark of his movies, you'd also probably laugh hysterically at a man scratching himself for two hours.If he just tried to make it a horror movie, this might have been at least decent, but any sense of pacing that might begin to show its face is ruined by ""Raimi-humor."" In short, this movie blows. Stick to ""Spider-Man,"" Raimi.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Forget the rating. Underrated movie.,"This movie is truly underrated, it's not your typical horror that tries to scare you with very dark scenes and jumpy surprises.

"If you like horror with some occasional humor, see this","""Drag Me To Hell"" is a very good horror/drama flick with a little bit of smart humor. Drag Me To Hell is fresh, exciting and frequently has you jumping or on the edge of your seat.Quite frankly it's not hard for a good horror film to keep you on the edge of your seat. That said, yesterday I saw the 2009 remake of Halloween II (a complete disgrace compared to the original 1981 version) and it's sad how poorly that remake was executed (I would have expected at least a minimal effort from Rob Zombie).The creative forces behind Drag Me To Hell did a great job of intertwining a new(?) couple's lives with a spell cast on her, with her efforts to defeat the evilly conjured beast, with a meeting of the folks and more. There's suspense, good acting and very good special effects in store.If you like horror films, check out ""Drag Me To Hell"".

Fans and aficionados of the genre can expect some effective jump scenes as well as some really decent monster make up/prosphetics, and I suppose what could be described as a few genuinely shocking scenes (of the cat sacrificing variety.)

No.I was caught by surprise a few times by my own laughter and then, fully realizing it is a comedy, I started enjoying the movie. The bad acting was really a masterful director stroke to make the film funnier. The gross and gratuitous scenes of old women juices were there to provide extra laughs. The beautiful blonde ambitious bank employee that can drive, think on her feet in dangerous and surprising situations was there for balance, to bring contrast to other horror movies where people are usually annoying screaming victims begging to be killed.

"A Horror Tea-Party, Not Spiced","If you are mature enough to remember with fondness Jacques Tourneur's NIGHT OF THE DEMON and Terence Fisher's THE DEVIL RIDES OUT, you will laugh at this.

You'll admire one of the best designed, weirdest creatures in supernatural cinema today. With her old age, one glass eye, rotten teeth and long, yellow nails (at just one hand, the right one), Eastern European hag Miss Ganush gives you the creeps by simply existing. This is how far our culture ventured in despising old age and demonizing older women in particular, true, but can't it be that every now and then one of them is really a witch? Black magic and witchcraft are, indeed, the source of DRAG ME TO HELL, with a touch of Le Fanuism in the idea that if you are accursed by a demon called Lamia - the vengeful spirit of all women ugly and abused - you'll be properly drawn to Hell to burn in peace.

More than just a PG13...!,"I must admit, about mid-point of the feature; you could probably guess who directed/wrote the script if you didn't already know.Sam Raimi (Writer and Director of Evil Dead sequels) employs pretty similar techniques as the Evil Dead features (wind noise/disasters, clay-mation, demonic possessions etc). Even the typography is almost too identicalAt first, I was very sceptical and questioned; 'what the hell is all the fuss about?', but as I chewed on a handful of popcorn, took a long draw of the large Coke in my left hand, I came to a sudden halt! The intro (within seconds) grasped the atmosphere kicking everyone in the audience; straight in the 'teeth', whilst mildly touching on the 'laws' of film tabooQuite typically, 'Drag Me to Hell' does imply overused/dried-out/ 'not-so-scary-anymore' conventions of Hollywood, i.e. hysterical sexy female, (Alison Lohman), cheesy dialogue, predictable moments of horror etceteraetcetera. BUT don't let that get in the way! Because the film does reimburse you with more 'SHOCK'.There were moments when the surround sound literally pained my ears Elements of the film were identical to The Exorcist (i.e. humorous yet very disturbing demonic processions), and so whether or not your 'eye lids' shut off the visuals, it WILL NOT alleviate the 'scare factor'(because it is just so darn loud!)There are moments when you may ask yourselves 'what the hell just happened?', 'how weird was that?', or 'oh dear god, why is this film a PG13!?' – Regardless, don't spend too much on popcorn because you might be put-off eating at least for a while!Anyhow; I give this film a 7 out of a possible 10. It was scary, humorous, shocking/thrilling, and definitely worth the money.So if you think you're not scared of demons, or you doubt any of the above, Go watch; Drag Me to Hell – and just find out for yourself!And Remember Don't 'shame' the Devil ;)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Drag Me to Some Other Better (and Scarier) Movie,"Those hoping that ""Drag Me to Hell"" represents a return to Sam Raimi's horror roots will be sorely disappointed. This is more ""Spiderman"" than ""Evil Dead.""The likable young actress Alison Lohman plays a woman cursed by an old crone who must figure out how to break the spell if she doesn't want to be dragged you know where. Her efforts involve some time spent at a seance, the sacrificing of a pussy cat, and lots and lots of scenes of the creepy old lady jumping out at our heroine and uttering over-amplified sound effects. Indeed, the only nominal scares to be had in the film come from this over-used effect, and it's not scary so much as merely startling, and stops being even that after Raimi uses it for the umpteenth time.I'm not criticizing Raimi for making a scary movie that's not scary. It's clear his tongue was planted firmly in cheek when making this film, and that he was more interested in kitsch than he was chills. But that doesn't mean I wasn't disappointed in the final product. It's hard not to be disappointed in teeny-bopper fare like this when you know what Raimi is capable of. It's like expecting ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and instead getting an episode of ""Charmed.""Justin Long plays Lohman's boyfriend, and though the character he plays is a supportive good guy, there's something so smarmy and cocky about Long that I couldn't help but dislike him.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The only strong emotion I got out of this film was utter embarrassment,"Most of the reviews I have seen for this so far have been very positive, and I enjoyed the Evil Dead films, so I was looking forward to this film as a step above most horror films that are released. However, as with other horror female leads (the American versions of The Ring and The Grudge more specifically) Alison Lohman played most of this film with a slightly vacant look of mild surprise on her face, barely interacting with the other transparent characters, the bitch mother-in-law, the smarmy but nice boyfriend.The brunt of the scares seem to come from just how many disgusting things the clichéd gypsy woman can pour in to the lead's mouth from her own, and the usual flapping curtains and swarming insects. I do realise this film is meant to be somewhat tongue in cheek, but I cannot accept that making a mediocre film is OK as long as it's almost comical enough to be watchable.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fine film.,"Those of us who have followed Raimi's career from his low-budget beginnings to his Marvel films can conclude that he performs at his best when he has creative control and freedom of choice. There he can offer us beautiful films like Darkman or Evil Dead. This film is a dynamic journey through the life of a woman where trying to get along with her boss will see her life compromised. What happens is well shown, the pace is frenetic, the performances are credible and the ending does justice to the genre. It is a film that can be seen more than once and that only happens with Raimi's good films (low or medium budget ones).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me To Hell,"Drag Me To Hell, for me at least was a much welcomed return to the old days of horror films that today's type seem to ignore. Instead of going for torture, or sadistic violence it relies more on a well written story, convincing acting and scares that don't come from graphic gore or brutality. The story I thought was very intriguing and was a rather original premise and once the macabre and horror film type scenarios come into play in the film, it grabs you and does not let go. I actually found myself jumping out of my seat several times during the movie and a lot of the time I did feel tense and exhausted because I personally really felt for the character in this film and after all that went on you felt as exhausted and scared as the main character of the film because it was handled so well and with tight direction, performances and script we feel like the character in the movie, which isn't always that great a feeling, but it leaves an impression on you and will definitely be a memorable experience. There were a lot of gross out effects and moments in the film that actually were a mix between being so gross and bizarre that it was almost humorous and at other times it made you squirm in your seat and feel nauseated. There still is enough violence and terror in this film, but I did not think it went into the hardcore violence just for sensationalism style that many of the films of the genre do today. This is a film that teenagers can actually see and those who are a fan of the horror genre should love it. In the theatre I was in it was mostly occupied by teenage boys and girls and there were a lot of screaming coming from the girls and various comments made during some of the grosser or more dark parts of the story. The film always got the atmosphere and the moments right, no matter what kind of a scene it was going for. The first part of the movie before it became a horror film was still interesting and played out as any well done drama would and the second half when it becomes a full blown horror film it had everything from music, to creepy sound effects and lighting and mood as well to really make one feel uneasy. This is one film that grabbed you and would not let go because a lot of it really happens so fast and there is so much energy and zest to this film that while you are grabbing the arm rests of your seat and your heart is pounding, you are still so into the film that you can not look away. This is thanks to a talented cast and crew who with previous experience, show that they know their horror movies and they can do them well, very well. This is one of the funnest and most uncomfortable (yet in a good way) horror movie going experiences I have had in quite awhile and this is probably one of the best horror films of the decade because it hit every note right and passed the originality test with flying colours and even while borrowing some trademark styles and techniques of older films, it didn't feel like a rip off of those older films, but rather an homage to them and honouring them. This film was a very fun experience and because I do have a taste for horror films this film really satisfied me and I look forward to seeing it again sometime soon and hope it leaves as big an impact on me as the first viewing I had. One of the best horror films of recent memory and one of the best films of the year so far.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"original, fun, and scary","This movie is so rare, unique, it has its own style. I would say that Drag Me to Hell is pretty scary and horrifying enough to watch. There are many stuffs which you can easily find in other scary films, such as curse, screaming, a ghost popping out where you wouldn't expect it to be. The movie seems like it well follows the formulations and laws for its genre. However, it is different and special at the same time. It is very fun and even hilarious. I literally laughed a lot throughout the film, and that's what I liked most about Drag Me to Hell. It constructs the horror things, and it also destroys them repeatedly. I think it's so creative. I've never thought I could laugh while watching horror films before this film. Drag Me to Hell just wins both scary and fun.new and different style, and you will get unexpected joy from it. this is actually one of my favorite horror films ever!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"I just got back from viewing this movie at my local theater. I never like to walk out on a movie but this tempted me so many times. I stayed until the end just so I could have the right to blast it on this site. THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! It has horrible acting, horrible effects, a horrible plot, and was a horrible story. In the theater many people broke out in laughter, if they had marketed this movie as a comedy I may have enjoyed it more. It is reminiscent of a guitar player that thinks he is the king of the world but can't play a simple song without screwing up. Its painful to watch them show a movie that just constantly fails to produce any enjoyment or fright despite countless attempts to do so. Nothing in the story made sense and the ""scary"" parts may have scared a 5 year old in the eighties who had never seen a movie before in his life. Just think crappy computer graphics and a writer that must have been comatose while writing the movie. I cannot give specific examples of why this was so terrible with saying any spoilers and it would be hard to even think of this movie ever again, I'm posting this because I went to see it because it got positive reviews online and after hitting submit I hope never to think of this movie again. I caution whoever thinks he/she wants to see this movie to please avoid it at all costs, if you see it you will want to sue the director for the hour and a half of your life that you can not get back.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not Sam Raimi's best, and will be too silly & gross for most, but it still has his stamp and will be enjoyed by his old-school fans","Although superheroes (most recently ""Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness"") are now his forte, iconic director Sam Raimi started in horror flicks - tho he hasn't made one since 2009's ""Drag Me To Hell"" (that he co-wrote with bro & regular partner Ivan) in which Alison Lohman (good) gets harshly cursed by gypsy Lorna Raver, cueing a vile demon to terrorise her (and by association bf Justin Long) as it preps to drag her to hell (duh). Silly, superficial and often over-the-top gross, it won't appeal to all and doesn't compare to ""The Evil Dead"" sequels that made Raimi - but having his twistedly fun stamp, his old-school fans will still enjoy it (especially the blam ending).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great Title,"Christine (Alison Lohman) rejects a creepy old gypsy woman for an extension on her payments for her house, thus evicting her. The gypsy woman magically retaliates and Christine must find a way to avoid being dragged to...I don't watch much horror, but the great title got me and the word was the Sam Raimi had left behind the stodginess of Spiderman3. In terms of plot it's all pretty straight-forward stuff, but the film was spoilt for me by Alison Lohman's patchy performance. She's fine in non-horror sequences, and even does scared well sometimes, but often her reactions just don't seem convincing. If you were trapped under a dead body with embalming fluid being vomited down your throat, you might seem a bit more distraught when you finally escaped, But Christine's hair is more ruffled than she is.The horror isn't bad, but is isn't until near the end that the movie starts to become a lot more fun.",,Anonymous,Horror
Above average horror effort,"I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was an entertaining little story, and I enjoyed Alison Lohman's performance, even though I thought her character was somewhat inconsistent. She seemed caring and sweet natured for the most part, but could turn unusually nasty, even considering the strain she was under. She gets a gypsy curse put on her and spends half the movie being tormented by an unseen force and the other half trying to figure out how to beat the spell. It's a little tiresome seeing her act out when no one else can see or hear what she's experiencing, and there are some sillier moments, but I thought it ended up having enough interesting moments to be worth a watch. Not a classic, but a better than average horror entry.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This film will literally ""Drag (You) to Hell""...","Nothing says ""Horror-ible"" like Justin Long. The fact that anyone on planet earth could rate this utter piece of crap above 2 stars is far more terrifying than this low rent excuse for a movie(?) could ever be. The supposed ""horrors"" in this film have less teeth than the gypsy, while the picture's corresponding score reeks far worse than the pathetically fake vomit that makes an appearance more than once. I don't know what movie other people saw, but I'm beginning to completely lose faith in humanity. This turd in the punchbowl could make Yahweh himself check out early. It could make Larry King run away like Michael Johnson. It could make Mother Theresa want to murder a puppy. Jesus would rather be crucified over and over again than watch this movie once. William Shatner shat on this very movie--and when Bill squats over something, you know it's sucking balls big time. In the name of civil disobedience, I'm sending this P.O.S. back to Netflix in two distinct pieces to hopefully give the next sucker who tries to rent this one a couple of extra days to actually read through the justifiably miserable reviews instead of just trusting the rating that is still about 6 stars too high. I wouldn't dishonor my toilet by flushing this monstrosity down it. I would much rather be violated in a federal prison by a gang of angry ex-truckstop queens than have to watch this again. I didn't know my eyeballs and cochlea could feel so much pure, unadulterated physical pain. I feel guilty like I should repent for putting myself through this unforgivable experience. I now know what hell really is. This film really can ""drag"" you there.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I was surprised to like this, since I'm not an Evil Dead fan.","I haven't been a fan of writer/director Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead trilogy, and his track record with Spider-Man has been spotty (I only loved the second one), so I was pleasantly surprised to really enjoy Drag Me to Hell.This movie isn't unlike The Evil Dead series in terms of humor and camp, but this time, with a bigger budget and I think more of an inclination towards horror than comedy, it appeals to me a lot more. There's a good lot of suspense and a coherent story (that's definitely unlike The Evil Dead), and I liked the change in acting style too. As opposed to Bruce Campbell's OTT tongue-in-cheek acting, Alison Lohman went for straight- faced naiveté that could've almost be mistaken for bad acting until she started ghost-wrangling. As her beau, Justin Long also plays it straight, and it's refreshing that his character is not an arse who stubbornly refuses to believe she's being haunted. And it's nice to see Babel's Adriana Barraza get gainful employment, even if it's for a kooky medium role.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Shock shock, horror horror...","I saw this movie tonight on a spur-of-the-moment decision and thoroughly enjoyed it.I'm not a big fan of horror films, and I'm not particularly familiar with Raimi's work , so I can't review this as a Raimi film, but I can review it as a film in general.The concept is simple enough; everyday woman wants to get ahead in life, makes a harsh decision, gets cursed. You pretty much know what you're in for. The ordinary life scenes play out in a pleasant fashion, very reminiscent of the Spiderman series. The production value can really be seen in these scenes.The best parts of the film, however, are the creepy suspenseful moments just before the obligatory shock. These are superbly set up, especially in the first 2 acts. Simply by employing a subtle camera move, Raimi scoots each and every audience member to the edge of their seats, gripping the closest thing to them. Then the shocking element comes. This, I feel, is where the film loses it. The first few shocks are genuinely terrifying (I won't spoil anything, but hold onto your hair when you see it ;)). After the first few though, it just gets silly. They use the same technique of a loud noise and shoving something very close to the camera. This technique is almost guaranteed to get a rise out of the audience, but could technically be executed using a rubber ducky and have the same effect.Other reviewers have commented on the use of humour in this film, and how it's faithful to Raimi's comedy. I, however, found it cheap and that it ruined the atmosphere. There was one scene in which our heroine is battling the old woman. She looks up to see an anvil precariously suspended above her head. The anvil hits the woman and her eyes fly out of her skull towards the main character in a very Road Runner-esquire manner....no really!The biggest downfall to this film was the long list of plot holes and 'Why didn't she just..' moments. I don't think this was aided by the acting, which in my honest opinion, was dreadful. Alison Lohman makes for an annoying, whiney lead character for which I had no sympathy. She seemed more involved with her work promotion than the demon ready to relieve her of her soul within the next couple of days. Dileep Rao, who plays the spiritual adviser, cannot be taken seriously after his first couple of lines. I thought that Lorna Raver actually pulled off the gypsy hag quite well.I could go on about this film and some of its pitfalls all night, but seens as I've already bored my friends, I think I'll conclude;I enjoyed it a lot, don't expect 'The Ring' style creepy horror, think jumpy shock horror. Oh, and sleep with the light on!-Ben",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Someone dragged me to see this film, and for the next 1 1/2 hour, I felt like I was in hell....","Evidently, many people liked this film. I think I know why. But before I talk about that, let me talk about why I didn't like it. Lorna Raver plays an old woman who is evicted from her house by a loan officer played by Alison Lohman. In an act of revenge, the old woman places a curse on the hapless loan officer that not only ensures a string of bad luck in the following days, but eventually promises to ""drag her to hell."" She tries to convince her boyfriend (played by Justin Long)--a college professor of psychology who seems to have a really crass undergraduate understanding of Freud--that something supernatural is afoot. Of course, the man of science rejects her suspicions, so she turns to an ""eastern seer"" (*groan*) played by Dileep Rao to try and lift the curse before it's too late.From the moment that the old woman appeared in the film, I could tell the film would be bad. Lorna Raver's performance reproduces and combines the worst possible stereotypes about Gypsy/Romani people in North American culture. I didn't find it ""offensive"" (which at least would have been something...), I just found it stupid. This kind of ""aiming for....but completely missed..."" was characteristic of the entire film. Moments in the film meant to be funny or scary were neither—-they usually just ended up being dumb and blatantly obvious or predictable. Thus, the film should be properly categorized not as ""fright comedy"" but as ""epic fail trash."" Now, some people will scream ""OMFG! But it's written and directed by Sam Raimi!"" Yes, and? Isn't that the same guy who butchered The Grudge and The Grudge II? To them I say: If you like something that promises to be really formulaic, replete with well recycled cinema devices aimed to produce cheap thrills, believes the function of film is to perpetuate offensive racial stereotypes, and enjoy being told to laugh on cue like the studio audience on some 80's sitcom, then this might be the film for you.",,Anonymous,Horror

"This Pic Doesn't Drag, Save to Hell","The long standing genre cliché of the old gypsy hag's curse is driven to new extremes in this enjoyable darkly humorous horror romp.After his successful mainstream venture on the Spiderman franchise, Sam Raimi's return to his gory roots offers a lightweight variant to the Evil Dead trilogy. The dialogue is banal as usual, some CGI effects are overused and the plot points are basically predictable - the final scene is effective, though -, but Raimi sure knows how to make one jump in his seat and the pace never flags.And in times of primitive torture porn this... shall I call it... innocent piece of good ol' horror storytelling is surely welcome.6 out of 10 obsessed billy goats",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good cheesy fun,"Extremely enjoyable if somewhat over-praised horror film from Sam Raimi, harking back to the ""Evil Dead"" movies that launched his career. They were genuinely cheap and cheerful but Raimi has gone on to bigger and better things. Consequently, this amalgam of high and low-tech only manages to push some of the right buttons. It aims for low-down good fun and for most of the time it manages it but it lacks the fright factor that would have made it something of a classic.Alison Lohman, (very good), is the bank official who finds herself the victim of a gypsy curse when she refuses an old lady an extension on her mortgage. To put it simply, the curse is that after three days of torment she will, quite literally, be dragged to hell. Cue some good set pieces and some decent special effects and it's nice, for a change, to see a horror movie that is based on the supernatural and not on some stalk-and-slash psycho, (though the old gypsy woman proves to be a pretty nifty stalk-and-slash psycho as she helps put Alison through those three days of torment).We get two big anti-climaxes, both well handled, before the inevitable final twist. (Anyone who has seen this kind of thing before will see it coming, though I admit I only half-guessed the outcome). This is the kind of old-fashioned nonsense William Castle might have made; just don't go expecting too much and please Sam, don't go making the apparently obligatory sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not up to snuff with the Evil Dead series but a good film,"Just got back and I love Raimi's dark sense of humor, I laughed all the way through the film.

The boo scares were too predictable to be scary and the sounds were very bright, painful at times like the sound of a dentist's drill, there was no bass to speak of in my viewing. Very well constructed, well shot. Lohman's acting was the film's weakness, she couldn't sell it. I kept thinking Rachel Miner would have been better, same face, same qualities, better actress. Justin Long (stereotypically) was underused. Lorna Raver was perfectly cast. Dileep Rao was interesting although the role wasn't stretching his abilities.

An absolute treat for the horror fans.,"I first saw this on a rented DVD in 2009. Revisited it recently. The plot - a loan officer declines to extend a gypsy womans mortgage thereby incurring a curse... the gypsy and the curse angle may sound similar to Stephen kings Thinner but the movie is an absolute treat for horror fans. Raimi created a truly frightening n tense horror film inspite of it being pg13. It is very tense and horrifying, also laugh-out-loud hilarious—and sometimes it's just flat-out insane. It has tons of jump scares. There is ample amount of tension in all of these moments. A very entertaining horror film. The film seems to offer up something to gross out and disturb everyone, the mark of any horror film. The effects are top-notch. Eyeballs pop out, staplers are wielded as deadly weapons, maggots are viciously vomited, nosebleeds jet across the room, etc. It is full of creepy sound effects and superb atmosphere n genuinely spooky score.

But it didn't, and I just did not get how this film received good feedback?!There was one scene that made me laugh though, it featured a goat, but that too was quite strange but rather funny.

"Relentless, mean, chilling and uniquely humorous - a welcome rekindling of roots for Raimi","Once upon a time, long before the days of web swinging blockbusters, Sam Raimi made horror movies. Ridiculous, demented, technologically inventive and grotesquely comical horror movies of a kind never quite seen before, to be exact. Of course, as with most independent voices forced to appease mainstream audiences, while he managed to smuggle in many trademark quirky touches into the Spider-Man franchise (the ludicrously out of place Saturday Night Fever dance in the third, for starters...) he is now renowned for, many fans of his earlier, nastier films felt that Raimi's madcap genius had been somewhat quenched with his melding to the mainstream. As such, it would be difficult to envision a more conscious return to his wacky horror roots than Drag Me to Hell. While it may contain a larger budget, slightly more familiar material and less stop motion than his cult classic credentials, Raimi's latest is the sort of kinetic, freewheeling, relentless bludgeoning of horror with just enough quirky laughs thrown in which previously made his name infamous and celebrated.Avid enthusiasts of Raimi's previous gross-out fare may be either disappointed or elated to find his latest more along the lines of the first Evil Dead, a more straightforward, traditional horror film, then the inventive madness of the second. Yet this is not to say the film is not inventive or madness - far from it. In fact, like most contemporaries, in many cases the film appears structured primarily for the sake of stringing together memorably terrifying set pieces, and painfully amplifying the tension in between them, as well as satisfying Raimi's seemingly unquenchable desire for endlessly tormenting his protagonist, as much as progressing the narrative. But, at the risk of over-glorifying its director, moments which might have reeked of convention in the hands of another filmmaker become uniquely effective in the hands of Raimi, who utilises Christopher Young's vastly over the top musical score to add a demented yet supremely effective veneer to traditional ""what's behind the door?"" style frights. Of course, a Raimi film would hardly be recognisable without the quirky factor, and while Drag Me to Hell generally forgoes humour in favour of frights, certain moments punctuating the film remain hilariously hard to forget (unusual possessed objects, a devastatingly creative opening fight scene, several inventive gross-out bits and at least one ironic use of Christian iconography among others).Nonetheless, as hard hitting, chilling and whimsical as the film is, it is unlikely to surpass Raimi's past work in the eyes of most fans, and those unfamiliar with his work are just as likely to be bemused as enthralled by such a brand of intentionally campy horror. Of course even considered within its genre, the film has clearly discernible flaws (an arguably oversimplified and generic script with an ending perhaps a shade too predictable and no characters quite as bizarrely memorable as Bruce Campbell's Ash), yet the crucial element to the film's success remains its dogged determination to terrify the audience as relentlessly and unpredictably as possible while simultaneously refusing to take itself seriously. Yes the fleeting attempts at moralising may appear trite, but such a daringly questionable moral stance (Christine is damned to incessant torment through a single moral lapse despite a lifetime otherwise spent attempting to better herself or others) demonstrates Raimi's gleeful refusal to confine himself with traditional emotional storyline arcs and instead have as much brutal fun in the meantime as possible. While the film may not be quite as fearlessly odd as his earlier fare, Drag Me to Hell is at least just as entertaining, which in the end is all it was likely intended to be.Even with the absence of B-movie superstar Bruce Campbell, Raimi's film is firmly carried by its capable cast. Alison Lohman is a triumph as Christine, the normally well intentioned loans officer subjected to continuous torment. As well as proving admirably game for abiding every possible trauma from being thrown around, writhing in mud and expelling insects and blood, Lohman proves enormously charismatic and frighteningly believable, making her tortures feel all the more disconcertingly affecting despite their campy excesses. Justin Long also proves a surprisingly solid piece of casting as Christine's incessantly kind and loving boyfriend, toning down his usual humour in favour of a likable and credible piece of potentially cumbersome characterisation. Lorna Raver is memorably unsettling as the gypsy woman placing the curse on Christine, as well as also proving commendably willing to subject herself to numerous unusual forms of punishment, and Dileep Rao is a laudably even and credible presence as a good hearted fortune teller.While it may prove more polarising for audiences than the average horror film, Drag Me to Hell marks a triumphant return to Raimi's formative genre, demonstrating that even after decades his ability to evoke superbly crafted scares and bizarre laughs remains intact. Audiences approaching the film with no real complexity in mind (though there are undertones to be delved up if desired) and prepared to laugh as much as scream may find the film several cuts above most modern fright-fests, and a positive omen, if any, for the creative direction of Raimi's subsequent return to the faltering Spider-Man franchise.-7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"All Resident Evil, No Silent Hill","Who here can say they honestly don't like Sam Raimi films? From the Evil Dead series to Spiderman, Sam has become one of those rare must-see directors in a business sickeningly full of frauds. When I heard he was returning to the horror business after an extended vacation in the mainstream, I was stoked. As it so happens, I was also stoned, just like I was when I finally saw the movie.Before I go on, I'd like to be clear on this point: Evil Dead 2 was horror, Army of Darkness was most certainly not (though many consider it to be). I was hoping that Raimi would go back to being serious again in DMtH, but this was sadly not the case. It's nice that Sam didn't want this film to be taken seriously, but he literally stole a gag out of the first Naked Gun (Lt. Drebin fighting a hospital pillow off his face) and forced more bad puns into the dialogue than a noobie flamer. Even the nod-wink jokes the movie eventually resorted to fell flat on a silent audience.Frankly, the Raimis don't write female characters well. Bruce Campbell delivered their notoriously dry, black humor like a champ; but Alison Lohman can't get the job done. They actually tried giving her a few of those Ash-like lines and she came off like Lindsey Lohan threatening her girlfriend in public. I chuckled at the delivery, not the material.The plot is sub-Scifi dreck. Its not even worth punching holes through because the film never tries to keep a straight face, but it unnecessarily bogs itself down with office politics at her stupid job that nobody could possibly care about. It'd be like if Bill Lumbergh from Office Space constantly interrupted the action in Army of Darkness for absolutely no reason. She actually goes into work the next day after she's attacked and cursed by a disgruntled customer! Listen, if you only have three days before a demon goat swallows you into Hell for all eternity, you don't waste half of them by going into work to kiss your boss's ass for a promotion! The scares are cheap, and the formula old: silence>extremely loud>close-up of something ugly. Its all Resident Evil, no Silent Hill. All ""Boo!"", no ""hmmmmmmm"" (Blair Witch 1 ending holla!). Don't get me wrong, it works a few times; but halfway through the movie you can see 'em coming minutes before they do, which is actually convenient because it gives you time to cover your ears. The score gets obnoxiously loud when it decides you need help being scared because the images and plot can't accomplish it by themselves.

So when you hear that he is back with another horror movie after so long, it's hard not to get excited about it. Unfortunately, I heard about it seven years late. Yes, this film has been out since 2009 and only now am I seeing it. Better late than never right? But I am exceedingly glad that I saw this film. Why? Because this is the best horror, comedy, parody movie that I have seen in quite a while. It has the campy visuals you'd expect from Raimi but never has he had more of a grasp on the genre.That's because he knows the genre so well. Watching this movie with friends ascents exactly why. Through the whole film, all you're trying to do is call the next thing that is going to happen. When the next jump scare will be or what the plot twist is. And you may be able to call certain things, of course, but the film is constantly trying to make you think you know what is going to happen next.It knows exactly when there ""should"" be a jumpscare and instead positions the scare right where you'd expect but it doesn't jump you. It may slowly lean forward into the light and then attacks. Which creates real tension. When you get jump scared what happens? You jump out of your seat and then laugh at yourself, right? When that happens all sense of tension is immediately gone.While this movie certainly jumps you it actually does it with the monster. And when that happens you get startled but now you're even more scared of what could happen. This film does a great job of using real jump scares and not those silly false scares. Plus, the jumps actually occur in the films universe. It isn't trying to scare you, it's trying to scare the characters. And that plays so much better for a horror film.But outside of being effectively frightening, what does it do? It's funny. Even though it's an effective horror it's also an effective gross-out comedy. Where a ladies head might head get hit and her eyeballs fly into a characters face. This is what Raimi does so well. He is a master of balancing tones. He effortlessly switches between humor and horror within seconds and it never feels out of place. ​ Which can be a nearly impossible task. But he knows what he's doing with this genre. He knows exactly how the camera should move, exactly what lighting to use, and how this story should play out. Which proceeds in a breathtakingly simple way. Within twenty minutes we have our characters motive established, the villain's role built, and the scares are already coming.Raimi knows that less is more for horror films. And with a few lines and even fewer scenes, we know and care about what is happening. We know why choices are made, why things are happening, and it flows beautifully. Every scene, regardless of how it feels in the moment, pushes the story forward. It never stops and has a scary scene and then moves on. It has those in the moment.It shows you that this girl is under constant turmoil everywhere she goes. At work, in her car, in her house, everywhere. There is hardly a moment when she isn't, and that helps sell why she is so incredibly nervous everywhere she goes. She is consistently looking over her shoulder, praying nothing happens to her. And that really helps you relate to her struggle. It's easy to get on board with her.And when she starts to crumble under the pressure you want her to raise above it. But, unfortunately for us, the movie knows this too. And just when you think you know where the film is going, it pulls the rug out from under you and rolls the credits. For most this will be very frustrating. Because it refuses to play out the way it ""should"". It pretends that it will for a little bit but refuses to do what you'd expect.It's really one of the greatest horror movies out there. Everything in front of and behind the camera comes together to make a nearly flawless film. It's tense, hilarious, beautiful to look at, intelligent, and most of all, a blast to watch. Nearly every element of the film, down to the soundtrack, just works. And yes, it can be hard on your first watch because of how different it is, but trust me when I say that it just keeps getting better the more you watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible Unfunny Piece of Garbage! This Movie STINKS!,"This garbage is considered to be a masterpiece??? Why does this have 90 percent on rotten tomatoes. I don't understand the positive reviews and praise? This movie was terrible disgusting schlock. Also, a complete rip-off of Stephen King's Thinner which also a shitty movie.This was supposed to be a horror comedy? First of all this movie is neither scary or funny. They might as well called this jump scare the movie. Take a drink every time there a loud jump scare scene. There's an unnecessary scene where the main character stabs and kills her cat. She got what she deserved when she was dragged to hell at the end. Good riddance!The acting is horrible and dry. Alison Lohman is an awful actress. No wonder her acting career ended after she did this movie. Her line delivery is horrid. You never believe anything coming out of her mouth especially when she tries to act angry or swears. She sounds like she's reading off cue cards. She also lacks reaction to anything crazy going on around her. She pretty much ruined this movie for me with her bland emotionless performance. She had that same stupid blank worried face the entire movie. I just wanted to punch her in the face! I was rooting for the gypsy woman to kill her!Justin Long and Alison Lohman have zero chemistry and make for boring leads. I felt like they were both miscast. Justin Long felt outta place in this movie. He looked like belonged on set of Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer. He pretty much phoned in his performance as he slept walked all his scenes. The gypsy came off more hilarious than scary. Every scene with her was a joke!This movie is way over the top and just plain old disgusting. They're replacing suspense and horror with blood, guts, and potty humor. This movie basically Alison Lohman getting attack absurdly and nastily every 5 minutes. This movie is full of gross. Burping up a fly, dentures flying out of mouths, old lady sucking on people's chins, vomiting bugs and maggots in somebody's mouth, bloody nose squirting blood everywhere, shoving arms don people's throats, possessed talking goat spouting profanities, spooky flying handkerchief's. None of this is scary or funny. Just childish, cheesy and stupid.If this wasn't made by Sam Raimi it would have gotten negative reviews and trashed by fans and critics. This movie sucked! Forgettable characters you don't care about, not scary, not funny, bad acting, dull plot, repetitive fake out scenes, gross out humor, lack of a musical score. It's is one of the most overrated horror films in the last couple of years.Sorry fans, this crap has nothing the on Evil Dead films. Those films were classics. This garbage is forgotten tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me to Hell,"After blockbuster success with his Spiderman trilogy. Sam Raimi returns to his horror roots with this gross out wild cartoon ride with camp undertones.Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loans officer looking for promotion. In order to impress her boss who thinks she is too nice. Christine refuses a loan extension to a weird old woman, Mrs Ganush. The angry woman feels shamed by Christine's actions and curses her.Later Christine is attacked by Mrs Ganush who seems to possess supernatural strength. With her boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) they go to see a psychic Rham Jas. He tells Christine that she will be tormented by a special curse for three days and then dragged into hell.This is not as low budget as the Evil Dead movies. A Bruce Campbell cameo is sadly missing. Horror movies fans will enjoy this especially with its dark humour and wild pace.I did wonder why Mrs Ganush needed a loan extension, she could had sorted out the arrears from all those people who were in her house.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Seems Familiar,"I really wanted to like this movie. I'm tired of the sick torture-fests of Hostel, was never excited by the rather silly plot twists of Saw no's 1-80. I was downright disgusted at the sacrilegious remake of The Fog, and bamboozled by the countless remakes of Japanese horrors that miss the point when they're translated to the world of Hollywood models.I was, therefore, disappointed when I saw this movie. I expected the outrageous slapstick of Evil Dead 3, or at least the suspense of the original Evil Dead. Yet there seemed to be neither. The story contained virtually no plot twists to keep me interested (Night of the Demon anybody?) and seemed to consist solely of things being splashed in the unfortunate heroine's mouth! Yes, the special effects were wonderful (they always are). But it's no substitute for a good story. I mean, there just happens to be an anvil suspended from a frayed rope in a garage when our heroine needs it the most? How many of us even possess an anvil? And why would it be tied to the roof??? I desperately want to say good things about the movie. I love Sam Raimi's work so far, especially the underrated Crimewave. Much has been said about whether the heroine is too nice to justify such a fate - but that ignores the arbitrary nature of the plot. Story seems to have taken a back seat - but to our constantly jaded eyes this movie seems to be long talky sequences punctuated by special effects which we have all seen before. Not frightening, just kinetic.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fans of Sam Raimi or the horror genre in general should be in for a real treat.,"After Sam Raimi's last film, Spiderman 3, which can be considered by many to be a disappointment to Spiderman fans, Raimi decides to direct something completely different. Going back to his roots in horror, Raimi directs this film with the precision of the Evil Dead films, only this is much scarier than either of those films. And, to top that off, Sam Raimi uses his typical tongue in cheek style, that was largely missing from the first two Spiderman films, but all too present in the third, and he uses just the right amount here, never going extremely over the top, but reaching close many times. Really, this is the best horror film that's been released in years.Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) is a loan officer who really wants that new promotion from her boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer). But her competition for the promotion is the new guy, a notorious kiss-up, Stu (Reggie Lee). In order to curry her bosses favor, she turns down an old woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), on her third mortgage for her home. Ganush ends up putting a gypsy curse on her that causes her to see a shadowy figure that beats her up and shakes up all the pots and pans and such. After going to a psychic, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), she finds that she has a curse that will drag her to hell in three days. Chaos ensues as she tries to beat this thing, and as her educated boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) begins to see her mentally deteriorating.This movie has more jump scenes than most horror films do, but these one's actually catch you off guard. In a few scenes, Raimi tries to build the tension, and you know a scare is coming, but in many other scenes there is no way of knowing when something will strike the screen and your heart will start racing. Knowing that horror is better with a pinch of salt, Raimi adds humor throughout the film. The scares are genuine, but the action scenes are usually very funny. This includes random blood squirting, mucus jokes, and a running joke of gumming to the face. And to add to the humorous horror, there is funny dialogue also. It's really an excellent mixture.The performances were spot on. Allison Lohman plays her performance as a nice girl well, but also manages to portray the characters dark sides. Justin Long is convincing as the boyfriend who is losing faith, but constantly convincing himself that his girlfriend isn't crazy. Dileep Rao as the psychic is great. An actor who was surprisingly amusing was Reggie Lee as the kiss-up co-worker, and he really provides quite a few laughs, despite an over the top performance.The final touch on the film is the musical score. This had a really pretty score by Christopher Young. It's probably supposed to sound like gypsy music, led by a violin, and as a stand alone score it's still good for a listen.Overall, this is an effective, oftentimes funny and scary horror film, and an impressive return from Raimi to the genre.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 99 mins. PG-13 for some bloody violence.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining movie,"The cast didn't really do anything for the movie. There is no ""Bruce Campbell"" in this. Alison Lohman (was Ellen Paige originally attached to this role?) was okay, if not somewhat miscast, Justin Long was just a supportive boyfriend, concerned seance/fortune teller guy, etc. Mrs. Ganush was GREAT though, one of the best horror characters I've seen in a while.The plot had some weak points. I didn't think that Christine's southern roots really brought anything to the table, they probably could have cut that out. I'm also guessing that you have to formally give the button to someone, because I thought Justin Long's character was going to have the curse.In the end, it was just another fairly neutered modern horror film that lacked that good old spark. I have no idea why the horror community has embraced that one so much. It represent for me, all that is wrong with most modern horror films. It's all about slick visuals and no guts (quite literally) so to speak and it became too predictable after the late middle-half of the movie (The anvil, handkerchief on the way to the grave, the obvious button swap, awkward kitty conversation at dinner event).It tried to be Army Of Darkness and ended up being closer to Scary Movie. But it's a damn beautiful looking film. It's utterly gorgeous.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yuck!,"This movie was a total waste of my money. I really, and being honest did not like this movie.

I just wish that maybe if the director or editor could of had fix the way the girl acts, I mean, she's not a bad actor but whenever she was like, ""Die you old bitch"", doesn't that offend the elder people.

The Return Of Raimi,"As a guy in his 30's, I grew up on the early work of Sam Raimi. After ""Army Of Darkness"" though, I noticed a change in his style and format. To be honest, I didn't care for any of the Spider Man films. I don't think they were terrible, just not as wonderful as the hype. Moreover, I don't think that they reflect the style of film that I came to know as Raimi's.I opted out of seeing DMTH at first. I didn't think the trailer was all that interesting, and I figured I'd catch it on DVD down the line. At the suggestion of an old friend I went and saw it tonight, and was pleasantly surprised. More so than I expected to be. Although it is no ""Evil Dead"" film, the work embodies what I had come to define as Sam Raimi's style. With Spider Man and such, I felt like he played to his audience: kids. With DMTH, it becomes obvious that the guy felt like making a real horror film again.I'll give him a pass on the CGI, as it is tastefully done compared to most these days. I'll also note that the acting was good, the flow of the film was good, and some the shots themselves are amazing. This film is by far the closest thing to Sam's older work that he has done since ""Army"", and should please his older fan-base. The kids today who aren't happy unless someone gets killed on screen every five minutes don't like this film, but those of us who are on the other end of that debate may just find a little slice of something worth a damn.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi's mastery of the genre continues!,"Drag Me to Hell 12/12/2009Director Sam Raimi has directed such movies as Spider-Man 1, 2, & 3, A Simple Plan and Darkman returns to his horror roots in Drag Me to Hell. Raimi's Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are two of the biggest cult horror movies ever made. They were both shot on extremely small budgets and launched his career and that of Bruce Campbell. Sam has a specific kind of horror that is half slap stick comedy and half ultra gore. The ""dead"" movies were made in the glorious golden ages of 1980's horror films.Drag Me to Hell is a very fun movie to watch that has everything the horror fan looks for, Super-natural curses, blood offerings and gypsies. The movies main characters are Christine and Clay, played by Alison Lohman (White Oleander & Flicka) and Justin Long (the Apple Computer guy). The story revolves mainly on Christine and her job as a loan officer yearning for the available assistant manager position. It's between her and the new guy Stu Rubin. Enter the creepy looking Sylvia Ganush, an elderly woman who comes into the bank and begs Christine for another extension on her mortgage but Christine turns her down. That night in the parking lot Mrs. Ganush is waiting for her and they engage in an incredibly funny fight scene. Mrs. Ganush then puts a gypsy curse on Christine. She summons a demon known at the ""Lamia"". The Lamia is known as the black goat and the eater of souls. Christine has three days to fight off and get rid of the curse before she is ""dragged to hell""Justin Long plays the boyfriend part well and adds his own brand of humor to the role. His parents are rich and don't approve of his choice of Christine, who grew up on a farm and was quite the pudgy tomboy as a child. As the curse progresses, it starts to make Christine see and hear things that aren't really there. They visit a fortune teller who feels the presence of the curse within Christine. He warns her of the danger and to be careful. Christine finally agrees to a fancy dinner at Clay parent's mansion. This doesn't end well as you might expect. The acting, directing, and such are all top rate. Everything you would expect from a Sam Raimi production. As mainstream Hollywood horror films go, it would be hard top.Raimi plays around with classic ways of scaring the audience. Wind, shadows, and strange noises are played out well. Other than in a Looney Toons cartoon, where else would you see a good anvil gag? The several gross out scenes are purposely played for their comic effect rather than to outright scare you, which is a strong trademark of a Sam Raimi film. There is a twist ending that is pretty sweet and is set up in the first part of the movie. Raimi's next film is scheduled to be ""Warcraft"" an adaptation of the super popular online computer game.",,Anonymous,Horror
"It's good, but it's not Evil Dead good.","First, let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Evil Dead, I must have watch this movie, too many times. I know the genre, horror/comedy with gore and cheese. Now, Drag Me To Hell is using the same formula, but in a real PG-13 movie, meaning that it's toned down a little.I did not find the movie to be too loud, like others have said here. The sounds used is supposed to be loud because it's the ""horrific"" factor, it's supposed to scare you. You have gore and goo, but not as much as you would think, not at the level of Evil Dead. Judging by the people in the theater I was, their was 3-4 good laugh moment during the movie and NO, you don't jump on your seat every 30 seconds unless you're THAT easy to scare.The killer for this movie is the ending. If you have $.02 cent of a brain, you'll know 10 minutes before the end what's going to happen. Yeah, wrong envelope. And even if those last 10 minutes are quite fun to watch, you can't keep from being bummed to know that all those efforts are in vain.I was expecting more of this movie and well, sometime it did Drag a little, and it's going to be rated 6/10. It's good, but could have been much better. I'm going to hope for a better Evil Dead 4.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Vigorous Raimi's horror flick not on par with cult classic ""The Evil Dead"".","""Drag Me to Hell"" the story of an unfortunate young bank teller played by Alison Lohman who,when refuses a loan to an old witch,ends up on the wrong end of a gypsy curse,a curse that makes her the target of an ancient demon called lamia that wishes to torment her for three days and three nights before coming back for its final prize:her soul.I often regard ""The Evil Dead"" as the milestone of a horror genre.It's extremely creepy and insanely gory horror film that pulls no punches with its lovingly putrid nastiness.Unfortunately ""Drag Me to Hell"" has more in common with Raimi's ""Evil Dead 2"",""Darkman"" and ""Army of Darkness"".There are plenty of witty jokes and some well-executed jump scares,but the lack of gore and violence is disappointing.Still there are moments so outrageous,so unbelievably over-the-top that you will squirm in your seat.The plot is very simple,but it's refreshing to see something original after neverending stream of remakes.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Over-hyped, Humorless, Frightless, and Overall Boring","Where should I begin with this steamer? This movie failed on all levels to entertain me. I have never once been more disappointed in a movie than with this. As a life-long horror fan, I would expect far more than this from a horror film. The ""scares"" used were the simple, cliché, and overused methods that should have been thrown out with yesterday's garbage. There is only so many times that you can try to ""shock"" a person before it completely loses its effect. Unfortunately, Drag Me to Hell used loud, banging noises and quick cuts ad infinitum through out the entire length of the movie, utilizing it as a crutch. Some will say it's a ""tongue-in-cheek"" affair, but it fails miserably at trying to be this as well. I really don't understand how gross-out scenes amount to ""humor"", as it lacks any thought or subtlety that good humor has. There were very few funny scenes in the movie, and the ones that were present were drawn out long past the punch-line. Some would call Raimi ""bold"" for not ending a scene where others would, I would say he lacks the ability to understand timing and how to effectively run a joke. He can run a joke, but unfortunately he runs it into the ground. Another problem I have with this movie is that Raimi treads old ground. The entire movie seemed like a call-out to the Evil Dead series. Some would say that's the point, I would say it's beating a dead horse. He lacks any kind of innovation with this movie, and one is left with a sense of ""been there, done that"". The entire movie seemed incredibly pointless considering that one could get the same basic movie, only far better, from watching Evil Dead. However, all of these could be forgiven. Unfortunately, Raimi makes the one major mistake that any movie should not make: Inconsistent pacing and tone. It seems as though that Raimi couldn't decide if he wanted this to be a ""serious"" movie, or a tongue-in-cheek slapstick movie. You truly can't mix the two, as it completely removes you from the tone of the movie when you switch from a ""serious"" horror movie to a ""funny"" horror movie, and then towards the end decide to be ""serious"". It removed me completely from the movie, and failed completely to draw me into the world.Other problems are present to, from unlikeable characters, to idiotic plot holes, to terrible acting, to bad dialogue, and many, many more. Giving this movie a 2 is a favor on my part, as I honestly find very little that is likable about it.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Best horror movie with good script , direction, special effects and music.","I saw a Sam Raimi movie after a long time and find this movie really exciting. All the cast was perfect the leading characters were all good. It was best of the demon movies I remember viewing, not scary but this movie keeps you engaged. I enjoyed the whole movie its running time is perfect as much as required to summarize the story, no twisted plot yet enough thrill to keep viewers engaged. You can easily guess which turn the film is going to take which keeps your interest and keeps you connected to the film.The direction and typical horror music of Sam Raimi makes the film above average, I really loved the music of this film which is vital to any horror film, and the special effects of this movie are just brilliant this movie has everything you need from any horror movie. The creativity in movie writing which is missing in most of films of modern age.

Mildly entertaining.,"I have to say I had fairly high hopes for this film, and overall I guess I got what I I should have expected - a typical Sam Raimi film, which is fun and nothing serious. It's not a brilliant film - Having said that it's not an awful film either. It's very much in the same style and feel of Evil Dead. It has a few black comedy moments. The typical over the top, latex, puppets and in-your-face scares, but there's nothing truly scary. If you're a big fan of Evil Dead (which I think was incredibly groundbreaking for it's time)-BUT when you watch it now it's pretty lame, over the top and obvious (but weirdly still in a good kinda way?) - then this is probably a film you'd enjoy.

This horror film creates a very eerie atmosphere, with mysterious forces in action in the dark. However, it's more comical than scary and that may be by design. It seems Raimi is having fun with this and not taking any of it too seriously. Some scenes involving slimy critters and bodily fluids go too far however.

Raimi seems to be having a lot of fun.,"A handkerchief flies at the protagonist's car and an angry face appears as it hits her windshield. It is thrown off by the window wipers before flying into the radiator grille. The handkerchief flies out of the air vents and attacks our protagonist, who is momentarily blinded and nearly crashes her car. She gets out and throws the handkerchief to the ground, stomping on it with her high heel. The handkerchief makes a squishing sound and squeals with anguish.Such scenes are par for the course of Drag Me to Hell, Sam Raimi's little pet project after helping his gargantuan Spider-Man trilogy.The movie tells a simple version of a familiar storu. Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) is having a terrible week. She has a job as a loan executor and is good at, but she seems in danger of being passed up on a promotion to an inexperienced brown noser. She has a loving and devoted boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), but his mother doesn't approve of her. Christine is reminded of her developingyears of being a pudgy girl in the farm, an identity that she wants to leave shake.Christine has an encounter with the gypsy Mrs. Sylvia Ganush. Mrs. Ganush wants an extension on her loan, which creates a dilemma for Christine. On the one hand, Mrs. Ganush has already been granted two extensions and offers no explanation of how she will pay back the bank in the future. On the other, not having the extension will devastate her.. She will lose her house. Aiming to impress her boss enough to win the promotion, she denies Mrs. Ganush her extension. The aging gypsy gets on her knees and begs for charity. Christine remains steadfast in her decision.This lays the groundwork for a series of scenes that seem like they should be scary but seem like the most comical scenes from Evil Dead 2. The movie didn't really seem like a horror movie. The only real scares are when things loudly jump into the frame. What exactly is attacking Christine? Oh, yet again: nothing.The big question: is Drag Me To Hell present an unfair prejudice. Clearly, but this is far too silly to be offensive (actual gypsies may disagree with me).I have seen this plotline before. It is straight out of one of the master Stephen King's least successful movies, Thinner. Part of the reason that movie scared me in the eighth grade was that it presented gypsies as an entity you shouldn't mess with. Gypsies were not portrayed in a positive light in that one.The gypsy in Drag Me to Hell is more of a monster than a human. It doesn't matter if she is living or a figment in her nightmares, she tackles out protagonist with superhuman force and makes deafening ""whoosh"" noises as she conjures wind whoever she goes. No one is going to believe this depiction is what gypsies are like. (or at least I hope they don't.) Nevertheless, it is a little tiring to see the villain of a major motion picture be a cultural stereotype.This is strongly paced and streamlined. The film is a brisk hour and 39 minutes, and to me it felt like half that. I was shocked when I checked how much of the movie was left and it was just a few minutes. The action keeps fast and there is always something interesting happening on screen.This is about as entertaining as a Looney Tunes cartoon. Not exactly a great motion picture, but as a director's showcase showing off his overall style, it works.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Hell of a Movie.,"Sam Raimi's long awaited return to the genre that made him isn't so much a scary movie as it is a roller-coaster ride of jumps, laughs and retching that will serve as a reminder to many of us why his ridiculous brand of horror has so sorely been missed.In ""Drag Me To Hell,"" Christine (Alison Lohman), a young career girl with a big promotion in sight and a devoted boyfriend (Justin Long), finds herself at the receiving end of the Devil's pimp slap. It seems as though an elderly woman (Lorna Raver) whom she denied a loan extension to has burdened her with a curse that gives her three miserable days before she is, well, dragged to Hell.Without a doubt, Raimi is in full-form here, and in spite of its PG-13 rating, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is a hilariously outrageous and intense experience much in the vein of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. Not only is the film precise in its effort to creep us out (Lorna Raver steals the show), it gives us a relateable heroine to root for and plenty of over-the-top and flat-out gross effects that only serve as the icing on the cake. Its running time will breeze by as you'll find yourself jumping for joy and trying to wipe the smirk off of your fan-boy face as you find a director who is truly in his element here. While the severe amount of hype that arrived in its wake may be too much for some to bare, it's a film that, if approached in the right mind-set (hint: lower your expectations and avoid all reviews -- even this one (oops!)) will prove to be a rewarding experience and easily one of the most entertaining horror movies in recent memory.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A blast from beginning to end,"Sam Raimi went back to his horror comedy roots with a movie which had me watching with a big dumb smile on my face through the whole thing.It embraces its own cartoonishness and silliness, never pretending to be more than just fun entertainment, while still managing to deliver thrilling scenes and subtle subtext. Ridiculously entertaining from begining to end. Also, an anvil gets dropped on someone's head, so that's a big plus (I told you it was cartoony).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag me to this movie,"As that is the only way I would see it again. Boring, predictable and disappointing are the first things that come to mind.Is it suppose to be a comedy with horror overtones or a horror movie with comedy ? In either case it comes up way short in each. The way the initial car attack scene ended told me all I needed to know about this sad movie. The old lady has a chance to finish her off then and there but nooooooooo.., that would make too much sense. It's one thing to suspend belief at a movie, it's another to suspend your intelligence. The few scares are phoned in ahead of time and the predictable ending (not matter what,horror always survives or wins)just makes me shake my fist at the writing. If you're 13 ( the target audience in my opinion) or never seen any good horror films you may enjoy some of it, but I give it a BIG thumb down and I'm now moving on...",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Deals with the demonic, but never becomes satanic","Drag Me to Hell is one fun horror movie! It has some predictable moments but, for the most part, it is quite unique. Sam Raimi does a good job of adding humor without diminishing the terror. This movie does not rely on blood and gore for the scares and it was refreshing to see a movie that deals with the demonic, but never becomes satanic. I definitely want to see this one again.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Simple, interesting and smart","so, once the story have a good idea and convincing basics to support the idea without any overstatements, then we can say this is the mean of success. the main idea is the Jinn and the black magics, it's not about ghosts, ghosts mean nothing. the black magics have two ways in the movie line, the first line is the scenes when the Jinn appears to the character and the other line when she imagines about the Jinn. the basics is simple, three days of suffering then the Jinn will take the soul, nothing and nobody can stop.however, The Tricks was very poor, I think also no one notice the movie music because the music missed in a lot of scenes ,the movie story was good however I think it had to be better",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Masterwork of both the Horror and Comedy genre,"Drag Me To Hell is simply the most fun I have had in the movies in a very, very long time. It is a guilty-pleasure, but actually a very well made film at the same time. It gives us old-school scares and humor that had me laughing more than any other film in the last five years. The story is simple yet effective, the performances from Alison Lohman and Lorrna Raver are perfect for this, powerful but also very comedic when they are required to be. The same goes for the rest of the actors in the film, all played their parts gloriously over-the-top, which really worked. The scares the film provides were many, some were scary, some were shockingly gross, and then some were just plain hilarious. The film will surely provide a lot of future references and homages to the over-the-top scenes, like the grave scene, the talking goat, and the dancing ghost. Drag Me To hell is without a doubt the best horror film of the decade, but also probably one of the funniest films I have ever seen. That is a true achievement, Sam Raimi's best film to date. But I do tell you this, please go see it with a large audience, because that will only enhance the experience even more.",,Anonymous,Horror
not a serious film by any means; Army of Darkness level horror with shock value scenes and not much else,"While I did expect at least a semi-serious take on the haunted/cursed genre of horror from director Sam Raimi, I also knew there would be a level of silliness. Unfortunately the latter ended up being the majority of the movie, and whenever it did take itself seriously, which felt like too much of the time, the borderline-cartoonish ""gore"" and shock-value scenes took me out of it. Still, I was able to appreciate and enjoy these outrageous bits, and the risk of pushing that PG-13 envelope. Also acting was so-so throughout, and the actions of some characters were irrationally erratic throughout. The ending will either make or break most people's perception of the movie; for me it was satisfying only to add to that whole shock-value thing. Had it been a little shorter and thinned the serious facade, I'd have enjoyed it more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

load of trash!!,"Either I turned up to watch more of the black comedy standard set by Evil Dead 2 and Army Of Darkness, which I might add was unique in delivering laughs amid its great character's. Or I turned up thinking Sam Raimi would actually make another good film based on the 8.2 IMDb rating it did have when I spent £6.15 getting into the cinema. Ash(Bruce Campbell) made both these films come alive with an outstanding acting performance then another and so on! Quite frankly the lead female was as good as a TV presenter reading an autocue. Even the supporting cast didn't help move the film along with an appalling storyline. Badly written acted and filmed. Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for this rubbish! My advice to you is miss it.... go buy The Evil Dead, 2 and Army Of Darkness and enjoy what seams a forgotten art of film-making great costumes, design structure,acting, settings, scenes, monsters, character acting at its best! Bruce Campbell may well have delivered the cult hero Ash to generations and generations to come by setting the standard this film is sorely missing. Clean the toilet instead",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Classic Horror Story Plotline,"Drag Me to Hell is genuinely a creepy movie. It has many good jump scares and the plotline kept me entertained.

Only the loud noises are memorable,"This movie was brutal to sit though.Story-wise it was meh... fine at best but at least it tried... it was very straightforward. The brutal part was the loud noises with literally every jumpscare - the sound design in this movie is horrible. You have to turn up the volume to hear the dialogue and then when the jumpscares come (and they will - again and again and again) you have to turn down the volume to salvage whatever is left of your hearing. Not a great movie experience!When Drag Me to Hell isnt throwing random jumpscares at you for no appearant reason, it will try to tell the story with a mix of horror and comedy which to me seemed a bit strange and had me shaking my head more than once. I know it was probably deliberate but for this movie I dont think it worked very well.I don't recommend this movie but if you're determined to give it a try anyway I'd recommend you do it WITHOUT headphones.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cursed by a PG-13  Certificate.,"This movie is about a Gypsy curse. An old hag decides to curse Christine Brown for not offering up an extension on her mortgage. Chritine is after a promotion that a colleague who is said by the boss Mr Jacks, to have 'an aggressive edge about him'. The movie however has a short prologue which is about a young boy who stole a Gypsy necklace and has the same curse as Chrisine put on him.This movie has some great visual flourishes. There are many jumpy scenes. It is also quite schlocky however, with puke scenes and one scene where Chritine has a bloody nose and sprays it all over her boss. The movie goes for comic thrills. Mixing horror with comedy, much like The Evil Dead movies. Is this a return to form for Raimi? Not quite. It does not have the adult humour of the Evil Dead films. It does try however but the Raimi brothers opting for a more universal audience with, perhaps his new found Spider Man clientèle following his moves, makes for less in the way of genuine horror. The film is very enjoyable though. It is a somewhat light hearted horror. Or is that light weight? You be the judge.",,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi's latest is frightening - except when Justin Long shows up,"A put-upon loan officer (Alison Lohman) denies a mortgage extension to an old woman, who subsequently puts a horrific curse on her that damns the soul to, well, hell. Sam Raimi’s horror tale is very stylish, as expected, although it lags during the quieter moments, particularly when Justin Long (as Lohman’s boyfriend) is around.Christine Brown (Lohman) is trying to get promoted to assistant bank manager by her officious boss (played by David Paymer), who favors Christine’s brown-nosing coworker Stu. One fine day, a woman (Lorna Raver) pleads with Christine for help with her mortgage; knowing her boss wouldn’t want her to grant another extension, Christine denies the woman, thus incurring her wrath. Said wrath includes a brutal attack in an underground parking garage (nothing good ever happens there in movies, you know), as well as at Christine’s house.Watching this movie demands a certain amount of disbelief suspension, more so even for your typical horror movie. At one point, the old woman puts her fist through Christine’s mouth, with no repercussions. Another time, Christine actually hurls an office supply into the woman’s eyeball. Again, no real damage. In fact, after that first physical encounter in the parking garage, both women probably should have died three or four times.As I mentioned, the movie lags whenever there’s no true horror going on, as if Raimi wasn’t quite sure what to do with all of his secondary characters. Lohman has good chemistry with Long, but that’s about the only positive: Long himself is wooden, a lightweight even by horror-movie standards, so although the two actors seem to connect, their scenes together seem flat, almost forced. And that’s not all of it, either. There’s an (understandably) awkward dinner with Long’s parents, a high-minded, upper-crust family, that doesn’t resonate as much as if ought to. You pay more attention to Long’s jerkish parents (particularly his snotty mother) than to Lohman’s curse-related issues.It’s important to note, though, that the horror scenes are unbelievably scary. The film opens with an electric scene in which a young boy is literally dragged to the bowels of hell before his parents’ eyes, all because he swiped a gypsy woman’s necklace. And every action scene thereafter is powerful, gross, stylish stuff. (In fact, for a PG-13 movie, the scenes are very intense - I think standards have changed just a tad over the past couple of decades.) Bottom line: It’s a good-looking horror movie with many genuinely terrifying moments that are offset only slightly by Justin Long’s annoying performance and character interactions that lag and seem out of place.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Some of the CGI was too much; but overall, an enjoyable addition to the genre","Drag Me to Hell (2009) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Hulu. The storyline follows a bank employee who is one night cursed by a gypsy. The gypsy dies shortly after giving her the curse making it virtually impossible to find a solution to the predicament.This movie is directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead) and stars Alison Lohman (Big Fish), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), David Paymer (Get Shorty), Ted Raimi (Intruder), Octavia Spencer (The Help) and Reggie Lee (The Dark Knight).The Mrs. Ganush character really set the tone and feel for this movie. She looked rough from the first scene and her intensity, persistency and gore was tremendous. This movie goes over the top with gore - from vomit, to blood splatter, to more throw up....this movie takes grossness to a new level. There's a funeral scene in this that's awesome and the goat always cracks me up. There's some good jump scares in this also.Some of the CGI was too much; but overall, an enjoyable addition to the genre. There's enough good content to make this a must see.

Sam Raimi Back to the Basics,"Christine Brown is an ambitious L.A. loan officer with a charming boyfriend, professor Clay Dalton. Life is good until the mysterious Mrs. Ganush arrives at the bank to beg for an extension on her home loan. Should Christine follow her instincts and give the old woman a break or should she deny the extension to impress her boss, Mr. Jacks, and get a leg-up on a promotion? Christine fatefully chooses the latter, shaming Mrs. Ganush and dispossessing her of her home. In retaliation, the old woman places the powerful curse of the Lamia on Christine, transforming her life into a living hell.Director Sam Raimi returns to the horror genre in which he was known famous for. Like the previous ""Evil Dead"" films, DMTH is not a serious horror film. One can tell from Universal's very old logo during the first few seconds of the film that it's going to be a B-movie. While it does have its scary scenes, there is a nice balance of horror and comedy here. This is a breath of fresh air, considering many horror movies these days take themselves too seriously that they get laughed for the wrong reasons or that they try to be funny but fail miserably and get laughed for the wrong reasons. Either way, they both get laughed at for the wrong reasons.If you're jumping out of your skins in the first five minutes of the film, you'll know you're in for a ride. What makes the suspense, scares, and tension in here so effective, as opposed to other horror film, is the use of noise and sound effects. Raimi uses everyday household sound effects to scare us, and they actually work! And yes, this film is scary. The make-up for Mrs. Ganush is very creepy. The score by Christopher Young is also really refreshing, because it's quite original.For the humorous side of the film, it's really a horror-comedy. The gross-out visuals are disgusting, but you laugh at them anyway because of how outrageous and exaggerated they are. Actually, the whole flick is kind of outrageous, isn't it? This is what makes the film very fun to watch. You jump out of your seat but you laugh it off. This film really does bring the audience in for the ride. For example, there is one scene in which a fly flies to the camera screen, breaking the fourth wall.The performance by Alison Lohman is really fun to watch. You see her character change from someone innocent to...well, you'll see. Justin Long does decently for what he's given, although it's not that much. Lorna Raver steals the show playing the devilish Mrs. Ganush. However, saying all of this, I can't help but say that I was a bit disappointed in the film overall. Some of the jokes in here are really random and bland. Some of the pop up scenes do get tiring after awhile. Overall, it's a pretty good horror-comedy. The film promises scares and laughs and that's what it gives.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I feel like this is a return to his roots for Sam Raimi, as there are definitely some elements reminiscent of The Evil Dead films. This is like a bigger budget, less claustrophobic but still over the top Raimi gore fest, with Alison Lohman as his target of torture instead of Bruce Campbell. I thoroughly enjoyed it!

A very enjoyable B-level horror movie.,"Although the first two Spider-man movies were really good - particularly the second one -, with the third one Sam Raimi was showing he was staring to get tired of the franchise. (Although it seems he wants to redeem himself - Spider-man 4 will reportedly be simpler, tighter and more exciting.) In fact, the film was such a creative - but definitely not financial - failure that Raimi decided to return to his roots... and craft a horror film in the vein of his Evil Dead trilogy. Drag me to Hell is the result of that. And although it isn't as effective as the aforementioned trilogy, it's every bit as creepy and darkly funny as Raimi would've wanted it to be. Not a perfect film by any means, but definitely superior (in every way) to his third Spider-man movie.The film tells the story of loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), who wants to become an assistant manager at the bank in which she works. She wants this promotion not only because she needs the money and because she wants to secure her future, but also because she's wants to impress her boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), and his parents. The bank manager, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), has to decide between her and Stu, her rival, for the manager's position. One day, an old woman called Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to the bank asking for relief from a mortgage she can't pay, otherwise, she'll lose her house. Mr. Jacks leaves the resolution of the matter to Christine and she decides to be rough in order to impress her boss and secure her promotion. Predictably, Mr.s Ganush doesn't react very well and begs to Christine. She is taken away. But later, the both of them get involved in a physical confrontation which results in the old woman putting a curse into the girl's jacket botton. Soon enough, Christine is stalked by a demon from hell, so she ends up going to a mystic (Dileep Rao) who tells her the demon won't rest until he takes her to hell to burn for all eternity.If the previous plot summary doesn't sounds like something out of a cheap, B-level horror movie, then I don't know what it does. Raimi has produced Drag me to Hell like an old-fashioned horror movie, making use of over-the-top (but suitably creepy) music, super-loud sound effects, odd camera angles and a very amusing mixture of horror and comedy. When the movie works, it can be both darkly funny and shocking, but when it doesn't... well, let's just say it doesn't seem like a very good motion picture at all. The main problem with Drag me to Hell (and hopefully this won't seem like regurgitating something out of my review for Jennifer's Body) is that it doesn't know whether to be a cheesy horror comedy or a straight-forward scary story. It definitely is a million times more successful than the aforementioned Megan Fox starer, but nevertheless, there were times in which I didn't know if the funny stuff I was watching on screen was supposed to be funny, or if Raimi had failed at scaring me.Alison Lohman has been very good in previous motion pictures - her performance in Matchstick Men is almost impossible to forget - but in Drag me to Hell she's simply... forgettable. It doesn't help either that it's very hard to sympathize with Christine - granted, what she did doesn't really deserve her being dragged into hell for all eternity, but that doesn't mean she is a very likable protagonist either. Additionally, I didn't think she was particularly bright not that she had much of a personality - Christine seemed to me like a very unfinished character, someone very hard to root for in a film of this ilk. Justin Long is OK as her boyfriend, Clay (although did he really have to be surrounded by Apple products all the time?) and Dileep Rao, as the mystic, adds some gravitas to the proceedings.Without spoiling too much of the film, I can say that I definitely didn't like the ending. In a very M. Night Shyamalan-ish sort of way, the movie features a last-act twist that a.) doesn't make any sense, b.) doesn't make the movie any more interesting and c.) is very easy to see coming. The film ends on a downer that made me think everything I had experienced before was for nothing, and that made me feel disappointed towards Raimi. I know most horror movies don't happy happy endings, but I definitely wasn't expecting such an abysmal, depressing kind of twist.So why is Drag me to Hell recommendable, then? Alyson Lohman gives a lackluster performance, the movie doesn't know whether to be scary or funny, and the last-act twist is laughable. Well, these are all aspects that definitely don't work, but when the film does work - that is, when it provides with a shocks, gore, slime, dark humour or interesting plot points - it's a very enjoyable B-level horror movie. Don't get me wrong - it is a very flawed movie, but overall I enjoyed almost every minute of it until the horrible twist spoiled everything. It might not be the scariest or the funniest movie out there, but for what it's worth, it's almost an hour and a half of solid - yet unremarkable - entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me to Hell (2009) Sam raimi at a high level,"Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors working today. The way he develops terror, and often comedy, really pleases me. In Drag Me to Hell, we have a very frontal terror that puts us very close to the protagonist. The entire film is based on her visions, that is, for many moments you don't know if she is really going crazy or if it is actually happening. The horror scenes are wonderful and disgusting at many times. Some of these scenes are accompanied by a well-used humorous tone. At other times, Sam Raimi uses jump scares, which are also very well used. Some scenes do not cause discomfort or sudden fright, but the terror is transmitted from the fear that the protagonist is feeling.

"A repulsive, over the top tour de force","Christine Brown is a loan officer who, in her quest for a promotion, refuses to extend the loan of the elderly Mrs. Ganush. Unfortunately for her, Mrs Ganush turns out to be a gypsy, and as a consequence of her greed, Christine finds herself tormented by a demon, the Lamia, who unless sated within three days will drag her to the depths of hell. Thus begins Drag Me To Hell, the latest film from Sam Raimi, the director behind two massively popular trilogies. Most people will be more familiar with his recent work at the helm of the Spiderman series, but hardcore movie fans such as myself have far fonder memories of a little franchise called The Evil Dead. Incredibly bloody and incredibly silly, those low budget schlock fests are huge cult favourites, and are considered by many cine-buffs to be amongst the greatest horror comedies of all time. Drag Me To Hell is Raimi's return to the genre that made his name, and is every bit as funny and frightening as his reputation would suggest it should be.Put plainly, this movie is utterly absurd. It's being marketed as a straight horror film, but nothing could be further from the truth. Just consider the premise for a second: a demon is being denied a mortgage extension! In reality, Drag Me To Hell is a cheesy, gratuitous horror comedy filled with intentionally dodgy special effects, more gross out gags than you can shake a stick at, and, at one point, a talking goat. After the disappointment that was Spiderman 3, it's good to see Raimi at the top of his game once more; it's been fifteen years since Army of Darkness (the third Evil Dead film), but from the opening scene of this movie fans will recognize his signature campy style. The camera work is a testament to B-movies; the quick zooms and slow tilts are glorious to behold. The movie is gross hell, although in hindsight it's actually not that bloody. Instead, Raimi uses a bevy of other thing to disgust his audience and torment his protagonist – maggots, bile, flies, eyeballs – take you pick! But as well as being hilarious, Drag Me To Hell is also at times legitimately frightening. I am a big fan of classic horror, but in recent years I have found myself bemoaning the lack of decent entries in this Saw dominated era. Maybe it's just me, but I find little entertaining about watching people get tortured for two hours – it's not scary, nor is it any fun. My favourite horror films have always been a mixture of horror and comedy; aside from the Evil Dead films, movies like Child's Play or Scream or even Gremlins (that movie is PG, but it's still far scarier and more suspenseful than anything from Eli Roth). Drag Me To Hell reminds me of films like these; slow suspenseful build followed by a jump scare. It's good to see the old tropes in use again, things like shadows, the wind and thunder. At the same time, Raimi completely subverts the whole idea of a jump scare, using items like a phone or a handkerchief to provide the shock. This is not the kind of scary movie that will leave you with nightmares, but while you're watching it you certainly get your money's worth.I should point out that fans of Evil Dead will enjoy this movie on a whole other level. Drag Me To Hell is filled with homage's and references to that trilogy, so much so that many scenes could be have been lifted out and inserted directly into Evil Dead 2. Come to think of it, my only real complaint about this movie is that there was no Bruce Campbell cameo! But even those who have never seen a Raimi movie before can still have a hell of a lot of fun. All in all, Drag Me To Hell is hands down one of the most entertaining horror films I have seen since I first saw the original Evil Dead. Funny when it wants to be, scary when it needs to be and stupendously campy throughout, this film is a repulsive, over the top tour de force, and a return to form for Sam Raimi, the master of excessive horror.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Light horror,"Drag me to hell is one of the most captivating screenplay in my opinion.Performances are good
Script is quite basic but the way it has been screened is worth watching
It gets slow after the first half and before the ending, still it keeps you engaged.I really loved the ending , totally unexpected by me.I think there was scope of making it a lot more scary.Wanna watch a light horror, choose it and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disney-horror.,"Why the hell does this piece of crap have such a high rating? It wasn't scary, exciting or good in any way. And the special fx where so bad I started laughing every time an eye flew out or goats started talking. It reminded me a lot of that ""haunted mansion"" movie with Eddie Murphy in it. This is as far away from ""Evil dead"" as Sam could possibly get. The idéa is pretty good, I can always enjoy a good hex. But as soon as the effects start taking over, the film lost all credibility. the acting is good, especially the boyfriend, but still not enough to sit through the entire film. Such a waste of time and money from an otherwise brilliant moviemaker. This movie is a joke. And not even a funny one.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

comments,"I thought Christine Brown was great. She fought back and really wrestled with her options. I would love to see a sequel, but I am not sure how they would do it. Hell is not really Hell if there is possibility of escape, so a Justin Long tries to get her back sequel would be pretty grim. If she was really good, she would not have fallen victim in the first place. I thought the Hume was a little much. I prefer scary to funny or disgusting, but when it comes to horror movies where there is more to fear than just death, this is the only decent one I can think of. Raimi is in to sequels so that might be possible. Howsoever, he tends more towards the Lovecraft viewpoint than the biblical (while using his own mythologies) . I.e. there are gods and demons but none of them are nice. In Lovecraft, the only reason nice places like we know can even exist is because the universe is in a temporary state where the bad things are dead — but they will eventually revive. Meanwhile their servants are bad enough. Course, maybe Justin Long can get Tim Allen and the crew of the USS Protector to come help. They owe him one. Since Sigourney Weaver is in that lineup, the Lima would be in deep serious trouble.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stupid as Hell,"Sam Raimi is a talented man but this outing was very disappointing. Mixing camp, ooze, and horror is a delicate balance which was nicely achieved with the Evil Dead series. Here, the characters are played too straight for camp which makes the ""scare tactic"" affects of the movie out of place since most of them do not deliver even a jolt. The evil characters don't seem to be enjoying themselves which may have lent some credibility to the film's campy aspirations. Otherwise, the scares needed to be better paced in order to lend some needed dread to the events. Also, there is a big difference between nauseating and terrifying. Sick effects are just that and here induce ennui after about the third time. The result being Argento meets Disney. About 15 minutes of the film gives a thrill, but it comes too late and is then dampened by a predictable ending. 3/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: Drag Me To Hell,"This film sucks a lot. As if the mouth tends to get in the way and having stuff shoved deep into it, be it the chin or even an entire arm socked right into it. Or at least that's one of the images that got is now permanently scarred in my head. With its copious amounts of drool salivating out from mouths, extremely wet slobbering and dribbling from lips, Drag Me to Hell is erm, deliciously frightening yet funny at the same time, thanks to Sam Raimi going back to his horror roots and delivering one thrilling ride with an old school flavour to it.Raimi has shown that he has that flair of combining shock-horror techniques, and I mean really shock-horror with the usual bag of tricks of noises building up to beating crescendos, light and shadow play, and a multitude of boo-worthy moments with in-your-face nightmarish imagery, he also has this touch of humour thrown into it all, many times causing you to scream and yet laugh at the same time at the silliness of it.In between the scary episodes which were very well designed, there's this theme of self- preservation running strongly throughout. I guess anyone in the right mind, if they have to go to the underworld, would do so only if dragged there, because there's this innate need within us that automatically kicks in for self-preservation or during the advancement of self- interest.What I enjoyed about Drag's protagonist Christine Brown, is how a tough-as-nails cookie she is. I had wondered how it would have played out if Ellen Page had not left the project, but Alison Lohman, for all her daintiness, proved to be no pushover either as she really exhibited plenty of spunk and found some inner strength to sock it to her opponents when it mattered. You'll find yourself rooting for her as she sometimes turn the table around and emerge victorious, but soon enough you'll understand that the evil forces that lurks in dark corners may prove to be a little challenging for a mere mortal, especially since it comes in the form of a real battering ram.One of the better things here is how the trailer didn't spoil everything for you, leaving some room for a lot more surprises up the filmmakers' sleeves, such as the car park scene so prominently featured in the trailer, having a lot more to do in the film with the set up of the hex, that made you root a lot more for Christine. Then the special visual effects in this film didn't disappoint. Without going over the top or overly reliant on computer generated imagery, it's a visual extravaganza beautifully crafted for this roller-coaster of a ride. However on the whole, the story got pretty predictable fairly quickly, and the ending was somewhat akin to waiting for that one big practical joke to deliver its expected punchline before calling it quits. Still fun though, watching it play out as intended.Hollywood horror churned out more misses than hits with all its lacklustre remakes, more often than not of the Asian horror films, but Sam Raimi has shown the way that there's still some glimmer of hope in the genre by Hollywood if they'd stopped their reliance of adapting from others, and rely a little on their own ingenuity to thrill and entertain. OK Sam, could you get back to work on Spidey 4 now?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sam Raimi's best horror movie despite not being recognized,"It is a horror movie, but I feel it has a bit of humor and mocks haunted horror movies.Scary scare scenes appear with high frequency but full of humor.If you compare this movie with regular horror movies, it's on another level.Audiences didn't seem to like the film, but critics seemed to like it. I rarely sided with critics, but this time was different.The best horror movie I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hot button issue.,"Sam Raimi returns to the genre that first got him noticed with 'Drag Me To Hell (2009)', which focuses on a young woman who is cursed by an old woman and must find a way to save her soul before it's too late. Though it isn't as obviously comedic as something like the superior 'Evil Dead II (1987)', the picture is unmistakably self-aware and willing to be just as silly as it wants to be. Though typically subtle, an element of dark humour is certainly present and often successful. Even when it doesn't provoke laughter, it makes the affair more interesting than most other entries in the genre that were released around the same time. That's because it isn't afraid to be as overt as possible, slinging our hero around the room or having her engage in a fist fight with an old lady (which are actually two of the more down-to-earth examples that come to mind). Its outrageousness is part of its horror, making it feel much more like the sort of stuff to release in the eighties than the late noughties. It isn't interested in taking itself seriously at all; it's pulp and it knows it. This makes it a rather charming affair, in a way. That's not to imply that it doesn't have a proper sense of the macabre, though. In fact, it's more horrific than humorous and will likely gross out anyone who doesn't like the idea of things (especially slimy, gooey things) going in their mouths. The picture isn't exactly scary, but it scratches that 'horror as entertainment' itch rather well. It may not be the most compelling affair, but it's typically enjoyable and is always interesting to watch - thanks mainly to its stylish direction. It's an entertainingly self-aware affair. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
SUPERB return to horror for Sam Raimi,"I just got back from rehearsing it at work! What can I say except AWESOME! Sam Raimi returns to the horror genre with a BANG! this is by far his best film since Evil Dead 2. He has hit a perfect balance between scares and laughs, just like he did with ED 2. This film feels very much like a cousin of the ED trilogy. I haven't been so tense watching a film in a long time, there are some seriously scary moments in this film, then some genuinely funny ones, in true Raimi fashion. It's brilliantly shot, paced and acted! I for one will never p**s off a gypsy, you can count on that! I'll be honest and say I did expect it to be a bit more ""insane"" from all the over the top reviews I'd read, but I don't know if my heart would have lasted the full 99 minutes if it had been. Poor Alison Lohman's character, she really doesn't deserve the horror she endures in this film, she really is a sweet, kind woman. Which makes it all the more insane when she starts to suffer at the hand of the evil Lahmia (spelling????) that comes for her soul! I did see the ""twist"" coming a mile off though, and everyone goes on about the ""stella"" ending, I found it a bit weak considering, but I guess it was only meant to be a ""1 last scare"" thing, when I wanted mayhem! LOL. Either way, I cannot wait to see it again, without expectations, as I believe I will truly fall in love with this film when I do! Raimi is the man once more, and shows Hollywood just how to make a fun horror movie! Make sure you all head out and watch this, take friends, it will be a great ride in a full screen with your mates!****1/2 out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

She doesn't even look sad, and didn't regret for what she did. But,she cares about goat xD

"You'd be surprised what you'll do, when the Lamia comes for you.","I gave it a fair look, but the fact that it was nominated for a Teen Choice Award told me that I would have to be prepared for disappointment.

I watched the unrated director's cut, but I have always found that to be a scam.The Pork Queen (Alison Lohman) should know better that try and tackle old crones (Lorna Raver). They tend to get cranky and hate losing. Some garbage about shame. It must be a gypsy thing.There are a lot of spooky noises and plenty of disgusting goop that teens love, but there is nothing that would give lovers of Raimi's earlier films any worry.

Too cheeky to be scary (but fun anyway),"I'm writing this review after my third viewing of Drag Me to Hell. I guess I've finally 'got it.'After seeing it advertised on its release, I was under the impression that it was meant to be (really) scary. Therefore, when the credits started to roll, I felt severely disappointed. This is NOT scary. It is however quite tongue-in-cheek - which I should have really guessed, seeing as it was made by the producers of the Evil Dead franchise.It's about a girl who gets cursed by a psychotic old gypsy woman, who damns her to hell unless... well, you have to watch it to see what lengths the poor bank-worker will go to to save her soul. This film, although grotesque in places, is far from frightening. It's more designed to make you laugh and throw-up at the same time.Don't take it seriously. Just get some mates, some beers and some popcorn and enjoy it for all its daftness (and ALWAYS be nice to gypsies if they want an extension to their mortgage).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Go See It!,"Well....this movie is something different...sort of.'Drag Me To Hell' is a very interesting movie. Thrills, chills, Sam Raimi, creepy old women, curses.....all of the stuff you just heard has been done in movies before, but not in the style it's done here in this film. I struggle to call it cliché, because it is and isn't at the same time (which sounds stupid). Well, let's basically say that it uses clichés in a different way. For example, the creepy old woman does haunt Christine Brown, but is as physically strong as Christine. Usually the old woman would just follow her around, but she doesn't just do that. She torments her. Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi have in a way, twisted the clichés to make a fresh film. I don't know about you...but I like it.At the screening I went to, everyone went crazy for the parking lot scene. I think I know why. It's funny in a way, but you're not laughing at Christine Brown, you're laughing with her. This is more a fight scene than a you-have-no-chance-of-escaping scene. It gives you a new image of horror, by mixing it with other elements and genres. I personally loved how the director (Sam Raimi) thought well there's nothing holding me off from killing a child, so why not? He's a free-spirited filmmaker. GENIUS! The movie keeps you thinking and leaves you saying ""oh if only she did that"" or ""she shouldn't have ...."". This is what good thrillers and horrors should do. The PG-13 rating didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. It was creepy, even without the R-rating.GO SEE IT! You'll have fun and be creeped out at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sam Raimi returns to what he does best,"Sam Raimi, for those who've never heard of him, is a cult director. To general audiences, his Spider-Man movies are probably the most recognizable, but to his hard-core fans, the ultra-gory ""Evil Dead"" flicks (in which a sarcastic everyman battles malevolent spirits) are the best.With ""Drag Me to Hell"", Raimi returns to what he does best. This movie is certainly a lot more refined even than ""Army of Darkness"", but no less cool. True, it follows typical horror flick formula - bad thing happened several years ago and a remnant of the horrific event is terrorizing people today - but I just love the sorts of things that Raimi is willing to show here (I would hate to have to be Alison Lohman's character in some of those scenes). ""DMTH"" is destined to become a horror classic! Also starring Justin Long, David Paymer and Adriana Barraza (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's maid in ""Babel"").",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good movie though there were some silly scenes,"I thought the opening scene of the kid swallowed by the floor was very poor and ridiculous and the movie remained boring for me until the old lady comes to the bank. Starting from here, I guess the movie began attracting me. I liked the very idea of casting this old lady (she was a perfect cast for the role). The car scene between the old lady and the loan officer was also a classic and pretty much was the master scene of the whole movie. Then comes the scenes where she kills her cat (that was really funny) and the scene when she visits her boyfriend's parents at the table, that felt more of meet the parents than any horror movie.I easily guessed that the coin was mistaken for the button. Actually from the very beginning of the movie when she gives him the coin as a gift, I told myself that the coin will have a lot to do with the plot.Not a very good movie but a good and should see one as the movie comes with a new idea : an old lady cursing a loan-officer for taking her house away from her. The idea doesn't promise a lot of horror and I don't think of the movie as a horror movie but it has the minimum.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"If you love the Evil Dead trilogy and Sam Raimi, welcome to heaven!","Just got back from the cinema after seeing this! As a huge fan of the Evil Dead trilogy and Sam Raimi i was obviously very excited about seeing this film! I was not at all disappointed! Part of me was slightly worried when I heard about the film because part of me thought ""After all these years doing Spiderman can Raimi pull it off again?"" After watching the answer is simply yes.The film blends genuine shocks and scares with an enjoyable plot and Raimi's trademark black humour. You will jump out of your seat and then laugh within the same scene.Lohman's character in the film is also a very likable heroine, a refreshing change to the usual teens thrown in the film JUST to get killed. You felt for her character and were completely gripped in her struggle. She was backed up with great performances from Lorna Raver as Mrs Ganush and Justin Long as her boyfriend. You feel Lohman is Raimi's new Campbell in this film, a fresh actress which he can chuck anything at and torture all she wants and she'll keep going.I'll stop now to avoid spoiling the plot but if you like Evil Dead and Raimi then this film is pretty perfect!

"Well, can't you at least gently pull me in the general direction, then?","Unrated Director's Cut. Christine Brown(Lohman, trying her darndest to imbue the role with some measure of personality... to no avail, both leads are dull and forgettable) has a nice life. Her boyfriend is... uh, well, a Mac, I think(or at least, she has one... and he has a Smartphone. And the producers think you should, too). Actually, no, he is introduced unable to fix a printer, so I guess he's a doctor(...I love Justin Long, although I think he should stay away from this kind of work(he never seems to fare well in them...), but not sure I buy him as that). She's a loan officer, and she may get a promotion! Ah, but to beat out the just-hired(get it? It's a... joke... and no, they're pretty much all that uninspired) Stu(who I think is the Joxer of modern times... no, I don't know why they didn't just give the role to Ted) for the job, she may have to make a tough decision. Or she'll have to choose whether to grant a third extension on a mortgage payment. Of course the answer is no. Bounds of reason! Whazzat? We're supposed to think that's awful? Oh, we're reinforcing the old stereotype about bankers cheating people out of their money. I guess we should just be grateful she's not a hook-nosed Jew. Anyway, this means an elderly female Gypsy will be evicted, and she choose to curse our protagonist - no, with a demon, not with colorful language... after all, this is a PG-13 film. This is a pretty polarizing one... critics love it(it would appear that they anticipated Mr. Evil Dead's return to horror so much, they'll take anything), a lot of viewers hate it. Sam Raimi is clearly more invested in the copious amounts of bodily fluids(blood is only one of them...) than the characters(who are evidently mainly there so he has someone to throw into walls(though our hero shrugs that off surprisingly well...), get bile on and get embarrassed... and that's the comedy(hey, if you like it in his other efforts, I suppose you may, here, too)), and that's of course his call(as long as he accepts that if he gives us nothing substantial to chew on, we'll forget this soon after watching it... and that's precisely what happens). However, he tries to have his cake and eat it too by trying to capitalize on our sympathy for the them that could have been there. The ending is admittedly grim... and as a public service, they warn you ahead of time, by telegraphing it. FX are a genuine positive, the CGI looks real and is so well-integrated, you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. The major problem here is that the shocks are nearly all, with hardly any exceptions, jumpscares. Yes, an obvious ones, too. The sound gets really low, then, BAM! Something gets in your face, the volume gets cranked, and that is supposed to be terrifying, rather than merely obnoxious. This is 94 minutes long without credits. There is a lot of violence and disturbing content as well as a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the recent string of unwanted remakes that have plagued this genre. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gruelling and Tedius,"I must admit I was categorically disappointed in Raimi's efforts herein. I have seldom walked out of a movie, but we left this about 45 minutes into it because it never got GOOD. All the best parts were in the trailers, and the effects were laughable. You can see wires, ill-timed stunts, and have your gag reflex triggered for free, so there's no reason to pay good money to see this. Our theater offered us rain-checks, which we gratefully accepted.I will say that the story is quite compelling, and if it is released on DVD in an extended R version I may give it another chance, because hopefully, they will clean up the final proof and make this something WORTH seeing. Honestly, though, I'm not sure that's even possible, as the acting was as bad as (if not worse than) the effects. I'm not sure an extended R version would actually save this.All in all?

A pleasant surprise,"I really enjoyed this film - it was nothing special, but was a very pleasant break from the run-of-the-mill splat-feasts that have haunted my local multiplex of late ... one point that I really appreciated, (although this may only be the case of the UK cut) - there were very few swear words used ... in fact I can't even remember 1 instance of bad language other than the word 'bitch' which I don't really consider to be bad language - well done to the film makers for not resorting to the lowest common denomination.The acting was appropriate, the script was plausible there were only a few small holes that were easily brushed off.Lorna Raver's performance as Mrs. Ganush really stole the show with quite a few good 'Ugh' moments of repulsion that should frequent a film of this sort.I was filled with hope early on with the obvious Gypsy influenced violin score, but was disappointed that it was not utilised more with the filming to create more tension.I'm very much looking forward to the next good horror that I hope this will inspire",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Off The Wall,"If you're anything like me, then you remember the good old days of Betamax. If you're quite like me, then you knew of an old video rental place that would hire 'video nasties'. If you're just like me, the first one you got your hands on was The Evil Dead.It was the stuff of legend - the horror movie that most parents wouldn't let their teenage kids watch - under NO circumstances. Perhaps it was the demonic voices. Perhaps it was the pencil scene. Perhaps it was 'that scene' involving the tree. Who knows. Nonetheless, we got to watch it anyhow - and boy did we rave on about it when we did.Some 28 years on (yes, I know) and it is still considered (and rightly so) as one of the best horror flicks the world has ever seen. Then there was Evil Dead II, which was just as good but with a little more humour, then Evil Dead III which was just as good again - but this time completely off the wall.And I guess you could sum Raimi up like that - a little off the wall. He loves to scare you witless, then make you laugh a little, just before scaring you out of your seat again. So when I heard rumour that he was 'going back to his roots' with Drag Me To Hell, I licked my lips in anticipation. Despite several attempts to watch this in the theatre, I never got the chance. Nonetheless, I have finally managed to watch it on DVD - the question is... what's it like?Well, fans of the Evil Dead franchise (if there is such a thing) will be squealing with delight over this outing. Imagine that Betamax was still in your living room. Imagine that little video store was still open for business and imagine the guy who works there just hired you a copy. Sit back and prepare to jump more often than a cricket for the next couple of hours.The look and feel of the movie is very much that of an age gone by - it relies on the simpler vehicles to get what it wants from the viewer, namely misdirection, REALLY loud noises and the now trademark 'Raimi Slant' camera angles to create a feeling of vertigo. There is a nice combination of CGI and prosthetic work here, but sadly no plasticine (if you know, you know).There is plenty of viscera - be it blood, maggots, bile or other unknown, unearthly liquids - and it makes for a whole lot of fun. The humour that is sadly lacking in some of Raimi's later outings has returned with a vengeance here, he clearly has missed grossing people out and then making them belly laugh right after.The acting is deliberately confused and dizzy, and the backdrops are straight out of a 50's horror movie - you almost expect Cushing or Karloff to walk out onto set at any moment. The overall feel is that of impending doom at every turn and it doesn't give the viewer a moment's rest from the outset - which is something I have personally missed in horror films of late. Did I mention the soundtrack and effects - sheesh...And so to the plot. What plot? Who cares! This is a SAM RAIMI movie for goodness sake! Girl gets cursed, chaos and madness ensues... THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW! Yes you'll see the end coming, and yes you've read the script before you've heard it - but I am not rating this movie on it's 'artistic contribution' or 'aesthetics' - I'm rating it on the basis that it really does do what it says on the tin - and that is scare the bejeebus out of you!So, a final note to all horror fans out there - if you haven't caught a viewing of Drag Me To Hell yet, I advise that you do it - NOW. If you wondered what all the fuss was about with The Evil Dead series, but are a little wet behind the ears - double march to your local store pronto.And finally to Mr. Raimi (if you're reading) - please, please, PLEASE make more horror flicks and show the pretentious wannabes that claim the throne these days how it's REALLY done.Enough of my yakking. I rate Drag Me To Hell at 8.1 / 10 - and that is a meaty score for a meaty movie. Awesome stuff!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
You Shamed Me,"Sam Raimi's dark comedy-horror work is always been praised. After directing Evil Dead franchise, he went for superhero genre. Everyone thought that he might not return for the genre for which he is famous.

The blend of dark comedy and horror is just perfect like Sam's previous works. The acting part needed improvement as the performance by the actors was not effective. The movie will surely scare you as the pacing is perfect, movie is neither slow nor rushed.Overall, if you are a horror fan you should definitely give it a try. You will love it.Sam Raimi delivered what could arguably be viewed as his best film of his entire career with this 2009 supernatural horror flick ""Drag Me to Hell,"" one that sees the filmmaker operating at peak powers and showing every single one of his strengths outside of a superhero film. Being the last great effort from him in a director's chair, he fully embraces the campy, goofy, and insane nature of this premise as we watch Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) be cursed by Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) after she doesn't give the elderly woman an extension on her home loan and what follows is a life of hell as Christine is haunted by said curse everywhere she goes. The character is given no breaks whatsoever as her life goes from bad to worse even after going to see a psychic (Dileep Rao) who warns her of what she must do to rid herself of the curse, and Lohman is excellent as a heroine easy to root for but someone who makes a grave decision that literally and figuratively comes back to haunt her and her boyfriend in Clay Dalton (Justin Long) does everything in his power to support her as he just wants the best for them in their relationship. The film is a truly vomit-inducing one as the practical effects mixed with the VFX make for some gross and disgusting moments of blood, eyeballs in cake, and corpses even down to Mrs. Ganush having her teeth fall out on many occasions, but the true greatness comes from the undertones of eating disorders, mental illness, and fate that never takes away the fun from the film and Raimi robs you of a happy ending as the final shot is a devastating blow that leaves your jaw dropped.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not scary, You can laugh at it","Good use of graphics, and direction is good. But it lacks the atmosphere. The ghost face were made more colorful. Its not scary at all... The procedure involved in calling the ghosts whatever, those scenes were made more funny than scary.. So, it is not scary at all. And i had to talk about racism. The movie shows an Indian ghost expert, who in one of the scenes was seen using his saliva to close the envelop cover, that is a kind of showing how Indians generally do. This is inappropriate and racist. So, having said so many cons of the film, i weigh it low for obvious reasons, NOT A SCARY FILM, JUST MADE IT.. Kindly watch the film, only to figure out why it went bad in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag me to hell horror?,"I rank the film among the average moments, the film seemed to me more like a horror comedy, certain passages of the film were more of a laugh than to be afraid, but despite certain shortcomings, the film did not bore me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Hurts,"I almost cried at the end of the movie. That's 99 minutes of my life... gone; completely wasted. I once broke a steering wheel with my chest in a head on collision. That was less painful. I would sacrifice a kitten, a goat, and an old gypsy to have the memory of this movie erased from my mind. All in all, I wouldn't recommend watching this one. The evil dead movies and other campy 80's movies like it were okay... this wasn't. Sam Raimi's kids should be kicked in the nuts for this creation. Just my humble opinion. I need a line and a half to finish this review, so I'll add that I really wish I could rate this less than 1 star.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror fans will like it,"No doubt, Drag me to Hell took me and my wife on an interesting horror ride even if its not our favorite genre. What I liked was that the running time was not too long and the story never boring because of the mysterious demon and ghost theory. There were in my opinion too many bloody horror elements but also some funny scenes. Sometimes it was really too disgusting. The atmosphere and the scenarios were well adapted to each sequence and Sam Riami directed excellent as in The Gift. Then the end lets all open for a sequel. The actors Alison Lohman and Dileep Rao did an outstanding job here. Bravo. 6/10.If you liked it I recommend both parts of The Ring, The Skeleton Key, The Amityville Horror or Hide and Seek.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Finally, American horror lightens up and goes back to the infamous days","Outside the golden gates of Hollywood Sam Raimi, best known for the Spiderman trilogy, is something of a horror legend. He originally gained fame for his openly grimy and dirty video nasties, which soared into the ranks of cult status. But now, after a hiatus of 15 years, he has finally gone back to his roots with the eerily delightful Drag Me to Hell.The simple story of Christine Young, a lawyer who is cursed by a gypsy, seems somewhat formulaic, but to me I find it is purposely so. It's frank use of stereotypes and corny economic messages provide a quiet underlying chuckle throughout the film. My favourite example is in the title, as poor Christine has four days to break the curse or she will be dragged, kicking and screaming, to the red-hot bowels of hell.During her journey, every imaginable horror device is utilised magnificently, intensified by thrillingly creative visuals. One sequence depicts an eyeball lodged in cake, with the jam and cream as the blood and pus. All this supplies a rich tone and novelty to what is considered a dated and exploited genre. The traditional and overstated score is almost of parody of sorts, with harsh, sudden screeches from violins adding an extra few centimetres to that jump in your seat. Because, believe me, there are many noteworthy frights to be found in Drag Me to Hell, some straight out of the horror textbook, some unique and bizarrely humorous. Refreshing, aptly concise and damn-right original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sam Raimi has been reborn!,"Drag me to hell is nothing but a horror film mixed with drama and a little bit of comedic violence. I was expecting nothing much from this film but what I got in return was something more satisfying. After hearing that Drag Me To Hell got positive reviews at Rotten Tomatoes (92%) and various other sites, it sparked an interest in me. I had the choice of buying this or Inglorious Basterds but I chose DMTH.After evicting a old woman from her home, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), becomes the target of a supernatural curse released upon her by Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver). Now she has to undo the curse along with the help of her boyfriend and a medium and maintain peace in her life from the ""Lamia"".The horror in this film is superb and the séance scene is absolutely terrifying and funny but can Drag Me To Hell live up to Sam Raimi's other work, that is nothing but The Evil Dead series, and the answer is obviously no! The gore scenes are often funny and that is a fantastic mix of genius. I always knew Sam had it in him. The only actor that amazed me was Justin Long. If you guys take all that supernatural crap then this movie is not meant for you and you'll probably miss out on a treat!4.5/5.0",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

a true waste of my time a very poor film,the title says it all and after watching this junk thats where i would rather be. despite what anyone says it was advertised as a horror and thats what it is a real horror to watch. if its a comedy or meant to be funny then where are the funny bits. the rating of 8 made me have to register and comment rarely have i seen a film this bad and i watch a lot of films. the jump scenes didn't and the build up was non existent there was no tension whatsoever and i was surprised that anyone could make a film this unscary my 5 year old could do better. from start to finish there is next to no special effects and nothing new at all my rating of 4 was very generous. for mainstream viewers avoid this like the plague for die hard horror fans its maybe your sort of film.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad for a comedy/horror,"This is mostly black comedy with very little horror or suspense in it.

Either you hate it or love it. (or really liked it like i did),"Okay i saw this movie when it came out in theaters and i liked it. It was a true refreshment cause all the other movies coming out where freaking haunting in Connecticut (blah) obsessed (ewwwww)the uninvited (okay) the unborn(disappointing)etc. not a lot of horror movies around the best of the bunch was this onebut i saw it again, and posted on facebook how much i really liked it and said it was a great horror movie for a pg 13 movie, and people start saying how much it suckedthe effects sucked ass, the ending was stupid, the whole movie wasn't scary, but just gross, i expected more.my defense to it was: the effects were pretty bad, but the atmosphere was put there very well, the boo scares where a little more than boo scares, the demon actually did something to the main character than boo scare her and disappear (Cough nightmare on elm street 2010 cough) the demon slapped her face around, threw her everywhere, tormented her with freaky images and sounds, gave her nightmares and hallucinations to hype her paranoia.then i went to this website and saw how many people hated it, and i read a bunch of them, and now, i'm not really sure what to say about itare they people who expected hardcore horror from a pg 13 horror flick? where they disappointed because Bruce Campbell wasn't there? or is the movie really freaking bad!so after reading the opinions of others, i'm with a question in my head. what makes a horror movie good or bad? i thought the acting was decent, there actually was some character development, things happened for a reason, every decision has a point (except a few minor exceptions)some things where over the top, some where actually creepy, and though it was long, it had enough things going on to entertain me.so, after this long, review/ self thought on how i should rate this igive it a 8 out of 10 it's freaking good",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rollicking, scary fun","Director Sam Raimi undoubtedly reached the biggest audiences of his career to date through his work on the ""Spiderman"" franchise. However, in the Eighties, his work on the ""Evil Dead"" movies assured him a place in that elite Valhalla reserved for masters of horror. After years away from the genre, ""Drag me to Hell"" is renewed proof that few filmmakers posses his ability both to terrify an audience and then have them in convulsions of laughter- while reminding them that nobody can outrun their conscience.The plot is pretty straightforward: Christine (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer who has been told that she needs to show toughness in order to secure a promotion that she covets. Hoping to win points with her boss, she refuses an elderly Gypsy's request that her mortgage be extended- causing this obviously ailing woman to lose her home. The old woman wreaks a horrific revenge by uttering a curse that unleashes the Lamia- an ancient demon that torments it's victim for three days before taking their soul to Hell for eternity. Christine is then subjected to increasingly terrifying manifestations of said entity (invisible to everyone but her)and enlists a medium to save her from damnation, but time is running out...The plot moves along at a cracking pace and there is no shortage of genuinely scary and shocking moments. However what really makes this film a joy is the mischievously surreal humor that permeates the whole enterprise, for example when a demonic eye appears in a slice of fruitcake. All in all, this is a terrific horror film that has no problem scaring it's audience while staying in touch with the idea that movies are all about having fun. Top-notch entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid Popcorn-Horror,"A solid piece but of course compared to Mr. Raimi's real horror masterpieces, the Evil Dead movies, Drag Me to Hell is rather a simple mainstream experience.

"""Hell"" of a Good Time","I will start this review off with one simple fact: I love Sam Raimi. I remember staying up late at night as a child watching the original ""Evil Dead"" through the corners of my fingers. It scared the hell out of me but, at the same time, there was something genuinely gratuitously amazing about the film. It was bold, bloody, filled with puss and maggots, and gore. It was incredible. If the nine year old me at the time could have married anything, it would have been The Evil Dead.After the Evil Dead trilogy, Raimi pretty much stayed away from horror (not including the excellent and sorely underrated ""The Gift""). That is until 2009 when Raimi splashed his way back into the scene with ""Drag Me to Hell."" I'll be the first to admit that I had no desire to see ""Drag Me to Hell."" PG-13? Yawn. Ancient spirits? Double yawn. Justin Long? I think I'm falling asleep already. Little did I know what I had coming.The plot is relatively simple. Determined to impress her boss and get a much-needed promotion at work, Christine Brown lays down the law when mysterious Mrs. Ganush literally comes begging for mercy at her feet. In retaliation for being publicly shamed, Mrs. Ganush places the dreaded curse of the Lamia on her unfortunate target, transforming Christine's life into a waking nightmare. Her skeptical boyfriend, Clay, casually brushing off her disturbing encounters as mere coincidence, Christine attempts to escape eternal damnation by seeking out the aid of seer Rham Jas. But Christine's time is fast running out, and unless she's able to break the curse, she'll be tormented by a demon for three days before literally being dragged to hell.What follows is gore, gore, and more gore. How this film was granted a PG-13 I'll never know. A waterfall of a nosebleed, gooey dentures, dancing goats, maggots...if you can imagine it, it's here. The film works as a social satire (the death of the middle and lower classes) and as a horror/comedy (the ritual at the end has to be seen to be believed). The performances are top natch and the ending is quite ballsy in its conviction (you'll see it coming a mile away but will be surprised they actually follow through on it). Overall though, if you love movies like ""The Evil Dead"", ""Army of Darkness"", or ""Cabin Fever"", it's a must watch. It is one of the best horror films of 2009.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Return of the Horror Classic...,"I confess to not being a Sam Raimi(sp) fan. I don't dislike the guy, I'm just not familiar with his work. But I do enjoy a good film, and am a fan of Alison Lohman (hard to be believe she once used to be a recurring actress on the WB of all places...see Safe Harbor). So I went and saw this film.I like a good frightening horror movie as much as anyone else does. More so because this movie didn't rely on an over convoluted plot, buckets of blood and is likely not to spin off five or six follow up films. Drag Me to Hell horrifies and scares the old fashion way, through a simple story and plays with light, shadows and the surroundings of the characters like films did before the writers/directors all worked to out do each other with every succeeding film.I also have to give special props to Alison Lohman as the films lead. Would have normally expected someone more ""beefier,"" but enjoyed her because of her smaller stature and more innocent vibe. She came across willing to fight/do what it took to survive, while never coming across as a one woman army. Exuded being average like most of us, not extraordinary.Shame there likely won't ever be a sequel. I know, I know what I said above about horror sequels. But I think Alison could pull off the girl returned from hell... Just a thought.KB",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't disrespect an old Gypsy woman who begs for mercy,"An ambitious loan officer at a bank in Los Angeles (Alison Lohman) wants an imminent promotion above her rival and so makes the ""tough decisions"" by refusing compassion to a desperate aged borrower. Big mistake. Justin Long is on hand as the young woman's beau.""Drag Me to Hell"" (2009) marked Raimi's return to the overdone comic book horror of his ""Evil Dead"" flicks after achieving blockbuster success with the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy. While unpleasant in ways since it deals with the assault of an evil spirit, the lamia, it's all-around superior to the first two ""Evil Dead"" movies (I've never seen ""Army of Darkness"").A critic who hated it claimed that it had no message. Whether people appreciate what the flick has to offer or not, it does have a message amidst its exaggerated comic booky thrills. A pretty glaring one on the surface along with interesting details if you go a little deeper.Lohman is winsome on the feminine front while Bojana Novakovic has a brief but notable role as the old crone's granddaughter.It runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles & areas nearby.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A waste of time,"Okay, so all I have to say is that it was interesting enough to keep me watching, but I'll watch anything if I'm really that bored. And trust me, I was really bored.I watched the unrated version on DVD and just... I wish I had never even looked at the cover of that movie. It was the worst thing I ever saw and I really did not need to see a woman kill her cat and then a man spit the cat's dead body out of his mouth or a dead woman's eyeballs fly from their sockets and into another girl's mouth. Just, no. It felt like they were just trying to make the movie as horribly disgusting as possible. I mean, I enjoy horror and I find movies like Saw fascinating, but this was just horrible. It was predictable, the characters were almost totally flat and you wouldn't care if the heroine was dragged to hell or any other place.I wanted to puke while watching this movie several times. And that's a rare occurrence for me. So take this as a warning and don't watch this movie. EVER.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Fresh, despite cliche'","A no spoiler review by Pittaz. Didn't expect that ending boys. But overall quite impressed with drag me to hell. Despite the cliche horror movie concept done many many of time, ""oh no I'm cursed, how do I break this curse"". It felt fresh and was done extremely well. It had my attention the whole way through. Although I can't help feeling like it almost felt rushed. I wanted to see more of the main demon who I felt only made an appearance a few times throughout and could of been fleshed out a lot more (as we are used to seeing from movies such as the conjuring series) As the ending drew near and Christine was faced with a moral quandary, and ofcourse realised the right thing must be done no matter the cost (as all movies do) what was unexpected was how the ending played out. Man that ending a thinker a real spanned in the works. Also loved the art style and the classic Sam Raimi ""evil dead"" grossness and gore. Especially that yellow puss produced from a main character. Overall easy 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Confused,"Good movie. Definitely worth a watch. The confusing part is I didn't know if it was supposed to be horror or comedy. It was corny in places, a very Bruce Campbell's Evil Dead esque type movie. The acting was very b-movie which made it more enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The goat and the machete,"I won't pretend to score critical points by suggesting this is pretty silly material. But is it scary? I'll sleep well tonight.It does have style. Taking some of the elements (stylistically and thematically) from Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" (that's a compliment), we're amused to see an ugly duckling already transforming into a swan. It's more amusing still that she's a loan officer and is faced with a dilemma: Should she deny an extension on a mortgage payment and earn points with her boss or should she give in and extend it to basically do the right thing?She makes the wrong choice and really pays for it. Alison Lohman serves the material well because she's someone we see as both vulnerable and growing into her own.The honey-colored cinematography, the almost camp skewering of quite a few California ""types,"" and a pretty good group of actors is wrecked—for me—by the intrusion of incessant loud noises that startle in the first 60 seconds, then become very unwelcome because they fill in for what could be/should be deeper development of character and plot.And for the record, in horror movies you can't just make up rules on how to break a spell. Okay, a stake through the heart of a vampire is something you can rely that the audience doesn't need schooling on, but anything else needs to be either presented at the beginning and the characters need to accomplish (or not) that very thing. It's lazy (and it's cheating) to just make stuff up as we go along. We lose interest and any investment in what happens if the rules keep changing as the movie proceeds.The kitten thing was actually funny, but I worried about the goat. I wasn't scaredjust worried.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very Very Overrated,"Alright, I'm a horror fan. Not just a casual horror fan, but more of a horror fanatic. Not just your average fanatic, really a connoisseur of horror. I remember my first viewings of Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness. That was nearly sixteen years ago for Army and even longer for the others. I was a fan, but in the genre of horror, I really didn't think those stood the test of time. Overrated films, but still light years away from that Hollywood crap and Hollywood remakes of classics and foreign masterpieces. Either way, I was both excited and apprehensive when it came to Drag Me To Hell. There are many things in horror that you learn to overlook; such as continuity and acting. Yes, both fall short in this film. The continuity is actually dreadful in some scenes, but in the big picture, those can be forgivable. Perhaps the biggest problem with this film is, dare I say it, the direction. The writing surely didn't help either. A few jumpy scares and a decent premise, but that's not enough to save this film. It's worth a viewing for a horror fan, but please don't praise it like the rest of these casuals and fools. This film is NOT a classic and is NOT a great horror film. Hell, it's not even really a good horror film. Raimi did not save the horror genre in Hollywood, it's far beyond saving. Looks like Raimi's spent too much time with the boys in the 'Wood, because it shows in this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Guys and gals, let me tell you something; I do not often praise someone's onscreen performance, but David Payner was at his absolute best here. His performance made us forget we were watching a movie at times. Without including any spoilers, he had one scene that was bloody marvelous to say the least. He has great supporting actors and actresses as well! The main characters do a great job of telling the story of loss, tragedy and hardship. We've all had bad days. While watching this movie, you begin to realise your worst day probably wasnt as bad as Christine's worst day. This is one touch chick! I spent the entire night fact checking this movie after watching it seeing what awards it won in its day because I wanted to make sure it recieved the critical acclaim I knew it deserved! It didnt win any and it's an absolute travesty. To conclude, you're going to want to follow Christine on her journey.

Where's Bruce Campbell when you need him?,"I suspected as much when I saw ""Spider-Man 3"", and it's been confirmed with ""Drag Me to Hell"": Sam Raimi has forgotten how to make fun movies. This is not an easy thing for me to admit, as I have been a Raimi fan ever since I first saw ""Darkman"" in college at the Texas Union theater.When I heard from numerous critics and fans that ""Drag Me to Hell"" was Raimi's return to his early style, I bought my ticket enthusiastically. Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was misplaced. The unabashed silliness that made the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and ""Darkman"" such fun to watch was seriously muted. Instead of the over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek acting styles of Bruce Campbell or Frances McDormand, we get Alison Lohman and Justin Long in the lead roles, both playing it straight. This wouldn't be so bad if they weren't such mediocre actors.And instead of the comic-book-style dialog that I have come to expect from Raimi's films (especially now that he is best known for the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy), the movie treats us to stifling discussions about mortgages and bank policies, and a serious debate between a psychology professor (Long) and a fortune teller (Dileep Rao) about the respective merits of Freud vs. Jung.But the real disappointment is that there was no splatter! When I see a Sam Raimi horror flick, I expect various body parts to be severed and lots and lots of blood. Instead, this movie settles for an off-screen animal sacrifice. The only truly funny part was at the wake for the evil old crone (Lorna Raver as Mrs. Ganush was the only actor to get into the spirit of things). And the only truly scary part was the séance near the end. The rest of the film's horror set-pieces rehash what was done before (and better) in ""Poltergeist"".Judging from ""A Simple Plan"", ""The Gift"", and the non-FX parts of ""Spider-Man 2"", I know that Sam Raimi can do serious drama as well as anyone else. But when I see his name attached to a horror flick, I expect ultra-violent, unapologetically goofy fun. And Bruce Campbell! 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
drag me to hell - dragged us through viewing hell,"a laughable, predictable attempt at horror. we came across the movie with no knowledge of what it was about but the title gave us high expectations. to say we are disappointed is an understatement. the events were predictable and the horror was weak. there were too many cheap shock tactics trying to make the viewer jump. the story line was not a strong one to begin with. the actors were not up to the characters. the gore did not look remotely real considering technology available in this day and age. one member of our party took it upon themselves to hit the fast forward button on the remote many times to reduce the time we had to sit through the movie. we thought it was laughable and we seriously thought it was a parody. it would have been better served as a comedy/horror but it wasn't that funny either; but actually it could have been.it was torture to watch this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Drag this movie to the toilet and flush,"Is this the best story line Hollywood can come up with? A gypsy curse? Is that supposed to be original in some way? Why is it that gypsies always have the power to kill people and curse people to death but can't seem to pay their bills on time or go to the dentist? This movie made me realize that Sam Raimi is one of the worst directors of all time. He's made one half-decent movie, The Evil Dead. The other two in the Evil Dead series were totally stupid, with a couple of funny lines that caught on in the cult film world.Evil Dead 3 was total garbage. People want to make the Evil Dead series more than what it is, which is just plain bad. Spiderman sucked as well.Anyway, back to this piece of crap. So this gypsy lady with a very fake accent can't pay her bills, even though she has a clan of relatives who appear later on at her house having a party. Her false teeth fall out, but when she goes to put them back in, you can see the actress's REAL TEETH right before the cut. Then, after stealing a bowl of candy, she begs for a break on her loan even though she's already proved herself to be a deadbeat and an actress with a really terrible fake accent. So who's fault is that? The loan officer, of course. And she deserves to die for doing the right thing! And this is basically the outline for this horrible pathetic excuse for a horror movie.Then, the Mexican lady wants a shot at the demon. She's been waiting to confront it for many many years. It's been her life long goal to confront the demon that is now after the loan officer. She will risk her life to get this demon, and wants to be paid 10,000 dollars to do it! What? If she wanted the demon so bad why not do it for free?This sets up the totally stupid and done a thousand times holding hands around a table and then the floating dancing guy during comedic music (evil dead crap.) So that doesn't work and suddenly the Indian guy tells her to give the button to someone else. Why NOW? Why not when he first found out about the stupid button curse did he not reveal this tidbit of info and save a few lives in the process? And what happened during the nose bleed scene? When blood shoots 30 feet out someone's nose, coating the room and a few people in blood, do you call an ambulance or act like the person had a paper cut? Oh, let's not forget the constant shooting of various liquids into the loan officer's mouth. Constantly. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE! Plus the inserting of an arm and some eyeballs into her mouth as well. What kind of perverted weirdo directed this movie?How does it end? Well, the loan officer, who is dating that ass-head 14 year old PROFESSOR who drives a PRIUS (the liberals got that right) gets dragged to hell after buying a new coat. Why did she need that coat so bad? I'm sick of thinking about this pile of crap. Do not watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
well done for what it is,"I am not, as a general rule, a horror movie person, and I decided to watch this one only because I'm a big fan of Raimi's Army of Darkness. But of course, that was a comedy in a horror-movie context, which is something quite different.Drag Me to Hell falls somewhere between Army of Darkness and The Evil Dead, a movie I did not like at all (I can't remember what I thought of Evil Dead 2, but my vague recollection would be DMTH is closer to that).The movie is a fairly standard horror movie story with some solid scares and some of the comical yet still creepy horror scenes Raimi is known for. It's not my type of movie, as I say, but it is entertaining.However, the ending is incredibly lame. You know, if you've ever seen a horror movie before in your life, that the ending is coming near a half hour before it arrives, and because it's a stupid, predictable, unoriginal ending, it is extra frustrating to not only have to sit through it but to also have to sit through so much time expecting it. I realize this movie wasn't aiming for an original story, and was content to just deliver cheap scares and comedic horror, but I still just dislike it.But then, I'm not a horror movie person.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poltergeist on steroids,"Saw a late showing of Sam Raimi's ""Drag me to Hell"", and what can I tell you; mediocre.I honestly can tell you, I don't think I can trust IMDb ratings anymore after seeing this! as of to date (June 01/2009) it has a rating of 8.3! How?? I can see this having a 6.5. My local theater rated this at 6.9, and I shunned them on having such a low rating...now I can maybe see why.okay so...the main thing that bugged me the most on this movie was the cheap CGI effects. Mr. Raimi should have either spent a lot more time/money on the effects or had non at all.. I don't know..maybe thats not how it works anymore.The other thing that bugged me was Alison Lohman's performance....oh god, did she ever do an awful job. Yeah shes cute, yeah her character looked like a perfect fit for her role, I just could not stand her in this movie...can't be to specific.I'm guessing Mr. Raimi had seen the scare maze video on you-tube a bit too many times. Don't get me wrong, the scares in this are good, but they regulate on loudness. I'm talking about, coming out of nowhere and being VERY loud. If someone were to watch this with lower or moderate volumes, you would not get the same effect as in theaters.So we will see when this comes out on DVD, and the rating drops, perhaps I am way off though and generally did not think it deserves over a 7 rating.I will say that it was a very nice change from all the gore-fest remakes that have been spewing out of Hollywood lately.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Raimi uses his popularity to sell us this weak work.,"This was not, I repeat, NOT a great movie. Okay I'm exaggerating a little here. Shouldn't have used the word ""great."" Let me try again: This was not, I repeat, NOT a good movie. Ahhhh, that's better. I like Sam Raimi's work enough although I'm not a very big fan. I really think he enjoys a semi-cult-like popularity that leads some folks here to close their eyes on the many flaws and write positive reviews about this weak Raimi offering.There are several very big problems here. The main one starts with the unconvincing performance of Alison Lohman playing the protagonist Christine Brown. I have not seen her in a lot of movies but if I have, her work must have been as forgettable as this one.Miss Lohmann comes off as a B-actress with very little range here. In many scenes I could have sworn they had just called her to the set as soon as she was done memorizing her lines. Those lines came out of her mouth just like a junior-high student trying to pass an oral exam by only memorizing from the text book instead of actually learning the topic.Miss Lohman should not take all the blame for this, though. Her character is so unbelievable that when she has her first sequence of violent spirit activity in her residence she merely shuts a door and goes back to her normal life. After the third or fourth such evil-spirit violence she calms down enough to go out with her boyfriend and talk about how nice a night it is! The writing is very weak and feels rushed. As if the script was written in one Saturday afternoon. The dialogs are so lame that I'm not sure if even Meryl Streep could have made lemonade out of it. Justin Long who does a good job in those MAC commercials looks like he is having a hard time keeping a straight face with this script.To be fair the individual set pieces are somewhat effective and in a couple of occasions even somewhat scary. But this is far too rare here. The Cheapest way filmmakers try to scare you is with gore-galore. The second cheapest, in my opinion, is when you are give sudden loud ""scare"" scenes designed to make you jump from your seat. While Mr. Raimi keeps the gore to a reasonable level he profusely relies on sudden shock shots to scare you.Ah yes, there's a third cheapest scare tactic and it's not so much a scare tactic as it is a make-you sick tactic. Bloody vomit is really passé but Mr. Raimi does not let that bother him. He also serves us saliva-soaked yellowed dentures, corpse vomit and a host of other yuks. That stuff worked for ""The Exorcist"" because it never felt like the director was feeding it to us just because he could. It does feel that way here.And oh yes, what was up with the boyfriend's parents? Imagine caricatures of Greg's parents in ""Dharma & Greg!"" At least that show was a sitcom. Were these characters even necessary? If so, why not flesh them out better? The whole sequence with the parents felt like another cheap attempt to fill five or ten minutes of this flick. Too bad.I gave this movie two out of ten on the IMDb feedback scale. The only thing that saved it from zero was the set pieces that managed to work. And that's not all of them, mind you.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reminds me of the 1957 classic,"I note that a lot of reviewers liken this to The Evil Dead Movies but to me this has borrowed the concept from the 1957 black and white classic ""Night of the Demon"", a film crying out for a modern remake! (Please, please, please!)
Most of the ""shocks"" could be anticipated as the script had telegraphed them in advance and much of the acting appeared ""wooden""!

"A clever throwback: A good, old-fashioned time at the movies","Over the past decade, I couldn't help but notice that Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson have been following very similar career paths. Both started out directing zero-budget, hilariously schlocky and highly stylized horror films, eventually upgrading and by the turn of the century directing big-budget studio-produced fantasy films. Jackson lent his unique vision and style to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, while Raimi's Spider-Man films featured a fascinating combination of low-budget horror sentiments and stylistic choices with enormous-budget production values. Now, after he finished his original Spidey trilogy (and before moving on to the upcoming sequels), Raimi went back to his roots and delivered a good, old-fashioned schlocky horror entertainment. And boy does he deliver.Unlike the two Evil Dead sequels, this film isn't a straight-up horror comedy, although it is quite hilarious. It's not a parody, though, and doesn't feature visual gags or jokes or anything like that. But rather, it just features scenes and concepts that are so over-the-top, one can't help but to laugh. In fact, this film can be seen as the exact opposite of ""modern"" horror movies: those films push the gritty realism of the situations they depict (even if they are usually nothing more than cheap torture and gore), while in this film, Raimi makes a point to emphasize the mythical, fantasy element and how over-the-top it is. By not taking itself seriously, the film leaves itself room to basically do whatever it wants, and stylistically, it really feels like a throwback to a more old-fashioned style of horror entertainment. It's not even that intense a film – it's rated PG-13, features no nudity or gore (but it does feature a lot of gross-out scenes featuring various insects and liquids) and most of its scares come from its sound design and editing.Speaking of the sound design and editing, the film is a technical wonder. Because it's so stylistically over-the-top, Raimi has the freedom to do what he wants with his camera, and the film features some really well-shot and well-crafted scenes and sequences that greatly intensify its sense of style. Probably the most inspired technical element of the film is its sound, from the brilliant sound design and effects to its pounding musical score which is also one of its biggest throwbacks to an older-fashioned style of film. The performances are also top-notch; good casting choices led to actors who don't phone in their performances but rather invest a lot of effort, both physical and emotional, into their roles, and the results are most noticeable. Alison Lohman particularly stands out, and she's also an underrated favourite of mine so it's great to see her get meaty leading roles like this one. Justin Long can be absolutely hilarious when he wants to so it's still strange for me to see him in completely straight-guy roles such as in Live Free or Die Hard, but it actually works in this film.Ultimately, what makes this film work so well is that it never takes itself seriously. Raimi uses the best stylistic flourishes at his disposal to lend it an atmosphere and feeling of an older and more classic type of horror film, a film that isn't really scary at all (except for a few jump-out-of-your-seat scenes which are just part of the throwback) but one that works on a purely entertaining level as an old-fashioned good time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Waste of money, stay at home or watch something else. I wouldn't even rent this one. Will someone please destroy the negative so it can't be copied?

This is what I hoped the Evil Dead Reboot to be like,"People's criteria for judging a Horror movie often make about as much sense as the rules inherent in the the mythology of the franchise. It often ends up being subjective to the time and place in the person's life and can easily contradict what was applicable before or afterwards.I remember seeing this movie shortly after it came out, when all I really had in mind to compare it to was Raimi's original Evil Dead trilogy. At the time, I wasn't very impressed, especially given its PG-13 rating. But, now that there are two additional Evil Dead films (both of which I consider total garbage because they are devoid of the humor present in the originals), I decided to give this film a 2nd chance. Honestly, I wasn't disappointed this time because it still managed to retain the original, shall we say, ""spirit"" of the Evil Dead films without being part of the franchise. It has a number of absurd moments that I find quite funny, although some of the jokes are at expense of the Romanis (pejoratively known as Gypsies), which probably offends some people.This movie is definitely not for everyone, but more for people with a warped sense of humor that don't mind a story involving ""bad things happening to good people."" It's no substitute for cinema on par with Casablanca, The Godfather, or The Shawshank Redemption, but it's certainly an enjoyable way to waste a couple of hours, provided that you are part of the niche audience that can enjoy this sort of movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me THROUGH Hell,"This movie was downright awful. The scenes were predictable, not at all scary and i even found myself laughing throughout some of the scenes.

The acting is mostly bad, and the main-character I just find not worthy of such a bad role. I saw all of the good ratings, and I must admit i was waiting for something visual and horrifying - but all it was to me was just a laughable comedy.

Heaven For Horror Fans,"In my perspective this is probably the most flawless horror movie ever made. The movie does what it’s supposed to do: horrify the audience and instill fear in them even after they have left the theatre. It does follow some guidelines of a horror movie of its genre like including a fortune teller, a séance and some gory scenes (that have enough of a kick to make you disgusted but keep your eyes fixed on the screen.) I have to say that even after reading the entire storyline and knowing what will happen in each scene I was surprised with the amount of jerks I got when I watched it. The acting of Alison Lohman has its peaks and valleys but Justin Long and Lorna Raver did a top notch job in executing their roles. The twist in the end is almost Hitchcockish but you will be shell shocked while exiting the theatre. The direction is absolutely amazing leaving you wanting more and more after every scene.

Whatever sympathy one may have had for Mrs. Ganush is quickly extinguished when the creepy old lady attacked Christine and put a curse on her.

"I get the horror part, but I didn't see much comedy","(This review may contain Spoilers) Before I start, I should let you know that I have never seen the Spiderman Trilogy, or the Evil Dead Trilogy, so I am unfimiliar with Sam Rami's work.I bought Drag me to Hell at Wal-mart remembering that I had heard great things about it, calling it one of the best horror-comedy's ever made. Was it? Well, the short answer is, no. One reason, it wasn't funny. I get that it was supposed to be campy, and there were a few humorous parts, but overall, it just wasn't the laugh-out-loud comedy I was hoping for. Two things really ruined the comedy for me. One was the death of the kitten, I mean come on, a kitten, that would be if the movie stopped, came to you, and hit you in the stomach. The second was the ending, I can't see the funny in a nice woman being dragged down to Hell, to burn for eternity. Just to be clear, she never did anything wrong, and she is being punished with everlasting pain and suffering. Unless they make a sequel with her being a stripper, or being whiner to the devil, I can't see it ever becoming a comedy.But it definitely works as a horror film. So if you want to watch Drag me to Hell, I suggest not expecting many laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi WILL NOT fail when he makes a horror movie. That is a promise.,"Intro: Sam Raimi is back to the horror genre with this scary and quite humorous tale of demonic proportions.Synopsis: Christine Brown is a loan officer for a local bank, when she denies a very scary gypsy's mortgage claim, forcing her out of her house, she is cursed to be sent to hell in 3 days time. (yes even scary monsters have tax issues) Review: The difference, for me, between the Evil Dead trilogy and Drag Me To Hell is that Evil Dead made me laugh and entertained me. Where as Drag Me To Hell made me laugh and genuinely scared me. Sam Raimi makes a great composition of eerie camera shots and borderline disturbing imagery. A great jump on horror for a PG-13 rating. Another reason it was good is because it kind of brought back that classic horror movie feel, and had a lot of originality, something that is hard to find in the horror genre these days. Now somethings that kind of got to me were some of the more comedic scenes. A lot of the scary parts had humorous parts in them, and there were a couple times where it took away the scare for me, still however entertaining. As far as special effects, well I'm not sure if they had a lot of money for some of the CGI or what the deal was, it's nothing that would ruin the movie for me.I think the real winner in this one though was the bone-chilling score, which was flawless. It is truly amazing how much a musical score can set a terrifying mood.Also very good performances by both Alison Lohman and Justin Long",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The editing was poor and the plot laughable. Justin Long's character has literally no clue what is happening the whole movie - really? Also, the nonchalance by which the female star goes about her 'duties' is poorly executed. What is good in this film are the supporting cast members - that are better than the so-called 'stars'.

Groovy.,"This is the Sam Raimi that made the Evil Dead films. After holding back for the last decade, he really lets rip with the OTT camera-work and gross outs. Once the plot is established, he steams from one set piece to another with barely a pause for breath. It's amazingly suspenseful. You WILL jump. It's physically impossible not to with the volume of the shock cuts, but Raimi actually delivers on the creepy visuals to accompany the jump, which instantly elevates it above the cheap-scares of a typical modern horror flick.Alison Lohman and Lorna Raver really kick the crap out of each other. The séance scene is AWESOME. The make-up and practical FX are fantastic. The CG is good for the most part, although there are a couple of dodgy moments.

Wear Ear Plugs to this Movie,"Here's how to perfectly recreate Drag Me to Hell in your own home. You will need a drum set. Get a friend. Pick a quiet room and take turns sitting with your back to the drums. Have the other friend randomly smash the cymbals and drums every few minutes for an hour and a half. Startled much? Congratulations, you've just watched Drag me To Hell, or at least felt what it was like to sit through it.For scares, that is quite literally all this movie has to offer. There is absolutely no subtlety to the horror. Instead of taking what could have been a movie with a rich lore and storyline, Sam Raimi chose to make Drag me To Hell into a ""jumpfest"" that relies on lots of overly loud music and sound effects. Sam, things that are loud are not scary - like jet engines - they are simply obnoxious. And for that matter, rusty gates that are creaking, and annoyed goats do not even have the capacity to be as loud as a jet engine. Did you know that, Sam? Apparently not.Initially, the PG-13 rating was a red flag for me, but I thought, it's Sam Raimi doing another horror film. I should trust him. Perhaps it's more psychological than anything else. After all, it is about an evil spirit that terrorizes its victim for three days before it takes them to hell. What an opportunity for a smart horror film! Sadly, my trust was misplaced. This movie tries to get some of its scares from gore, but ultimately fails, because it's PG-13 Gore. It's pretty easy to watch and pick out the parts that should have been R, but were obviously toned down to keep a more summer friendly audience in the seats. Too bad, really. Most of the effects end up coming off as fake, and oddly enough, done with CG when they did not need to be. Like when Christine gets dead old lady gunk splattered on her face in the shed. How hard is it to just splatter someone in the face with what looks like dead old lady gunk?Ultimately it all felt like a rehash of some old concepts from Sam's Bruce Campbell heyday(Christine wrestles with an evil handkerchief much like Ash wrestled with his evil hand). Unfortunately there is no Bruce Campbell to be found, and the handkerchief is done in CG(how hard is it to just hand someone a handkerchief and say, ""Wrestle!""). Like everything else in the movie, it just comes off as lame.And in case you were wondering if the plot is a ripoff of Steven King's ""Thinner"" - yes. Yes it is.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag me...to see this again!,"'Drag Me To Hell' is a god-damn good film, floating in a sea of horror plagued with sunken Hollywood remakes, and it also gives a revitalising kick to the comedy-horror genre.Christine (Alison Lohman) is told to make the 'hard' decisions in her job at the local bank to seal a promotion, and the weathered old gypsy Mrs Ganush (Lorna Raver) is the unfortunate victim of this selfish act of personal greed and capitalism. But, she gets the last scratch (laugh, ruler, bite...) as she places a Lamia curse upon Christine. In three days she will be dragged into the depths of hell by an unspeakable evil force. What follows is a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat, over-the-top, suspense fuelled ride (reminiscent of Sam Raimi's early Evil Dead films) through ninety-minutes of scary, disgusting and at times quite humorous (anvil, anybody?) scenes that make 'DMTH' an enjoyable and impressive film.Raimi does what he does best, by allowing the surroundings to come to life – the rattling of doors and windows, the use of shadows – he takes a hold of the age old cinematic device of keeping the vision and display of the Lamia at bay and allowing our minds to fill in the blanks. A perfect example is a scene in which Christine is tripped in her own bedroom by the forces beyond. How can you combat, defeat or avoid something if you don't know what, where or who it is. The tried-and-tested common horror conventions coupled with the slick editing of Bob Murawski (who virtually creates and sustains the menace of the penultimate scene), a solid central performance of Alison Lohman (who now knows the dangers of refusing a loan extension!) and the knowledgeable direction and experience of Sam Raimi makes 'Drag Me To Hell' one of the fair few horror films worth the admittance fee.This film is nothing new, and nothing different. You will notice the subtle nods and homage's through the humour and disgusting inventiveness of Raimi to the various films of the same veneer in the 1980's and the early 1990's, but what makes this film stand-out is that it ticks all the right boxes in audience expectation. It will make you jump, keep you tense, release a giggle and squirm a little, and most importantly: it is fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Guess what? It not originally from Japan or a Remake.,"When I first heard of this movie, the title told me what I wanted to know. With the grade A pieces of crap ""Horror"" movies in 2009 such as Friday the 13th or The Unborn being released, I had little interest to see any horror film in theaters, and Drag Me To Hell sounded like it would be like one of these movies. Needless to say I didn't pay attention to the movie, and can't recall even seeing a trailer on T.V or looking for one on the internet. Eventually however, I saw that Sam Raimi was making this film. I have known of Raimi's work ever since I was smaller, but being a bit young to see it in theaters during the time of Evil Dead's release, I eventually saw them when I was in my early years of 10 and 11. I remember sneaking in to see my brothers watching Army of Darkness at 6 however, and being scared ****less for weeks. Now, with a bit of fresh nostalgia to motivate me, I decided to research this movie. I was surprised to find it holding a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, and decided to wait and buy it on DVD, my hope that it being critically acclaimed and coming from Sam Raimi would provide a brilliant horror movie. And it did. When I finally saw Drag Me to Hell, I was blown away. I must applaud Raimi's work on this original concept that certainly ranks itself among films like The Exorcist or A Nightmare on Elm Street. So now, lets begin the breakdown shall we? The Story takes place in a suburban Los Angeles where the films opens up to a slightly disturbing set of scenes in the mid sixties that establishes some character plot and to give us our first look at what Hell has in store for the cursed. It then takes us straight from the action experienced a few seconds before into the opening credits. I particularly thought the score for this certain part of the movie was incredible and quite eerie, while giving us some background on the accounts of demons in the old times. We then meet our main character, the brilliantly played Christine Brown, who is a loan officer for a bank, and as we all know she gets in some deep **** with an old gypsy woman who pleads for an extension to pay off her debt or her house will be seized by the government. Christine gets cursed for she doesn't give the old bag her extension and we have our movie begin its chain of events. The story gives us characters who become deeply scarred, and the process in which Christine's life get absolutely destroyed is portrayed perfectly horror wise. The séance room scene without giving much away is one of the eeriest parts of the movie. Its combination of dialogue, music, and images spread out through the entire scene worked out perfectly to develop the character of pretty much, Hell. Drag Me To Hell scared me, but not in a scream fest rather in a smart form, by clever camera angles combined with scenes of the monsters and demons we have in the film. So much could have gone wrong with this, but it all played out effectively. Michael Meyers for example, never popped up and screamed, most times you just saw him appear. People didn't say Halloween scared me because of the pop up moments; they say it scared me because of Meyers. Same goes with Freddy Krueger, he just talked and it creeped you out. When you hear the Lamia talk or see Mrs.Ganush it has that sort of effect. It's creepy and scary, but you're not jumping out of your seat when you hear it. There are a few pop out and scare you moments but don't feel cheap or out of place at all. In the way that they are used, they contribute well to the pace and horror aspect of the movie. Then ending I will also add, is one of the best parts of the movie. Its not prolonged as neither is the first one in the beginning (This will make more sense after you watch the movie) and its just ends leaving us to think, and actually think of what really happened to the character. It's not real, but in the movie it is and in that sense it's pretty intense. Closing Comments: The effort and brilliant screenplay is proof in the finalized product. This film isn't supposed to make you laugh in my opinion, but I did find some of the scenes offer some comical lines, but again they did not feel out of place and never broke the horror feel to the movie. There were times throughout the movie when I would think ""Sam Raimi is the only one who would write that."" Those who don't understand Raimi's style of horror films will find this movie unenjoyable because it isn't the cheap stereotypical high school kids/hot girls with a mildly scary slasher movie, where there are at least two sex scenes to keep the college kids attention. Horror movies have become a social object for older and younger kids to bring their friends, to get cheap scares and then talk about it for weeks. Subsequently directors and producers create terribly put together pieces of pedestrian **** to please them, but really only to please their own wallets. If you are one of these movie goers odds are The Eye or The Grudge would be more your kind of movie. Raimi didn't make this film for those people, and clearly kept fans in mind and doesn't disappoint. If you want to see a thought provoking brilliant sound track and visual image combination of a movie that is intelligent and one of the best true Horror films I've seen in years, you'll find your Michael Meyers with Drag Me to Hell.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me to Hell - A Bit of a Drag,"After all the hype surrounding this film, I was expecting a good old-fashioned reel of celluloid madness in the '80s horror tradition, and instead I got a contemporary cop-out. I remember when I first saw Sam Raimi's Evil Dead flicks. The trilogy is an exercise in camp, which is acceptable on the grounds that none of those pictures were intended to truly be horror movies. Bruce Campbell's comical turn as Ash Williams,a hapless defender against satanic zombies that somehow infest a backwoods cabin, is entertaining and even inspiring (plenty of E.D. knock-offs ensued) but far from horrifying, and minimally suspenseful. Back then, the aim was to cheese, and to cheese with a marked lack of substance so self-indulgent that eventually, two decades later, cinephiles would come around to the simple genius of Raimi's grime & slime vision.It was on the foundation of Raimi's subsequent directorial works, combined with the slew of positive reviews surrounding Drag Me to Hell, that I walked into this flick expecting real scares. After all, Raimi is capable of fine craftsmanship - A Simple Plan was probably the most underrated film of the '90s, just ahead of Renny Harlin's The Long Kiss Goodnight. But Drag Me to Hell pales in comparison to both those pictures. Somewhere along the way (I suspect while making Spiderman) someone convinced Raimi that CGI special effects were a suitable replacement for, well, actually filming something.Drag Me To Hell suffers very early on from the sort of CGI baloney so commonly seen in PG-13 ""horror"" flicks these days. An opening scene where an unimportant character is quite literally dragged to hell losses all impact for one reason and one reason only: we're allowed to see it. This fatal error, based it seems on the cinematic canard that seeing is believing, carries itself through the entire film. Which is a shame, because this movie seemed to have potential for real, down-to-earth horror elements. Alison Lohman as the ordinary, petite blond Christine Brown turns down the disgusting Mrs. Ganush, played convincingly by Lorna Raver, and sends the hag away without a third extension on her mortgage payments. From there I hoped events would crescendo to real horror proportions. They didn't.Instead Raimi somehow meshes visually unconvincing CGI with actual film footage (see the scene in the parking garage) and lets Mrs. Ganush reappear in those sporadic flashes we've all come to expect from movies that rely on the audience's jumpiness when there's a deficit of actual thrills. When all the ""gotcha"" moments pass, all that's left are a handful of painfully mediocre scenes between Lohman and her boyfriend Clay, played unimaginatively by Justin Long. Throw in an over-cooked seance, which is probably the only part of the movie that directly hearkens back to The Evil Dead - you'll see why - and all that's left is the promise of more poorly-conceived CGI effects, and Justin Long placating Lohman's redundantly terrified, two-dimensional character.Drag Me to Hell is rated PG-13, and although there are times when that rating is stamped on an R movie for marketing purposes, this isn't one of them. Consider the rating a warning. Raimi might have been better served to study another film from the '80s, one that eschews the usual demon formula for an eerie old woman. It's called The Woman in Black. It doesn't have a single frame of CGI. And frankly, it's 100 times scarier than Drag Me to Hell.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yes!!,"This movie was the most fun I've had at the movies in a really long time.Mr Raimi has definitely redeemed himself from Spider-Man 3 in my eyes. I had a premonition that this movie was going to be good, but it was nowhere near what I expected.It's not profound on any level, so you better leave those notions at the door. It's crude, revolting, and loud.As a big fan of Army of Darkness, I was pleasantly surprised and had a blast. This film is not a true horror, but a fun one. It really is a popcorn movie. Take a bf or gf, or better yet, go with a big group.There's not much else that can be said about this film without spoiling it.Suggestions to the public: Don't decide whether or not to see this movie based on reviews. Don't read any threads about the film's subject matter. Don't eat anything really heavy prior to seeing it.Again, don't expect anything profound, or even serious. Plenty of ridiculous and disgusting images and scenes await you! We went to see it early and there were only a handful of other people in the theater, but everyone was screaming and throwing their hands up in disgust and shock!The best spent $30 in a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A young woman's act of cruelty summons demonic forces to torture her.,"This review contains a Spoiler about the movie, that I make in hopes of countering a popular criticism of the film. Knowing it will, I believe, help many people enjoy the movie MORE.(Spoiler commences in the next paragraph).Before I say anything else about this movie, I have to make a comment about what other reviewers have said about the film, and correct a general misinterpretation of the film. I made the same misinterpretation when first viewed it, but on reflection, (which a rewatch confirmed) I realized that what many people describe as a ""gypsy curse"" is in fact a demonic curse, and nothing to do with the gypsy woman at all. Raimi in his interviews has emphatically stated that the character of Mrs. Ganush is the victim in the story, and the way he shoots the parking lot scene, and the reality-bending events that happen there, indicates quite clearly that Christine is already haunted by the Demon, and the thing in the parking lot is NOT the pitiful old lady who was begging her for mercy in the bank. Thus, all the reviews that claim Mrs. Ganush is a villain are quite wrong, and do Raimi's masterful film no service. Later in the film we see multiple examples of demonic ""Ganush"" appearing, and we know it's the Demon in her form, so why believe that the thing in the parking lot is the real Mrs. Ganush? And more importantly, this means that the ""curse"" is just a trick of the demon's. Christine damns herself by believing in this ""curse"" and in her descent to further depravity, including her final horrible crime against the REAL Mrs. Ganush at the end of the film. The Parking Lot creature is an exaggeration of the aspects of the real, pitiful, old lady that Christine found repulsive.What is brilliant about the film, for me, is the way Raimi tricks the audience into believing the lie along with Christine, and sympathizing with the choices that damn her at the end. People who call this a ""comedy"" are truly off the mark ...this is a deadly dark horror film ... just because it includes an anvil gag doesn't make it a comedy, since the anvil gag is clearly constructed by terrifying supernatural forces. It's not a cartoon if it's constructed by Demons to torture you.I did not see the original Evil Dead films, so any references to those films were lost on me. I prefer it that way, since I enjoyed this film as perfect by itself, without the distraction of referencing.I have gone back and seen this film 4 times in the theater now (though I did wait for Bargain Tuesdays and a Matinees). It really is beautifully constructed and shot. A real honest to god FILM. If you pass up the chance to see this in the theater, you really have missed a treat, because Raimi really makes use of the whole screen. (Note Clay's reactions in the background during the reading of Christine's fortune .... Justin Long does incredible work in this).My only quibble with the film is that, while Raimi pulls a great deal of subtlety out of Allison Lohman (as Christine), I feel her acting fell down slightly whenever she was required to show real anger ... when required to be truly angry she didn't really pull it off, but I saw what Raimi was going for, and it still worked. Brilliant film. Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seriously Entertaining,"I enjoy the horror genre but have for quite a few years now been disillusioned by the horror films i've seen. Most modern horror films i find are predictable and unoriginal. However, Drag me to Hell was a surprising change to the norm. i found it to be engrossing and very atmospheric whilst having a touch of humour reminiscent of Raimi's Evil Dead series that ensures that Drag me to hell doesn't take itself too seriously while still managing to be pretty damn frightening. i can't remember being genuinely scared by any horror film in my adult life but this film s#*t me up on many an occasion.Entertaining, engrossing , just a touch amusing but bluddy frightening!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ridiculous, long, boring drivel! Worst movie I've viewed in years!","Well, I'd first like to say that I've had an account on IMDb.com for many years and have voted on many titles, but never have I actually posted a review for a movie until now. But I felt the need to really get this off my chest.""Drag me to hell"", pardon the pun, made me feel like I was IN hell for the 1 hour and 39 minutes in which I had to endure it. There were many times where I wanted to just walk out of the theater but did not, thinking that ""Sam Raimi has never made a bad movie, it will get better"". Well, it didn't. It just kept getting worse.The musical score was uninspired and sounded like a knockoff of ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"", the ""special effects"" were ridiculous, the writing was shoddy and copied far better ""gypsy horror"" genre films, such as Steven King's excellent ""Thinner"", which I'd recommend you see if you want to get a good idea of a gypsy horror film done properly. The acting was unconvincing and it was sad to see someone from a great series as ""Sliders"" reduced to this crap. I shall not give away the ending but suffice it to say, it really puts the final nail on the coffin on what could have been a good movie. Instead, we are left with an at times boring, ridiculous, cheap ""scare"" bore-fest.I don't understand what other people see in this movie, but Evil Dead this was not. Shame on you, Sam Raimi.

"Trite, Dull, Predictable","I'm astounded by the number of people proclaiming this film a masterpiece. It lacks suspense, engaging or fleshed out characters, pacing, or surprise. The entire film played out as expected by twenty minutes into it.I began to be worried by the opening sequence. When literally anything can happen in a world created by a film, it's rarely very exciting or interesting when it does. It's much better to use a little more restraint so that when a large supernatural moment occurs, it really packs a punch. As it is, we're given everything here, including the kitchen sink, so the whole movie feels repetitive and uninspired. There seems to be no rules for all the things that occur--matter and objects acting on the film-maker's wishes, rather that acting in accordance with the world created by the story itself.I guess I'm old school, but I find a film like ""Rosemary's Baby"" a million times more interesting than this juvenile drivel. Fantasy and dark fantasy are interesting genres, but they have to have emotional weight and multi-dimensional characters to make them worthwhile. As it is, this film is simply an exercise in style over substance designed to appeal to the junior set.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A perfect example of a sub-par script executed by exalted directors, a failure.","To put it bluntly, this film's script is terrible. So terrible in fact, that I, someone who NEVER voices his opinion about anything on the internet, actually took the time to register on IMDb and voice my disappointment in this lacklustre film.Since the inception of early horror films, there have always been excessively corny pieces of work. Bad horror films are as bountiful as snowflakes in the arctic circle, and much like snowflakes they are usually uniquely interesting in their own way. This film however was like a bad regurgitation of all the time-worn horror failures rolled up and packaged as a possible 'clut classic' via. the Raimi namesake.What makes the three 'Evil Dead' films 'good', to spite the fact that they are unbelievably corny, is their witty scripts. Things like the humour and pushing the boundaries of the cliché horror films of the day are what makes them classics. This film however, has no interesting points to the script whatsoever, it is plain Jane, mass produced, Hollywood garbage.The frights are all too predictable. You get the feeling that you've seen this film already a thousand times. The classic horror score warns you of the impending ghoul popping out of the dark, this time with absolutely terrible CG graphics. The most entertaining part of the film was when it reminded me of Evil Dead Two, with the marionette possessed with the puppet-like movement. I was half expecting it to scream 'DEAD BY DAWN, DEAD BY DAWNNN!', and if it had, the film would have got another star from this reviewer.Acting in horror films is not supposed to be good, hell, its more entertaining sometimes if its absolutely horrible, but in this feature the unimaginative script will make you want to turn the film off. PG-13 horror films MUST rely on innovations in the genre to really 'scare' people (i.e Blair Witch Project, JU-ON). R rated films can use the innovative violence and gore to propel itself to cult classic status. This monstrosity unfortunately has neither.Terrible flick, IMDb rating is skewed by Raimi brothers die-hard fans, don't believe the 'hype'. I am an Evil Dead junkie and this turd does not cut the mustard. Who writes this garbage and how much do they get paid? Something this unimaginative was probably written by some computer AI in a pentagon basement. It was crap wrapped in a 18karat gold foil, bottom line.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

The worst movie I have ever wasted money on!!,"My wife and I went to see this movie during opening weekend. We spent $14 per ticket, and of course my wife had to have candy and popcorn and a soda, another $20. We get into the movie and watch the previews. I usually judge the movie I'm going to watch, based on the quality of the previews. The previewed movies were awful and the movie began. The beginning was pretty interesting and honestly it had potential. Well, then the scene were she is fighting with the old lady in her car. This scene went on for 20 minutes (it felt that way) and grew cheesy and cheesier with every moment. This movie is not scary, funny, or entertaining at the least.

Almost brilliant.,"Let's start with what's good. The movie very strongly portrays Californian culture, Gypsy culture, and Indian culture. All of these things offer a unique and cool atmosphere that isn't similar to many other films, especially horror films.The movie is funny, and it's also very terrifying. Most of it is serious and ominous, with a creepy presence seeming to stalk from behind the camera. On that note, the directing is excellent, too, with unsettling tilting and intimidating points of view.Now, some bad things. I love funny horror films, and a lot of the humor in this was great and fitting, but the problems arose, for me, when Sam Raimi forced comedy into scenes that could have been much more sinister. Most of the big scares were intense and legitimate, but the car fight and the séance really could have dropped the humor; it simply made them good, rather than great.Now, the Lamia's two attacks on Christine in her home, the cemetery scene, and the twist ending were brutally dark and exhilarating. Their suspense and theatricality pushed the entertainment value through the roof.But here comes another problem. The twist ending was made obvious way before it happened, and that made it just slightly annoying. Viewers don't need to be spoon-fed. But still, it is executed in a way that lets the movie sink its teeth into your heart, that shock is just a little diluted with an eye-roll from the viewer.The movie also tries to cram in too many gags and scares for its run- time, making the pacing seem a bit rushed and odd.All these flaws hold Drag Me to Hell back from masterpiece status, but finally I can say that they don't hold it back too far. Not too far at all.The atmosphere, the acting, and just the bizarre craziness of this film, mixed with its sinister, theatrical scares make it absolutely awesome. It's just a roller-coaster of fun, and it shouldn't be expected to be anything else. If you want a night of thrills, chills, and laughs, go ahead and pop it in.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a horrible movie; Sam Raimi is one of the worst directors of all time,"First of all, the plot was just dull. A cursed woman has to make a difficult decision, there's a talking goat, and a medium speaking Spanish (as if it's supposed to make the movie seem a lot more scary that it actually is). In essence, this movie is typical of Raimi's work: cheesy and fruitless. On the positive side, the picture was great and the music was decent. The acting was simply too facetious and bad (which I don't think at all meshes well with a horror movie setting). The dialog was also pretty poor. 1/10. Don't see it. Watch something else, like Session 9, The Blair Witch Project, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, or A Nightmare on Elm Street. Anything would be better than this garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the BEST horror/comedy films I've ever seen in theaters!,"Okay, as I am writing this, I saw this movie over a month ago in theaters but never got to writing a review. This movie I saw in a COMPLETELY empty theater, no one in there but me. The movie from start to finish was thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat. However, it did have me jumping out of my seat and screaming a few times! Christine Brown is a wonderful and well-acted out character played by Allsion Lohman. Allison portrayed Christine as a character that was smart, witty, funny, and courageous. I really got into her character. Justin Long plays Clay, Christine's boyfriend. His acting was very good and he is the ""I can't believe it until I see it"" type of person. Lorna Raver plays the scary Mrs. Ganush. Lorna Raver's character was well-acted and VERY frightening! This movie had so much suspense, great acting, awesome writing, a GREAT plot, and awesome jump scenes! The jump scenes were a little much, but they weren't weak like in ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" these made me jump and scream!

Sam Raimi has a special talent for horror.,"The horror genre is slowly losing respect amongst people who take films seriously, I can confidently say it is because of the absolute nonsense they try to pass-off as cinema these days, with its cheap scares, smutty sex scenes and mind-numbing plots. But Sam Raimi might be the saving grace of this sinking ship as he has brought it back to basics. This film is perfectly crafted with a plot a child could understand but still entertain the most refined of movie goers. I enjoyed every character of this film, as they were all portrayed with skill. The scares are credited not to a loud slamming door or a sudden din of orchestral shrieks but to brilliant special effects and a mystery to the evil which lurks through this film.

Her boss tells her that she must be able to make tough decisions in order to advance. An old Gypsy woman asks for an extension on her mortgage and Brown turns her down to impress her boss; big mistake, as the Sylvia puts a curse on the young banker after attacking her in the parking lot and removing a button from her coat. That night, a spirit haunts her and she has nightmares. The next day she has a nose bleed and shoots blood all over her boss.Brown visits Sylvia's granddaughter and learns that the gypsy has died the previous night. The medium has bad news; a demon named Lamia will be visiting her for the next three days, and then will take her to hell. Apparently, the little devil enjoys sacrifices, and so while Christine is being beaten, she kills her kitten.The psychic wants $10,000 to remove the curse, and Christine gives him the cash. Another seance, this one involving a goat, is held, but to no avail. Lamis wants Christine's hide, refusing all offers of appeasement.I will not give away the ending.

Perfect blend of horror and comedy,"What this movie is, is a perfect blend of horror and comedy. The horror parts really will give you chills and make you be on the edge of your seat. Some scenes can even get creepy to the point you just want it to be over with but enjoy the intensity at the same time. Sam Raimi who is the director did a great job with the ""Evil Dead"" series and he does it again with ""Drag Me to Hell"". I make a reference to ""Evil Dead"" because it has similar elements but different setting and plot. The story is about a girl that gets cursed by a very old gypsy woman and thus the girl gets tormented by the curse and lot of terrible and vulgar things starts to happen to her. And while this is going on she does whatever she can to beat the curse and she is a character you can't help but feel sympathetic for. And beat the old hag in this movie that cursed her. I first saw this movie when it came out in 2009 in theater and even seeing it today it still gave me chills throughout the whole movie. Even the comedic parts although funny made me chuckle in a uneasy manner. The instrument violin can be a pretty creepy instrument and it's used effectively to add to the chill factor. The really scary horror movie uses this tactic as well and the music really does add to the intensity. Although some parts of this movie doesn't make much sense sometimes, overall most of it is executed very well. Movies like this show you don't always need blood and gore to make a effective scary movie.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

So i thought, this film must be good.The day before i go to see it, a girl comes into work terrified, she almost crys as she tells me about it. So I'm now thinking, wow this film must be great. Im really looking forward to a good scare.Basically get to the cinema. pay for my ticket, food etc. start to watch it. i jumped a few times at the start, even at the car fight scene, which BTW was like something out of Spiderman and didn't belong in a ""horror"" movie.I quickly began to realise that this is not a ""horror"" movie, with all the comic violence, molesting corpses, cute kittens, etc. the only thing that seemed to tie it to the horror genre was the mono performance of the leading lady. Go to acting school there! Horror to me must be something completely different to what it is to everyone else? Halloween any one?The real ""menacing"" parts i thought were nothing to do with visuals, but more of the sound and tension, like that time in her house! The less you see the more i think, and that is not the case in this film, with stupid effects, gags and acting.So I'm guessing that this movie was rated soo high because it was made by the evil dead dudes? so it seems you can get away with making complete and utter rubbish, and have it praised, just because you made a few good films before! Im judging this film on not who made it, but what it was for me, and that was poop. There was nothing at all scary or creepy about this film, i slept fine after it, and i kindda zoned out of it as it was so not entertaining!also what is scary about a talking goat? it was soo sad, it wasn't even funny!the reason i gave it three stars was, 1. Justin long was like the only good actor in it, convincing at least. 2. it had a really cute kitten. 3.this star is for myself for dragging myself through hell and back, (basically wasting two hours of my life and wasting £10 for dung!)avoid it!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead Again,"honestly I loved this movie! if you liked the evil dead movies I can't help but say you'll truly enjoy this movie. Sam has done it again. people who over analyze horror films will probably find plot holes and subtle things wrong that people wouldn't do but seriously if your going to take a fictional horror movie and act like it could actually happen then you should stick to non-fiction. The ending was great so make sure you don't just accept that you know what will happen or figure that it'll all be okay in the end. honestly this movie could only have been better if he somehow worked Bruce Campbell into the action to just say ""hail to the king baby"" as he shot the old gypsy woman with his BOOM STICK! and in closing this is the type of horror that I truly love not truly scary but fun and well made!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where is the comedy tag?,"In the genres it lists horror and thriller, so i went into this movie thinking it was just that. WRONG. It is a horror comedy a la scary movie/cabin in the woods, and these previous titles are done much, much better.

Didn't see THAT one coming...,"Very few true horror films hold my interest. In fact, MOST horror films I see are only seen by me because of the people I'm with at the time. And at first, I expected this to be fairly standard, your average horror make-up and special effects, some pop-out moments with tremendous music, blah blah blah.But what I got was a virtual modern-day version of Army of Darkness, another film by Sam Raimi (Which I found hysterical). I consider Drag Me to Hell a comedy with horror elements. And while that may come off as completely idiotic and pointless, there is a level of entertainment emanating from the film that isn't found in any other film. Its over the top, gross-but-not-gory effects make you laugh harder than any comedy you'll see, and as you laugh, you'll only wonder why you're laughing as you couldn't imagine anything worse.The plot is fairly standard, with no major exceptions or faults, and, surprisingly, the acting is fairly top-notch. Justin Long plays the caring, nerdy boyfriend considerably well, and the co-workers of the main character are quite believable. CGI is fairly standard, as well as make-up, and cinematography.I rate movies by how well they affect me or how well they entertained me. And while Drag Me to Hell hasn't particularly affected me physically or emotionally, it did fulfill my need for some pointless, over-the-top adult humor.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Apparently misunderstood.,"This film tells the story of Christine Brown, a woman of modest origins who, wishing to ascend socially by a job promotion and feeling despised by the rich boyfriend's parents, turns out to be responsible for the misery of an old (and disgusting) Hungarian gypsy, Mrs. Ganush. In retaliation, she goes after Christine and casts on her a terrible curse that threatens, in just three days, shoot with her soul into the depths of Hell.This film marks the return of Sam Raimi to horror movies where he was so happy in the past, with hits such as ""Evil Dead"", a film that he will revisit here, in some scenes and details. Yes, because he not only directs this film as it is also one of the main responsible for its screenplay. From the middle of the cast we can highlight two names that really shone: the first is Lorna Raver, a veteran actress with a huge talent who has done most of her career in theater, despite some discreet parts in movies. By participating in this film in the role of the main antagonist, Mrs. Ganush, I dare to say that she did her most prominent role in the industry so far, and that was a very wise bet: she managed to make a truly disgusting and loathsome character, which contributes greatly to the dramatic tension. Another name that deserves congratulations is Alison Lohman, who plays the protagonist, Christine Brown, and easily captures our sympathy, making a psychologically complex character who will pass through an ""evolution"" during the film, becoming more altruistic. Another thing that makes Lohman deserve congratulations is the fact that she have done almost every scenes of the film without stunts.I think many people haven't understood this film. I recognize that it uses many ""recipes"" and ""formulas"" used in other horror movies and it can become a movie more predictable... but I think this is a minor problem compared to the modern and absolutely pornographic oceans of blood, vomit and guts that we can see in some films. That didn't bring anything positive to the art of horror cinema but, in these days, it's easier to scares by that way than using more elaborate means. Maybe that's why ""Drag Me to Hell"" didn't achieve the recognition I think its deserves. It's a movie that works well and scares us, puts us under stress, anxious and nervous, as if we felt that Brown's punishment was too hard for the mistake she made. The ending is somewhat predictable, in fact: Brown is the only one who seems to think she can easily escape the fury that came for her. Despite this, and some comic details, it's a great horror film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Horror and comedy can work together, but this doesn't achieve the balance.","I was initially excited to hear about Sam Raimi's return to the horror genre with this film. So, after 5 years of hype surrounding how excellent a return-to-form this film was for Raimi, I finally sat down to watch.Frankly, the balance between horror and comedy is WAY off. We're supposed to be menaced by, or afraid of, the gypsy woman. But her entire introduction came across as a terrible attempt at gross-out humor. This continued in the parking garage, where the gypsy woman tries to gum the protagonist's face. These were the wrong decisions, implemented with poor consideration for pacing and tone.The same applies to the ""shooting blood"" scene in the bank. It was intended to be humorous, since I can't imagine that Raimi actually thinks blood shoots out like that. But as soon as we get into the sense that it's supposed to be a darkly humorous scene, the tone shifts 180 degrees again, and we're supposed to take it seriously.This film simply fails to find the right balance, and the right time to attempt striking that balance.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible movie waste of time,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen! A complete waste of time with a ridiculous story and terrible acting. There's no plot twist, just a series of random, unrealistic scenes that fail to deliver any suspense or entertainment, especially for a horror film. The story is weak, and the cinematography looks like it was shot on a phone. Even for a 2009 film, it falls short compared to other movies of the time. Definitely not worth watching-skip it unless you've run out of other options. It feels like the filmmakers didn't even try, leaving you bored and disappointed.No wonder non of the actors made it after this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mr. Raimi is back and better than ever!,"After the ultimate letdown that was Spider-Man 3, Sam Raimi decided to return to his directing roots, the horror genre, in Drag Me to Hell.It follows Christine(Alison Lohman), a woman who has a pretty good job and an overall great life. She's also gunning for a promotion as assistant manager at her place of employment, a loan office. It's a close race, but her boss Mr. Jacks(David Paymer) will give the promotion to the person who can ""make the tough decisions"". Christine does this by declining elderly gypsy Mrs. Ganush(Lorna Raver) a third mortgage extension. Ganush later attacks Christine and gives the curse of the Larmia, in which Christine will be tormented by dark spirits for 3 days before being dragged to the fiery pits of hell. With help from her boyfriend Clay(Justin Long), fortune teller Rham Jas(Dileep Rao), and medium Shaun San Dena(Flor de Maria Chahua), who once and unsuccessfully tried to break the curse years ago, Christine must hurry if she ever wants to save her life. Otherwise, it's hell she'll go.First, the positives. I enjoyed the dark humor seen throughout the film. I know most say this is a straightforward horror exercise, but I'd classify it as more of a Evil Dead-esquire horror/comedy. It uses splat-stick as its primary humor producer. There's even a scene involving an anvil that reminds me of Wile E. Coyote. Another great scene involving a séance that goes awry both make me laugh and scream. Speaking of screams, the movie also scared the living daylights out of me. I screamed three times and kept holding my hand over my eyes. It kind of uses that sick humor to lull you in a false sense of security and then WAM!, a creepy version of Ganush surrounded by flames pops up. It just plain works. I also liked the performances. Lohman's performance as Christine helps you feel sorry for the girl, even though she screwed up big time. The score by Christopher Young is great, composed mostly of violins. This music also helps out for the easily scared folk, as it hints when a scare is about to happen.On the negatives, I felt the film was too short(99 minutes). That's been a problem for the Evil Dead series too, with an average clock in at about an hour and a half. I was kinda left wanting more. But other than that, this is pure gold.Overall I give it a near perfect 9 out of 10. I'm praying for a trilogy. Or at least a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

As fun as it gets,"Yep, I'm gonna say it. This is Sam Raimi's best work yet. Stylewise, this is definitely a more jolting horror than Army of Darkness & the Evil Dead films. The jokes and gags don't come as often as they do in AoD, but he puts more into setting them up, so that when they do come, they're even more shockingly hilarious than the ones in AoD. Raimi invests more in character building in this film, leading us to both squirm and howl even more at all the punishment that Christine (the heroine) takes. I like the horror movie genre, but I'm sick of all the predictably bad schlock that the movie studios put out there just to make a quick buck. Thank god Raimi has returned some credibility to horror.

A WiseGuy's Review: The Best PG-13 Horror Movie I've Ever Seen,"25yr Male from Detroit, MI --- Based on pure scares, lead performances and overall movie experience, Drag Me To Hell is by far the best PG-13 horror movie I've ever seen. Wasn't sure what to expect out of this film but love Raimi's Army of Darkness and this movie far exceeded all of my expectations. There were so many tense scenes, random scares that made me jump, and hilarious over the top campy gore scenes. This movie is an absolute thrill-ride from beginning to end. Don't be swayed by the comedic aspect of this movie everyone keeps talking about. Yes, there are some laughs but this is a horror picture and I thought the comedy was very skillfully placed. I absolutely loved Alison Lohman in the lead role she seemed to really give this performance her all. The witch villain is disgusting and terrifying and awesome. The only PG-13 horror movie I could even begin to compare with this is the Ring which is an entirely different type of horror movie and really can't be compared. I had a great time seeing this movie it is faced paced, highly entertaining, very scary, visually stimulating, and certainly one of the best horror movies to come out in quite some time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Pure horror, just the way it should be!","Just when I was starting to agree with all the people that regularly complain that no good horror movies are being made these days; along comes Sam Raimi to deliver what is surely one of the best horror films of the decade! Drag Me to Hell is pure horror just the way it should be; very little time is spent on the plot and characters, and a lot of time is spent on the actual horror - the result is a shallow, but expertly made and very exciting film. And best of all the film is clearly aimed at Evil Dead fans, which gives it tons of cult appeal. Parts of the film are gruesome and disgusting, while others are manic and cartoonish; and it all slots together very well indeed. The plot is very simple and we focus on Christine Brown; a loan officer at the bank. Her world is turned upside down one day when an elderly woman turns up wanting an extension on her mortgage. With one eye on a promotion, Christine tells her there's no way she can get an extension; leading the old woman to place a gypsy curse on her...which will end with her being dragged to the fiery pits of hell!The film doesn't rely on gore to deliver its shocks. It's Sam Raimi's direction that really makes the film exciting. The plot is very well plotted and we're never very far away from another jump scene. Most of the sequences featuring the villain are fast and exciting, which ensures that the film is very entertaining. It has to be said that the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense and there are some very big holes in it; but really I couldn't care less, because when a film is this exciting; it doesn't matter. Aside from the scares, Raimi delivers some laughs too and the pitch black humour is very well placed; a dinner sequence was a particular highlight. Alison Lohman at first seems a little too lightweight for the central role, but she grows into it as the film moves along and proves herself a very good sport by the end. Justin Long is, as usual, entertaining in a co-starring role; while big credit has to go to Lorna Raver, who is brilliantly effective as the villain. The film builds up nicely for the most part; and we boil down to a fantastic séance scene that is pure Evil Dead. Clearly this film isn't going to appeal to everyone; I expect a lot of complaints about the plot, but if you like entertaining horror and/or are a fan of Sam Raimi; you owe it to yourself to check this beauty out!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good movie.,"***MINOR SPOILERS***Drag me to hell is one of the best horror/ thriller movies of the decade, as well as one of the best PG-13 thrillers ever made. Without exaggerating I jumped off my seat at least 15 times during this film. It is not just the fact that demons and ghosts are in the movie, but it is all about how Sam Raimi directed it. He refrained from presenting an overwhelming amount of blood and gore (come think of it this film didn't even have any blood and gore in it) and that is the beauty of Sam Raimi's direction. Unlike his previous entries such as Evil Dead 1&2 (filled with Zombies and violent and bloody scenes), Drag me to hell relies much on loud bangs and eerie musical scores that can make anyone jump off their seat at any given time. Although I've never heard of Lorna Raver before watching this film, her disturbing and creepy character kept giving me nightmares for a couple of days after watching the film. The plot of the film is also short and to the point There were as many characters as needed to be and all the actors played their roles perfectly. And not to mention the explosive ending I didn't see coming. This is the perfect horror film and I LOVED IT. I can't recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I normally don't like horror movies but this...,"Was AWESOME!

While I was watching the movie I wanted to leave a couple times because I was so scared but stayed and am really glad I did.In these days where movies try to just pile on the blood, you get a movie like this where the fear is psychological, and that's the way I feel horror should be. Wondering what's going to happen next and rooting for the lead character even though she has her flaws. On top of that, there's even a believable and pretty sweet romance, definitely a surprise. So I know this may sound crazy but I think this could both turn into a cult movie and also end up being a great date movie, I love it! For the people that don't see the greatness in this movie you can go back to Saw or Hostel, this is so much better.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me to Hell is an Instant Horror Classic,"In the spirit of the Evil Dead Trilogy, Director Sam Raimi drags you into a world of complete insanity with this soon-to-be horror/comedy classic ""Drag Me to Hell"". The movie is everything I expected it to be: no holds barred, good old fashioned fun. It knows no bounds and goes completely over the top, and just keeps going. It's loud, imaginative, as scary as it is hilarious, and especially enjoyable to go see at the movie theaters. Sam Raimi's blend of humor and horror is unique and exciting, his timing is amazing (which is difficult enough when the two genres are separate), and you really do enjoy every minute of it.The premise is simple. A loan officer (played by the lovely Alison Lohman) is cursed by a really creepy old gypsy woman after denying her of a third extension on her mortgage payments. She visits a psychic, who tells her a very evil spirit is now after her soul and she only has three days to rid herself of this black curse. Justin Long plays her immensely supportive and incredibly wealthy boyfriend. He is a realist who believes her experiences are merely the product of post-traumatic stress, but is willing to accept the notion of supernatural forces if it helps her.The movie does not take itself too seriously, like many horrible horror movies tend to do. Instead, the movie plays like one of those walk-through haunted houses you visit during Halloween, or those creepy carnival rides with spooks that make you jump at every corner, for the sole purpose of keeping you fully entertained. ""Drag Me to Hell"" makes it fun to go the movies, and it will definitely endure as a great feature for decades of horror movie nights to come. Ultimately, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is just a classic campfire horror story, and Sam Raimi just so happens to be one of the greatest storytellers of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Return""?  Who's to say Raimi ever really ""left""?","To get it out of the way, most people writing or talking about Drag Me to Hell are saying that ""Raimi's returned"" or ""he's come back finally!"" There is an underlying current here to say that he ""lost"" it somehow, in terms of being a talented director. Maybe it's jet-lag from being on a binge of several years of Spider-Man (and the, politely saying it, mixed reaction to Spider-Man 3) that maybe one wondered if he would return to his horror ""roots"" as he hadn't made one since The Gift and not one that really stuck out in the 15 years since Army of Darkness. But he's always had the goods, even through the Spider-Man movies (and yes, even through most of part 3 I would argue), and what Drag Me to Hell represents not so much a return but a revival, akin perhaps to the Coen brothers, Raimi's old buddies, going back to basics with No Country for Old Men. Suffice to say, this is more than comfortable territory for Raimi: Drag Me to Hell is a reminder of what he's good at, which is not simply horror, but scaring the s*** out of you while making you laugh your head off.This wont be for all horror fans, perhaps, such as those who scamper off to the ""safe"" fare like Haunting in Connecticut or the super trash like My Bloody Valentine 3D. This is PG-13, but in a way that doesn't mean Raimi or his brother co-writer Ivan are playing it any safer than Evil Dead 2. Their story of Christine Brown (gorgeous and talented Alison Lohman) turning down an old gypsy for an extension on her mortgage and thus being branded with a three-day-ticket-till-hell curse, is the stuff of pulpy EC comic books, with a touch of satire (did anyone else think of the current mortgage crisis when watching this) in the stew of over-the-top gags in true horror set-ups. Sure, there may be a few ""JUMP"" scares, and sure a couple of story turns may not be logical (I had a problem with Justin Long, playing the psychology professor boyfriend of Christine's, doing something at about 2/3 of the way through the movie that didn't make much sense in terms of know-how), but it there's rarely a scene without some wallop of entertainment.And like the Evil Dead films, when they were at their best, Drag Me to Hell confronts its protagonist with an onslaught of ""holy-crap-what-was-that"" things, such as an incredible (and I do mean incredible) nosebleed, the old gypsy popping up in a shed where an anvil is hanging conveniently overhead, the goat used for a sacrifice that suddenly turns possessed during a ritual, or just certain things like the recurring fly or (gulp) the bleeding eyeball in the middle of a piece of ""Harvest cake"" which Christine has prepared. And like a former bewildered but strong hero like Ash, Christine toughens up soon and fast enough to do some unthinkable but hilariously tasteless things (i.e. poor kitty - and the kitty's return, ho-ho). And, not the least, after her roller-coaster of a horror-comic endeavor has supposed to come to a close, nothing is really, truly over.Drag Me to Hell is a rollicking good horror movie, and for the certain moviegoer with as many laughs as another not-quite-comedy movie playing right now, Pixar's Up. For fans of the people involved, or just looking for a few jolt-out-of-your-seat scares and bat-s*** crazy sequences, this is your current if imperfect fix you're jonesing for.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Drag Me To Hell is a modern masterpiece,"I was in the preview and have to say it's a real succeeded old school Horror ala ""The Evil Dead"" or ""Hatchet"". That what's been supplied on the Horror genre market recently it's really cheap. Somehow, there were remakes of older films and extremely hard, partly unnecessary violence in ""Horror""-movies has been performed that marked the film course anyway or even made any sense. With ""Drag Me To Hell"" Sam Raimi succeeded again to create a film that shows a very strong cult potential. Beside the ingenious SFX, which really fit to the ""hell ride"" the film also presents a lot funny stuff! Along the actual happening there are many funny scenes which put a smile on the viewer's face at one moment and abruptly scare again at the other moment.

Drag Me to Hell Review,"Drag Me To Hell(2009) Starring:Alison Lohman,Justin Long,Lorna Raver,Dileep Rao,David Paymer,Adriana Barraza,Chelcie Ross,Reggie Lee,Molly Cheek,Bojana Novaković,Kevin Foster,and Jay Gordon Directed By:Sam Raimi Review CHRISTINE BROWN HAS A GOOD JOB, A GREAT BOYFRIEND, AND A BRIGHT FUTURE. BUT IN THREE DAYS, SHE'S GOING TO HELL. Hello Kiddies your pal the crypt-critic here and well he's going to try and keep this brief. This is one of the scariest films I have ever experienced. It's like sinister scary but to be quite honest I think this is scarier just because of the ending. I saw this film because I'm a big fan of Sam Raimi,he's given two of my favorite trilogies of all time. The film revolves around a woman named Christine Brown who has a lovely boyfriend,good job and has a bright future ahead of her,until one day after not giving an elderly woman the extension she needed to stay in her home she curses her and in three days Christine will go to hell. The plot while probably not realistic makes for a scary time. It's one of the most screwed up movies I've seen since paranormal activity 3 and sinister. I believe the theme of this film would be to enjoy life for as long as you have it. The acting is very good, I love the woman who played Christine and hope to see more of her in the future. The rest of the supporting cast is great in their roles. Sam Raimi knows how to direct actors who aren't too well known. All of the elements of a scary movie are present from beginning to end. I hear there might be a sequel,I think I heard that a long time ago,If so I'll see it because I highly recommend this scary flick. I give Drag me to HELL a four out of five stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you love Evil Dead You'll Love Drag Me To Hell Perfect for Halloween Time,"I thought this movie was awesome. It was unique and had some great moments the fans of the Evil Dead series will appreciate. If there is or ever was to be an Evil Dead 4 it would be in much of the same style. Sam Raimi proved that hes still got it in the horror genre. I was looking for a good horror movie in loo of fall time. I recently watched the crazies and Legion both huge disappointments then i watched tonight and it served its purpose for me. A smart, gory, scary, bright, evil, shocking, fun movie perfect for anyone looking for a great horror movie around Halloween. I hope there would be a sequel. I applaud Sam Raimi and I say forget Spiderman and focus on more horror movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible,"Cheap scares, Swiss cheese plot. I really can't say anything good about this movie. The jokes were not funny, the acting was though. Why does every curse movie never address the fact that if these gypsy people could throw curses around willy nilly they wouldn't need bank loans as they could easily hold the world to ransom?This doesn't even fall closely into the category of black comedy, because after the first hour and a half I was bored to tears. Utterly ridiculous gross out moments don't make a film good, good script and plot design do. I gave this a 2 being generous. I have no idea how this film has managed to hit 7.2 on the IMDb score. I can only imagine that the majority of people voting are as unhappy as me with the calibre of horror that has been available over the last few years and got a bit itchy with their rating trigger.If you want my advice then stop watching American horrors. The big budgets destroy any feel of real horror that remains in a story. CGI has ruined the world of film with super graphical scenes. The films that really do scare; such as The Wicker Man (1973) and Psycho (1960) didn't have so much as a dancing puppet, and yet still terrify me if I watch them today.I believe there needs to be an overhaul when it comes to the horror genre, because if crap like this is passing the threshold at the end of first decade of the non-believing millennium, then we are in serious trouble for what the future has to offer.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
How It Would Be Like To Be Plagued?!,"How would it be like to be plagued?!Terrifying, terrifying I tell you. Gypsies, I must say have always been a mystery to me (I don't know about others) and that is why people create these films about gypsy curses like Stephen King's Thinner for example. A fear might murk within us about making these mysterious people angry as they have been persecuted by society and thus might take their anger out of those of high power; just like what happened between Christine Brown and that sinister Gypsy grandmother who plagued her with a demon who would drag her to hell for not allowing the gypsy to keep her home.I don't want to spoil the rest, but this movie was so intense; and there are very disturbing parts to watch which may offend sensitive viewers. Tell me, would you kill in order to survive or would you rather be dragged to hell. I'd rather be dragged to hell. Watch the movie and you'll understand.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shock...Another Shock...Another Shock...Another Shock...Get the picture?,"In the past, the concept of a PG-13 horror movie was laughable. Now, it's pretty much all we get. I went into ""Drag Me to Hell"" with trepidation because aside from the spooky ""The Ring,"" all horror movies with the PG-13 have been universally reviled as complete crap. Then again, this is from Sam Raimi, the creator of the cult classic ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, so it should reverse the trend, right? Not really.Although I didn't actively hate it, I didn't like it either. Because the PG-13 rating eliminates most of the trademarks of the genre (extreme violence, sex, gore), the only thing Raimi can rely on is shocks and special effects. There is an overload of the former (even though they ""work"", and they get boring after a while, and the special effects are sub-par.Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer at a bank. Because she wants a promotion, she decides not to give an old lady named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) an extension on her mortgage, as this will save the company money. While being a jerk in this case would have had some benefits, it was probably unwise to do it to poor old Mrs. Ganush. Boy can she hold a grudgeThe problem of this movie is that I just didn't care. The acting was okay (though Justin Long was really miscast). I was only interested (a word I use with caution) in the story because I wondered where the story was going. And the special effects looked cheap; with a big budget movie like this, I expected better.About the concept of PG-13 horror movies...as I am not a fan of the genre, I can't really give my opinion. However, I can say that I am against neutering movies to fit the PG-13 rating. In this case, I probably wouldn't have been so annoyed if this wasn't the case with every movie. Based on the past and this movie, I'm guessing that a PG-13 horror movie probably has no real merit, only marketing capabilities. And, unfortunately, the latter is the only thing that matters.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A tale from the crypt? Or a look at a human being's uncertainty and greedy winnings?,"Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' trilogy will forever stand as among the most refreshing and original chapters in the horror film genre. Jumping the boat to create the enormously popular 'Spider-Man' trilogy he now returns 29 years after the first 'Evil Dead' and creates a wonderfully slick feature and rebirths the genre once again. As mentioned by others on the message boards and in the comment section, we're in a time where horror films are mostly Japanese remakes (that originally has got underlying scares that the American everyday film viewer don't actually sense) and franchises whose torture and gushing blood whose spirit almost leans toward the sadistic and pornographic. 'Drag Me to Hell' is Sam Raimi at his best, upping the pace from his earlier features to create an intense 96 minutes of sarcastic humor, nerve-snapping scares and an emotional core of greed, self-loathing and spirits of the dark. Alison Lohman takes on this solo-ride like Bruce Campbell did in the 'Evil Dead' films and faces Lorna Raver who brilliantly plays out the disgusting and frightening Mrs. Ganush and makes her one of the most memorable horror villains in quite a while. We've got a few minor characters worth mentioning, with Justin Long as the earnest boyfriend, and Dileep Rao as helpful (or?) fortune-teller that becomes surprisingly important elements in such, at first glans, straightforward horror film. Though some have criticized Raimi for using CGI to cover some happenings as if he's departed his low-budget, B-film spirit of the 80ties, I think the CGI-effects weren't overused and they felt like a fine addition to such a splendidly wild story. This is easily one of my strongest recommendations of 2009.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi's Return to Horror,Sam Raimi proves that he hasn't lost his special touch for terror in Drag Me To Hell which follows a bank employee who makes the tough call to not grant a gypsy an extension on her loan and gets cursed to be dragged to hell in 3 days. It balances terror and humor incredibly well and you might find yourself jumping out of your seat one minute and laughing the next.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It dragged me to Heaven.,"Christine Brown has a good job, a great boyfriend, and a bright future.But in 3 days, she's going to Hell.Now that's scary.Hearing that Sam Raimi directed this movie kinda made me want to see this movie.So I watched it with some moderate expectations thinking of how good the reviews had been.Once it was over, I was surprised.'Drag me To Hell' is a superbly entertaining horror movie packed with jump scenes, great acting, good characters, an interesting premise, and even some moments that make you say ""Eww"".It's really nice to see the mastermind that brought us the 3 exhilarating Spider-man movies show us something new and original.The movie itself even has a message that people should really abide by.It all revolves around the choice of making good decisions and the consequences of making bad ones.Maybe you could go straight to Hell for denying an elderly woman an extension on her house just to be Assistant Manager.Talk about greedy.In short, 'Drag me To Hell' is a great horror film that doesn't hold back on the chills or gross out moments.Screw the Christians who have a problem with the title, THIS is Heaven.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Master of Horror is Back,"It's hard to defend that recent horror films are simply not nearly as good as they were in the past. Moviegoers have become so accustomed to the idea that torture porn like represented by the Saw and Hostel series is what horror is all about. Not to mention how the rest of the horror films are simply remakes of past movies, like the recent Friday the 13th remake. Thankfully, Sam Raimi decided to tackle the task of making a great horror film in the 21st century. The question is, however, is the film everything horror fans wished it to be? The answer is a resounding yes, considering Drag Me To Hell is quite possibly the best horror film to be released in decades.The main idea behind Drag Me To Hell is a simple one, yet an idea that has been seemingly lost over the years: Making a horror film that embraces retro horror films, yet is still exciting and exhilarating enough to bring new ideas to the genre. As the years have passes, it truly seems that horror films lost all the charm that they once had. Horror movies are supposed to be enjoyable diversions from reality, that while still being scary and creepy, are fun to watch. Simple as that. But now, the genre is filled with grim, sickening, and twisted gorefests that are neither enjoyable or entertaining. Sam Raimi, however, saw exactly what was wrong with modern film-making, and corrected it. It's truly unbelievable at how amazing the result is.As far as the story is concerned, the film is centered around one young woman whose life isn't going so well. Her bank promotion is about to be given to a newbie, and in an attempt to show her boss that she is the right one for the position, she denies an old woman an extension on her mortgage. Normally, this wouldn't be a huge deal, had the old woman not cursed the young bank clerk to a fate in hell! Yes, it's silly, but it's refreshing to see a silly horror film plot again, which haven't been seen in years. The shocking part of the film, for me, is just how hilarious it is, yet at the same time, being filled with creepy moments. I spent pretty much the entire film laughing, and some scenes had me laughing so hard that tears were running down my face. I had never laughed that hard during a comedy, let alone a horror film no less.It is also highly recommended, above pretty much all films in recent memory for that matter, that viewers see this flick in a theater. Why? Well, there are movies that people go to see for the movie itself, and then there are movies, like Drag Me To Hell that are made in part due to the experience. Laughing and yelling at the screen with a bunch of random strangers is what the horror genre is all about, and that is exactly what this film provided. There were people screaming from fear, and then immediately rolling in the aisles laughing. There was even one part of the film where a person was walking into the theater as a screamer popped up on-screen, leading to her literally falling to the ground in fright. While watching it on DVD will still be great, definitely go to a theater if at all possible. It's worth every penny.Many people refer to me as a cynical reviewer, and that may be true, but I am not kidding when I say that people owe it to themselves to see Drag Me To Hell. It's a celebration of classic horror, and strong enough to represent the past in a time where the genre isn't holding up very well. It's exhilarating, enjoyable, hilarious, and downright awesome in every regard. Sam Raimi deserves a round of applause.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overrated and aged poorly,"This movie has aged like milk. Standards for a ""good"" horror movie were so low in 2009 that this movie got merit-points with critics for being ""decent"". By today's standards, it has an incredibly cringe script and filled with cliche moments that make you go ""wtf why did they decide to do that"". For example, someone pukes in protagonists' mouth 2-3 times. Many ridiculous moments just to gross you out. Odd looney-toon-esque moments where bodies contort or ragdoll in cartoonish ways (eyeballs popping out of head like Beetlejuice and shoving an entire arm down someone's throat like their mouth is made of rubber). Maybe 10 minutes worth of clever content in the back-half when the protagonist has a moral-dilema that is somewhat interesting, but only occupies a small portion of the film before returning to Looney Toon's land of Acme.I did like that the protagonist's hair is ripped out 3-4x, that was maybe the only running gag that worked well.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I love this movie, it freaks me out and does so effortlessly.","Drag Me to Hell is a return of the classic horror genre. Raimi manages to create some genuine thrills and terrors using the old-fashioned format of surprise: misdirection and suggestion and I absolutely adored it. It's mostly a film for amusement rather than for terror which kind-of disappointed me. As wholly cheesy as that proclamation may sound, it is entirely true. With a tantalizing premise itself, Raimi at times does manage to masterfully construct a chilling atmosphere when it's not held down by laughable sequences. Aside from his fan base, the real reason you would be drawn to this film is it's terrifying premise rather than the actual construction itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

classic raimi!,"this movie is an instant classic. there was a poor review by ""ghodmode"" that obviously did NOT pick up the connections from ""army of darkness"" or any of ""the evil dead"" series. of course it's over the top! this is taking so many elements from such an old CULT CLASSIC and putting it into a new modern film. you would probably not appreciate this movie if you are not familiar with Raimi's style and the evil dead connections. a lot of it is done with some over the top slap-stick and very jumpy scenes. watch it with headphones and it'll be a lot more entertaining. if you don't love this movie, than you don't understand why a lot of this film was shot the way it was. people who purely took this as a ""horror"" film would think it was dumb, but it had a lot of humor in it that was purposely done for Raimi's following. and if you haven't seen the evil dead series and army of darkness then shame on you, repent, go watch it immediately, then join the cult classic following of bruce campbell and sam raimi. THEN you can really appreciate this film. i say this is sam raimi at his best. the connections between the evil dead series and this film are countless.

Only Raimi,"When one asks if a more or less new Raimi horror film is worth seeing, this film is a clear example that it is absolutely worth it, a scary and ironic horror as only this director knows how to make films, entertaining from start to finish. All the hallmarks of a Raimi film and this is wonderful for those who love this director and his works. It can be said that as a plot the film is not that great, in fact it adds a little but not enough to the classic trivial horror plot but one does not pay too much attention to the plot because it is too busy laughing for this film halfway between horror and comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Welcome home Sam!,"Mixed feelings here. First up I'm stoked that after a decade of making paint by numbers Spiderman stuff Sam Raimi is coming home to the genre that made him. On the other hand though, after all the glowing praise that has been thrown at Drag Me To Hell I expected something of T2 or Die Hard proportions, something that redefined a genre and set a high water mark for all other filmmakers to aspire to.That clearly doesn't happen here, but in any case this is a very good (most importantly fun) horror flick which is definitely worth checking out and is at least better than 90 of the last 100 horror flicks that I've seen.Still not quite enough to crack my all time top 10 horror movies though.A good horror movie should aim to do at least one of the following: Scare / Amuse / Shock / Gross out / Build suspense / Provide some good gore / Kill 90 minutes in a more enjoyable way than watching 3 episodes of Will & Grace.Drag Me To Hell does four, it primarily amuses, at times it scares, it aims to gross out and achieves this goal, and let's be honest almost anything is better than watching a 2000's version of ""Are you being Served?"" minus the laughs.What you won't find here is suspense, Sam has no time for it and prefers a quick build up, then scare, scare, scare for 80 minutes. What does this mean? Well in reality this is pretty much what the Evil Dead movies would have looked like if he had a budget, and many scares and scenes rip freely from the trilogy.First the plot in ten seconds: A young bank employee does a gypsy lady wrong and is in turn cursed by same. Unless she appeases the demon spirit within three days she will be Dragged to Hell.I could give you the same info in another 27 paragraphs but instead I have decided to give you some random thoughts as I watched the movie:Justin Long was in Jeepers, Creepers. This is a definite step up. He is such a good and understanding boyfriend that it is obvious he reeeeeallly knew he wasn't ever going to do any better and decided to believe anything she said rather than dump her and find someone more sane. (C'mon I like Justin Long, but if he wasn't an actor would he be scoring with anything above a 7? Be real now.)The girl, Alison Lohman, is a pretty good actor, cute enough to be interesting, but not memorable enough for me to want to watch what she is in next.Why would someone put their Mum on speaker when you know she doesn't approve of his girlfriend and she is in the room?Being a former bank Johnny, it is good to see that even movie characters assume all bank employees are tellers regardless. (It happened all the damn time!)There are tossers who will stab you in the back in every workplace.Why would leaves blow through a deserted underground car park?The characters have a cat. I initially thought that ""Here we go, how many forced scares will we get from here?"" You know what? Zero. (Points: Raimi.)When you have three days to go before being dragged to hell, unless you make amends with the curser. Don't put it off until the last minute.Between this, Thinner, and even Snatch, don't ever mess with a gypsy! Now some thoughts about Sam's pet likes:Sam likes eyes, especially eye trauma. (If you think about it, his Ghost House Logo starts out as a skull eye looking through the keyhole.) In Evil Dead 2 we had the memorable ""eye down the throat"" gag, in Army of Darkness the initial ""eye in the shoulder"". Here he kicks it up a notch, or at least as far as a PG horror movie will allow, we have a cake-eye and an eye stapling to keep us warm until his next flick.Sam uses simple body fluids more effectively than almost anyone else outside of porn directors. The gross-outs in Drag Me To Hell come frequently, and even though you know it is only a film they just look gross. Notable examples include a high pressure nose-bleed, numerous mouth to mouth vomitings (!) and the aforementioned dinner scene.A single buzzing fly is sometimes more disturbing than 1,000 decapitations. I can watch someone get a pitchfork in the head and not blink, but when the fly goes up one nostril and out the other I nearly gagged.When you use the plot device of having the lead character susceptible to random visions, you can have an attack from ANYWHERE! This leads to so many unexpected shock scares that you can understand the lead character going nuts.Sam still loves the ""possessed guy rising above the floor and speaking loudly in a disembodied voice"" thing.As a horror movie I don't think this is ready to be considered an all time classic. I personally enjoy Army of Darkness and Slither more than this. BUT: if you wanna spend 90 enjoyable minutes with a few scares and some great gross-out comedy, you likely won't do better.Final Rating – 8 / 10. Thanks for coming back Sam. You've still got it, but go back to R and give us one more real crack at horror before ""Spidey 4: Tobey Needs One More Paycheck To Afford A Lamborghini Murcielago"".If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not so scary,"Sam Raimi, of the 'Evil Dead' movies, detoured into comic book heroism with Spider Man. Working with his older brother and sometime collaborator Ivan on the screenplay, in 'Drag Me to Hell' Raimi returns to the horror genre but branches out into the supernatural with a tale of possession, curses, and exorcism. The result is a movie that has the potential of satisfying the general audience repelled by contemporary horror films so bloody and disgusting lately only adolescent males or their grown-up equivalent can stand them. 'Drag Me' has more elaborate, faster, louder effects than were available in the Seventies, but it's intentionally old-fashioned. It even opens with a prologue set in 1969 and cast in a deliberately garish B-picture style. In what follows, the scares have more in common with William Friedkin's 1973 'The Exorcist' than with the 2000's 'Saw' franchise, 'Cabin Fever' or even 'Friday the Thirteenth.' This is a vivid exercise in self-conscious but enthusiastic genre that for all its noise and yuckiness is is more enjoyable than unsettling.The first thing you notice is that the main characters aren't the attractive but despicable (and therefore disposable) youths Fred Krueger comes for, but people you can actually like. At the heart of this movie is a nice young couple, the plucky, winning and pretty Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) and her sweet, faithful boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long). Lindsay is a loan officer at a small bank. Appropriately enough in this time of the burst real estate bubble, Christine brings down a curse upon herself by refusing to delay a mortgage foreclosure.Raimi plays with the situation and our emotions here. The sick old lady who begs for a third extension, Mrs. Gannush (Lorna Raver), elicits Christine's (and perhaps our) pity at first, though Christine's need to impress her boss and win the vacant Assistant Manger post for herself makes her refuse to grant that extension. But the yellowish slimy drool from Mrs. Gannush's mouth, her hideous sharp discolored nails and her snaggly pointed teeth -- which, absurdly, are false, and which she removes to suck on some candy from Christine's desk while she's talking to the manager -- quickly tip us off that in fact she is -- ridiculously, over-the-top-- evil, doubtless a witch, put on this earth, or on Sam Raimi's set, to make Christine's life a nightmare and give us a lively, slightly scary, slightly gross ninety minutes in the theater. He avoids he whole issue of human sadism by focusing on an invading spirit, a ""Lamia,"" that aims to torment and terrify, not torture or maim. Not for the first time, Raimi's sequences revel in their sheer absurdity, while skirting the edge between seriousness and play.* Mrs. Gannush has a menacing hissy fit when Christine turns her down, and has to be removed by security officers. Then she is waiting in that classic scary place of movies, an underground parking lot, to confront Christine. and launch the curse, which hinges on a coat button. I felt a little embarrassed for Lora Raver. She's not so much an actress here as a most unflattering object upon which special effects are hung.With all the whirring insects, dark winds, flying objects, and buckets of fake blood that follow, what anchors Raimi's movie and makes it watchable are the appealing human elements, which add a certain nuance uncommon in the genre. As Christine's boss Mr. Jacks, who controls her future, David Paymer isn't the bad guy we expect, but admirably fair. Her oily, devious competitor for the assistant manager position Stu (Reggie Lee) is greedy and devious, but also so pathetic you can't hate him. Similarly when former farm girl and nobody Christine goes to meet Clay's well-heeled parents (played by Chelcie Ross and Molly Cheek), their snobbism toward her surprises us by fading quickly, and they seem quite decent people -- till Christine's curse leads to behavior so appalling they're glad to see her to the door.Something makes Christine want to have her fortune told. In stories like this you've got to have a spiritual adviser. The Raimis made an excellent decision in choosing that this should be a man from India, land of deep spiritual lore. As Rhan Jas, who helps Christine find ways of appeasing the evil Lamia that's after her, Dileep Rao is warm and appealing.Finally Justin Long, whose online bio begins with the description, ""a likable, boyish-looking actor with thick eyebrows and a friendly smile,"" is hard not to love.It's with these human touches that Raimi constructs an essentially grim, nightmarish, and by implication deeply pessimistic movie that feels surprisingly cozy. This is largely because it also feels old fashioned, evoking bygone movie-going experiences more than any scary realities. It's funny that so many teams of special effects guys were involved, given that none of it seems real for a minute. Raimi plays the game to the hilt, but he never stops letting us know he's in on the joke._____________________*Kevin Lee's YouTube video discussion of Raimi's 'Evil Dead II' sheds light on the director's outlook and methods. ""If the Evil Dead movies have contributed one thing to our appreciation of film aesthetics,"" Lee begins, ""it is to make us consider the boundary between what's funny and what's scary."" A pretty thin one, it appears.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A hell kind of movie..,"Reviewers of Drag me to Hell are in unison that the movie was amazingly good that's why when I had the chance to pass by the theaters, I rushed to the ticket booth and spend pennies for it. Glad that it didn't failed me.For the 21st century, many horror/thriller movies were made that is lacking in substance and originality. Horror movies were made with explicitly bloody and gruesome scenes emphasis but always lacks in sound effects and creativity to thrill the audience like Friday the 13th, Saw series and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. American movies are exaggerated in their vivacious interest of making remakes to the oriental culture like Korea and Japanese where movies in line were Shutter, The Uninvited, The Grudge, One Missed Call, The Eye and many more remakes. These are movies made by Asian masters and failed remakes in Hollywood.Horror genre seems to be dead within these years not until the Raimi brothers of Evil Dead trilogy go back to making horror film entitled Drag me to Hell that should drag audience at the edge of their seat. What was amazingly good is that it meets all the elements of a good film the sound, the timing, the picture and of course the acting not mentioning the space. And these elements are used in a very different manner. The sound was composed and amazingly design using the orchestra and used to keep the paced of the thrill and the atmosphere of a disturbing horror. The visual effects don't seem to be realistic, but it's obvious and acceptable. It's what makes the movie to be differently scarier and I like it. The timing to keep the terror alive over and over within the pace of the movie is unpredictable and once you are caught by it, screams out the hell as you can. The actors and actresses did their job. You could expect it from Allison Lohman {Christine Brown} and Lorna Rayver {Mrs. Ganush} which the relationship between the characters was in tension. Both nailed their part. Times that you may feel pity for the bad guys and feel harsher for the good guys. Mrs. Ganush I think, have done the greatest job so far in the movie to be mean, dirty, old, sometimes pitiful and a scary gypsy woman. She is an icon that could not be forgotten in horror film-making history. Other supporting actors and actresses were useful for keeping the twist.Overall, you may feel mixed emotions in the movie. It's a sort kind of comedy, you may get scared, you may feel like running wherein you are just seated at your seats for the solution of the protagonist, and you may feel like yuck for its nasty and disgusting parts. Kudos for Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi for bringing a one hell kind of a movie. It's a classic horror movie I've seen in a long time since the American version of The Ring and The Descent. Drag me to Hell; you will love every minute of it. It is a masterpiece and best seen in theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Even nice people go to hell""","Wow!I love Sam Raimai. He has created masterpieces. Evil Dead? The king of horror. It was badly misunderstood with it's campy effect, but now is known as one of the best. The Spiderman trilogy? This is probably the best trilogy next to the Dark Knight's. He knows how to direct a film without being serious, and taking a break from all seriousness can be great sometimes and we actually need it. But with Drag Me to Hell, I have big expectations. I read the critic's reviews stating that this IS Raimai's return to what we known and loved, and guess what? It surpassed all expectations.Sam Raimai has this thing with this film, where he takes this forgettable, clichéd story and turns it inside-out. When I first read the plot summary, I really thought it wouldn't turn out to be what it was all cracked up to be.Wrong.He inserts his formula of horror slash comedy and wraps it up in his special entrée. And he did a fantastic job. What I liked best was how Sam got away with his PG-13 rating but still keeps all his formula there. We have the gross-out gags, which were hilarious to watch, while also managing to make us look away in disgust. But that's all we wanted, we got it. The movie was actually a bit scary, just like the original Evil Dead. He knows how to mix horror + comedy in a great fashion, where we don't know which one was present more of. And again, the movie was hilarious! If you're not too sure of black comedies, especially ones that mixture with horror, then this won't be that great to you. But every scene was excellently done, and this was the return of the horror/comedy king!Now what saddens me is that people gave this bad reviews. It was understandable, but films much worse than this are rated higher, but are so much more clichéd. People didn't understand that the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously, was supposed to be a bit campy, and was expected to actually make you laugh. But the critics are the ones to listen to here, and recommend for all people ready to be disgusted, to laugh, to be horrified, to have fun! Drag Me to Hell was a treat, and one of the most entertaining movies of the best decade. And special kudos for the ending, which was one of the craziest twists ever. Now people saw they saw it coming, but I'm 75% sure they didn't, and they wanted to feel a bit better about themselves. Anyways.. Drag Me to Hell was a treat, and one of the most entertaining movies of the best decade.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Of gypsies who suck and refreshing horror movies...,"First of all - I am a huge fan of horror movies. I have heard a lot of ""Drag me to hell"" and finally I bought my own copy of this movie.The Spanish intro (especially because of my Spanish, that is not that well and I hadn't put on my glasses, so even reading to me was kind of hard... ) has been a little confusing and in the next few minutes we get to know Christine who is just lovely. But in the cruel world she can't make it through with all of her neatness - at least it seems like it.The movie is kind of ironic (especially in the end, when everything turns out to be different as expected). There are no real shock effects and the fight between the gypsy and Christine is hilarious... Yes, it has been disgusting (especially the toothless sucking on her chin), but it has just been kind of funny.""Drag me to hell"" is not the typical horror movie and in my point of view more likely a comedy - but in a good way. It did not scare me one bit, but you sympathize with the main character and hope that everything turns out good... but in the end you get a reasonable truth.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Super scary movie if you get it,"The ppl who bash this movie and said it's not scary is missing the point. It is the concept that's meant to be disturbing as fark, because you can be a reasonably good person minding your own biz, doing your job and still get dragged to hell cos you offended some unsavoury characters! I love how they wrote Christine as someone with her own selfishness , agenda and not some goody 2 shoes that can do no wrong. Damn that's damn relatable and can happened to anyone. There's no natural concept of good can overcome evil, karma etc here. Just simple - wrong place, wrong time ,wrong actions sorry off to hell you go to suffer eternity. She obviously doesn't deserve such harsh fate isn't it? That's the freaking scary part knowing it can happen to anyone of us which is the message of the movie 😱",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dumbest movie ever!,Alison Lohman is the worst actress and this movie is so stupid! This proves that IMDB ratings are crap. There isn't one single thing about this movie that's enjoyable. It's neither funny or scary. It's just plain dumb! A 6.6 rating must've been expensive!,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprising,"Once in a great while I am surprised. I didn't expect much from this movie, but it was actually quite good.For surprising me and being an entertainment I give it 9 stars - must see for horror fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
My opinion,"I'm still trying to find out why everyone thinks this film is wonderful.Special effects of poor quality, boring script, exaggerated performances, rituals that are beyond reality, too expected final, lame humor. If you really want to cause disgust, due to emphasis on other things ... There is much more than worms and flies in his mouth.It would have been interesting to know the relationship of the old with the demons.Definitely, do not waste money or time watching the movie .. not worth it. All that was good was the presentation.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Very scary but still very good, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a classic","At first when I wanted to see this film, I imagined it as just another modern day piece of crap that they call horror these days. At about halfway through the film I wanted to run out of the theater and go home. Not for how bad, but how truly scary this film is. The suspense was captivating and really catches you off guard. Some parts were very disturbing and I was so grossed out but still so interested I had to watch. The plot and story were both brilliant, acting was good but could have been better. Gives a really good pace that makes this film nearly flawless. This is a true movie that brings back the true horror that cinema used to have. I would definitely recommend seeing this movie if you want to get scared but still want to have a good time.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
the scares are there and the laughs are there and very often the scares are funny,"So I've finally got round to seeing Mr Raimi's much anticipated return to horror. Being a long time Evil Dead (and to a much lesser extent, Spider-Man) fan – I've completed all the Evil Dead video games, score! – I was excited as everyone else to see what I am still willing to describe as Evil Dead 3 ½.From the buzz at the time I was told to expect a fun and frightening ""ghost train"" type thrill ride – a scary movie ideal for dates and such. And I have to say this was bang on, the difficulty lies in the following; this is, after all, a DVD release review and this film is made for the cinema. Where this finds a bigger market on the home viewing front is the nerd factor. This film is chocka with references, predominantly to Raimi's past in gruelling horror and arguably to horror staples such as Night of the Living Dead (1968) (which I gleefully enjoyed this Halloween) and Night of the Demon (1957) (as also referenced in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) ""Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes""). The great camera work is very reminiscent of the unique attempts of Evil Dead, though refined greatly at this stage in his career, and there are many sound effects and moments – notably the laughing furniture - that will appease the nerd demons. And of course the ever present cameo of the directors 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 is not forgotten.Don't see this film if you're the kind of person to say ""Oh what a stupid film they heard a noise and went down into the cellar"" because this a fun light-hearted and gross-orientated flick. The film continues those horror staple sensibilities and would certainly be more at home in the 80s or 90s - it even uses the 1980's Universal logo at the start. It does feel like a breath of musty air from the past, I imagine this film was made partially to counter the gorenography wave with a return to a night at the drive in, to suck-face with your score and nearly poop yourself whilst still having a sweet time. Interestingly, the script was written by Sam and Ted Raimi shortly after Army of Darkness [1992] but Sam started off on his road to the big time that would end up in the multi-million dollar Spider-Man franchise. This does however allude to the ongoing question (mainly posed to Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell – now getting some prominent TV work which is nice to see) as to whether he will return to the Evil Dead series. It could be argued that this is merely a warm up but I would guess due to the fact the script was written after Evil Dead, there's probably little intention to go back, in the meantime unfortunately a remake is expected shortly, as the industry dregs up more and more head-bangingly dull 70s/80s horror classics remakes – they'll have to run out soon, the barrel scraping will come ... and drag you to hell ... sigh.It has to be remembered that despite this return to gruesome form, Sam Raimi never really intended to work in the horror genre. Growing up as a budding film maker with a love of The Three Stooges, often making direct rip-offs with his friends and siblings, his intention was always to work in comedy. However, the most money is made in horror and so Evil Dead (originally titled ""Within the Woods"") was Sam's break – despite being banned under the obscene publications act. Cheeky.However, this does make a unique viewing experience. Raimi's comedic sensibilities never left his films, more notably in the follow ups Evil Dead II (1982) and Army of Darkness (1992) horror and comedy are melded very effectively – the scares are there and the laughs are there and very often the scares are funny. This man really understands the comedic potential of someone being thrown, really hard, against a wall by a spirit – though I must say its funnier when its Bruce (who unfortunately has no cameo here), but maybe I'm just being feminist.Something else that sets this apart from many horror films that have this more fun/comedic approach is the quality of the acting the central cast are all great, have a fair amount of depth but also sum up their characters perfectly. And Dileep Rao is great as the horror movie fortune teller – the film teeters between genre stereotypes and deeper performances. To summarise, if you missed this film at the cinema, like me, you missed out to an extent. That's this films real home, if not the drive-in double features of the 1970's. And yes the double feature comment does have something to say about the substance of the film but Sam Raimi's a more than capable director and the film is without question 95 minutes of fun, frights and ""eeeeeewww""s. This horror-comedy dynamic, often totally mishandled by others, still works brilliantly here and makes for an enjoyable film. On the other hand it will very likely disappoint if your looking for a proper horror such as the first Evil Dead, but then with Raimi's back catalogue you should know what to expect. Evidently the release on Halloween was an apt move. Watch this for a fun night with the lights out and, even without your Oldsmobile, you'll have a great time. Don't forget the pop corn – it will fly.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
doesn't know what it wants to be,"The tone of this movie is all over the place. I love dark comedies and i love horror comedies. This was neither. I still don't know. I tried watching it from all perspectives but nothing fit.It wasn't scary at all. The majority of the ""scary"" parts were gross-out moments. And there are so many dumb moments and parts where you're left scratching your head. So many parts of the story are irrelevant (parents scene). This movie is garbage (1 viewing, 4/4/2021)",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scares Galore,"A loan officer refuses to allow an extension on an old woman's house and she's cursed to be dragged to hell before the week is out.Sam Raimi makes a triumphant return to horror with Drag Me To Hell. It's loud, brash, scary, funny, and always entertaining with some great performances and effects. A few times, it does get a little too over the top, but then it wins you over with yet another great scare.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
not as good as they say,"Alright I was stooked abut Ramis return to horror and sat with anxiously waiting for movie to begin. When it started I couldn't help but notice thats its your typical curse movie..I mean I can list countless movies that are similar to this one. I was surprised that people thought it was scary , or it made them jump when u see the jumps and scares a mile away except for 2. Overall i gave this a 4-5 cue the ending was decent ,but this was clearly brainless horror for teens. So I am still waiting for Rami's true return to horror maybe the new evil dead (2010) will be it but if u liked the grudge then check this out but seriously this movie seems like a typical scare flick nothing special here ,it really sucks to cuz i wanted to enjoy this movie",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
