"Iconic, unique, fresh, a definitive new horror","Scream With the countless number of teen slasher movies doing the rounds, it is too easy to watch scream and see simply another school serial killer movie that has just rolled off the factory production line. However, it was Wes Craven's 'Scream' that started the whole revival of the horror genre and re-invented the teen horror. Through no fault of its own, but rather a succession of bland rip-offs, not to mention a very successful spoof (Scary Movie), Scream's original impact has been severely dulled. Were Scream released today it would no doubt be moderately successful but would be instantly forgettable. But back in 1996 the teen horror market was wide open. The teenagers of the 90s were bored of traditional horror movies featuring haunted houses, vampires or deformed monsters. They had seen them all. So Wes Craven, having reinvigorated the horror genre once before with 'Nightmare on Elm Street', set out to do it again. This time, along with Kevin Williamson, who would go on to be creator of Dawson's Creek, created a new kind of horror  one that you could laugh at as well as scream at.What made Scream so successful is that it was never patronising, and displayed a strong sense of ironic self-awareness. It took every horror cliché in the book and turned them upside down. For the kids that had seen too many movies, there was now a movie for them. The characters did not follow the clichés, but in fact talked about them, and talked about what would happen if they were in a movie. This sense of irony may seem tired now, but when Scream came out it was new and exciting. There was rarely a need to scream 'don't go upstairs' or suchlike in Scream, because the characters themselves were saying that! The idea of the killer being amongst the students adds a fresh dimension to the film, as fear gives way to paranoia at not being able to trust anyone. The subversions of the accepted horror clichés, in particular in the opening ten minutes (I'm not going to give anything away for those who have not seen it) also contribute to making Scream a truly shocking movie. It was this sense of innovation that made Scream such a breath of fresh air for the horror genre, and it is only a shame that Craven's genius has been ripped off so many times that his work has dated far too quickly. Craven and Williamson have also created a new horror star  but it was not a particular character but just a costume with an iconic mask. The Scream mask has become just as symbolic, perhaps even more so, than that of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees.For any serious horror movie fans, Scream is essential viewing, if only to witness the film that started it all. The 'movie within a movie' idea was terrific, and would be taken even further in the sequel. The frequent references to classic horror movies, and reversals of accepted horror clichés, especially in the opening ten minutes) are also fun to watch out for. There is even a wonderful moment where one boy climbs in the bedroom window of his girlfriend  a scene that would be taken and used as one of the foundation for Williamson's successful teen series Dawson's Creek.The iconic mask, the one-liners, and the unique self-awareness when it comes to horror clichés make Scream a true original  accept no imitations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Hate To Admit It, But It's Great","There's more than a few reasons to hate `Scream'; the main reason would be that the film single-handedly resurrected the teen-slasher genre, a movie category that had long been beaten to death.  Because of the success of `Scream', witless horror crap like `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Urban Legend' got greenlighted, half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs, and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried `Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day.  `Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage.  But the truth of the matter is, `Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.The plot of `Scream' is very simple: a masked knife-wielding maniac is busy stalking the students of High, killing them off one by one.  The killer's inordinately obsessed with one girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who of course gets involved in the quest to unmask the killer.  The catch (in case you don't already know it), though, is brilliant.  Everyone in the film is familiar with all the slasher film conventions.  They know that you shouldn't walk in the woods alone at night.  They know that having wild sex is an unwritten invitation to be hacked to pieces.  They know not to say things to each other like `I'm going outside for a cigarette; I'll be right back.' -- such statements are virtual death warrants.   One of the best examples (and best characters) of this is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the film-obsessed nut of the film, who actually goes so far as to muse what `real' actors and actresses should play the other characters in the film, going so far as to joke about who gets to be Tori Spelling.  All the dumb conventions of slasher films are pulled out of the shadows, exposed for what they really are . . . and then, some of them get used anyway, because the characters willingly choose to ignore those conventions.  Some cliches are thrown away, while others are embraced.  `Scream' really turned the horror/slasher film genre on its ear, becoming the first truly suspenseful and exciting slasher film in many, many years simply because it suddenly had a million new avenues to explore.  The film's self-awareness allowed to move in brand-new directions . . . and suddenly, scenes that used to be predictable in other slasher films suddenly become incredibly intense in `Scream'.Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film -- as director of slasher classics like `Nightmare On Elm Street', he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then, much like `Scream's' script, chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true, or to go off in competely unexpected directions.  Either way, Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nail-biting, thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore, which is always a plus in great slasher films.  The acting ranges from barely mediocre to good -- Neve Campbell's okay as Sidney; Courtney Cox is pretty good as tart-tongued reporter Gail Weathers; Jamie Kennedy rules as Randy the film geek; and David Arquette is utterly bland and forgettable as Deputy Dewey Riley, the sad-sack policeman.  But casts in slasher films don't particularly matter anyway; the good ones are all about suspense, terror, and gore.  And in `Scream', Wes Craven provides massive amounts of all three of those criteria.The irony is, `Scream' spawned dozens of imitators, and by spawning imitators, all the new avenues opened up by `Scream' quickly got old and boring once more.  Still, purely on its own merit, it's an excellent film. The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's `Halloween', without question, but `Scream' actually runs a close second.  It's well worth watching.  Grade:  A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Clever, scary and funny - a must-see for horror fans","Making a brilliant, original horror film is pretty hard these days, since practically everything has already been told, and more than once. Using that premise, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson came up with Scream, whose cleverness derives from the fact that it knows every single stereotype of the genre and satirizes them.Take the opening sequence, for example: a young girl (Drew Barrymore) is making popcorn and waiting for her boyfriend when she suddenly receives a phone call. Normally, this would be a huge clichè, only this time the killer decides to play a little game (horror film quiz, naturally) with his victim. In fact, the only reason why he kills her is that she gave the wrong answer to one of his questions (those who haven't seen Friday 13th might want to skip that bit, as it spoils said movie's ending). That scene is both very scary (the murder is quite graphic and disturbing) and at the same time funny (it tests the characters', and the audience's, knowledge of the horror genre), and the rest of the film continues in the same vein: after the first killing, the masked psychopath starts disposing of other teenagers in the town of Woodsboro using the same technique. One of the targets is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother was raped and killed the year before. This implies the killer might be the same, but who could it be? Sidney's distant father? Her mother's lover (Liev Schreiber)? Or some random guy, with no motive at all?Fortunately, it is not the last category: this murderer has a motive and a plausible identity as well. But it isn't the payoff that makes Scream interesting; it's how Craven and Williamson get to it, by outlining the genre's conventions (some of which were actually invented by the director himself) and using them in a clever, if self-referential, way. The point of the movie is, the more you know of this kind of films (pay attention to the rules, stated by geeky film buff Randy), the more chances you have to survive (although you must take into account that the killer has seen the same movies). The in-jokes that would ruin other films are the very cause of Scream's success, with memorable scenes such as the villain mimicking the movie his victims are watching or Craven's unmissable cameo as a janitor wearing Freddy Krueger's outfit (not to mention priceless lines like ""Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative!"").In other words, Scream is a smart, effective horror film, which manages to amuse and scare in equal measures. Definitely worth watching, even if the two sequels (especially Scream 3) don't really match the original's intelligence and, forgive the expression, originality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's my all time personal favorite in the horror genre,"Scream is the best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's and it is my all time personal favorite film in the horror genre. I love this film I always did and I love to death! It was really the first movie that introduced me in to ""horror"" genre slasher films. It was directed from my favorite horror master Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It is a horror mystery like was Friday the 13th and April Fool's Day. Scream deserve legendary status. The movie spawned three sequels and the TV series that I did like. Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox and Rose McGowan work for me. It is about a high school teenage student in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, who becomes the target of a mysterious killer known as Ghostface who kills teens and who uses his obsession with scary movies. The first one is the best in the series and it is still one of the best horror films of all time.Wes Craven borrowed and used Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street mostly scenes for this movie. It mentions a lot of cult classic horror movies and till it's day it is still praised by fans. I enjoy this film I always do. This is my movie and my personal opinion! Scream follows the teenage girl Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who becomes targeted by a psychotic killer dressed in a ghostface mask who uses his obsession with scary movies. David Arquette plays police deputy, Dewey Riley who helps protect Sidney and Courtney Cox plays tabloid reporter, Gale Weathers. This is one of Craven's best along with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" that redefined the genre and Ghostface has become another popular slasher since. ""What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?"" Ghostface is one of the most popular and really scary character. The mask is so scary before new year on Halloween day I saw the mask putted on a front seat in the car and i was so scared, I thought it was the killer waiting on me but it was only a mask but a scary one.The Story begins after two high school students are murdered by the serial killer. Sidney Prescott becomes next victim of intelligent serial killer, Gale Weathers reporter and journalist is shure that serial killer is the same person who murdered Sidney's mother one year ago and now he's terrorizing Sidney her self. Deputy Sheriff Dewey wants to investigate the murders by himself, but attractive Gale seduced and confused him, so it's up to Sidney to find the killer, before he kills again to find the truth, she will must kill. I love also the characters: Matthew Lillard as Stu Macher, Rose McGowan as Tatum Riley and Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks. Great story and great soundtracks. I watch this movie thirty times and is still the best, I watch with my mom as a teen good times. I love the script the dialogues in this movie, I love Drew Barrymore as Casey Becker in here.10/10 Scream deserves a legendary status it is my personal favorite horror slasher film from Wes Craven in the franchise. I have the whole collection on Blu-ray discs and I have the first three movies on VHS tapes. I love this film to death I love it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Single-Handedly Revived the Slasher Genre,"Scream single-handedly revitalized the slasher genre, which was beyond dead as of 1996, and inspired countless spin-offs and attempted remakes in its wake. Wes Craven creates yet another horror masterpiece, and does so in an original and unique way. Add in the witty, self aware, reference-filled script by Kevin Williamson, which was rumored to have taken influence from Friday the 13th Pt 6, and you have one of the most iconic slashers ever made. Arguably the greatest opening scene to a horror movie ever, along with so many more iconic lines and scenes (Randy watching Halloween on the couch). The acting is next level by horror/slasher standards and has a very likable cast. Skeet Ulrich giving his best performance of his career, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Drew Barrymore ... do i need to go on? The influence and impact Scream had on the late 90's is undeniable, simply one of the best scary movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Scary, funny and clever  the best Scream movie by miles","Almost a year after someone raped and killed Sidney Prescott's mother in the small town of Woodsboro, someone is killing teenagers.  When Sidney herself becomes a target, the link is apparent and her missing father is a suspect. However, as with all good scary movies, everyone is a suspect.The film that sparked the revival of horror movies (Halloween H2O, I know what you did last summer, Urban Legend etc all followed..thanks a lot!). This stands out from all those (and it's lackluster sequels) by being really good and clever.  The story is nothing more than the standard slasher plot  but it avoids the cliches quite well.  In fact it uses the cliches as references and makes plenty of jokey references to other movies and the supposed rules of horror movies  we even have a quick flash of a caretaker dressed in Freddy's jumper and hat!That doesn't mean it's not scary  it is!  From the tragically horrible opening 10 minutes through each gory killing the tension is high and the shocks are real.  The plot twists nicely and the ending is much better than most slasher movies (including the absurd endings of 2 and 3).  This manages to be fresh, clever and scary  getting by any sticking moments with it's tongue in it's cheek.The cats are good  Campbell is a believable virgin, scarred by what happened to her mother  before she starts turning into Buffy the vampire slayer in parts 2 and 3.  Cox is excellent playing against type and David Arquette is funny as the Deputy Sheriff.  Kennedy as Randy is also funny as the movie geek  in fact he remains the highlight of the next 2 films.  The cast being filled of up and coming faces (including Ulrich) makes it even more thrilling when the `wrong' people get killed, technically all the cast are `unknowns' who usually make up the body count, so really anyone can potentially get offed.Overall funny black comedy, scary thrills and gory excitement.  A rare treat  a really good teen horror movie",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"For me an inventive mixed bag, but there's more good than not","I've gone back and forth in my feelings about ""Scream"" both times I've seen it, almost 20 years ago when it opened, and just now There are times when its meta-parody- but–still-scary approach to teen slasher films works quite well, especially the ending which manages to be funny, scary, over the top, and socially witty all at the same time. Other times it's too self conscious to actually be scary, but not surprising enough in its humor to really be as much fun as it could be.It's also a hard film to criticize, because the answer to almost every complaint (e.g. the actors playing high school kids all look like they're well into in their 20s) can always be 'but that's the whole point, it's always that way in these movies'. But one thing that does annoy me that isn't so easily shrugged off is that the cast seem to be in a number of different movies. Skeet Ulrich, for example, brings a surprising amount of realism and depth to his character, while Courtney Cox as an 'I'll do anything for a story' reporter plays a cartoon of a cartoon. This isn't of issue of 'good' versus 'bad' acting, but it does make figuring out just what the tone of the film is, more muddy than it needs to be.Probably the best thing about 'Scream' is it knows when to BE best. The opening and closing 15 minutes are the two strongest sections of the film, so if the middle is a little all over the place and sometimes repetitive, and a little more obvious in it's humor, that's not what you walk away remembering.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the coolest and more original horror movies I've ever seen,"I thoroughly enjoyed SCREAM. I haven't seen too many horror movies that struck me as great, especially since most of them are the same. I like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and SCREAM for the same reason, they are more original than the default horror flick.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is still mourning the death of her mother, who died nearly one year ago. She seems very distant, even from her best friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) and her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). She, and most everyone else, thought that the killer was already behind bars. But when people close to Sidney start to get killed, Sidney realizes the the killer is still at large. Deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) is there to protect Sidney and reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is there to get the scoop.I think the plot of this movie is very interesting and fun. The best part of it is that the killer does his murders in the style of horror movies. The rules of horror movies are often referred to and horror movies are even spoofed fairly often as well.The actors do a very good job. Neve Campbell is excellent as the primary target/victim and main character of this movie. David Arquette does a fair job as the inexperienced cop (but not as good as in the sequel) and Courtney Cox does a great job as the bitch reporter. Drew Barrymore did very good in her very brief part as Casey Becker. Jamie Kennedy does an OK job as Randy Meeks, the movie expert (but again, not as good as in the sequel). Roger Jackson is the best possible choice for the phone voice and Henry Winkler had a great cameo.The character development in this movie is good. You'll probably often yell ""Look behind you, moron"" or ""Get out of the room, idiot"" at your TV, which this movie is probably going for. Sidney is the most interesting character, with Dewey and and Gale at a close second.I was surprised that I found Scream 2 to be even better than Scream was. But both are really good. Go out and buy them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A classic,"With Scream (1996), Wes Craven re-invented & revitalised the slasher genre with this modern horror classic, Scream is funny, clever & scary, as a fright-masked knife maniac stalks high-school students.

The rest (on reflection) was a bit like a grown-ups version of Scooby Doo.If you want to calibrate my taste (and lack of), I prefer Wes' ""People Under the Stairs"".

It's a scream that they made something this original!,"In 1996, when I saw this in the theater, I was expecting to see a predictable movie. That we would just get bored with. But I was wrong. This has to be one of the most clever movies of the 90's. Believe me, this was an awesome thriller. Wes Craven should stick to movies like this,It had a wonderful cast. Funny lines. Scary moments. Classic horror scenes that will keep you at the edge of your seat. A movie that you'll rewind and want to watch again and again. And after the 50th time you watch it, you'll say, just one more time.So, if you have good taste, or are looking for something original, watch this film. And get the trilogy DVD set.

I screamed alright.,"I screamed because of how bad this movie is.We'll start with Wes Craven. The guy made one good movie in his whole career...A Nightmare On Elm Street. And even that could have been twice as good as it is. This is just more generic crap from the Craven factory.Second, the writer. Kevin Williamson. I think that's his name. I'm not going to look it up either because he doesn't deserve it. Not only did he write this horrible piece of crap, but he also wrote I Know What You Did Last Summer (AKA Prom Night the remake). The only good thing about that was the possibility for a spoof called I Forget What You Did Last Summer. But enough of that crap (literally), let's get back to Scream.The movie starts with a carbon-copy of the opening of When A Stranger Calls (which was fifty times scarier than everything Williamson and Craven did put together twice). Then we get into the actual movie, which is just constant references to other horror films.My main gripe with this movie is not the writing or directing...but the characters. All of them. We literally have NO reason to care about ANY of them. Rose McGowan is nice to look at, but that's as far as it goes. But the worst is the actual killer himself. I know they were trying to break the invincible horror movie killer cliché intentionally, but they went WAY too far. This guy falls over at the drop of a hat! Instead of being totally indestructible, he's just plain clumsy. And why on Earth was he dressed up in his disguise while at the grocery store in broad daylight? And when the identity of the killer is finally revealed, it's really no shock considering he did absolutely nothing for the whole film, not to mention that he has no motive except for some little soap-opera bullcrap that we're just supposed to believe. It doesn't come as any type of shock at all.Is this movie horror, or comedy? It tries to be both but never goes far enough in either direction and just ends up being neither funny nor frightening. Williamson and Craven think that referencing great horror movies means that theirs will be great, too. All that did was remind me of how awesome a movie like Halloween is and how pathetic this tripe is.But the worst to come out of this movie is actually it's influence on other horror films to come. The fresh teen cast, all featured on the cover art in the same exact fashion as this movie. If you're ever at the video store and see a box cover that mimics that of Scream's cover...just walk away. Because honestly...what Scream-influenced movie was even halfway decent? None.Scream is anti-horror. It's everything that a horror movie should NOT be. Fresh teen cast, bright cinematography, clumsy/harmless killer, fast-cut editing, banal directing, forgettable action movie score, references to other horror movies, too much comedy, unbelievable sequences, characters that we have no reason to care for, and to top it all off...it spawned countless imitators that were even worse! Do yourself a favor...don't watch this. Watch something great instead. Something like Rosemary's Baby.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Thrilling, refreshing horror tale","Watching this film for the first time in the basement of a four story house, with no-one else in was the perfect setting for this film. From the very first scene I was gripped and I could not wait for the climax to discover the murderer and his motives. The script was extremely original, as they had purposely set out to parodie the typical slasher style movie.It was written in a way that deceived and tricked and had you jumping out of your seats but also laughing at the paradoxical black humour.

The production values are excellent with atmospheric photography and settings, Wes Craven's direction is to date one of his best directing jobs, the music is haunting and the sound effects unsettling. The acting from Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette is top notch, and GhostFace as a character is iconic.

Enjoyed it a lot more than expected...,"I have been recently reading a lot of reviews of the latest film in this series, Scream 4. Now, for one reason or another I have never seen any of the 'Scream' films before well not all the way through anyway. Time to change that I thought and so here we are with the first one, Scream. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would, it doesn't take itself all that seriously and there's an awful lot more humour than I expected.We open with a mysterious voice calling up a girl called Casey, who is home alone about to watch a scary movie. She tries to blow him off but he is persistent and eventually begins to creep her out. Things don't end too well for Casey, or her boyfriend, Steve, after a masked assailant has finished with them. We then switch to another girl, Sidney, her mother had been murdered almost a year ago and her father is about to leave on a business trip. All the talk the next day at school is about the murder and on returning home Sidney receives a call from a man with a mysterious voice. She isn't so easily scared, but still she is attacked by the same masked assailant. Having fought him off, her boyfriend, Billy turns up just before Deputy Dewey. Having found a cell phone on him, Dewey arrests Billy and Sidney goes to stay the night with Dewey's sister, Tatum. As time goes by the bodies begin to mount up and this attracts the media, particularly ambitious reporter, Gale Weathers. It's only a matter of time before Sidney is to be the next on the list, and anyway, there's a score to settle and an awful lot of suspects.This made a refreshing change for me, a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time has all the scares and shocks of a more serious one. I liked it! Decent performances all round; Neve Campbell did a good job as Sidney, as did Skeet Ulrich as Billy. Also of note were Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Matthew Lillard as Stuart. Also nice cameos from Drew Barrymore as Casey, Wes Craven very briefly appeared as Fred the Janitor and Henry Winkler as Principal Arthur Himbry.There is a great soundtrack too, including an interesting acoustic rendition of 'Don't Fear the Reaper' when Sidney and Billy are first seen on screen together (very nicely done). I suspect, unfortunately, that the other films in the series may not live up to this rather good beginning, but we shall see If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a viewing, even if you're not really a fan of teen horrors (like me) Final verdict: Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The little parody that could.,"I recently watched this again for the first time since it hit theaters. Scream has been parodied and copied so many times the film itself is now a cliché but that doesn't change the brilliance of the original. In some ways Scream is an end cap to the modern slasher sub-genre beginning with Halloween on one end and culminating in Scream. Sure, there have been a number of slashers since but the genre hasn't dominated horror as they did in the two decades following Halloween. Scream isn't terribly original but by capitalizing on that it serves to masterfully sum up the genre and two decades of films before it. Wes Craven, where are you now?

Send yourself a copy,"I'm a sucker for a slasher. I even like the bad ones like ""Halloween: Resurrection"" and ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" but to me they're really fun and often have a really cool twist ending. So when an actual good slasher comes along, I'm all over it. As soon as ""Scream"" starts with its tremendous opening, you know you're in for a really fun and interesting film with originality. ""Scream"" ticks all the boxes and is probably the best slasher film ever!Wes Craven's known for his ""Nightmare on Elm St."", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and such. All have been OK, but I think Wes has really found his place in the teen slasher genre. He makes it fun and original with the help of the excellent writers who are actually really clever at creating irony plus funny lines and characters.The thing that holds a slasher together is its characters and ""Scream"" has really memorable characters. Courtney Cox is a delight as the originally annoying TV presenter that eventually turns into someone who we actually really like. David Arquette is also really funny as Deputy Dewey the policeman. In fact the whole cast is brilliantly fun, including Matthew Lillard who is suitably hammy as the friend of the group.Aside from the memorable characters and sharp wit, ""Scream"" is also really exciting and suspenseful. There's even a chase scene that lasts a good 15 minutes. A rarity where nowadays its a quick 2 second chase in the woods. The cinematography and camera movements are also really interesting. The camera sometimes has this dream-like quality to it that suits the film really well. ""Scream"" never gets dull, it's tense and exciting right up to the shocking end twist that really fulfills your expectations.""Scream"" grasps you by the throat from the minute it starts and doesn't let go. It's memorable and really exciting fun. If you're a fan of slashers like me then ""Scream"" should be at the top of your list. The sequels are quite good as well, especially the incredible latest instalment ""Scream 4"" that is probably on par with this incredible original.

Clever,"I don't think I can come up with a better argument that Wes Craven should never have written his movies alone than Scream. I think he was a perfectly competent filmmaker when it comes to the visual aspects, and his ability to manage actors had improved over the years. However, he was always a subpar writer. Even A Nightmare on Elm Street, his best work that he wrote himself, really needed another pass by a better writer. Scream, though, from a script by Kevin Williamson, is Craven bringing his professional ability to a clever and well-built screenplay.The movie famously opens with Drew Barrymore's Casey, a high school student, preparing popcorn and taking a series of increasingly threatening phone calls from a male voice over the phone. Having kidnapped her boyfriend and tied him to a chair in her backyard while quizzing her on horror movie trivia, ending with both her and her boyfriend's gruesome murder. This was a shocking thing at the time because the marketing had put Barrymore, the biggest movie star at the time appearing in the film, front and center of every trailer and poster. Killing her off early established that the film wasn't going to follow any rules. Of course, Hitchcock had already done this fifty years before in Psycho (a film that gets quoted and referred to directly late in the film, so I think Williamson understood that he was being clever but not completely original).Then we meet our real main character, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), and if there is a wonderful center to this film, it's Sidney Prescott. It takes a little while to figure out where she's coming from, but Sidney's mother was murdered and raped a year before by a man now in prison named Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) for the crime. She's a hurt, young woman who is still dealing with the trauma of her mother's rumored promiscuity and brutal murder when a series of new, brutal murders erupts in her otherwise sleepy town. She had a boyfriend, Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), with whom she has yet to have sex, insisting on a PG-13 relationship (not the first self-aware movie reference the movie will have). The two are two-fifths of a friend group that also includes Tatum (Rose McGowan), her boyfriend Stu (Matthew Lillard), and the horror movie obsessed Randy (Jamie Kennedy).The movie is at its best when the focus is on Sidney and her sense of trauma. There's a great scene where she goes into the girls' bathroom at school, hiding in a stall, where a mean cheerleader details her theory on how Sidney is making up a lot of what's going on in the town in order to attract attention. It's really painful to Sidney, but she says nothing. Neve Campbell's quietly pained performance here is probably the best performance Wes Craven ever got from an actor.The murderer, nicknamed Ghostface because of the use of a cheap Halloween costume that resembles a ghost, attacks Sidney, which, when combined with the suspicious arrival of Billy into her room through her window moments later, convinces her that Billy is the killer. This is eventually cleared up when Sidney receives a threatening phone call while Billy is still in prison, and it's about here that the real self-awareness from Randy starts coming in. I find Randy's meta-humor amusing (especially when, near the end, he's talking to the film Halloween on a television, telling Jamie Lee Curtis to turn around while, at the same time, it's Jamie Kennedy telling someone named Jamie to turn around when the killer is right behind him), but I'm not really sure what it adds other than a bit of thin cleverness. Granted, it's largely amusing, but I feel like it kind of ends up distracting from Sidney herself.The finale of the film is a long party scene after curfew has been called (I'm not sure the movie understands how curfews work, but whatever) where the game of red herrings all over the place comes into play. It recalls the much less successful Deadly Blessing because the characters are much better established here, and it's not really all that heavy handed. It just kind of ups the level of guesswork in the finale in order to keep the audience on its toes. Those who love the whole, ""I can't guess the killer"" thing adore this kind of mechanic, but I end up feeling just a bit jerked around a bit.Now, I've actually seen this film a couple of times (though it's been a while), but I remembered enough to recall who the killer was before I started the film. With that in mind, it becomes really obvious who it is, with the film giving just enough curveballs to where the first-time viewer will get thrown off the trail.The self-awareness ends up working against the film, slightly, in the final moments of the film when the main character veers from ""I don't need a motive because nothing matters,"" to ""I have a very specific motive, and here it is"" in seconds. It can't seem to decide if it's a satire of the genre or an earnest attempt at one on a certain level. I also kind of hate the musical score, which Mickey Mouses every moment in the film. I honestly think the film would be a fair bit stronger without a non-diagetic score at all.Still, I really do enjoy the film overall. Neve Campbell is the core of it, but there are a host of very nice supporting turns including David Arquette as the earnest and somewhat bumbling deputy Dewey (a seeming callback to the bumbling cops in The Last House on the Left, but much more effectively used) and Courteney Cox as the tabloid journalist who wrote the book trying to clear Cotton of the crime that Sidney was key witness against him for who has a wonderful antagonistic relationship with Sidney that helps drive some of Sidney's emotional movements. I get the appeal of the who done it elements, though they have a very limited charm to me personally. I think if I got into those sort of mechanical parts of the story, I'd like this more like its biggest fans.As it is, the film is a solid outing from a clever script handled professionally by someone who'd been making movies for more than twenty years. It's entertaining, and it even works on multiple viewings. It doesn't have the promise of Craven's earlier quality work, but it entertains well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Savior of the '90s Horror Genre,"By the 1990s horror had grown stagnant due to the numerous sequels that were preceding films like 'Friday the 13th', 'Halloween' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street.' But when Kevin Williamson wrote the script for 'Scream' it was destined to be a winner. 'Scream' is one of the scariest 1990s films I have seen in my teen years since I was only three when it came to the big screen. The genius of the film is that the device known as a telephone/cell phone can used against us in sinister ways which makes us fearful of our safety in our community. I was impressed with the performance of the cast and of course Wes Craven's creativity in the manner of the film's deaths and look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well worth a watch..,"Wes Craven has been contributing to the horror genre for years, with films such as the Hills have eyes, Swamp thing and Nightmare on Elm street. All of these films which have over the years become classics and help inspire the horror films of today. So where does Scream fit in? Is it another Wes Craven classic? Well to perfectly honest, yes! I was never a great fan of horror films, I always found that their plots were too predictable, but scream changed all that. It takes the horror genre we all know, and turns it upside down. This is done by an exciting and unpredictable plot which was excellently portrayed by such people as Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard, who each added a certain something to the already brilliant storyline. With one of the most memorable and sinister faces from the big screen, it has struck fear into the hearts of many since day one. Wes Craven has done it again...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
No shocker and not even a leg shaker,"When a good friend of mine introduced me this flick as a ""classic"" of the horror genre I thought he was actually joking. I had never watched this movie because it seemed rather bad and stereotypical to me and when my friend convinced me to give it a try and when I heard that a new fourth part has come out I opened my mind and watched the whole trilogy. The first movie was actually about as bad as I expected.I mean there are tons of great horror movies out there to get discovered like the classics ""Nosferatu"", ""The mummy"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" to only mention a few or even more recent stuff like ""Jeepers Creepers"", ""My little eye"" ""5150 Elm Street"" or the more exotic stuff like ""Marebito"", ""Infection"" or ""Two sisters"" without talking about legendary and eerie series like ""Twin Peaks"", ""X Files"" or ""Millenium"". But the Scream trilogy is amongst the worst stuff I have ever seen. Even other overrated and popular stuff like ""I know what you did last summer"", ""Final destination"" or ""Resident Evil"" is fairly better executed. I really don't know why this fairly overrated American slasher crap and fast food cinema is actually so popular. Even the parodies of this movie in the ""Scary Movie"" series are more intriguing than the original.Well, the movie is at least very entertaining and you tend to watch it until the end to know who is the murderer. I must admit that I bet on the wrong guy and that the ending quite surprised me but when I thought that I finally found a positive point, the final conclusion is so superficial and ridiculous that the surprise factor is already erased once again. This movie is simply made to entertain and switch your brain off and from that point of view, you get an average junk food flick but I really ask myself why there are already three follow ups of this mediocre movie until now.I know that the movie itself parodies some horror movie flicks and doesn't take itself too serious and I really laughed a few times but the path between humour and ridiculous dumbness is very small in this movie. The dialogues are horrible, the acting is mostly wooden and distant, the scarface killer rushes into every opened door like a retarded fool and is simply embarrassing, the killing scenes are quite predictable and as soon as an intriguing and suspenseful atmosphere is established, a stupid comedy scene scraps it all. The movie doesn't seem to know if it rather tends to be a parody, a suspense or a horror flick and tries desperately to be all of this at the same time. That creates a potpourri that seems at least interesting and fresh for the first third of the movie but the originality factor is simply used after a while and neither the characters nor the scenario nor the overall atmosphere are able to grip me and keep me hanging on for the last two thirds.This movie is simply made to be watched as a teenager with a couple of friends and some beers. It's a fast food party movie but for any horror movie or suspense flick maniac, this movie may be of a very low interest.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A legend is born.,"A killer in a ghost mask starts a killing spree, a group of friends try their best to unmask the killer, and stop the bloodshed.My favourite 90's movie, this film managed to do what Halloween did twenty years previously, bring a genre to life. Many films followed this one, some were good, most were poor, none of them managed to pack the punch this one did, I know what you did last Summer being the best of the efforts.It's slick, stylish, sexy, it's iconic.

Better Than Most Slashers...,"I am giving Scream nine stars out of ten, because I think, for what it is, it is a near perfect movie. The storyline is simple: a girl in her late teens named Sidney Prescott is still dealing with the murder of her mother a year ago. And then, just two or three days before the one year anniversary of her mother's death, a killer dressing himself up in a spooky Halloween costume called 'Father Death' (later called Ghostface) starts murdering people in the small peaceful town of Woodsboro. And he makes Sidney his main target. From there on, it is a ""Whodunit"" murder mystery, where any of the other characters in the movie could literally be the person behind the mask doing the killing, and only at the end of the film will you find out who it is.Here are some reasons why Scream is awesome, and way above the (vast) majority of slashers:-The acting is very good. There isn't a single bad actor in the entire movie. Most slashers (and horror films in general) have acting that is just OK at best.-None of the characters in this film are interchangeable. There isn't one character that feels like they exist only for the sole purpose of dying.-The opening scene is one of the best opening scenes in any horror movie, ever. Just perfect.-This was a breath of fresh air in the horror genre when it was first released back in 1996. The horror genre was all but dead, and then Scream came along and gave it a much needed boost. Scream has since spawned (thus far) three sequels, and has become one of the most popular horror series.There are other reasons why this movie is awesome, but instead of continuing to type them out, I recommend that you just watch it (if you haven't already) and see for yourself. If you're a fan of slashers, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
If you are looking for cleverly crafted thriller Scream is most definitely for you.,"Scream is often disregarded as just another cheesy slasher film to those who have not seen it, or are not a fan of the horror genre. Though yes Scream is considered a slasher film it marks something different for the horror slasher genre. I admit I entered watching this film with an expectation of slasher trademarks, bad acting, easy kills, bad decisions made by the main characters, a masked killer. Let me say I was more than pleasantly surprised by the artistry in this film in comparison to its predecessors such as Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. Wes Craven has been credited with the classic film direction for Nightmare on Elm, but Scream takes you to another level of creativity. With a sense of mystery as well as the gore of a slasher it makes for an enjoyable experience.The movie acts as an interesting double narrative, allowing the watcher to become invested in a murder mystery, while also getting a commentary on prior slasher film conventions. Characters are found making direct references to previous slashers sometimes even making fun of them. There are also several visual tricks used in reference to past films. One of the easiest ones to pick up on is one of the characters in Scream Billy's striking resemblance to Johnny Depps character in, you guessed it, Nightmare on Elm Street. There are also several other little nuances lovers of classic horror can pick up on , from cameos to name similarities.If you are looking for cleverly crafted thriller Scream is most definitely for you. It is a movie that continuously keeps you guessing with just the right amount of jump scares and red herrings.

One of the scariest slasher movies ever made--one of the years best films. ***1/2 out of ****,"SCREAM (1996) ***1/2Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Liev Schreiber, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Winkler Director: Wes Craven   Running time: 111 minutes   Rated R (for strong grizzly violence and gore, language, and some sexuality)By Blake French:""Scream"" is the mother of all teen slasher films. From the opening sequence to the somewhat silly closing cliffhanger, it is one of the scariest productions of the past several years. Now, about the opening sequence, it features a penetrating Drew Barrymore receiving prank phone calls from a man with a deep, mysterious voice, who becomes more and more conversationally aggressive as they talk. ""What's your name--because I want to know who I'm looking at."" After building up some very effective momentum, the scene has a heart-stopping climatic payoff that isn't only  pointless gore, but terrifying suspense. It is moments like these that make ""Scream"" one of the best movies of 1996.""Scream"" centers on a high school girl named Sidney Prescott, a modestly productive young woman who spends much of her time alone and with her boyfriend, Billy. She is approaching the anniversary of her mother's murder, whose killer has been convicted and sentenced to death. Sydney's school is in the process of mourning the brutal murder of two fellow classmates, and the pupils aren't exactly sympathetic.One night Sidney is home alone, and receives a phone call similar to the one in the opening scene. Sidney is tormented in that call, and after an exchange of a few unfriendly words, attacked by a dark individual wearing a white ghost mask. She fights him off, however, and lives another day, much in regard to the mysterious appearance of her boyfriend and a young, squeamish cop named Dewy.The presentation of Sidney's life is not one-dimensional. The overlook on her schooling experiences, classmates, relatives, friends, and teachers are all believable. Strongly supporting the character are the details and sub-characters.It is nearly impossible to watch ""Scream"" without making a list of assumed suspects to the numerous killings that take place. Here is my prediction list of murderer suspects, not telling who, if anyone, is the correct guess:· Dewy, the young police officer who suspiciously shows up at nearly every crime scene, and has somewhat of a psycho personality.· Sidney's boyfriend, Billy, who is actually sent to prison for a short period of time after being accused as a prime suspect. He also appears at a crime site unexpectedly.· Sidney's  father, whom has motive for murder and is nowhere to be found locally.· A crazy video store clerk who is obsessed with scary movies and who I forget the details of.Another element that makes ""Scream"" so great is the content of the murders. The victims aren't just helpless plot puppets waiting to die like a mannequin, but real people who want to live. Each puts up a good fight in defending themselves, and several nearly escape the killer. The characters who die are often unexpected, members of the main cast--making this production unpredictable.The performances are electrifying in Wes Craven's highly acclaimed horror film. The actors act with dramatic intensity and the characters are perfectly cast. Each character is explored with suspicion, and due to Craven's direction, the villain's identity remains a mystery until the lazy finale. I am an experienced filmgoer, and I thought that I had the killer picked out at mid point in the film. But I was so wrong--the film had me fooled all along, and that is not an easy thing to do. I had no clue of who the killer actually was. ""Scream"" contains so many twists are turns that by the end of the movie, I couldn't have correctly predicated the killer's identity if my life depended on it.Brought to you by Dimension Films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

An ok film...for horror.,"First of all, I have to admit that I am not a fan of the horror genre, there are a few that I really like, but for the most part...not a fan.  With that said, let me get on with the review.I thought ""Scream"" was an ok film, it had a lot of good things going for it, but there were a few things that just didn't sit well with me.  Overall, I thought the story was actually pretty good and quite suspenseful.  The comedy was also just spectacular in the film.  The best character (hands-down, no contest) in the film is Randy (played by Jamie Kennedy)! His character and the way he says things totally made the movie for me.Alone with Jamie Kennedy, the rest of the cast was pretty good as well. Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Winkler all did great jobs with their characters.Like I mentioned earlier, the story is actually pretty good in this film. The only complaint that I have is that there are a number of murders and killings that take place in the film that are completely useless (I guess that defines a horror film).  For instance, it is never explained why the killer kills Drew Barrymore and what she has to do with the entire story....maybe that's cause she DOESN'T!!!  I just don't like that they always seem to throw in a killing here and there that have nothing to do with the story, just an excuse to have another gruesome death scene.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  There were a few other problems I had with the film here and there, but nothing I can't deal with.If you like horror films, and especially if you like teen-slasher films, then you should definitely see this film.  If you are like me, and just like the occasional horror film, then you may also want to check out this film. If you do see the film, I hope you enjoy it.

What is your favourite scary movie?,"By the 1990s the Slasher genre was becoming stale, filled with clichés, countless sequels and very predictable and uninventive. Likely two men was able to play on this, Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven was able to play on this and made a really excellent take on Slashers.In the small town of Woodsboro two teenagers (Drew Barrymore and Kevin Patrick Walls) are shockingly murdered, a year after a woman was raped and murdered in the town centre. Very quickly the town is thrown into turmoil, with the media reporting on it, but the teens do not seem to be worried. The killer, known as Ghost-face soon targets another Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the daughter of a victim, who luckily escapes. But Ghost-face is going to rest and goes on a mission to take down Sidney and anyone who stands in his way.Scream works because it is set in a world where horror movies do exist and teenagers know clichés. It is a self-aware horror film and has a lot of references to classic horror films like Halloween. Scream is forced to be inventive and Craven who is a master of the horror genre, so knew what he was doing with this film.Even if Scream was not made with a post-modern, self-aware horror with a comic edge, it still would have been an excellent horror film and one of the best slashers around. Craven and Williamson made sure their characters were fully developed, likable or at least normal. Sidney is a character with a lot of a baggage because of her mother's death and afraid to get close to people. She is a likable because is a friendly, smart, decent girl who is also tough. Sidney's friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) was tough no-nonsense girl who could have easily been the clichéd slut role, but that was avoided because she was a good friend and competent. Courteney Cox plays a unpleasant journalist who cares more ratings and book sales more then safety of people and emotional harm. She is not a journalist who is looking to report the truth or for the public interest. But she does come good at the end. The characters of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Stuart (Matthew Lillard) offer a lot of comic relief particular because of their knowledge of horror films. And David Arquettte is solid as a competent police officer who has a typical brother-sister relationship with Tatum.Cavern made sure Scream was exciting with a lot of action, violence and creative deaths. I particular like his technique of using the camera to follow the victims and move it around the house, adding excitement and intrigue. He knows how to build suspects and he does keep you guessing. I don't get scared watching horror films but you do care for Sidney and the idea of being home alone at night can make you more tense.I do have a criticism. They does not seem to be much of a reaction at the school hearing about two of their peers being brutally murdered. Most people seem to be very causal about it and saw it as something fun, not worried about a serial killer being on the loose or just saw it as an excuse for a party. Come on, if they was a murder in a small town there would be more sadden, grief and worry. Personally I would have focused on this collective reaction, but I am a more serious person and possibly would have a thriller/a social piece.Overall, Scream is certainly a worthy horror film, no manner what generation of horror fan you are.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Scream? Yawn, more like...","I have to say I was seriously underwhelmed by this movie, though possibly more than I would otherwise have been had there not been so much hype about how wonderful it was.The first sequence with Drew Barrymore was very well done, and would have made a good short film, but the whole ""aren't I cool having all the characters in my 'horror' movie talking about horror movies"" thing got very old very fast; it was a good idea, but overused to extremes.However, I was more put off by the ""we're making a movie for teenagers so we must make sure we explain everything VERY CLEARLY so everyone knows exactly what's going on"" approach to the script: for the first half hour or so it seemed like we'd get a couple of minutes of plot, then an Exposition Break as some character had to explain to some other character exactly why they disliked them, or what their personal problems were, or whatever. Dull, dull, dull.In the end I gave up and watched the last half on fast forward. Ah, so that's who did it. Well, ho hum.Shame, I really liked Wes Craven's first 'Nightmare on Elm St' movie and the last half of 'Last House On The Left' is pretty much unforgettable (then again, so is the appalling dialog in the first half!); I think I'll have to watch both of them again to remind myself that he could make good movies once.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Make Your Last Breath Count,"What's really interesting is that this is a film that is essentially a combination of parody and serious film, and manages to be both by creating a truly unique structure.In the film, the director very intelligently uses the clichés of a horror film, creating an almost parodic atmosphere, and yet not going out of the scope of a serious film in any way.Paying homage to the horror film itself, the director creates an interesting atmosphere and openly shows us through dialogues that he plays with various elements of the horror film. The film is unusually interesting and entertaining precisely because of such a combination, and when it comes to violence alone, it is definitely appropriate for a horror film, it is brutal and bloody and gives the film the tone of a real horror movie.The cast did a great job, they made the characters fun and interesting.

Horror will never be the same again...,"The opening ten minuets of this film sum up a new age of slasher film in a brutal and chilling way. Scream isn't Halloween or Friday the 13th but something new and refreshing to the horror/slasher genre. The opening scene consists of the standard horror movie set up but before you feel comfortable enough to condemn the film from the start the brilliance of this movie comes into play. The Voice - Roger Jackson.The voice is so significant, so unique that it attracts you in a way in which you feel that your being spoken to directly. Another underlining aspect of this film isn't the killer but what the killer is wearing. The Ghostface costume/mask is so significant that when seen it is instantly recognisable. The eeriness of the costume adds to the effect of the film because it allows the audience to try and play a guessing game of who it can be. A guessing game which goes on till the final few scenes.A chilling film which ensures that horror movies will never be the same again.It's a scream, baby.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scream (1996),"Directed by Wes Craven. Starring Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan, Drew Barrymore, W. Earl Brown, Joseph Whipp, Henry Winkler, (voice) Roger L. Jackson. (R)High school student Campbell and her friends become the targets of a motivated mass murderer slicing up the small town of Woodsboro; the twist here is that these savvy teens have seen enough horror movies to know the ""rules"" for how to survive (no guarantee that any of them will consistently remember to follow them, however...). Hip, blood-soaked contemporary horror film revitalized the slasher genre, updating it for a new generation haphazardly defined by glib irony. Kevin Williamson's self-aware script and Craven's veteran directorial skill serve the material well; it's an imperfect concoction, to be sure, with the occasional cheap scare tactic, head-shaking implausibility, and a tendency toward overkill during the final reel, but it's overall a sharp, funny and sporadically suspenseful venture into genre cross-breeding. Though later rehashes and self-parody has diminished the impact, its opening sequence still ranks as a true virtuoso of horror filmmaking. Followed by three sequels and a television series.75/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

More Than I Expected,"I decided to see this because it has become a cultural icon. Having seen so many slasher movies, I decided long ago they just weren't very interesting.

It's all there. Of course, there's about ten ""jump out"" scares and all the stereotypes. Still, it kept me going. There is layer upon layer of surprises and we actually do care somewhat about the people in the film. The mask must have been quite the thing when this first appeared.

"""Scream"" - 15 years later, it's still the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slasher movies!","OK, here it is, finally, the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slashers: ""Scream"" is the popular 1996 slasher epic that single-handedly signaled the return of the slasher movie, and also single-handedly revitalized the sagging horror genre. But there was a twist: a large part of ""Scream's"" massive success had to deal with its open acknowledgment of its source material, lending the movie a level of self-awareness that had never been done before in horror (or at the very least, done very successfully).The closest horror movies I can probably think of before then might have been ""The Lost Boys"" (1987), or maybe even ""An American Werewolf in London"" (1981). (And yes, I do realize there is a possibility that I could be wrong, but those are the only two I can immediately think of.)The movie also represented a marriage of old and new: horror maestro Wes Craven (""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""The Last House on the Left,"" ""Shocker,"" - to name a few), the man behind the camera of this wildly inventive slasher, was a seasoned professional in the horror genre at the time, yet his career at the point up until ""Scream"" seemed seriously lagging - despite the mild success of the reality-bending ""New Nightmare"" in 1994. Enter into the picture newbie screenwriter Kevin Williamson, whose inspired script for ""Scream"" took the lessons of past slasher flicks and injected a hip, knowing, mid-1990s cynicism and self-consciousness into the material that didn't ride the fine line into camp territory: the kids in this movie spoke and acted like they *knew* they were in a horror film. Together, these two gave us horror movie heaven - ""Scream.""Despite the over-riding sense of self-knowing and movie-referencing humor, ""Scream"" is still edge-of-your-seat entertainment of the first order. It's a ludicrous premise that in theory should not work, but it does: the movie is still pretty damn scary (in addition to being gruesomely bloody and gory), even though all the characters are keenly aware of the ""facts"" of horror movies yet still knowingly break the rules established by the three godfathers of the slasher genre - the aforementioned ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (my personal favorite slasher movie), ""Halloween"" (1978), and ""Friday the 13th"" (1980).The film's plot is deceptively simple: Somebody is taking their love of scary movies too far, and they're making a killing (pun intended). The classic opening double-murder sequence (featuring Drew Barrymore) sets the tone for the rest of the movie, and that is a non-stop roller coaster ride of thrills, chills, and laughs. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell, whose performance here officially ushered her into being the MTV generation's scream queen) leads an all-star cast of a slasher movie that also doubles as a brilliantly thrilling whodunit.So whodunit? It obviously wasn't the ultra-feisty reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), nor was it Sidney's best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) or Tatum's bumbling older brother, Deputy Dewey (David Arquette). Or was it one of them? Either way, other suspects include Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich, whose character's name is an obvious reference to the late Donald Pleasance's Dr. Sam Loomis from ye old ""Halloween""), Tatum's mentally deficient boy-toy Stu (Matthew Lillard), or was it the movie-loving uber-geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy)?I've seen ""Scream"" countless times over the years, several of those times were in a high school graphic design class my sophomore year. I got into it around '99 or 2000, three or four years after the fact, but I loved it from the opening moments. Upon a refresher viewing today to mark the 15th anniversary of the film's release, I realize ""Scream"" has not lost of any its impact. But because ""Scream"" was the movie that revitalized the horror and slasher genres in a single dose, it didn't take long for imitators to follow its self-knowing, movie-referencing satirical formula, and some of those imitators include its three sequels (released in 1997, 2000 and 2011, respectively). (And how about those slasher movie parodies in the ""Scary Movie"" series? Isn't it ironic that ""Scream"" was initially titled ""Scary Movie""?) It was a formula that worked once and only once.Most famously, perhaps, ""Scream"" firmly established once and for all, the ""rules"" for surviving horror movies. Drum roll, Randy:1) Sex = death,2) No drinking or doing drugs, and3) Never say, ""I'll be right back"" because you won't be.15 years later, ""Scream"" is just as thrilling, entertaining, and funny as it was when I first saw it as an impressionable teenager in 1999 or 2000. Wes Craven has always had a way for directing scary movies with lively and three-dimensional characters, but ""Scream"" carried the revered horror master and his chief screenwriter into mainstream blockbuster territory, three more times, even.(Yes, I loved - that's right, I said I loved ""Scream 4""; it's the best and funniest since the original.)10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scream (7/10),"Wes Craven officially supplemented himself on the Mount Rushmore of horror once his nontraditional slasher film Scream hit theaters. Utilizing a style of writing and dialogue that is closer to that of a midday soap show than a feature film, Wes Craven successfully pulled off a fun ""who done it"" slasher. The film does a great job at poking fun of horror clichés and has an aspect of unpredictability. Even though Neve Campbell is the star, the show stealers are Courtney Cox and David Arquette with great character development and chemistry.

Scary Movie,"Of course Scary Movie was the working title of this Wes Craven vehicle, which got hijacked by the Wayans to make their spoof of this (and other Horror movies of that time). Craven also had made the latest (til then that is) Nightmare movie, called ""New Nightmare"". It was the first one that got into the whole ""we are aware this is a movie, while we're doing it"", but wasn't as successful as the Scream movies became. Even though it was a success in America it did take almost a year to come out in Germany for example.And while the movie ""plays"" with rules and has fun with it, it is also pretty scary. Of course friends of mine didn't like the fact, that it tried to be funny and scary. Some people like their horror movies to be straight and not fourth-wall breaking. But this one is really a great example how to do it. It also helped Kevin Williamson to become famous (at least for awhile, he worked with Robert Rodriguez - Faculty) and Wes Craven to be ""hot"" once again.As you can see, I have not really written anything about the movie yet.

Scream deconstructs the slasher genre to make a screamingly thrilling film.,"Specific types of film will most likely follow a formula, a structure that forms the basis of its narrative. The slasher genre is the most procedural of them all. Expendable characters meeting their untimely demise where the virgin individual survives and prepares for the sequel. Scream knows this. Craven's innovation and genre competence enables this slasher to be self-referential, providing both humour and thrills. A small town experiences a serial killer dressed in a Halloween costume, as they slaughter several students from a school. Its deconstruction is the composition of the story's construction. The outstandingly memorable opening sequence with Barrymore sets the narrative's tone instantaneously. The serial killer toys with her psychologically by playing a game of movie trivia, a quiz I would like to participate in if I were to be brutally murdered. This referential humour complements the violent stabbing and intestine pulling rather well. Craven, clearly a fan of horror films, shows his adoration for the genre by understanding it. He acknowledges specific tropes and utilises them to their full potential. Various characters are one-dimensional, but that's the point. Does it necessarily make a good film? Yes and no. Exposing weaknesses in a genre and yet still using them shows that you are still conforming to the set rules, as opposed to making it that little bit more fresh. Don't get me wrong, this is enjoyably innovative, but tries so hard that specific twists in the story are underwhelming. The constant use of horror references nearly made my ears bleed. 'Carrie', 'Friday the 13th' and even Craven's own film! It was like a tsunami, and I wish it was just a wave instead. Also the musical score was overwhelming occasionally, although excellent use of 'Halloween' in the background. Still, an entertainingly unconventional thriller that relishes in its meta nature. Keep an eye out for that severe weather warning though, because Gale Weathers rapidly approaches and she owns the film, taking no prisoners.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The movie that defines a slasher film.,"This is the movie that defines a slasher film, where a serial killers dressed in black with a ghost-face mask stalks teenager Sidney (Neve Campbell) one year after the death of her mother. Soon, Sidney's classmates begin to fall victim to the slasher, and Sidney must find out with the killer is and if these incidents have anything connected with her mother's death.Filmed in a high school setting, the actors did provide a believable and serious performance nonetheless, providing enough drama and suspense to make the horror film watchable. The scenes with the killer's voice over the phone, the killer chasing the victims and the victims hiding and trying to escape from the unseen killer will send chills down your spine and cover your ears to prevent you from being creeped out at those jumping-out-at-you moments.Campbell's character was overly dramatic at times and appeared too angry at the role; Drew Barrymorre would have made a better lead actor, but her smaller role in the movie was memorable to say the least.

Say a prayer for the youth of America.,"Sidney Prescott becomes the next target of a maniacal killer who has already killed two kids from her school. As tabloid babe Gale Weathers gets involved, and starts to dig deeper, it becomes apparent that the killer may be connected to the man who raped and killed Sidney's mother. Could it be that the wrong man is in in prison for the crime? If so? Just who is responsible for this new rein of terror?Scream opens with what has now become 10/12 minutes of classic horror folklore, where director Wes Carpenter sets out the marker for the reinvigoration of the genre synonymous with his name. What follows is a full blooded exciting picture that is laced with genre references and bona fide pinging humour. Teaming up with hipster screenwriter Kevin Williamson, Craven has assembled a roll call of stock teen-slasher characters, filled the roles out with a cast list reading like the young, pretty and the restless, and embraced the genre he loves while also subverting it. Clever clever stuff indeed.Retaining its ""mystery who done it"" core throughout, red herrings and misdirections come and go, Scream is also a truly scary {and violent} picture. As it makes the knowing genre faithful laugh, it also makes them jump, squirm and shout at the screen. Particularly during the last, excellently constructed quarter when the terror ups on poor Sidney and the reveal induces cries of ""what the hell"". Subsequent revisits to Scream has you spotting all the little pointers in the story that you missed on the first viewing, but even knowing the reveal fails to dim Scream's lasting appeal. Also of note is that the cast get a chance to act, something that is a rarity in the sub-genre that Scream is the flag bearer for. Neve Campbell, Jamie Kennedy and Courtney Cox benefiting the most from the sly and adroitly written script. Craven's film spawned two sequels, the first is equally dazzling and watchable, the second not so. While it was also responsible for a cascade of imitators and comedy spoofs that would follow. None however have captured the essence, the nous or the style of Scream. It remains the daddy and the bench mark in an often maligned and rarely realised teen-slasher genre. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Over-rated Nonsense,"No matter what critics or anyone else say, I think that this film is not good at all.  The scary part about this film and the series is that it has probably made more money at box office then the unholy trinity of Italian Horror(Dario Argento, Mario Bava, & Lucio Fulci) has ever made in their life.  One problem is its poor attempt at being humorous.  Scream(1996) is a popular film because many people are desperate to see a well made horror film.  The acting is below average and technically, the movie is unimpressive and uninspired.Its a shame that Wes Craven sold himself out to do this overbearing ""horror"" film.  This was made for a generation of people who have no idea of what a great horror film is or what makes them scary.  The whole thing is formulatic and genetic when it comes to the movie itself.  I prefer the slasher flicks of the early 80's to this movie and its clones because they were filled with better murder scenes, more gore, and a lot more evil villains.

The One That Started It All,"Scream (1996)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Say what you will about the actual film but there's no denying that this Craven film put the horror genre back on the map. It's been nearly a decade since I last watched this film and on this newest viewing I was rather shocked to see how much more impressed I was with it. The story is pretty simple as a killer wearing a ghost face mask stalks teens in a small community and he might have some sort of connection to one (Neve Campbell) whose mother was butchered a year earlier. This killer, however, has his own set of rules that those he stalks must play by. SCREAM was a massive hit back in the day and it saved the genre from its own self destruction and nearly fifteen years later the film rightfully deserves the label of being a classic. While it's far from a masterpiece it at least manages not to lose any of its impact that made it so special when it was first released. I'm not going to sit here and say that SCREAM broke and created all the rules because there were horror-comedies long before this one and there were horror movies that references other horror movies so that there wasn't anything new either. What made the film work so well is that director Craven was at the top of his game and one might say that he did the best work of his career by making this material work so well. Yes, there's quite a bit of humor here but it works because fans of the genre will get a kick out of seeing ""rules"" that they know carried out. The various references to other horror movies makes for a lot of fun and we even get a couple nice cameos from previous horror stars. Craven puts his mark all over the film in terms of suspense and this famously starts with the Drew Barrymore sequence that starts the movie. I remember not being overly impressed with this sequence when I first saw it but viewing it today makes quite an impression because of how much suspense there is and how the director manages to slowly build it up. Seeing this sequence today also makes you see how violent it actually was and the death scene is quite effective and chilling considering the events that are going on around it. Craven also keeps things moving perfectly well with the ending because not only does he keep the tension going he also manages to keep the mystery up in the air as well. There are many suspects from start to finish but we're always guessing and even when you think you have it figured out something else will happen to throw you off track again. Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Jamie Kennedy and Matthew Lillard all fit their roles nicely and it was fun seeing the likes of Henry Winkler and Linda Blair. Even at 110-minutes the film never wears out its welcome as it moves at a very quick pace and whatever elements it's going for are always working. A lot of times horror films wear down with age but that's not the case here as the movie is just as strong and perhaps even stronger than when it was originally released. Each generation has films that built the horror genre and SCREAM certain did that and you really can't take away from it simply because of future rips that would eventually help kill the genre. With its story, fine cast and strong direction, this is a film that will stand the test of time and will always have its place in the history of the genre.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
There's a formula to it a very simple formula everybody's a suspect!,"In the nineties horror was taking a drastic turn instead of being seen as a serious genre it was now being mocked and made fun of up until the mid 2000s. Films like leprechaun or I know what you did last summer that didn't even try to be suspenseful or mysterious. And instead op for more campy tones. In 1996 Horror Legend Wes Craven the man behind a nightmare on elm street, The Hills have eyes, and the last house on the left. Delivers Scream arguably the pinnacle of the horror comedy sub genre. A girl named Sidney Prescott(neve campbell)is your typical High school shy and awkward, unfortunately after her mothers murder a year ago she hasn't been herself since then. The anniversary of her mother's death's coming up then all of a sudden two student from her school are murdered. Sidney soon starts receiving mysterious calls from a stranger, and want soon follows is an inquiry as suspects begin to line up. What made scream different from any other film of the time was the fact that it actually built using it's clichés. It's a movie that was self-aware and satire. The characters are all purposely cliché you got a movie buff randy who the whole movie spouts horror tropes. Stu(Matthew lillard) who's probably the best character in the series only being rivaled by Dewey. Over the course of the movie while it still poke fun of the cliches while still follow through on them. It still gives an entertainment premise and a plot. Neve campbell gives a good performances Sindy doesn't really come off as an unlikeable character, in many ways she's written as the most realistic in the fim. As not only does she cope with being reminded of her mother death, but also rumors begin to spread and she harassed by the media. Primary Gale Weathers(Courtney Cox) who's more concern with getting the story and kinda the reason why so much bad publicity surrounding Sidney. Though the best character in all the films is none other than David arquette as officer Dewey, the most luckiest cop ever in a horror film. He's more of a knock at how cop are for the most part incompetent and pointless in these films. But he comes off as one of the most likeable person. Like when he picks the phone back up even after Sidney hangs it up. The overall movie is more so homage in a way It pays tribute to the genre more than anything. There's some tons of easter eggs and references to spot from cameos to names. Billy Loomis is an direct references to Dr. Loomis from Halloween. Also the idea of having a killer center around horror movies add to that. The ghostface killer is one of the most popular slashers. The fact that you can still find this costume on sale come Halloween cements to that. It's a slasher of multiple interpretation who's more grounded in reality surprisingly. Not a powerful unstoppable emotionless killing machine. He Constantly tripping over the costume and getting knock over, but still capable of brutality stabbing murdering you. The idea that the killer truly can be anybody does in some way, add to the suspense. When he's stalking Sidney it someway it silly, but kinda suspenseful. While other films tried to capture the tone of this movie, Overall Scream still remains a fun classic for it's meta humor characters and 90's tone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

'Do you like scary movies?',"'It's like deja vu all over again', declares Sidney Prescott, the heroine of Scream (1996). Sidney is referring to the death of her mother a year earlier and to the similarly horrifying murders of two schoolmates just a day before. Of course, she should not be using 'deja vu' and 'all over again' in the same breath, that creates a tautology, but the girl has been through a lot. We can cut her some slack.'Deja vu all over again' is a succinct summary of Scream, the horror movie to reference all horror movies.Halloween (1978)and its sequelHalloween II (1981)receive the most attention, but the range is fromPsycho (1960)andDementia 13 (1963)toCandyman (1992)andMother's Boys (1993). You also get an occasional reference to a work outside of the horror genre: a nod toClueless (1995)here and an homage toTwin Peaks (1990)there. Yet, it would be a mistake to see Scream as purely a pastiche.Directed byWes Craven- him who madeThe Hills Have Eyes (1977)andA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)- Scream has enough independent plot to support its macabre scenes.

Scream contains a handful of plot twists, including the brilliant and grotesque final reveal. Importantly, there is a sustained anticipation of plot twists, with the movie going out of its way to state that literally anyone could be the killer. Or a killer.In what was a novel idea at the time, the characters are equipped with the same knowledge of horror film as ourselves, creating a unique venue for speculation and kinship. It could be done wrong (theScary Movie (2000)franchise would show exactly how) or it could be just amusing, instead of genuinely unsettling (see theHappy Death Day (2017)films), but in the hands of the master of the slasher genre, it goes just right - right for the jugular.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Smart Slasher,"Scream is an absolute blast of a horror movie and one that deserves an annual viewing this time of the year, it's a perfect Halloween teen slasher with brains. Wes Craven reinvents this genre, turning cliches on their heads and becoming a self parody at times. And while that does take away some of the tension, it still brings in a new element to this kind of slasher, blending humor and terror in a tight concise fashion. While some may find the humor and breaking the fourth wall a bit much, it's still a refreshing take on a familiar tale. The characters are written with care, and while some of the performances are a bit over the top, the moments of bloody horror can help forget some of Scream's shortcomings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A must see for any slasher fan!,"If you haven't yet watched this film but you know the plot is a killer dressed up chasing some teens and think it sounds all too unoriginal, think again!The first 15 minutes of this film will go down in not just horror cinema history, but cinema's history in general. Also, even if you have watched just one horror film in the past, the rules stated in this movie will make perfect sense.Scream is one huge guessing game, and you can almost guarantee your first and second guesses wont be correct.Another great thing about Scream is that it catches you off guard with the comedy it has in between death/chase scenes, and in some cases, comedy during these tense and on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes.Overall, its a complete must see for a slasher/horror fan of any level, as it is a surprisingly brilliant masterpiece of a horror flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scream and scream again and again!,"It's been more than a decade since I last watched ""Scream"" – probably right after it got released in theaters or something – and honestly have to admit I never was a big fan of this much-hyped blockbuster. To me personally (admittedly I was just an over-enthusiast horror fanatic who just started to find his way around the genre) it was simply a mockery against really unsettling movies and the one film that suddenly turned everyone into a horror buff overnight. Also, and maybe even most importantly, ""Scream"" was single-handedly responsible for a massive overload of inferior and sometimes even downright retarded knock-offs, imitations, zero-budgeted amateur trash slasher flicks. Suddenly and thanks to the simplistic concept of this movie, everyone considered him/herself capable of making a horror movie and sadly enough most of them even found ways of distribution as well. This was my personal blunt opinion on ""Scream"" more than ten years ago. By now, I still think it's a vastly overrated movie and definitely not the best horror film of the nineties (my vote for that either goes to ""Braindead"" or ""Candyman""), but my opinions regarding the actual film's quality surely have changed. ""Scream"", and particularly Kevin Williamson's screenplay, is very clever and witty in its observations on the contemporary teen pop culture and it covers a pretty impressive range of old horror trivia. Wes Craven, who in his career alternatively tackled some hits (""The Hills have Eyes"", ""Deadly Blessing"", ""Nightmare on Elm Streeet"") and some misses (""Shocker"", ""Vampire in Brooklyn"") was the ideal choice of director for a film that simultaneously spoofs and pays tribute to a popular film genre that thrives on clichés, stereotypes and gratuitous scares. Last but certainly not least, the actual story offers a handful of genuinely uncanny moments as well as some neat unpredictable twists. Simply the opening sequence starring Drew Barrymore already – which I suppose everybody knows about by now – is enough indication that anything can happen to any disposable character in this film. The premise is rudimentary and ancient, with a spooky masked killer terrorizing a small high school and particularly one girl whose mum got massacred one year earlier, but that's all there is necessary. Good performances, tight direction, classy photography, dazzling soundtrack and a truckload of nauseating murder set pieces do the rest. Recommended for all type of horror-appreciating audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It was alright,"I couldn't remember if I saw this one as a teen or not but turns out I was only 9 when it was released so I definitely wasn't as young as that! With halloween coming up, I decided i'd give the franchise a go, starting with this one. It isn't groundbreaking by any means and doesn't compare to say the likes of Halloween which is fantastic but it's still an enoyable watch.What I did like was that I was wrong about who the killer was the entire time and it kept me guessing along the way right until the very end. Is it cheesy? Yes absolutely and barely scary (at least in my opinion). It's basically a bunch of knife wielding, horny teenagers.Not a bad journey though and I would recommend despite the ending being pretty terrible, it was all over the place when the killer(s) were revealed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Overrated schlock,"Okay...""Scream"" definitely did bring the slasher genre back to life, and that is a good thing.

Yes, it is very gory (guts splattering on the floor, heads flattened by garage doors, throats slashed, scissor-stabbing, squirting blood, etc.) but it was way too long and some of the twists were too stupid for their own good. Overall, I wasn't surprised or really that into this movie. The whole ""Scream"" trilogy is very, very overrated. I prefer some older, cheesier films like ""The Funhouse"" or ""House of Death"" over this junk.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""What's your favorite scary movie?""","'Scream' is a scary movie however the light-heart attitude of this movie makes it quite funny also.The story begins with a phone call and ends with a blood bath in true horror style. A young teenager Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) gets a mysterious phone call and the caller asks a series of questions most famously ""What's your favorite scary movie?"" he terrorizes her for a good ten minutes and probably the most terrifying scene in this movie he finally kills her while wearing the famous ghost-face costume.The story jumps between horror and comedy, for most of the movie the viewer's heart is racing and for the rest they are roaring laughing. Much of the comedy is provided by the stupidity of Dewey Riley (David Arquette) the always lovable character.Much of this movie revolves around one character Sidney Prescott (Neve Cambell) and the grief she suffered since her mother was murdered and she a witness. An inpatient boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) seems a suspect of the Woodsboro murders as does many others even Sidney's father (Laurence Hecht) and her friends as well.I think it is safe to say Wes Craven has done it again in creating 'Scream' it is well recommended on seeing especially at night.

A modern horror classic,"By the time ""Scream"" was released in 1996, writer/director Wes Craven already had a couple of landmark horror films under his belt in the form of ""The Last House on the Left"" & ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". With ""Scream"", he teamed with screenwriter Kevin Williamson for a reflexive take on the slasher genre. The result was both a critical and commercial success.In a nutshell, the story revolves around a costumed serial killer who is murdering teens while eluding the police and creating a media frenzy. Not a particularly novel concept but that's the point. The screenplay plays up the conventions of slasher movies, offering a clever commentary on the sub-genre that's appealing even to those who sneer at the formulaic nature of such movies.The acting talent on board isn't half bad for a horror flick. The memorable opening features Drew Barrymore and there are recognizable faces everywhere you look, including Neve Campbell (naturally), Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan & Henry Winkler, among others. One note regarding the casting: Skeet Ulrich is such a dead ringer (sorry) for a young Johnny Depp that I have to assume that his casting was an unspoken nod to Depp's presence in the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"".As for the direction, Craven knows his way around a horror movie, so its no surprise that he supplies the movie with the requisite suspense. The movie also looks attractive and has a decent soundtrack to boot.Ultimately, ""Scream"" succeeds both as a slasher movie and as a satire of slasher movies. It's also pretty accessible, being not especially gory, at least in comparison to contemporary fare. Of the sequels, I've only seen the first two, neither of which rose to the level of the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

There was a brilliant mix of crazy oddball characters and the performances were all solid.I loved the satirical approach they took to horror, with this meta self awareness, and winking to the camera style. Occasionally it was a bit on the nose and a little too much, but for the most part I loved it.Having watched this at the cinema for the 25th anniversary, I can see why this is a much loved classic.

I can't believe that this movie actually spawned 3 inferior sequels.My 2 beefs about this film are -(1) The final sequence (which revealed who was behind these ghastly murders) was too dragged out and this seriously weakened the story's fever-pitch momentum.(2) Product placement of Chex cereal and Jiffy Pop popcorn lost this film some significant points.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Good for what it is,"Being a fairly big horror fan I put off seeing this one because I got tired of hearing the ""best scary movie ever"" chant and knew it couldn't live up to the hype. (Although anything with Barrymore, Cox, Arquette and Campbell is in it's self a scary proposition) As a spoof of slasher films it's pretty good at what it does, the acting isn't all that bad believe it or not and Craven, who's not my favorite, did a fairly good job. The tongue in cheek humour was good and I esp. liked the homage it gives to it's forefathers. Some great background music which probably lends itself to giving away the killer.On a scary scale however, it rates up there with ""The Little Mermaid"". Mostly it rehashed all the old slasher modus operandi and if you've seen a Craven film before you can tell when someone is going to get it. No suspense at all and it constantly resorts to the old ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" jump outs for it's frights. Also, it put out too many red herrings about who the actual killer is for my tastes.6/10 (because of some good lines and paying respects to Hitchcock but sadly no Phantasm or Romeros) but if you think this is the end-all-be-all of horror watch a few of the movies this one took from.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

""Scream"" was a tribute to many slasher films but using a special mark, the dark humor.

"Good, not great, but good...","I remember when I stepped into the theatre to see this film, it had been praised as a masterpiece and the greatest horror film in the nineties (which it's NOT, if you ask me). I was in a good mood while leaving the theatre, having been very entertained throughout the film. The events in the film actually managed to surprise me, and when the killer/killers was/were unmasked, it was proven to me that my guesses were completely off track. I did not however think that it was a masterpiece, for one reason mainly. The point of a horror film is to be scary, and this one wasn't. I have three criterias for a great horror film, and for it to be okay it has to pass atleast one, they are: Scary, Exciting and Entertaining. I found the film to be highly entertaining, somewhat exciting in places, but not scary. But two out of three ain't bad. The actors are okay, the cinematography is slick and good, so's the editing, but the music, AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! It's utter and total crap! CRAP!!! Okay, now that that's out of my system, perhaps I can continue with some more thoughts on the film. A lot of people say that the film owes a lot to ""Halloween"", which may be a valid point, but the film this one mainly reminds me of is ""Black Christmas"", just think about it, the phone calls, the hiding places and all.

What a surprise!!,"Scream is a good movie, more of that is a great meta-movie /parody of the slasher genre of horror ,which by 1996 ,when scream came out was in decline. West Craven here in a way made fun the main movies of his directorial history (like A Nightmare on Elm Street) and show us that even the most hardcore Filmer can be caught of guard. That is in a sense the story of Scream and fortunately Mr Craven and the actors made a great job pocking fun in the clichés of the horror movies we all know and either love or hate. To the point this flick was a sleeper hit and twenty years later has become the guideline of ""How to survive a horror movie"". Before I saw for the first time Scream ,I thought that it was overrated, after seen it it more than deserves the praise it gets. If I have to nit pick some thinks, is the fact that it is a bit dated for todays standards and the chill which once made people chill ,has been spoiled due to the low point in which horror movies are in modern-days. Note that it also had unnecessary sequels like the films it made fun of, what a irony!I am pretty sure that, horror movies will come back ,like the superheroes movies before them and Scream will be seen as a historic film ,like Phsyco(1960), Dracula(1930) ,Alien(1979), The Thing(1982) and the rest of the historic horror movies which even today we praise them as landmarks.

Not as great as it thinks it is...,"So it's not a bad film, its just not a great one and I've no idea why critics and cinemagoers alike have lapped up this self conscious and forgettable slice of ""irony"". The first 10 minutes were very good and they almost actually frightened you - sadly the same can't be said of the rest of the film which gradually descended into more unfunny ""in-jokes"", ridiculous plot developments, criminally bad acting (almost saved by David Arquette) and non-scary scary scenes. Okay so maybe I'm missing the point, maybe that is the attraction of it all but surely if it was so good I would have enjoyed it just a little and I can't be the only one who thought the ending was one of the worst ever in a movie. I admit it did have some funny lines, some moderately scary patches and enjoyable scenes but does this warrant the scores of glowing reviews everywhere?The real irony is that it's a movie that thinks it's great attempting to send up other slasher pics that think they were great but weren't.

Scream,"In what should have been the ultimate homage to the horror genre, Scream turned out to be a disjointed look at how horror movies are often perceived. Directed by horror master, Wes Craven, his 1996 film followed a high schooler as she copes with the brutal murder of her mother when it seems as though her killer has returned to terrorize her town. Starring such 90's stars as Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette, Scream towed the line between horror brilliance and comedy quite unevenly. It was this disjointed dance among genres that left me far less impressed with Scream than I intended to be, especially having been directed by the man who gave audiences my personal favorite horror franchise, A Nightmare on Elm Street.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) a high school senior grieving her mother's senseless murder is stunned when it seems that, just before the year anniversary of her mother's death, the killer is still terrorizing the town. Sidney's world is rocked to its core when the ones closest to her begin being slaughtered in the same senseless fashion as her mother was killed. When the murders keep happening, police begin to suspect that the wrong person may have been convicted of Sidney's mother's murder, and begin to suspect Sidney's father. Convinced that her father is not the murderer, Sidney along with the help of the lead officer on the case, Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) begin to comb over all the case details in the interest of protecting Sidney's father and finding who they believe to be the copycat murderer. Their task is made none the easier by the constant intervention of Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) a money-hungry television reporter who wrote a book about the murder of Sidney's mother, which did little to endear her to Sidney. The more murders that take place, the more the killer's motive looks to be nothing but a game. Initiating the killings with a phone call and a quiz to save their lives, police must learn the identity of the killer before their game runs out.I wasn't sure what took me so long to see Scream. I am a big fan of the horror genre and had heard that Scream turned the genre on its head and was a fun mystery slasher for horror fans. A couple of poor casting choices and genre jumping, however, ensured that Scream will be a movie I only view once. I have never liked Matthew Lillard in any film I've seen him in. It's a personal problem, I know, but with him having a prominent role in Scream, I could hardly avoid my distaste for him by engulfing into any other actors. Also, the casting of Henry Winkler, as the principal of the high school, in a caricature of his most famous role as Fonzie from the Happy Days was an interesting maneuver. In a way, I admire the choice, as it's not likely those in the audience see Winkler without thinking of his iconic role, but it also pulls you out of the movie a lot to see him doing such an exaggerated caricature unrelated to the film. The other nail in the coffin of Scream was the senseless jumping around between a serious mystery of discovering the identity of a brutal killer, and a cheap laugh grabbing comedy. There were no smooth transitions between the comedy and the drama leaving the film a disjointed mess. A severe disappointment, Scream is a one-time viewing for this reviewer.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"You May Not Scream, But You Will Grin","In the 90's, the slasher genre was worn out. Series like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" had gravitated away from their horror routes and were now like comedies. The longevity of these series were now a running joke to the audience, and the genre needed some new life. So ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" director Wes Craven decided to make ""Scream"".""Scream"" is a horror movie that is self aware. While most films in the genre are usually mocked for being so cliché, ""Scream"" celebrates it and cleverly follows the classic formula.The beginning of ""Scream"" opens up with Drew Barrymore. Many people thought that, due to the marketing campaign, she was going to be the lead role, since she was such a big name at the time. But, no, she's actually killed within 15 minutes. It's kind of a tribute to ""Psycho"", where Janet Leigh was portrayed to be the main hero, but was abruptly killed early.So then, the film transitions over to Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell. Sidney's mother was raped and killed a year prior to the film, and as such, Sidney is in a depression. I find Capmbell's performance to be very solid for a horror film, and this is my favourite role she's been in. This is the film that launched her career. She may have a respectable resume these days, but in my heart, shes a scream queen.Sidney has a boyfriend named Billy, played by Skeet Ulrich. Neve Campbell had co-starred with him earlier that year in ""The Craft"". In his very first scene, Billy sneaks into Sidney's room just to make-out with her. But the way he proposes it is funny as hell. Funny enough, this is probably the way I would propose it if I had a girlfriend.Then there's Sidney's best friend, Tatum, played by a young Rose McGowan. Funny to think that in 11 years, this chick would be blowing the hell out of zombies with a gun-leg in ""Planet Terror"".Tatum's older brother, Dewey, is played by David Arquette, who is the real life older brother of Patricia Arquette. Patricia had starred in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors"". Dewey is an easily lovable character. He comes off as kinda wimpy and weak, but you just love him.Then there's Gale Weathers, played by Courtney Cox. Gale's a news reporter, but she also becomes Dewey's love interest. While the sequels expanded upon this, in the original, it seems like Gale is just using Dewey to get to Sidney for her next big story. Sidney gets so mad at Gale that she punches her square in the face. I laugh my head off every time I see this part.But the man who steals the whole film is Randy, played by Jamie Kennedy. Randy is a film buff, always overflowing with film references and great humour. Randy is probably my favourite film character of all time. Mostly cause I can relate to him. Being a film buff myself, I know the mindset, and thats my favourite part about Randy. He's always in movie-mode.The finale is a 40 minute long build up, sprinkled with a kill here and there, and it keeps you guessing at who the killer really is. Speaking of which, I haven't even talked about the killer yet.The killer's costume was an actual real life Halloween costume that was already popular before the movie. It's kinda like the original ""Halloween"", where the filmmakers went out, just bought a random mask from the store, and used it for the movie. Reusing this technique was very smart in my opinion, cause it truly gives the feeling that the killer could be anyone.Overall, I love this movie. While it's in no way a masterpiece of horror cinema, the modern age owes a lot to ""Scream"". It revitalized the slasher genre and brought a new audience's attention back to the classics. It's not a landmark, but it's a pretty solid horror film. Check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Nutshell Review: Scream (DVD 1996),"It actually took me 9 years to finally watch this slasher flick classic, and I'm now kicking my rear that I should've watched it when it premiered in local theatres back then. Credited as sparking off a slew of copycat slasher films in the late 90s, and reintroducing Wes Craven to a whole new generation, Scream will remain an important milestone for the horror-slasher genre.Starring a relatively young and unknown (then) cast, Drew Barrymore opens in what is probably the most recognizable start to a horror movie, with her demise after being caught in a cat-and-mouse telephone call with the primary killer in the movie, a psychopath who dons the Halloween ""Scream"" costume.That famous opening aside, Neve Campbell plays the main lead Sydney, a student who's now the new target of the killer. Given her complicated background of having her mom killed about a year ago, she is spooked by the fact that she could have sentenced the wrong killer to prison, and the real one is still out there, stalking her.As with slasher movies, her group of friends become suspects and cannon fodder for the killer. What works is that although the cast is huge, and almost everyone is a suspect! The film doesn't let off throwing at you the red herrings, making you wonder what could be, and if it is.Looking at the film, the killer is not the invulnerable being that always gets his prey. Here, he does get hit and attacked, which adds a totally new, believable dimension towards the instinct for survival. Also, there are tons of movie references which will keep every movie buff totally happy and jumping with glee at identifying them. I'd like the part where one of the characters laid down the 3 rules of horror films: Never have sex because only virgins survive, never smoke or drink, and never say ""I'll be back"", because you won't. Sort of summarizes every horror movie out there, doesn't it?And the ending totally rocks. The script is intelligent (for a horror-slasher movie), and will catch you off guard, if you haven't been reading anything to spoil the movie, after 9 long years.Sadly, this Code 3 DVD contains no extras besides the norm of scene selection and subtitles. Pity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""This isn't a movie. This is life."" Really? You wouldn't know it by the script.","Tell me, if you're a writer who writes a cliché, predictable story, can you excuse your bad writing by having your characters state, within the movie, that they know it is cliché and predictable? This is my problem with Kevin Williamson's script, and this movie in general. You can't excuse a tired plot by having your ""hipster"" characters acknowledge every cliché from previous movies in the genre. It really is for five year-olds, there's nothing subtle about it at all. The viewer is beaten over the head in this film with constant references to other films in the genre. This self-awareness has been called new and edgy, instead of what it really is: a total cop-out. Why write characters so self-aware of all the genre pitfalls, only to have them execute the same bad decisions in their own reality? Such a waste.""Scream"" was heralded for being different from the pack because it was the first mainstream horror movie to parody the characters' situations and point out the flaws in the genre, but really, the idea was very simplistic. ""Scream"" differs from other genre films only in the fact the characters talk as if they're in a horror movie, while the rest of the film is just as predictable as any other movie in the genre. Changing one small ingredient in the recipe doesn't affect the end result that much. A child could have conceived the idea.The characters exist in a world where horror movies can happen just like in the fantasy of motion pictures--the killer can seemingly be everywhere at once, the heroine can elude her pursuer until the film's finale, and other characters conveniently find themselves in situations where they are far too easy for the killer to pick off. Of course, real life is a bit different, which ironically the main character says at one point in the film, right before we get treated to every horror cliché in the book before the grand ""finale"", which plays out just like a movie. Such a shame more of an effort wasn't made to create a better movie that sent a more believable message about the genre as a whole: that the killers aren't superhuman, not everything will go according to plan, the heroine will not always survive, and not everything plays out like a scene from a movie. That would have been a far better message than what we ultimately get here.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Good revival of the genre.,"I liked Scream, in fact I liked it a lot. The opening scene involving Drew Barrymore is brilliant, in writing, directing, and acting.

Horror movie? More like a light-hearted comedy.,"I had high expectations before watching this famous horror movie, and as I don't usually watch movies from this genre, I was a a bit scared that this will be too frightening for me.It turned out that it was completely unnecessary for me to be worried. There wasn't a single moment in the movie which made me scream, and the jump-scares were predictable even for someone who isn't familiar with the genre. Most of the acting was worse than what we see in a home video, and it wasn't hard to guess who the killer is, although the ending gives a little bit of a twist to the plot.On the contrary, the whole movie seemed like a parody, and if we look at it this way, it is quite a funny film, with lots of laugh-out-loud moments. The movie has some comedic characters who are witty and fun to watch. It is also excellent for a drinking game: drink whenever someone dies, screams, a phone rings, and a horror movie is mentioned. All in all, I would recommend you to watch this movie with your friends. Don't expect to be scared, but expect and enjoyable evening.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This horror flick has killers who kill per horror film conventions.,"Scream is a rarity: a horror movie spoof that succeeds almost as well at provoking scares as laughs. That's because director Wes Craven in addition to having a genuine affection for the genre, understands how wildly improbable and easy to lampoon it is. And, with Scream, he skewers it at every corner, using self-referential humor and a flood of in-jokes (some subtle, some obvious).In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern film criticism involves ``deconstruction'' of movie plots. ``Deconstruction'' is an academic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in words nobody can understand. ``Scream'' is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those cans that heats its own soup.But this movie is not just a horror film. The self-referential tone of the movie allows us to step back from the horror. Also, the presence of detectives and inquisitive characters focuses our attention away from fear and toward curiosity. We can stop the killing if we can only unmask the killer.For those who know horror movies, the self-referential tone provides some funny moments when characters point out the ""rules"" of a horror movie, mention director Wes Craven, or comment on what would be happening ""if this were a movie.""And, for those looking for a good scare, Scream is an excellent choice. The mask the killer uses (which appears to be derived from Munch's ""The Scream"") is really quite frightening. The killer is more human than in most horror films, and therefore more terrifying. He is not invisible, but he is only seen in a quick flash. His advantage is not supernatural power - victims can lash out against him and have some effect - his advantage is surprise and fear. The killer's humanity and thus his potential vulnerability makes him all the more frightening, and makes us all the more tense for his next victim.MESSAGE - Horror films may breed copycat killings.Conclusion: This is a modern type of heart-thrilling horror movies and it really does scare you who are not a real fans of horror movies. I rate this movie as a good movie and it is also a good way to thrill the audience. So it realy does had a very strong effects on the thrilling part. I rate it 3,5/5. But for the story of the movie I rate it as a fair story. Great score for a movie like this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Improves as it goes along though one can see after watching it why it was ripe for parody,"After her friend Casey is killed by the mysterious Ghostface he turns his attention on to Sidney whose mother was killed almost a year earlier...Scream is a bit of an odd film as it is pretty dreadful in its early stages; the phone calls between Casey and the killer are quite laughable and are not even remotely scary (IMDB bills Scream as horror and mystery so presumably the silliness of these scenes are not intentional). Craven seems to disguise this with the notion of Scream sending up the cliches of horror films in order to give the film a fresh feel.Having said that, once the film moves into its final third it does start to produce the goods; yes it does fall into the cliches, but at least it is exciting and starts to become fun. As far as the cast go then perhaps the only people who do anything of worth are David Arquette and Skeet Ulrich; Matthew Lilliard was annoying as a Jim Carrey wannabe whose mouth, at times, seems to be as wide as a hippo. Neve Campbell is bland, though Courtney Cox kind of steals the show here as the go-getting reporter (she's not a brilliant actress, but she makes her mark here and she looks absolutely gorgeous in this film - never seen her look better).Scream is a tough film for me to give an overall consensus for, if you like horror you're going to be disappointed and if you like comedy you're going to be disappointed. It's a bit of an oddity that doesn't sit well anywhere. Like I've said it becomes enjoyable in its final third, but ultimately it does set itself up for a fall one which it does struggle to recover from.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Ultimate Movie Review!,"Horror legend, Wes Craven, wanted to mix a traditional slasher film, with a who done it mystery, while at the same time parading both. The result is Scream, which turned into a much bigger film and franchise than he expected. He wanted to do this sort of under the radar, with a cast of virtual unknowns, but due to its uniqueness, the movie quickly gained popularity and today is considered one of the best horror movies of all time. The cast are all household names now and the ending of this film is legendary. Twists, turns, paranoia, accusations, one liners, and good looking people is what Scream is all about. The story is a great one, the cast is solid, and when it comes to writer/directors, you can't get much better than Wes Craven.

great premise for a horror,"I'm not into scream the way so many are, meaning I can't remember it scene by scene nor do I have any interest in seeing it again but I liked the movie and got the premise which really was good. a horror within a horror-it was nice to see something that hadn't been done before and the cast was great as were some of the more memorable scenes and lines.But I still don't think scream was a perfect movie, there were at least 2 things I didn't like about it one being the amount of violence it featured. I realize that for the premise of the movie-some violence needs to be there but cmon-after awhile, it was a bit much, scream was more violent then many regualr horror films! I think the movie's best moments were diologe driven-the showy emphasis on all the gore was overdone and done for effect and ditracted from the whole movie in general. I also felt the ending was a bit ridiculous and unlike the plot in general there was nothing brillient about it, it seemed thrown together. I'm trying to do as honest a review as possible because so many either loved or hated this and I'm in between-I definetly did not love it, but moderatly enjoyed it and am glad I saw it.

A Cancer!!!,"SCREAM is a cancer, a cancer that has spread and infected nearly all those who have watched it, a cancer that has killed the Horror Genre. The catch is that SCREAM in itself is not an awful film, it is actually quite good. The problem is not the film itself it is the way that people have embraced it. Jaded horror fans who have OD'd on lousy horror movies have been so refreshed and blinded by this movie that they have proclaimed it as the new king, the greatest Horror movie ever. In a word - bull****. Anyone who says this needs shooting, SCREAM is not even in the Top 100 Greatest Horror Movies. Even the director, Wes Craven has made several superior movies. In my view a good comic-horror should not attain glory by ridiculing REAL horror classics like this film ends up doing. Now all Horror Movies are just blatant imitations of this. Parodies of a Parody, no thanks. On its own merits SCREAM is a good film but in terms of the effect it has had it is the worst thing ever to have happened to Horror. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, DAWN OF THE DEAD and the Italian shockers of Directors such as Fulci and Argento are classic horror movies, SCREAM should never be included in the same league.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A classic thriller, breathed new life into the horror genre","At a time when the likes of Michael Myers, Freddy Kreuger, Chucky and Leatherface were getting a bit stale, and the entire slasher formula was getting played out, in came Wes Craven's ""Scream"" which broke all the rules while having it's characters acknowledge those very rules in the film. I'll save the ""rules"" talk and just let the viewers discover that aspect of the film, but i'd like to talk about why this film is a 10/10 for me.The opening scene is one of the best grabbers in history of movies, let alone horror openings. It shares a similarity to ""When a stranger calls"" where Carol Kane is babysitting and is receiving threatening phone calls. Drew Barrymore greets the audience answering her house phone and the film is already off running, no long credit opening, just throwing the viewer right into the deep end. The writing and score throughout the opening really draws you in as Barrymore and the killer ""play a little game"" during their phone call exchanges. Craven does a terrific job building tension as Barrymore's panic and fear increases by the second. The first 10 minutes of this thriller let's the viewer know it isn't F'n around.Secondly, The main female lead ""Sidney Prescott"" is crafted by Director Wes Craven to show she's a vulnerable and slighlty insecure young teen, allowing the audience to easily identify with her and root for. Something that's missing from many horror/slasher films is that the viewer couldn't care less who dies because there is no character development for anyone on screen. The films supporting cast are engaging as well with the help of writer Kevin Williamson's sharp dialogue chock full of old horror film references and meta humor. Until ""Scream"" no horror movie had been this self-aware...but this one didn't go overboard with it like the new ones do.The next reason i rate this so highly is that the story is actually captivating and becomes almost a ""whodunnit"" detective thriller as it leaves the audience guessing at who is committing these attacks.It also has a great ""final scene"" or ""3rd act"" which i estimate spans about 45 minutes. The final scene takes place at a house party where all the characters end up and the killer begins picking them off one by one.I was in 5th grade when i first saw this movie which was on VHS likely rented from Blockbuster. I was a young horror movie fan enjoying the likes of Michael Myers and Kreuger, but Scream just ""hit a little different"" as the kids say. For me it was the dialogue, score and story. My mom rolled her eyes at Halloween and Nightmare/Elm Street, but with Scream she was engaged because it was more of a thriller mystery. ""Scream"" wasn't an initial success in theatres, but word-of-mouth did it's job and it influenced a slew of new teen-centric horror slashers, but none of them compared to this classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Quite a feat, delightfully genre-bending.","Director Wes Craven, and writer Kevin Williamson have quite effectively bended horror genre conventions to create a clever, tight, suspense-filled film.  Just as the audience believes they know what is about the occur, the filmmakers twist you in the opposite direction.  The protagonist, Sidney Prescott, differs from the norm as a horror heroine in that she has dealt with trauma in her past, and is smart and strong, definately not your typical screamer.  Clues as to who the antogonist is are dropped throughout the film, but in such a way the audience wanders down the wrong path consistantly until the final revelation in the last reel.  Scores above any other horror film in recent memory.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pretty good.,"Many people hate this movie. And maybe they should, after all hideous films that have tried to copy this one (Valentine, anyone?) it's no hard thing to do. Scream still stands as the best of the genre it invented i.e. the ""slasher-wannabe"" genre. This means it tries to be something it actually isn't. Scream is not a slasher movie, plain and simple this is just a thriller dressed up for Halloween.The story is simple; a man murders teens just like in numerous real slasher films. This is what makes the movie pretty funny to watch, there are dozens of jokes that relate to films of the slasher genre. A pretty solid cast makes this work fine. Neve Campbell (what's she doing nowadays?) is probably the best of the lot and she looks wonderful too. A crappy ending makes the movie a bit less entertaining but it's still fun to watch and well recommended both for those who know the horror genre well and beginners.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scream,A classic horror film directed by Wes Craven. The performances from the main cast is great and somewhat cheesy in a great way which makes the film more entertaining to watch. A classic horror film that ages like fine wine through the years.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Classic?,"Director Wes Craven almost singlehandedly resurrected the horror genre in the mid 90's with this film. Prior to Scream the 90's and the entire 80's had been decades with tireless and tiresome retreads of once popular horror films. These films adhered to the same formula, had little or no innovative or imaginative ideas, and were filled with empty-headed teens big on looks and almost totally void of any real talent. Craven adheres to many of these notions as well in Scream, but he is always using them in a self-mocking way. Scream has much going for it as a horror film: one of the best opening sequences of any horror film with the subtraction of star Drew Barrymore very quickly, some genuine thrills and chills as well as some genuine laughs, and a constant homage to the genre with references such as Wes Carpenter as a popular director of the day and the rules that one should learn having watched horror films. Craven even manages to insert a clip of Whale's Frankenstein for good measure. BUT...and you might have guessed this was coming...I get real disheartened when so many people say this is a classic, one of the greatest horror films ever made(if not the greatest itself), or even Craven's finest film. It just isn't so. I would not even imagine any scenario where I would put Scream on my top ten...top twenty...top thirty... greatest horror film list. Great horror films have great scripts. Scream does not. Aside from the roller coaster introduction with Barrymore, the film never manages to reach those same heights. There are a lot of good plot twists, but let's face it - the story is pretty preposterous. Great horror films usually have great actors giving great performances. Scream does not have any great performances. The cast does a nice job smiling through much of the film - even in the face of impending death. As an audience we are never asked to take anyone seriously. And as an audience we don't. Great horror films have great, memorable scenes that linger with the viewer. Scream DOES have some of these. the opening is very effective. Craven deserves a lot of credit for it, but it is never rivaled again in the film. Don't get me wrong - I liked Scream. It was a fun movie. It gave me a few reasons to jump from my seat. It made me laugh here and there. But it never left any long-lasting impression on me that I had just sat through a masterpiece like when I first saw Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, or Carpenter's Halloween. Craven is a good director and has made many good films. I like his 70's work best: Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes(films that may well repulse many viewers but left a lasting impression on me, though most of it was pure shock!). Those films are really better than this film. Craven plays up to a modern audience whom he is making fun of indirectly in the film. He laces the film with all kinds of genre references that most of his younger, hip audience will have no understanding of at all. He tells us that those people in horror films that have sex or drink or take drugs will die. He shows his audience exactly what they want to see and then pokes fun at it. Surely this hip approach has a lot to do with the wide accolades the film has received from its loyal audience over the years. I think Scream, though not a great film, deservedly is due recognition for making horror popular again and mainstream. This mainstream approach has led to many new, innovative horror films since its release and has made the horror genre certainly one of the more profitable genres to produce a film for. Yes, we still have the umpteenth sequels and unnecessary remakes, but there have also been some new films that I believe are direct descendants of the legacy of Scream.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Neve was great at playing Sidney.The killer is pretty easy to identify in the middle and at the party in the end. For one thing, after Tatum dies, Billy comes running from the side of the house... the same side the garage is on. And Stu does tell Tatum to go get him a beer in the garage... hmmmm.

A good parody of horror films?,"This ""horror"" movie is set in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, and tells how the young Sidney Prescott, a year after the brutal murder of his mother, is pursued by a mysterious psychopathic killer, masked with black clothes and a mask that looks like something out of a Munch painting. Directed by Wes Craven (who became famous with the franchise ""Nightmare on Elm Street""), has a script by Kevin Williamson and includes Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette in the lead roles, playing respectively the young Casey, the protagonist Sidney, an ambitious reporter called Gale Weathers and the sheriff's deputy, Dewey.As audience, we are in doubt about what really is this film: if it is a mere horror movie then we are facing one of the worst: although some situational scares, the film does not scare anyone, on the contrary: the killer is bumbling, fumbling and spends at least half of the film playing with the phone and stumble around the stage. In turn, the victims are mostly young immature teenagers, so pathetic and mentally retarded that we come to the point of delighting us with their deaths. There is no terror, just false terror, and there is no suspense, only false suspense.If this movie isn't a horror movie but a teen film (perhaps one of the most indigestible film genres that exists), then they are on their favorite ground and I just wish, when they saw the sad end of the teenagers here, they decided to spend more lifetime devoting themselves to reading and developing their maturity.Finally, if this isn't a teen or horror movie, it can only be a comedy that seeks to parody both genders. And, if this is true, then this is a great film, which made us laugh from start to finish and ridicules, in a funny way, both film genres. The dialogs of the adolescents, seeking to theorize the ""formulas"" of horror films and how to survive in a horror movie, are particularly funny.

Probably the most harmful and irresponsible movie ever.,"This is hands-down the worst movie I have ever seen.  I only sat all the way through it because I kept hoping that there would be something redeeming at the end.  Something to justify the intense violence and sick ""humor"". There was nothing.  The ending left me cold and feeling sick.  Perhaps that's what Wes Craven wanted.  To all the people that ""loved"" this movie: you really need to ask yourselves what you loved about it.  You need to think about it very carefully and do some serious soul-searching. Personally, I actually felt violated after watching it.  One of the few movies I've actually regretted watching.  There was simply nothing positive to be gained from it. Moreover, I honestly believe that this is one of the most dangerous and irresponsible movies ever made.  The studio never should have released it. How anyone could ever voluntarily sit through it more than once will be an eternal mystery to me.  The most frightening thing about it was that it was a big hit.I know people will accuse me of ""misunderstanding it"" or other such crap, but let's examine the facts: what this movie is really about is greed, abo ve all else. Wes Craven's sick and horrific fascination with intensely graphic images of human guttings and dismemberment is truly shocking. He tries to sugar-coat it's stench with a little humor mixed it.  He knows that makes it more palatable. He markets this dangerous mixture to impressionable youth, not caring about the consequences.  Not caring that the human mind (especially a young mind) becomes desensitized to violence the more it's exposed to it.  He wants this movie to be ""cool"" and seen over an over. He know he can achieve this by making it extremely violent and horrific. Rebellious youth will flock to it. They do, and he succeeds, not caring who he's harming, as long as he's getting rich. That's practically the definition of evil, if you ask me. To Wes Craven: shame on you!Maybe I'm just some old-fashioned, backwoods moron who's really uncool and beyond all hope... but will somebody please explain to me what's so entertaining about watching young people getting graphically hacked to pieces by a knife-wielding maniac?  Why is this supposed to be funny?  Why is this considered by so many people to be ""cool""? This attitude embodies everything that is wrong with our society.  I'm not a fascist, nor a religious right-wing republican in favor of censorship, but this type of garbage just should NOT be made.  It's as simple as that.

Self Parody Can Still be Screamingly Scary,"Scream is what happens when you combine the world-weary, cloyingly experienced direction of Wes Craven, and the creative talents of a (then) young and hungry screenwriter, Kevin Williamson. Scream received a lot of ink upon its debut for boldly parodying the genre, turning dialog and plot developments (usually unbearably trite) into something witty and unpredictable.However, Scream achieves greatness whereas many other B-movie horror spoofs fail in their attempted hipness, solely because it manages to remain a disturbing, hurtful movie taking place within the bounds of reality. Despite its comic relief, every scare in Scream still feels real. The film doesn't so much mock itself as it merely suggests that even serial killers can have a sense of humor. The film's black hooded crank caller graduates to movie-icon status, thanks to some wonderful cinematography and editing techniques by Craven, who still knows how to force a jump out of his audience. David Arquette, on the other hand, achieves icon status for his inept character of Dewey Riley and will become the butt of many jokes because of some effective stunt casting. (i.e. ""Scary Movie"")Even if you are sneering by the final plot twist, it's hard to deny that Scream does the unthinkable by making a really funny movie this dark and disturbed.Horror and GoreFairly graphic, at least by Wes Craven standards. Wes Craven seems to particularly enjoy destroying beauty, so don't expect anyone to survive on looks alone. There is a nice balance of bloody goo meets cat-and- mouse thrills, and the killer's ominous voice is perhaps the most violent blow of all. The fact that various characters are self-aware throughout the film, and still scared stiff by their horrific demise, emphasizes the point: just because you're smart, doesn't mean you're smart enough to survive what's coming.How to Watch ItWatch this murderous playground with friends and make sure the lights are on and the phone line is free.

"Classic thriller, a real Saturday-night-on-couch-with-lover movie.","This was a really good movie.  Even though we've seen this type of movie thousands of times before, it still remains spine-chillingly scary.  So what if it is predictable, it is fun!  This is what scary movies should be about, take the innocent young girl, put her alone in a big house with a psychopathic killer lurking around and WHAM, you've got a hit.  That is the ultimate recipe for scary movies.Drew Barrymore's performance is gut-wrenchingly real.  The actors in this movie portray terrified and confused teenagers with endearing realism.

THE SLASHER!,"Scream is among my three favourite movies. I truly believe, as far as horror goes, this is as good as it gets.I first watched Scream in highschool at a house party, yes really. I remember sitting down, distracted by my friends, being told how good this movie was. I was half paying attention as it begun. Yet I swear to you no more than a minute in not only was I silent, glued to the TV, but so was pretty much everyone else. I can so clearly recall looking around at all the people in the living room, catching their eyes as the opening scene was ramping up. It scared the life out of me.I have nothing negative worth saying about the film. To this day Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis is the best performance I have ever seen. The character works so perfectly with everything and everyone around him. Not a single shot is wasted when it comes to the characters. Every line they say or look they give serves a purpose. Once again I sight Billy Loomis as the shining example of this.The feel and vibe of this movie is perfection. The atmosphere is so nostalgic in regards to being a teenager into horror movies. I can't name a film with a more notable ascetic. Which is such an achievement given its basic setting. I cannot think of a single significant facet in which this movie does not succeed.Alongside all of that, the movie is so clever. With the birth of analyse videos on youtube, people breaking down the film shot by shot, we can truly appreciate how smart the writing is. So many little things that, if noticed, key you in on things to come and crucial plot points. Scream rewards you as the audience for paying attention, something the majority of films are not capable of doing.I cannot state how much I love this film with what I know of the english language.

Single handedly rebooted the slasher genre,"I love scream. I even enjoy the sequels. Yes they're predictable but they're fun. Scream is both a homage to the 70's slasher films and a reinvention.

It's clever, because it's like a double bluff... so obvious it can't be. Then wham, yes it is. I'm not naive, the biggest thing Scream had going for it was there hadn't been a movie like this for a good 10 years and we all love a good jump scare at the movies.

"Be Kind, Please Rewind","ScreamIt was hard making threatening phone calls in the 1990s because you had to know when your mark was going to be home to answer.That's the reason why the killer in this horror movie lurks outside their victim's house.On the anniversary of her mother's murder at the hands of Cotton (Liev Schreiber), high school senior Sidney (Neve Campbell) receives a call from a stranger taunting her loss. Shortly thereafter a knife-wielding maniac in a mask invades her home. As bodies pile up, Sidney suspects Cotton may be innocent.

New Breath for the Horror Genre,"Horror movies had sort of run into a rut before Scream came along with its wit and new take on these predictable films. It is, in the simplest terms, a spoof, (a very scary spoof). But there were two things that made it so good: 1, Everyone was a suspect, 2,The Killer could have been anywhere at anytime. The fact that the audience had to deal with something popping out around every corner and hints at every character being the evil-doer made it intriguing and frightfully entertaining. Our movie buff, Randy, directed us through the film with his accurate insight into the horrific plot unfolding around him...""There's always some stupid bulls!@t reason to kill your girlfriend, that's the beauty of it all: SIMPLICITY! Besides, if it gets too complicated, you lose your target audience."" Comments like these made it so enlightening and showed writer Kevin Williamson's ingenuity and brilliance.

A Really Fun Horror Movie,"I'll start out by saying that I try to stay as far away from horror movies as I can. I'm scared really easily and I don't enjoy sitting terrified for two hours. However, I think this is a great horror film for people like me. There are parts of it that are pretty freaky and will definitely have you checking your house a little extra before you sleep, but there will also be times where you are literally laughing out loud and feel relaxed. It's the perfect blend of comedy and horror.The whole premise of the movie is that it basically makes fun of horror movies. There are really specific tropes and stereotypes used throughout that build the perfect ""formula"" to a horror movie. For the last 45-ish minutes of the movie, a group of teenagers are watching a horror movie as the plot points of that play out in the ""real life"" of the Scream characters. It's actually a pretty cool parallel and you get to see just how typical every horror movie is.I wasn't overly impressed by the big twist. I thought it was something that you could kind of see coming from a mile away and when it happens, it just kind of makes sense. The whole time you're wondering who the killer is, and when it's revealed, there's about a moment of shock, but then that's it. Maybe that's the whole point - like I said before, I haven't seen that many horror movies, so maybe that's what happens in all of them. It was a kind of cool twist, but it didn't really do much for me in terms of keeping me on the edge of my seat. It just felt very cheesy, which again, could have just been the entire point of it.Overall, though, I enjoyed it a lot. I am interested in seeing the others and I was not left too scarred by this. I have seen a couple of horror movies that have kept me up at night, and while this did give me a little bit of a scare, it's nothing that bad. If you're not into horror movies, I'd still recommend seeing this movie - you'll laugh a lot, there aren't really jump scares, and the whole film just kind of keeps a lighthearted tone. It's actually pretty fun to watch - maybe just do it in the day time, with other people lol!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not bad at all,"Many people bash this movie for many reasons:Its a modern horror. Its got big name actors. It tells a story of itself.But, thats not how I see it. I'll admit the big name actors being present almost made me not want to see this movie, but when I saw that anyone could be killed at any time, I changed my mind. The story here is quite simple: a killer in a ""ghost face"" costume goes around killing teenagers. Seems too simple?Well, actually, its quite interesting. The teenagers are not stupid, horny junkies who do stupid stuff and get themselves killed. Well...mostly not anyway.The style of this movie is what made me enjoy is so much. One of the teens is the killer, and you sit there trying to guess who it is. Also, they refer to many past horror movies, and make it known that they are in what appears to be a ""horror movie turned real"".David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Skeet Ullrich, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, and Jamie Kennedy all gave great performances.

"Scary, Chilling And Funny - I Loved It!","Scream was probably one of the most popular movies of '96, and I can really see why. This was a frightening, gory movie that also had a bit of comedy mixed in with it. A series of murders occur and all the victims are from Woodsboro High School.

Courteney Cox plays in-your-face reporter Gale Weathers who is always ready to be at the scene and reporting the latest. Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott, an innocent girl whose mother was murdered and raped and now the killer is after her, too! Jamie Kennedy plays Randy Meeks, horror movie expert and comical friend. Rose McGowan plays Tatum Riley, Sidney's best friend who is the sister to Deputy Dwight 'Dewey' Riley. David Arquette plays Deputy Dwight 'Dewey' Riley, a brave deputy who must investigate the tragic events. Matthew Lillard plays Stuart Macher, wacky student at Woodsboro. Drew Barrymore plays innocent Casey Becker who is brutally murdered in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Liev Schreiber plays Cotton Weary, accused killer of Sidney's mother. So as you can see, there is quite an assortment of interesting characters. A fan of horror movies is almost guaranteed to like this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great opening . . . then I fell asleep,"Amazing. I honestly don't know how Wes Craven does it. He takes another genuinely interesting premise and absolutely slaughters it on screen - and I'm not referring to the body count here.The opening ten minutes are admittedly great. Drew Barrymore reaching for the phone, only to find herself in conversation with a stalker is inspired. What a pity then about the rest of the film.Back in the mists of time when horror movies used to scare people - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, Psycho - Scream would probably have passed without notice. But since The Evil Dead, it seems you don't have to scare people anymore, you simply have to amuse them.Quite honestly, I don't care about Jason's mum, nor about Jason, nor about who was hiding behind the curtain with a machete in their hand and wearing a stocking over their head halfway through Prom Night III.The genre of horror lost its teeth some time ago. Just occasionally a modern day classic will rear its head. If you want to see real true horror, watch Wolf Creek from about 2005.For those of a less demanding taste watch this drivel, masquerading as a horror film and stuffed full of characters straight out of any number of American sitcoms. Which brings me back to my earlier point: how does Wes Craven manage to slaughter so many genuinely good ideas?I recently saw his New Nightmare aka Nightmare On Elm Street Part 7, and it was virtually identical to Scream. The same sets, the same characters, the same supposed shocks you can see coming from a mile off. The only difference of course was in place of the tiresome Freddy, we have some tiresome bloke in a mask waving a fake knife.Fake just about sums it up.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

While it's fair to say that the quality of the films ebbed and flowed I think it's also fair to say that they were made based on the strength of this film.It's worth remembering that when this film was released the horror film genre was stale and pretty stagnant. Scream not only parodied the genre as a whole, it also revitalised it and brought some much need ingenuity. As well as the historical importance of this film it still holds up today, especially for those who are new to the genre.I don't have much more to say about Scream. If you've seen the film before you know why it's worth watching.

Some people don't get it...,"Some people think it's just a typical 90s slasher. It isn't, it's a satire which (i understand) can be a little confusing sometimes. This movie is meant to be funny: making fun of slashers but at the same time it is a slasher, so it uses irony as a form of comedy. Anyway it's very funny in outlining horror clichés and using them at the same time. I think all 3 Screams are great but the best is the third which has one of the funniest things I've ever seen in it and I think to enjoy the Scream movies you need to have seen some horror movies and perhaps be a little sadistic (ok maybe not) but anyone who tells you this movie is bad really doesn't get it.

Undoubtedly the king of slasher movies!,Scream has one of the most intense opening sequences ever shown in a slasher movie. The chasing sequences and the gory style kills provide a hell of an experience. American horror culture and its influence over youth is shown beautifully as the movie progresses. Typical college style romantic sequences were a delight to watch with all the wild sequences. The climax with twists which is like a blood splash festival is the right ending to the whole movie.Acting performance of Neve Campell is good where she depicts the life of a half depressed waiting for a miracle life women. Courtney Cox too does her part playing the media vixen with a punchable attitude.Scream is one of a kind enjoyment that is a satire as well as a gory filled exciting ride.Rating:74/100.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Single-handedly eliminated the horror genre,"Everyone used to talk about how SCREAM 'saved' horror; the irony was, as we've now come to see, it actually killed it off, and almost for good. While SCREAM is a pretty decent film, the firm tongue-in-cheekness of the script, combined with pretty teenage kids, and subsequent turnover at the box office, made studios go teen-horror movie mad. The end result was five years of complete drivel from the so-called horror genre, with few notable exceptions, all from outside the teen horror area (SIXTH SENSE, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and lately RING). Tripe like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, URBAN LEGEND, SHRIEK, and the spoofy but equally terrible SCARY MOVIEs helped turn horror completely into a farce. A joke, even. The follow-ups to SCREAM further contributed to this demise, both forgetting the joke and playing themselves further into near-total parody. Another irony is that Craven did this in-joke horror much better two years earlier with NEW NIGHTMARE; a far superior horror movie, and a very underated flick. Only lately, with the realisation that horror was actually a lot better in the 1970s, have we seen some signs that a turnaround might be on the horizon. Please, please, please... don't screw it all up by making another SCREAM, Wes.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wes Craven's sleeper hit that brought back slashers to cultural relevance with a sly satirical bite and self-referential humor.,"In the town of Woodsboro, several teens consisting including Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard), Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan), Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) experience a rash of killings done by a nameless assailant who calls his victims using a voice modulator and stalks and kills them in a ghostface costume. The killings become a media sensation sending the town into a panic as tabloid reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) covers the story believing the killings have ties to Sidney and the death of her mother.Scream began under the title of Scary Movie and was motivated by screenwriter Kevin Williamson's love of the slasher genre with the unique point of this particular film being it was a slasher film where slasher films existed within its own universe. The script eventually became the subject of a bidding war between several studios including Paramount, Cinergi, and Morgan Creek, before Miramax acquired the script for $400,000 with an option for the two sequels Williamson had outlined and an unrelated fourth film. While Wes Craven wanted to keep the title of Scary Movie but Miramax heads instead opted for Scream (though they would later recycle the title for a series of parody films). Upon release the film became a hit with both audiences and critics with the film becoming a sleeper hit earning $173 million worldwide against a $15 million budget and not only starting a new horror franchise, but also inspiring waves of imitators in the previously dead genre of slashers that had largely fallen by the wayside with the advent of the 90s. The film was the subject of praise for its self-aware approach to the slasher genre and to this day remains a modern day benchmark for many films that followed in its wake.While the movie has all the standard traits we associate with the slasher formula including the various character archetypes, creepy phone calls, and masked berserker killers, the movie walks the line between playing these elements seriously. The film is chocked full of references to slashers running the gamut from culture touchstones like Friday the 13th and Halloween (and even Craven's own Nightmare on Elm Street) as well as more general ""rules"" of the slasher genre often espoused by Jamie Kennedy's Randy Meeks whose tirades about how you should go about surviving a slasher are some of the funniest moments in the film in particular since he's having these conversations with actual slasher fodder. But despite the satiric bite present in the film's screenplay, the movie also balances that out with genuine shock and horror with the opening sequence still very memorable and tense even in the midst of referencing other films. The movie has created a legacy for itself and is an important film for the 90s (and subsequent films that built upon it) but you can definitely see some cracks in the foundation due to revisits by imitators and Williamson himself with the nature of the killers becoming a common cheat in many films of this ilk that followed suit.Scream remains an impressive showcase in balancing horror and humor and has earned a well deserved place in horror history with an iconic killer and approach.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Well balanced and iconic slasher.,"This is a film that offers something from several genres: it is a good horror film, a funny comedy and a suspenseful whodunnit. Because the plot does not rely on the supernatural, which is part of its appeal, I think one of the more unique aspects of this film, when released, was that it is a pretty good mystery/whodunnit as well. So many people are set up to be the potential killer, but are gradually whittled away, and even in the last act you are still guessing.

What makes it even better is that this film does not derive its scares from blood and gore (although there is a fair amount of it, especially in the opening scene), but it truly does have you in suspense in many of the scenes.  What also adds to this benefit is that the film actually has a plot aside from the slashing that tends to dominate these films.

The first of this era...,"""Scream"" is the first movie of the Scream series and it has to do with a killer known as Ghostface who begins killing off teenagers, and as the number of the victims start to rising, a group of friends find interesting to find out the rules of this serial killer but unfortunately for them the serial killer has other plans.I liked this horror movie because of the plot and the story of it which I believe that it was really unexpected. I also think that Drew Barrymore made a really great interpretation playing as Casey and I also liked the interpretations of Neve Campbell who plays as Sidney and Courteney Cox who plays as Gale Weathers.Finally I have to tell you that if you want to watch a really nice horror movie then this is your movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Greatest movie EVER!!!!!,"This movie is my personal favorite. I didn't really like....ok I HATED horror movies before I saw Scream, but now, I like Scream/Halloween type horror movies (slasher). Scream is hip, funny, scary, bloody, action-packed, and dramatic all at once. I have the Director's Cut as well as the original and Scream 2 on video, so I basically LOVE this movie! If you don't like horror movies, then see this movie, and it will change your attitude. In a word EXCELLENT!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ghost(Joke)face's starting point. Cult classic ages not smothly,"Because of the newest Scream entry, Scream VI --- any soar throats by this point? ---, my daughter wanted to go on a smooth ride of watching the previous entries, starting with Scream from 1996. I joined because I'm always up for horror (and trash.)Scream starts with a scene that has no purpose other than to stablish the funny slasher murderer Ghostface. The opening scene is so iconic that any parody that wants to mock Scream uses the same opening scene's premise: Ghostface's phone call. To the overall story, the opening scene adds a big hole that I can only discuss later.What prompts Scream to the second act is the attack on the protagonist. These scenes add more questions than answers, to be honest, much of them not answered by the end of the movie. Each action feels like a filler to enlarge the movie's screen time, unrelated to the main plot. Because of this, the progress is just a bunch of random killing that makes no sense other than what I mentioned previously about the opening scene's big hole.The climax to any slasher movie is the confrontation between the murderer and the protagonist, in which we also learn the whys. Well, again, most of the movie is a huge parody, so nothing to add here other than a dramatic and funny chase sequence that ends with the big revelation.Overall, Scream is a classic that I think started as a joke and ended up a huge cult success. I guess we didn't know better back then. I'd only recommend this movie if (A) you are on a nostalgia trip or (B) you want a fresh take on the series before watching the newest entry.!!! SPOILERS AHEAD --- PLEASE, DON'T READ IF DON'T WANT TO LEARN ABOUT BIG EVENTS OF THE MOVIEMost of the killings make no sense when you learn why Ghostface is murdering people. Well, Ghostfaces, as a matter of fact: Billy and Stu are the killers. I get Billy's motive: he is a spoiled child, kinda psycopathic, that wants to get revenge on Sydney for his mother's departure because of Sydney's mother's affair with his father (phew!) Stu seems to be on the ride because he is a psycho.Now, this revelation makes the other murders irrelevant. I assume it was Stu and Billy just following their psycho path (get it?), but it all feels dumb --- specially the Principal's death; that one was just plain dumb. I guess that was the idea: to mock that slasher villains have weird, not-well-thought motives.In the end, Scream is a cult classic, a trash entry to the slasher genre that knows what he is doing without shame. I guess that's for the best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Worthy of the Reputation,"I remember the mid to late 90's. The mainstream movie scene then was weak. Especially in horror. It was still dominated of dying franchises that had lost whatever it was that made them the icons they were in the 80's and early 90's and left them empty shells. Or else it was dominated by the ghosts of those that had already fallen. Nowhere was this more evident than the Slasher.So, along comes something new and fresh from Wes Craven. A slasher film that's super meta and starts off with a gritt, captivating sequence torment and murder. It reinvigorated the genre and led to a rebirth.Or at least that's the narrative. I do recall feeling Scream was fresh and new. No super natural, unstoppable force doing all the slaughter like Leatherface, Michael Myers, Jason, Freddy, Chucky, etc. Ghost Face was more of a whodunnit mystery, closer to the original Friday the 13th or Sleepaway Camp. Maybe for that reason alone I remember really enjoying it at the time.But nothing about this movie really lands well today. The plot twist at the end is too contrived. The kills after the intro are uninspired and boring. There are tons of jump scares and plot misdirection to keep the audience engaged, but the tone is off and lacks and actual suspense. It's a sarcastic inversion of slasher tropes and full of meta references and in that sense can be seen as an homage to the genre, but sitting here in 2023 it was hard to make it through the whole thing. This is coming from someone who's been rewatching and rediscovering slashers from the 80's and 90's as of late, so I'm not just hating on it for what it is. Maybe I'm just not a Wes Craven fan... But this is one I wish I'd skipped.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Another Milestone...,"Director Wes Craven's SCREAM is so well known by now as to have become both legendary and a near-parody of itself. At the time of its release, it was just what the mad doctor ordered for a beleaguered, bereft genre that was just about out of gas. As he, along with the likes of Tobe Hooper, had done in the early 1970's, Craven single-handedly reinvigorated / reinvented horror for an entire generation.SCREAM broke every ""rule"", presenting itself as a slick, satirical look at horror films, by turning them in on themselves. From the first time Drew Barrymore's character answers the phone, to the final, shocking revelation, Craven and Writer Kevin Williamson force us to laugh at and, yes, scream at the self-contradictory ""reminiscent freshness"" of it all.Scads of movies followed, attempting to utilize SCREAM's mood, coolness, and self-referential slyness, but none were ever as good. None ever made a mark like this movie. It stands as one of the most influential films in horror history. Extraordinary and classic stuff indeed...",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I only watched it in hopes that it would enhance my viewing of the comedy ""Scary Movie"". Now that you know where I'm coming from you can see I'm not going to love it up front.  But from that point of view, I have to say, the acting was impressive. Lots of new (to me) talent bursting through here.

scream movie,I love this movie so much this is my favorite movie of all time. This is why I gave it a rating of ten. I love the way the story plot is so realistic and scary. I have seen it about fifty times. I watch it at least three times a week. I know all the words by heart. I love how the scenes aren't to bloody except for the ending scene. This movie is so awesome I love Kevin Williamson for writing such a great film. Also I love Wes Craven for directing it . I love his movies. This movie has the best cast of all time.Like Neve Cambell Mathew Lillard Jamie Kennedy Skeet Ulrich Rose Magowen Henry Winkler Courtney Cox Arquette and David Arquette and more.........This movie is so scary my favorite scene is the opening seen. This movie is so good I Bought the box set and everything.There is a lot of hints in this movie that is similar to Halloween.......like go to the Makenzies is in both Halloween and scream. I also like how all the screams tie together to create the trilogy ... like roman causing it all and how him and Sidney share a moment at the end of scream 3. I also enjoy how old cast members appear in the other screams like Stu Macher(Mathew Lillard walks by in scream 2 when he is supposed to be dead and randy (Jamie Kennedy appears in scream 3 in the video to explain the rules to Sidney and Dewey..Once again I really love this movie and I hope everyone else does too,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Still worthy,"Like Quentin Tarantino before him, Kevin Williamson has become one of the most revered/reviled writers of our generation.  I don't revere him(I hated I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and while DAWSON'S CREEK started off good, it got mediocre, except for Katie Holmes(*sigh*)), but I don't revile him, as this movie was good.  You don't have to be a big fan of the horror genre to even appreciate it(though it does help, which I found out after watching HALLOWEEN and then watching this again).  It does share a problem that every Wes Craven movie has had since NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET - an overlong climax - but it's funny and scary, it takes some well-deserved shots at both the horror genre and how our culture reacts to death, and it doesn't look down on its characters or its audience.  Still, I am looking forward to SCREAM IF YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST SUMMER(or is it HALLOWEEN?), as this does need a spoof around now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A fun guilty pleasure,"Scream has been lauded as groundbreaking for its self-aware references to the horror genre. There are several instances where the film directly acknowledges the tropes it engages in. While that is fun and unique, it is not enough to carry this movie by itself. Scream is certainly meta, but it doesn't take the next step with that awareness. The story still falls into predictable clichés that slasher flicks have become known for. So, even though this gimmick makes the movie above average, it fails to go too far beyond that.Plus, from a technical perspective, Scream is standard. Visually, there are tilted angles but that is the only technique used on that front (and it's a basic one). Meanwhile, the soundtrack, editing, and effects are all fair but forgettable. Overall, there isn't much filmmaking here that stands out. The mask has become iconic so that was a great costume choice, Drew Berrymore's opening scene is a strong hook, and Matthew Lillard provides a charismatic performance. However, those are all the positives of note in this film. Therefore, while Scream has a few tricks up its sleeve, there simply isn't enough here to make it more than a fun guilty pleasure.Writing: 6/10

a brilliant film,"This film is a classic horror movie, and thought it may not be one where the audience are scared to death, it still made it as one of my favourites, and believe me I've seen a lot. The downside to this film in my opinion was the fact that there is nearly no acknowledgement of Rose McGowan or her character Tatum on the cover of the VHS/DVD or in many of the trailers. She was, to me, one of the star characters of the film.The special effects aren't the best I've seen, though the blood looks real in parts, but certain deaths do look like they really could have happened.

So-so horror spoof,"I never understood why this movie got such great reviews...it was a ok horror spoof, but not a great horror movie. In fact, in my opinion this made a mockery of the horror genre.

Yes, many horror movies in the '80s & '90s were basically the same, which was good. That was what the viewer wanted, so why change? Apparently genre great Wes Craven felt the need to attract a younger audience...so he got rid of teh horror & threw in pretty faces with humor. I'd write a review of this movie, but it's just a spoof of horror flicks, with so-so humor thrown in. I didn't care for this movie too much; but it was better than the two sequels.

Wes Craven's Phenomenal Comeback,"A group of teens are pitted against a masked murderer that tests their knowledge of horror movies.Can we admit that Neve Campbell is a terrible actress? She managed to get in all four ""Scream"" films, and ""The Craft"", and ""Wild Things"" and ""Party of Five"". She was a dominant force of the 1990s. But really, just admit it, she was the Kristen Stewart of the 1990s -- very wooden, not much range, and considered more appealing by studio executives than by actual viewers.But that criticism aside, this is a great film, and definitely among Wes Craven's best. He has had his great films and his less-than-great films. Some, frankly, we might want to forget. But this was so powerful, really added some wit to the slasher film, and for that we must respect the man. Wes Craven is the all-time greatest horror director.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A new Horror classic!,"What's your favorite scary movie?"" Well, Scream is certainly one of my favorite horror movies. Scream is directed by Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, The People Under The Stairs). Scream was the smash hit that transformed the horror genre. Scream is a rarity of horror, spoof, laughs, thrills, chills, and overall Wes Craven crafted another amazing horror classic.I'm going to try and keep this review short. Mainly because a majority of people already know this is a good movie. I honestly believe, it takes someone with the talent of Wes Craven, to somewhat poke fun at the horror genre, and in the same film deliver a good horror movie. The movie is original, and even though it has '90s written all over it, it still feels organic and fun.Everyone does an amazing job acting in the film. Neve Campbell is tough as nails, David Arquette and Courteney Cox work well on screen, Matthew Lillard is funny and scary, along with the rest of the cast. My only complaint, is from the poster of the film, you would expect Drew Barrymore (Charlie's Angels, 50 First Dates) to be the star. I believe they did this as an extra way to make money, and cash in on her popularity.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Scream. If you haven't seen this movie, what the Hell are you waiting for? Seriously, it's more than a movie for horror nerds and geeks. It's a movie that should be seen by any movie lover. Oh, and the Fonz is in it! I believe Scream earns a...9/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie.

Self-Reflexivity in Scream,"People are into this movie because they appreciate it has an endearing. This movie is, throughout, self-reflexive. This is how it can be self-deprecating in a really endearing way. It still has intrinsic scares; it is not explicitly a movie about moviesit carries the self-reflexive thing just as far as it needs to and uses it in just the right way. The most obvious example of this from the movie is when the guy lays out the rules of a horror movie and predicts what will happen next. When I think of Scream, these are the ideas immediately present in my mind: pure play in fright, the garage door scene, the archetypes, the self-reflexive attitude, epitomized by that one scene in which a character lists aloud the rules of the horror genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A horror classic,"A maniac is killing off teenagers in the small town of Woodsboro. A bunch of teens (among them Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard) try to figure out who's doing it and why. Meanwhile reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is trying to get the story from the town deputy (David Arquette).This came out in winter 1996. By then horror films were all but dead. However this one was a big hit with critics and audiences and started off a new wave of horror films. Why? Because it has a clever script with MANY references to older horror films; established the rules on how to survive a horror film; had smart, intelligent and likable teenagers and basically played with the genre and reinvented it. Also there is a good sense of humor in this but there's also some very graphic gore (especially at the end). This got an NC-17 from the ratings board until director Wes Craven agreed to tone down on the violence. The acting is good all around, it moves at a fast pace and I was constantly entertained by it. Also the opening 15 minutes with Drew Barrymore is terrifying. The only debit is Lillard. He overacts to a downright embarrassing degree and gets very annoying...especially at the end. Still, him aside, this is a great horror film. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Another Great Horror Movie,"While Scream does take some horror elements from other movies it does it in its own way, which makes it a great movie.

"Not too scary, but it is fun.","I recently had a good time watching all the Saw movies, and so was in the mood for another horror series to churn through (and possibly get obsessed with). Like the Saw series, I'd only ever seen the first Scream, and about a decade ago, too. Rather than start with Scream 2, I decided it was worth revisiting the first, especially since I didn't remember much beyond the opening, some parts of the ending (but not all), and that I mostly liked it.After seeing it again, yep, I still mostly like it. There is something missing here for me to say I love it - it might be that I don't feel like the film's quite as clever as others seem to. It is a witty and post-modern approach to horror while not being so played for laughs that it ceases to function as a horror/thriller movie (so it's not a full-on parody, and it doesn't go as far when it comes to deconstructing tropes/conventions as say Cabin in the Woods), but I don't know if it's all that. I think Wes Craven's New Nightmare - released in 1994 - is about as good, and similarly has a real meta hook to it. That one's not perfect either, but does still feel underrated. As far as Craven's best film goes... I'd still go with the obvious pick and say 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street.But Scream is fun, sometimes quite funny, and doesn't have many dull moments. I like how aggressively 1990s it is, with the high school scenes scratching the same itch as Buffy the Vampire Slayer's early seasons (and apparently Sarah Michelle Gellar is in Scream 2). It's really close to being great in my eyes, but I can't quite find myself loving it; it's right on the cusp. I can understand its popularity though, for sure, and I am looking forward to seeing what directions the sequels go in, even if part of me fears they may push things a little too far with the meta stuff (we'll see, and they could always pushing things ""too far"" in a way that somehow works).",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Well done, but it doesn't work like it's supposed to","There is no doubt that this movie not only caused a resurgence in slasher movies, it completely changed the way they work. For a movie to do that, it has to be very good, and I applaud ""Scream"" for its ability to do so (though I'm getting kind of tired of the style it created for a few reasons which I will list here).""Scream"" is your standard slasher movie, albeit with a few major differences. First and foremost, it is a curious mix of scares and comedy, which I will get to later. Second, unlike most slasher movies, it's pretty smart. The characters do dumb things, but they talk smart, and the fact that they still do dumb things makes it pretty funny sometimes. Finally, it's well done. It all seems very fresh and nothing is sloppy or hammed up. Very welcoming.The plot is standard, but given the purpose of the movie, that's what it should be. It's a slasher movie that pokes fun at itself and the earlier entries into the genre, so it's only natural that it takes this route. Basically, a costumed psychopath is stalking and brutally murdering local teenagers (after they drink or have sex, and/or do stupid things...again, part of the joke). But it centers around one local teen, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is of course, not without a dark past.That's pretty much it. Sound familiar? It should. Again, that's the point. But what rises it above the level (significantly) is that it knows what it's doing, and isn't trying to hide it (therefore not assuming its target audience is dumber than the characters that inhabit the worst entries into the genre). The characters are actually pretty intelligent (thanks to the smart script and the solid acting across the board), and even know the rules of the slasher movies, and of course the people who laugh at the warnings die gruesome deaths by making the mistakes that they were warned about (again, it's being funny and scary at the same time).Now about that purpose I was talking about, the fact that it's aiming for both laughs and scares, sometimes at the same time. It's certainly ambitious, which is rare for a big studio, and unheard of for a horror movie, especially a slasher movie. However, I have to admit, it doesn't work like it's supposed to. The laughs dilute the scares for the most part (though there are a good few creepy moments). The beginning scene with Drew Barrymore, is excellent, though not very scary. Still, it's commendable for how well it's done. I admit that I didn't see the final twist coming, which is kind of surprising (and probably should be rather embarrassing) since it was probably meant to lampoon the feeble attempts of the same obligatory task that was made by its predecessors. Then again, movies like ""Scream"" are typically not my kind of movie. But it's a modern classic of sorts (as close to it as a mainstream movie will come), so I had to check it out.While it doesn't work like it's supposed to, that doesn't mean it's a waste of time, not by a long shot. ""Scream"" may not be the best horror movie, but it's undeniably engaging, and never boring. I was always involved in the movie, and its interesting tone helps a lot. It's a fun movie, in a way, but it still manages to be pretty dark and grim. The recognition for that goes to Wes Craven, rightly known as one of the masters of the genre. He puts a lot of effort into the movie, and it shows. His goal is clearly not to have the most brutal deaths and the most sex, booze and gore he can cram into a single movie (though there are significant amounts of all of them and then some). He loves what he's doing, and wants to make it the best he can, and for his part, he does the best that can be done with the material. The new mixture of laughs and scares not working is not his fault, it's the concept that doesn't work. That statement is proved by all the future horror flicks that try to use the same method, which has long worn out it's welcome (even though it never really came).The acting isn't that important, as it's not that kind of movie (slasher movies aren't supposed to be). That said, all the acting is believable, and serves the film's purpose solidly.Writer Kevin Williamson is clearly very talented, especially since this was his first script. He is an idea man (something that is almost extinct in mainstream Hollywood), and he has about as much know-how and as strong of a love for the slasher movie as Craven himself.Speaking of, Wes Craven deserves most of the credit for pulling this movie together. Again, this movie doesn't quite work like the filmmakers had perhaps hoped, but it could have been a complete mess. Applause goes to Craven for preventing that. Actually, he makes it work well enough that almost none of the horror movies these days aim for just scares, which is kind of a shame now, because after 11 years, I kind of miss those movies.Do I recommend it? Sure, just know what you're going into. If you're going into it expecting a pure scarefest like ""Halloween,"" you're probably going to be disappointed because that's not what ""Scream"" offers. It's a slasher movie that offers a commentary on itself. Now that's something you don't see every day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Horror Classic!,"Scream is a 1996 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. The film stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and Drew Barrymore. The sleepy little town of Woodsboro just woke up screaming. There's a killer in their midst who's seen a few too many scary movies. Suddenly nobody is safe, as the psychopath stalks victims, taunts them with trivia questions, then rips them to bloody shreds. It could be anybody.Scream serves as a near perfect example of how to successfully and single-handedly revive the horror genre. It is a film that takes elements from classics that evoked the genre and reinvents melodramatic conventions breathing life into a worn-out genre. The movie contains the usual horror characters, but they are supplied with dialogue, often surprisingly smart and funny, that serves as a running, biting commentary on slasher tropes. Scream builds to a splattering finale that should leave genre fans highly satisfied. Scream is nothing short of a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Snarky Slasher That's Deliciously Self-Aware,"A piercing satire that also works as a well-formed case study, Scream fits the mold of a classic slasher movie while recognizing and celebrating the genre's most common stereotypes. Often in winking, rambling monologues that crash straight through the fourth wall. With Wes Craven behind the camera, there's no doubting its credibility, nor its working knowledge of those tropes. Craven had admittedly tired of horror movies at this point in his career, but the promise of sending one last love letter to his longest tenured fans, while also having a little fun at their expense, pulled him right back in. He must've enjoyed the experience just as much as the audience, as he'd sign on for three more installments over the course of the ensuing fifteen years. His guidance, wealth of knowledge and cheeky willingness to hold nothing sacred (not even his own body of work) are essential components that really bring this cheeky screenplay to life.Scream's tricky mix of horror and humor doesn't always click, but its wins outnumber its misfires. In addition to the tongue-in-cheek meta stuff, it hits the right notes as a teen comedy, a moody thriller and a crafty whodunnit. That's an awful lot of hats, but they all fit, and they're all necessary; the film's diversity makes it easier to look past its weak acting and cheesy tone. Neve Campbell is nice to look at, but her stammering cadence is a huge roadblock. Jamie Kennedy's character only exists to look us in the eye and flaunt the writer's genre awareness. Matthew Lillard is the sole cast member who could reasonably pass as a teenager, but not necessarily for the right reasons. These all play into the ongoing game of nudging, ironic self-awareness, but that doesn't mean they're above critique. I'm not even sure they were intentional.Which isn't to say it can't do subtlety. While many such homages are spelled out in bright lights for the lesser-informed, alert viewers will catch an equal number of sly hints writhing under the surface. Both do their job admirably, serving as necessary relief for the ever-present night scares and house party stabbings. The killer's wardrobe is similarly on-point; a simple but memorable guise that justifiably became an instant classic, right alongside Freddy, Jason and Michael. Watching this with my kids was a unique experience, given the abundance of '90s hallmarks like land lines, video rental stores and brick cel phones. One character is even killed by a CRT television. That it's so firmly planted in 1996 is part of its charm, and still another connection to the old slashers with which it's so infatuated. Imagine how many victims could've been saved over the years, if only there were an iPhone in their pocket.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
No other slasher horror can top this classic!,"Although I was only a few years old when this movie came out, it is still to this day my all time personal favorite horror film. Even after three others that continued on with the franchise (which were equally just as great), I still always came back to this one. The reference to all things horror movies within the film is a great comedic relief throughout, especially with characters like Matthew Lillard's and Jamie Kennedy's. And the almost constant action keeps you reeled in the entire time.The first time watching kept me guessing the whole way through who the killer actually is. The reveal and whole ending scene is spectacular in that it is both shocking and witty and left room for plenty of storyline to follow in the other three movies. All of the characters work well together and add their own little quirks and personalities to each little bit of the movie.It is definitely a classic and has yet to be topped by any other slasher film to this day in my opinion. It is rewatched religiously even 20+ years later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Fave,"If you want to watch the ultimate classic awesome horror film, watch Scream. I didn't even know what it was and my mom forced me to watch it. Like she tied me to a chair and pried my eyes open like in Clockwork Orange. Ok not really but Scream. Watch it because it is a classic tongue-in-cheek homage to movies that are on VHS in my grandpa's basement. Watch this, then I dare you to say it's not a classic film.

Resurrection Boulevard.,"Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" series had run its course by 1996 and he needed some new material. While horror films rarely become creative, Craven decided to poke fun at the genre that he helped to make famous by the mid-1980s with ""Scream"". This is a silly slasher flick, but it knows what it is and does not try to get cute with crazed gimmicks. A town falls under siege as the teens start to be murdered by a person dressed in what is little more than a Halloween costume. Naturally the cops are no help (most notably David Arquette) and the media turns the whole thing into a gigantic circus (with Courtney Cox leading the way). Teens Neve Campbell, Drew Barrymore, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard all try to figure out who the bad guy might be, but in the end twists and turns will occur that will surprise some and leave others feeling a bit empty. ""Scream"" is not a bad film for the genre. In fact it is a near masterpiece compared to the ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series of films. Craven, who struck gold with the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", nearly accomplishes what he did some 12 years earlier when he revolutionized a sub-par cinematic group of films. ""Scream"" works better as a parody than an actual horror flick and its influence would lead to lesser films by other film-makers. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best slasher movies by far.,"Wes Craven took everything we know and love about slasher movies, and elevated it to the next level. 'Scream' showed us slasher movies can have substance.Thanks to clever writing and good directing, 'Scream' feels remarkably original and fresh. It is scary and suspenseful but also not too serious, thanks to some lighthearted moments that are subtle enough not to ruin the suspense.Neve Campbell stars as Sidney - a role she would portray for the next 25 years! We have our bunch of teens as we normally do with slasher movies. Only here, all of the characters are so well set-up that it's not all that easy to predict who will be the next victim, and who will survive. It is also actually a really good story. Sidney's back story is crucial to her character, and survival instincts. The film propelled Neve Campbell to super stardom.And who could forget that classic opening sequence starring Drew Barrymore? Talk about classic!! And off course that now famous mask. 'Scream' is fast-paced and suspenseful and a clever who dunnit murder mystery, that will keep you guessing until the end. But wait, there's more...there's a few twists! The film has a very good score as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Self-referential nineties,"This movie changed horror. Other movies have changed the way that we are scared through film and this changed it for the teen market. The gore was there but not extreme; the stars were kids and the music for the new generation. This film also brought a self-referential nineties post-modern irony to the ball game. As a film it is very good with strong acting and some good jumps. It does lack depth although the light comedy makes up for that. This is an entertaining, if lighter than most, slick teen horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
My Favorite Movie,"It's only fitting to write a review for my favorite movie, the movie that reinvigorated the slasher genre. Satirizing the horror genre and the many clichés that were prevalent in the 80's horror movies while successfully throwing the audience through a loop in the first ten minutes. I think one of the reasons the movie has been so successful has been the cast, using already established actors like Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore. My first viewing of this movie brought a mix of excitement and fear as Ghostface flashed his haunting mask and tilted his head. The story has a meta feel to it, the characters can recognize the presence of other horror films and know the dangers of being a teenager in the situation. You spend the whole movie trying to decipher who the killer is and even when presented with a red-herring and as the characters start dropping, you still are perplexed with the result. The film offers comic relief and characters that you can become invested in; whether it's Dewey the lovable deputy, or Randy, the geeky horror movie guru.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A favorite of mine for one reason!,"""Scream"" will always be a favorite of mine for one simple reason. I love what happens to Drew Berrymore's character in the first 5 minutes of the film. Why can't this happen to her in some of her other movies? ""Riding in Cars with Boys"" anyone, or perhaps ""Home Fries""? ""Charlie's Angels"" - you bet!! I could watch the first 5 minutes of ""Scream"" over and over again. The rest of the movie is pretty good too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A different perspective on the genre,"Ah Scream, a movie that blew away the horror going cinema goers and haunted kids of the days nightmares. This is one movie considered one of the quintessential viewings of horror and is credited with revitalising the genre which had up to that point been in a way, dying out. As much as I respect Scream for doing that I can't write this and say I loved it or found it to be this amazing movie, I more felt it tries very hard to be smart but thinks it is smarter than it really is. The master behind the whole shebang is none other than Wes Craven who is considered one of the daddies of the horror movie genre and for good reason, the guy knows suspense when he see's it and crafts a movie that on his part is good and well done. I did however find little things about this that aren't all that great and the acting is not always that great even if this is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek.Our plot takes us to a town in the US and more specifically to a load of teenagers who are shocked to find out one of their classmates was brutally murdered by someone only we have seen wearing that now infamous mask. Our plot then takes us between murders as people are killed in the town, and not only teenagers are the target, this killer is one sadistic piece of work who also happens to be oddly funny too. Scream prides itself on making a mockery of horror and it's usually before this obvious plots, what it doesn't do though is truly branch out of that I mean if you watch closely it never truly changes the story, just plays out like any other. One thing I really did appreciate was the way Craven makes everyone a suspect and you really don't know who it is until the very end and even then you expect some kind of twist.I really wanted to love this I truly did but I do feel this has aged quite a bit, and I don't mean with its fashion etc. The reason I felt it is dated is because Scream itself created horror that could also contain humour as a light side gag, in turn Scream may have changed the game and had a few comments on the industry in horror but never truly stands out to me today and any movie which changes the game should be able to beat anyone who dares copy it. That all said Scream is still pretty damn scary I mean the killer jumping around is really quite chilling even if he keeps getting smacked by cupboard doors and kicked in the balls. As Horror goes it may not satisfy all those who prefer it serious but truly don't take this seriously and you'll have fun.I almost forgot to mention the actors involved; of course we have Neve Campbell as our main character of sorts Sidney Prescott who is in a spot of trouble throughout. Cast like Courteney Cox make it good but watching many episodes of ""Friends"" before hand makes me see her in a whole new light where she isn't Monica Geller. We then have David Arquette as a kind of comedy reliever in Deputy Dewey and some jokes also come from the future shaggy in ""Scooby-Doo"" (sorry I mean that is what I most remember him for) Matthew Lillard who alongside all the other cast members always has something funny albeit a little dark to say.I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to see Scream and call it a masterpiece or brilliant or even good for that matter but maybe one day though. I will though be able to recommend it and say it is OK and that I feel is good enough because this is one movie I think everyone should see whether horror fan or not you can't deny this is a popular movie and one you might just love yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I'm surprised how many people liked this movie.,"Let me just say that if you liked this movie, good for you, I am just expressing my thoughts about how amateur this movie is. My opinion is that true horror films do not use blood and guts alone to make it a block-buster. Take an old Alfred Hitchcock movie, lets say Psycho for an example. Sleek, thrilling, magnificently creepy, a huge twist at the end, and totally controversial for it's time (Even though it spawned a whole bunch of crappy sequels, but hey, what horror movie doesn't?). To me, this was not a true horror film, but a bucket of meaningless blood and gore passing itself off to be horror. But again, this movie might be or some of you fans of ""new age"" horror flicks, but for us fans of the old Hitchcock classics like the Birds and Psycho this movie is not our style.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What's your favorite scary movie? Easy: Scream,"This movie is amazing. Great cast. Great writing. Great director. Great characters. I recommend this to everyone. This was my very first horror movie and it really got me interested into the genre. There are plenty of scares and jumps throughout the film and it has its fair share of violent acts done by the killers. The first time I saw this movie I caught the last 40 minutes or so, so I didn't have any clue what was going on and I didn't even really know what the movie was about. So I was glad to see it again all the way through, really appreciating the movie. Now its one of my favorites! The character development is great, so you really care about who dies/ doesn't die and the one-liners are funny, bad-ass or just plain wrong. Kudos to K. Williamson for his original, groundbreaking script. And kudos to the cast, particularly to Matthew Lillard (HILARIOUS), Neve Campbell (my favorite Scream Queen), and Courteney Cox (favorite actress ever-played ruthlessly ambitious Gale to the T), for their wonderful acting.

Lots of movie references and pop culture trivia in the scenes but you gotta pay attention to get them as they re meant to give a certain effect.

Instant classic,This is one of the best horror films of the 90's where Wes Craven makes a parody of horror/slasher films where a masked killer who is a horror film addict stalks and kills teenagers.

The story has few scary moments, but it has several funny moments that work very well, just like it makes fun of other films of the genre even if it ends up falling into some of the same cliches that it makes fun of, it always maintains the mystery and suspense. Most of the gory scenes are well done, as are some of the action scenes, the performances are compelling, and the plot twist is unexpected.It is a film that manages to entertain, as well as it manages to be a bit scary and very funny, ideal to have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Scream (1996),"80/100. The movie that begun the silver age of slasher films in the mid to late 1990's. Although Wes Craven's horror filmography is glowing with other culturally significant trips to the macabre ( A Nightmare on Elm Street, Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes) I consider 'Scream' to be his greatest achievement. Not only was the timing for the film perfect, but Kevin Williamson's simple yet brilliant script and an almost perfect cast help hail this movie as one of the best horror movies of the 1990's. Neve Campbell as the film's sexually repressed or 'final girl' character, if you will, rivals that of the original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis. David Arquette as Dewey Riley steals the spotlight every scene he's in, Courtney Cox proves her acting talent by playing a stuck up, malevolent news reporter whose passion and slight hint of selflessness makes her character hard to not love, while Jamie Kennedy helps channel the audience's thoughts and concerns to everyone on screen. Even minor characters such as Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and even Henry Winkler all have memorable roles. Drew Barrymore's opening scene although perhaps a little over-the-top, is both memorable and nostalgic to horror movie lore. This strongly meta influenced film is one of the few to get the concept right and the laugh to scare ratio is perfect. The final act is a wild ride that should make everyone shudder at how plausible it would be for someone to put on a Halloween costume and start butchering inebriated teenagers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Best Slasher of all Time,"Behold, the best slasher of all time!While some may say Halloween (1978) or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) I think this is better. Both are amazing, but this is infinitely more rewatchable for me, and is just a great time anytime I watch it. I'm going to my best to make a longer review for this like I've been doing, but for some reason, even though I adore this movie, I feel like I can't find a lot of words to explain why I love it, but I'll try.I think the best thing about Scream is the mystery. Never in a movie have I been second guessing myself so much. The twist is iconic for a reason. I was just shocked when the big reveal happened. The entire storyline is super well done. It takes its time, but also has very fast paced. It starts with an amazing opening kill, and the opening scene is genius. It sets up so many things about Ghostface in such a short period. Really the definition of ""show not tell."" It shows how Ghostface is a horror movie nerd, likes to mess with his victims, and is very sadistic. The dialogue is superb. Starting with how Casey thinks Ghostface is just messing around, but starts to realize how evil he is. The way it seems playful at first, but so smoothly changes Ghostface's dialogue into his sadistic version is great. The tension in this opening is exquisite. And of course the ending of the entire opening is gruesome, but, like I said, sets the tone of the movie super well.I know I just spend a really long time talking about the opening, but it's so iconic and well done that I think it deserves it. The rest of the storyline after the opening is just as good. Slowly establishing each character, and their whole deal, but not becoming boring by throwing in really good intense moments and at the same time, making you second guess who Ghostface might be. And I'll be honest, the dialogue is so good in this movie that I wouldn't even need any kills or moments like that to keep me entertained. And of course the dialogue is boosted by the amazing acting. Everyone plays their roles to perfection, and because of this, Scream has so many likeable and dislikable characters. Each feeling unique in their own way. The cinematography is great and creates a great atmosphere. The party section at the end is the best part of the movie, and contains some of the most iconic moments in the franchise. And then it leads to the twist, which is jaw-dropping.Well, there it is. My attempt at creating an unnecessarily long review on Scream, the best slasher. Could I have done this review and made it only a paragraph long, but I still get the main point across? Yes. Do I make these reviews really long so I can look smarter? Yes. Yes I do.

Cinematic masterpiece,"What is there to say that hasn't been said about Scream. Innovative, scary, funny, clever, smart, etc. Its definitely a movie that's one of a kind and a magic that will never be replicated. Taking all of our beloved slasher cliches and flipping them on their head redefined the horror genre in 1996 and no one saw it coming. Although I desperately was waiting for the films release not too many people were. It arrived that December with very little buzz and only a selection of mixed reviews. Made for $15 million and opening with only a little over $6 million it looked like a flop. But as the weeks went on and word of mouth spread and critics started seeing it. The reviews shot up and so did the box office. Ultimately making over $173 million worldwide. I'm happy to say that I got to experience the phenomenon first hand working at a movie theater. To this day the movie is still fantastic. It's truly a perfect storm from the fluid, accomplished direction from Wes Craven to the brilliant screenplay by My personal idol Kevin Williamson and a perfectly cast of actors giving inspired performances. Neve Campbell was without a doubt one of the strongest scream queens to grace our genre and of course we can't forget the charasmatic Courtney Cox or lovably dopey David Arquette that followed her through the excellent franchise.

Over-hyped but still worth a look,"But once again actors in their mid-to-late twenties are playing teenagers and the effect of the film is totally ruined as they behave and act so unrealistic. While most people may consider this a cool movie just because of the scares and the over-hyped 'irony' there is actually an intelligent plot with a pretty good twist. I notice this more as I am a writer and this is one of my fave horror/thrillers.I advise you not to watch this for the pumped up scares (to a very loud soundtrack) but for how a typical 'who's the killer?' plot line can be a little better than it is believed to be.Some of the characters can be really annoying. In fact the only one that doesn't enrage me is Dewey. His idiotness makes me laugh and diverts my attention from the other characters in the very slow 'character building scenes'.The direction and photography are very bland. Wes Craven did a much better job of a real horror film with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Here it just seems as if he aiming at the teen/popcorn market. You'll notice that, with these kind of movies, most of the characters (not actors) are teenagers and the tone of the film is mostly 'safe'. In the Scream 'sub-genre' there is never any REAL edge.After this movie was made, many, increasing bad, movies that were all exactly the same rolled off a conveyor belt in Hollywood. They were easy moneymakers. Craven knew this beforehand but deep, intelligent movies do not sit well with mass audiences. The blander the style of film is, the more popular it will be with the majority of audiences.The plot in this one redeems these bad qualities.

"Why ""Scream"" Made Me Scream... In Frustration!","Alright folks, gather around, because I'm about to tell you the tragic tale of ""Scream."" You might want to brace yourselves - it's scarier than the movie itself.### Wes Craven: The One-Hit WonderFirst up on the chopping block is Wes Craven. Oh Wes, dear Wes. He gave us ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" which was good - I'll give him that. But that's like saying, ""I baked one good cookie in my life, so now I'm a master chef!"" Everything else from his cinematic kitchen is just reheated leftovers from a horror buffet.### Kevin Williamson: The Pen Behind the PainNext, let's talk about the writer, Kevin Williamson. At least, I think that's his name. I didn't bother to look it up because, quite frankly, he doesn't deserve the Google search. This is the guy who also wrote ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" which should have been called ""I Know You Stole This Plot from 'Prom Night'."" The only thing good about that movie was imagining a spoof called ""I Forget What You Did Last Summer.""### The Movie: A Carbon Copy Catastrophe""Scream"" starts off like a cheap knockoff of ""When a Stranger Calls"" - you know, the kind of knockoff you'd find in a dollar store bargain bin. That movie was fifty times scarier than everything Craven and Williamson have ever done, combined, and then multiplied by ten.### Characters: Who Cares?The characters? Let's just say we have as much reason to care about them as we do for a soggy piece of toast. Rose McGowan is there, looking nice, but that's about it. The real cherry on top of this horror sundae is the killer. Oh boy. They wanted to break the cliché of the indestructible horror villain, but instead, we got Mr. Bean in a Halloween costume. The guy trips over air! Why is he dressed in his spooky getup at the grocery store in broad daylight? Was he hunting for fresh victims in the frozen food aisle?And when the killer's identity is finally revealed, it's like finding out your surprise birthday party is actually a tax audit. No shock, no awe - just pure soap opera nonsense.### Horror or Comedy? Make Up Your Mind!Is ""Scream"" supposed to be a horror or a comedy? It's like trying to be a vegan at a barbecue - it fails at both. Craven and Williamson thought name-dropping classic horror films would make theirs a classic too. All it did was make me want to rewatch ""Halloween"" and mourn the lost time I spent on this drivel.### The Aftermath: An Army of ClonesBut wait, there's more! The worst thing this movie did was inspire a legion of awful imitators. If you see a movie poster with a fresh-faced teen cast posing dramatically like in ""Scream,"" do yourself a favor - run. Not walk, run. Because any movie influenced by ""Scream"" is like a cheap cologne knockoff - it stinks and gives you a headache.### Final Verdict: Anti-Horror""Scream"" is the anti-horror movie. It's everything a horror film shouldn't be: shiny new teen actors, bright lights, a klutzy villain, choppy editing, bland directing, forgettable music, and more horror movie references than a film student's thesis. And the comedy? About as funny as a tax audit.Do yourself a favor - skip this movie. Watch something truly great, like ""Rosemary's Baby."" Now, that's a horror film that won't make you scream... in frustration.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ghostface!,"As someone who grew up watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was way too young, I have a sweet spot in my heart for Wes Craven's work. He always seems to take a slanted view at the horror landscape, creating these works that both fit into the genre while also poking at the genre itself. Scream really personifies this notion as probably the definitive meta-horror for quite some time, creating or at least bringing this new sub-genre of horror to the public consciousness and thus paving the way for the likes of Shawn of the Dead or Cabin in the Woods. Its cliche where its meant to be cliche, cheesy where its meant to be cheesy, pokes fun at the horror genre in a way that manages to feel legitimate and then still manages to pull off a memorable horror icon and a pretty solid ending.On the downside, this thing acts like a time capsule for life in the late 90s. It's a problem whenever you do something referential or meant to act as a commentary on the state of things right then and there. There are parts of it that just do not age exceedingly well and much as I remember the time and the culture of the 90s, it doesn't always translate well to now. That said, still kinda love this movie and think its great, quotable fun and I absolutely loved the brief window in time where everyone was going as Ghostface for Halloween.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Perhaps the finest slasher ever made,"""Scream"" is a genre-defying classic - there's no doubt about it. Director Wes Craven created a slasher that works on multiple, varied levels - part horror/thriller, murder mystery, and black comedy, ""Scream's"" story blends genres in a way that shouldn't work on paper, but works marvelously on film.With a killer opening, pun intended, you know right from jump that ""Scream"" isn't going to go the way you think. Standing tall with star power that includes the likes of Drew Barrymore, ""Scream"" shocks by killing her off within the first ten minutes of the film. In a beautifully intense sequence, Drew is toyed with after receiving a mysterious phone call, psychologically tortured after being forced to watch her boyfriend killed in front of her, and then brutally slayed, with the Ghostface killer going as far as to hang her from a tree and rip her innards out. And I mean, really, with an introduction like that, can you truly guess where ""Scream"" is going to go next? Craven made a masterful decision when he chose to kill off Barrymore in the opening - throwing audiences completely off guard.What could be traditional slasher fare, ""Scream"" does have all the blood and gore you'd expect from this type of film. More than that, though, the film elevates itself through a truly engaging story and actors who take the material seriously. Neve Campbell is the star of the show, portraying a girl who already has some underlying trauma that she is trying to deal with. Her character is multilayered - at times shaky and scared, at times badass and brave, Neve owns her performance, adding a layer of believability and realism that is so often missing from slashers. David Arquette and Courteney Cox also steal the show, both of their conflicting personalities contrasting nicely against each other. And though I don't need to say it, I of course will say that there is not a single weak link amongst the cast - everyone does a phenomenal, and more importantly, memorable job,And memorable is just another word that happens to perfectly describe this movie. From the opening that we have already discussed, to Sidney's first phone call from Ghostface, to the kills throughout the film, to when Ghostface is finally unmasked, ""Scream"" is filled with sequences that you're sure not to forget anytime soon. And whether these sequences are one of horror, comedy, drama, or mystery, each one of them not only work separately but also blend perfectly so as to never compromise the tone of the film.""Scream"" has an undeniable energy to it - with its pitch black comedy, thrilling horror, and tense mystery, ""Scream"" blends genres in a way that hasn't been done before, and has rarely been done as good since. Perhaps the perfect slasher, this film is endlessly rewatchable, and always entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not as Scary as in the first scene,"This is one great movie trilogy.For the longest time i never wanted to watch Scream cause i never liked horror movies, then one night i was thinking, ""what the hell, why not?"" so i put it into my VCR and watched, and when i say the begining of Scream with the girl (ain't gonna tell you who, incase you haven't watched it) was hanging from the tree, I stop the movie.  I though that the move was gonna get a lot more bloody!Well 2 years later, after people talk about all 3 of the Screams, i dicide to watch it, but i started watching it at noon, in the light, not the dark. And I was surprised, it wasn't as bloody as i thought, and before having watched ""Scary Movie"", I knew kinda what was gonna happen!  Well i liked the first Scream, and so i kept the tape playing cause we recored Scream 2 after it.  After i watched both, I really wanted to watch the third, because ""Scream"" is not anything like ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""It"", or ""Needful Things"" whihc had a crazy blood scenes to what i saw.  The Scream movies are like Mysteries, with Swearing, and Blood.  They also have Comedy, special in the third one, which they did i little too much.  But if you are not into Scary movies to much, just like me, and think ""Scream"" is really scary, well you are wrong, go watch it, the first part is really scary but that's really the most blood you will see!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I can blame this movie for many things.,"SCREAM was a slasher flick that is responsible for regenerating the teen slasher category. If it weren't for this film, we would never have seen CHERRY FALLS, FINAL STAB, and many other movies that never should have been brought to the screen. FINAL STAB is one audiences could have lived without seeing. So, looking away from that, what else can I blame SCREAM for? A lot. My reoccuring nightmares maybe!!!! Just kidding. This was a movie that, like so many movies these days, but isn't. The first time I saw it, I was afraid about what would happen next. When the movie ended, I was yelling at myself for being afraid. Because there were no scary moments of this movie. PLOT: masked killer walks around cutting people up, right in places where you would think that someone nearby might hear all of what is going on, but no. That's about all. So, for being no different than any other horror movie made since the 70s, I give this terrible piece of cinematic value 2/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best Horror Movie Ever Made,"This is the greatest horror movie and one of my top 10 movies. Scream came out at a point when all slasher movies were done before, yet it was unique as it parodied all the stupid tropes in those movies. But unlike the movies it copies like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream is actually a good movie. Just the opening of Scream blows me away, too bad the rest of the movie doesn't manage to live up to the perfect first 10 minutes. Everything thing from the killers design to the cliché jokes are incredible. The meta-ness of the film really works in its favour to get a mysterious and sometimes funny movie that is completely unique in it's otherwise boring, repetitive genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A genre-defining classic, 1996's ""Scream"" still holds up even now, 20 years later!  Fiendishly entertaining, often hilarious and genuinely eerie when it needs to be!","It's hard to believe that 1996's ""Scream"", a genre-defining horror and satire, is 20 years old. Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson's masterpiece of self-aware thrills and chills was a landmark upon release, and redefined the world of cinema in a big- bad way inspiring not only its own legacy of three sequels and a recent popular spin-off television series, but also ushering in a new wave of horror films taking influence from its style and tonality as well as re-igniting interest in the genre as a whole after a decidedly dead period in the early 90's.But does the film, an undeniable phenomenon of its decade, still hold up all these years later? The answer is a resounding ""yes""!Following tragic lead Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the film follows a plot involving a psychopathic murderer tormenting a small American town. Seemingly obsessed with horror films, the killer first calls and torments his victims, often referencing popular horror and slasher films, before striking. High School Student Sidney, who is still reeling from her mother's murder one year prior, is having her own personal troubles, which are only made all the worse when it comes to be clear that she is seemingly one of the prime targets of the killer. And so, during a massive high-school party, the stage is set for a bloody, brutal (and hilarious) final battle against the mysterious figures that have been rampaging through town!The real reason the film is such a hit is the expert writing, Craven's direction and the absolute charm of the cast. In particular, I have to give high praise to Williamson's script, which is expertly refined and finds a pitch-perfect balance between self- aware comedy and fiendish horror thrills. The characters in the film have all seen the slasher flicks the killers are trying to emulate, leading to a lot of wonderful moments. Including a laugh- out-loud scene where Sidney explains the common rules of horror film bimbo's doing things like ""running up the stairs"" when they should be running out of the door only to see her ironically forced into the same situation. Or the iconic scene where supporting character Randy (Jamie Kennedy in what is perhaps his most well-known role) literally explains the rules of surviving a horror movie to his drunken party-going classmates while they hoot and holler and intentionally break the rules.Craven's direction perfectly compliments the wonderful screen writing. Craven, an icon who will be sorely missed after his recent unfortunate passing, was an authority in horror three decades in a row, he helped to define the direction the horror genre was heading, between ""Last House on the Left"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and this film. His sense of visual storytelling had a sense of class and his guidance in his cast and crew helped translate Williamson's fantastic writing to the screen almost flawlessly.And then there's the cast. Good lord is this a great assembly of performers. Neve Campbell is endlessly likable and identifiable as out troubled heroin. Supporting roles played by the likes of Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich and Mathew Lillard are all great additions and give great justice to their roles. (Yes, even Kennedy and Lillard- who can be disliked in some circles, are excellent here.) And the film even introduced relative newcomers Courtney Cox and David Arquette to a wider audience with their scene-stealing roles as reporter Gale Weathers and Deputy Dewey Riley. Wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL cast!Heck, even the sort-of pink-elephant element of the film being ""so 90's"" (one of the reasons why some younger people I know are hesitant to give it a shot) lends to its charm, because it's such a refreshing time-capsule of nostalgia. This is one of those films where, despite the carnage, it'll give audiences who were alive in that decade a fuzzy sense of years-long-past. And it gives the film a further layer for re-watching and re-visiting, especially when analyzing and comparing it to other horror films over the years.It's without doubt a classic. Nearly without flaw. Still relevant to this day thanks to its wonderful observations on genre. And still fiendishly haunting and uproariously hilarious.""Scream"" is easily a 10 out of 10. And still very much well-worth watching for not only fans of horror, but fans of film as a whole.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""What's your favorite scary movie?"" - Certainly not this one!","The cult ""Halloween"" from 1978 started the avalanche of slasher films, which ruled the horror genre during the eighties, but in the nineties, the genre died out. And then Wes Craven made ""Scream"" in 1996, whose popularity spawned several sequels and brought slasher movies back to life. ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and many others soon followed.""Scream"", like many before it, deals with the mass killing of teenagers, and it does it in an interesting way, but without particular tension and in a somewhat humorous atmosphere. As it contains a large number of witty remarks, a mountain of clichés and references to the cult slashers of the previous decade, I found it difficult to see it as a horror film, but experienced it more as an homage and parody of slasher classics.""No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface, I wanna be in the sequel!""The main assets of this film are the opening and closing scenes and the female part of the cast, but not in the acting sense. Everything in between tries to be both horror and comedy at the same time and fails on both fronts. It is neither scary nor suspenseful enough for horror (except for the opening scene with Drew Barrymore), because its atmosphere is more like a ""Scary Movie"" (which, by the way, was its original title) than a slasher, nor funny enough for a good comedy/parody. With due (dis)respect to its cult status and influence on the genre, it left such a tepid and forgettable impression on me that I only realized towards the end that I had already seen it, probably somewhere around the time it came out. I recognized only the end, because it is the only part of the film impressive enough (insanely silly) to remain in my faint memory even after twenty-five years.It will remain a mystery to me how and why this made two hundred million dollars at the box office and what the hell happened to the man who made ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". I watched it last night with a twelve-year-old kid, who couldn't fall asleep until four in the morning afterwards, while I barely managed to stay awake until the end of the movie. However, if the target group of ""Scream"" are pre-pubescent children who have never seen a horror film before, then it might be good and me not competent to judge...5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A near perfect return to the Slasher genre!,"It's has been a while since I have watched this movie in it's entirety, I have a falling asleep problem okay, but it is a damn near perfect horror movie. I am fairly certain that I did go to see this movie in the theaters with my friends when it came out and I am so glad I did. I would have never thought back then how significant this film was and would be on the horror genre moving forward.With Scream Wes Craven breathes new life into the stagnant SLASHER subgenre and captured lightning in a bottle for the second time with Ghostface much like he did with everyone's favorite Springwood Slasher Freddy Krueger!Scream is loaded with many quotable lines, great kills, superior gore, and plenty of twist and turns to keep you guessing who is behind the killing. Well, at least on a first viewing. There is also plenty of Easter Eggs sprinkled throughout the film that even after almost 30 years, I am still finding new things.The bottom line is Scream, at least for me is highly nostalgic. It is a time capsule of simpler times and also the genesis of changing times with the early versions of the internet and cellular phones, it was truly a great time to be alive.

"""If this were a scary movie I'd be the prime suspect.""","In the later stages of Scream Neve Campbell lambastes the heroines of horror movies, claiming it's always ""some big-breasted girl who can't act."" Well, Drew Barrymore might fill part of that quota, but she certainly can't be accused of not acting in the best twelve minutes of the whole trilogy. This is Scream as it should be: self-referential in its dialogue, yet genuinely scary too. This ""lone girl in the house"" trick is pulled off twice, and works both times, though thereafter the film degenerates into self-satisfied smugdom of the highest order.There's perhaps a little more bad natured humour than might at first be evident, too. I remember laughing with friends at the humble reference Barrymore makes to Craven's back catalogue, when talking about Nightmare on Elm Street being scary. ""Well,"" she replies, ""the first one was, but the rest sucked."" However, closer inspection shows that Craven had little input with many of the sequels - he wrote and executive produced the third, but had no involvement with any of the others. What would seem to the majority of the viewing audience to be a modest slice of self-mockery is actually a bitter filmmaker venting his spleen.But the major praise heaped upon Scream is that it's what film students call ""recursive"". It's a horror movie about horror movies. It acknowledges that some horror movies aren't real, so therefore maybe it could be, blah de blah... Of course, all this could be quite fun were the point not made with sledgehammer subtlety. How many times does the word ""movie"" occur in this mov- film, anyway? Every two seconds someone's asking someone else who would play him or her in a movie, or claiming ""this isn't a movie"" only to be met with ""Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie, it's all one great big movie."" Errrrr... is it a movie?From the second half, beginning with the irritating video store scene, things start to get awry. No longer is the film scary, just roaming around it's own backside. For the last hour the film serves not to scare with occasional reference, but to show us all how ""clever"" and ""ironic"" it is - or thinks it is. The whole idea of satirical endeavours is that they're finely tuned and discrete, Mr.Williamson. Carving a script that goes ""ha ha ha we're in a movie, it's just a movie, it's like an old horror movie don't you know ha ha ha is this a movie I think it's a movie it's like a movie"" does not make you a candidate for Jonathan Swift's line of ascendants.I probably enjoyed this more when I saw it on release. At the time Scream was probably one of the few horror films I'd ever seen, and so 90% of the references were lost on me. But now I've learnt a little more their gratuitous crow-barring into the dialogue really grates. You can almost imagine film nerds sitting there with a mental checklist, ticking them off one by one million. Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Oh, my sides! His surname is the same as the Doctor's in Halloween, and Halloween features in the film, too! And it's also the name of a character in Psycho, and we reference that too! And he looks a lot like Johnny Depp, who was in Nightmare on Elm Street; Wes Craven's other horror-revitalising movie. What a rib-tickler!!) enters, to be slated by another character ""what's leatherface doing here?"" Wait a minute - tee-hee-hee, snigger, chuckle! - wasn't Leatherface a character in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Well, I say! That really is superb!! What devastating wit! Ha ha ha! Oh, let's cap it all off by tossing in a reference to Carrie, and maybe you could talk about Jamie Lee Curtis being a scream queen. Oh, this is marvellous stuff!Next, we get the much-touted ""rules of horror films"" sequence. If you have sex you die, if you drink you die... etc., etc., etc. The lovely Courteney Cox is watching all this backslapping goo on a hidden camera and concludes with ""Uh... boring!"" I quite agree Courteney. The problem with this ""rules"" scene is that the ""rules"" it exposes are nowhere near as clever or as revolutionary as they would like to assume they are, merely blatantly obvious. Only a pea-brained idiot would comfortably sit there going ""Oh, how clever! I never realised that before!"" Craven, who holds a Master's Degree in Philosophy, justifies the whole genre towards the end with: ""movies don't create psychos. Movies make psychos more inventive."" Is that the best you can do? Don't get me wrong, the genre has been unfairly derided, particularly in England, and Wes is a good spokesman for its plusses. But is that really all he could think of to say? Perhaps he was too busy, and hey, lest we forget, he didn't write the script, but this rollercoaster of smug inanity trundles on with a ""can you guess how this movie is going to end?"" bore-a-thon. Wes did try his hand at writing similar stuff two years prior, with New Nightmare. While this seems to be destined to be regarded as a ""proto-Scream"", it's actually the better film, and showed that Wes didn't need Kevin Williamson half as much as Williamson needed him.Linda Blair does a cameo; a character peers into a mirror while saying, ""after you branded him the Candyman?"" It really does get very, very tiresome. As a historical document, this film will never lose its validity. It opened up a whole new subgenre within the field, albeit a short-lived one that has already passed. It is also made horror popular again, almost single-handedly upturning the fortunes of many genre directors. But as - I'll say it - a movie, it has sorely dated in under five years. Where it was once fresh and sparky, now it's glib and passé.Inevitable sequels followed, the second being arguably better. The third, written by Ehren Kruger after Williamson had moved on, was fine, but lacked impact. Maybe it was the familiarity of the characters, particularly the constipated expression of David Arquette (Who it's now impossible to take seriously after seeing his character reborn as ""Doufus"" in Scary Movie) and the hard-as-nails attitude of Cox. Moreover, it was a film whose time had now passed, and, the biggest irony of all, it failed to last as long as the movies it lampoons and unwittingly resurrected.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

We all go a little mad sometimes,"***SPOILERS*** Director Wes Cravens, who plays Fred the janitor at Woodsboro High School, craven attempt to make the ultimate teenage slasher film hits the bullseye with his 1996 smash hit ""Scream"" that has all the elements of every slasher movie known to man, or the movie audience, in it.Played along the lines of the 1978 horror thriller ""Halloween"" which is seen on TV all throughout the movie ""Scream"" has this masked psycho tearing up all of Woodsboro in pursuit of Sidney Prescott who for some reason he has it in for. The cues to the psychos maniacal hatred towards Sidney are many with the most obvious being that her deceased mom was up to something no good when she was brutally murdered a year ago. But as the movie goes on it becomes evident that all the movie, and Wes Craven, is trying to do is out do every teenage slasher film that proceeded it and does an excellent, and gory, job in doing it.We have such a diverse cast from a wild eyed Linda Blair paying an obnoxious and shrieking reporter as well as Henry ' The Fonz"" Winkler as the strict disciplinarian principle Arthur Himbry, of Woodsboro High. It's in fact principle Himbry, together with about two dozen other Woodboro residents, who ends up being one of the Psycho's many victims in the movie. Himbry is attacked murdered as well as, thank God off screen, gutted and hung from the high school's football goalpost for sticking his nose where it shouldn't belong! The psycho killers business! The killing goes on at such a fast pace that you eventually don't seem to care anymore for those who get offed by the masked psycho in that they, like in almost every other teenage slasher films, are made to look, by their wild sex and drug parties, like they more then deserve what's coming to them.The ending sequence that takes some 15 minutes is so off the wall and ridicules that by then you get the feeling that you've been had by Director Wes Craven's attempt to out do the teenage slasher genre to the point where the film, despite the massive blood letting in it, is more of a comedy then a horror movie. All you have to really do in finding out who's to be killed or not to be killed in the film is to see who's either naughty, besides the psycho killer, or nice in it.

Don't answer the phone. Don't open the door. Don't try to escape.,"What can I say about Scream (1996) that everyone has not said already, but it is by Wes Craven who directed A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Both movies are good with one being more self-aware about what happens in horror movies or slasher movies in general.Ghostface is one of those killers who is not supernatural like Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, he is just a regular person killing people in normal ways. But because of that it can be funny when he is stumbling or can get knocked over easily for the victim to get away.Neve Campbell as Sidney is a memorable main character in the Scream franchise, along with Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers and David Arquette as Dewey. There are characters in the movie you are not supposed to like and there is a backstory on what happened to Sidney's mother that gave more to the character of Sidney.There are references to other horror movies, they talk about certain rules on how to survive a horror movie, and they watch classic horror movies like Halloween (1978). It does not get annoying because they do it subtly in their conversations.Scream (1996) is a classic horror movie that people still watch along with the other sequels following it. I would recommend this if you like Wes Craven Horror movies and the self-awareness, then you might like this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wes Craven's best work.,"Pure brilliance! That's what this movie is. Not only it's a modern day classic, it's almost a perfect film. It serves as a slasher flick, a perfect blend of slasher and whodunit, an excellent thriller and an extremely exciting rollercoaster ride. In my opinion, Scream and Scream 2 are better than his most popular movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street. No, I don't hate original Freddy movie, I consider it to be one of the bests of the genre but that doesn't change the fact that I find Scream to be Wes Craven's greatest work.There are a lot of goods I have say about this movie, and I won't be spoiling anything. All these stuffs aren't probably things that have not been already said prior to my review. But these are the reasons why I love it so much. First, it's extremely well-paced. It has a definitive tone it goes for, any doesn't miss a bit at all. It is almost two hours long, it begins to end at around 1:30:00 mark. The last 30 minutes doesn't even feel like 30 minutes. It's almost like 5 or 6 minutes, and I am not even exaggerating. There's not a single moment in the movie which doesn't give an uneasy feeling. That uneasy feeling lasts throughout the movie, until things start getting revealed. And after that, what follows is an intense, action packed finale that the movie absolutely deserves. And I almost forgot. The opening of this movie is perhaps the best opening of all the slasher films since the late 70s.Even if it wasn't a meta film, except for a few interesting pop culture references, it would've worked equally well. That's because it has a story of it's own. You are constantly gripped by the whodunit aspect of the movie. It completely understands that it's actually the intensity, the tension and the characterizations you give in the film that makes it work, not some pointless gory scenes. The gore and kills are mere aftermath and payoff of what we had just witnessed in the story. Gore doesn't equal a great horror, and in particular, a great slasher. Seems like this film understood it really well. And there's something that this movie does, which none of the slashers before it and (except for a little extent in Scream 2) none of its sequels do. That is getting the uncertainty factor absolutely right. Definitely, I would say none of the endings of the Scream movies (1 to 4, at the time of this review) were quite predictable to me. But, even in the beloved classics, except for a possible few dodges, we get to know who the main lead is and who's going to be the victim. It's not that with Scream. At many moments, even though we recognize the main lead (who's awesome, btw) we feel like she might not make it. And, definitely a lot of people are sliced. But, we do not, or should I say, cannot expect a character to die or not to die because it plays the trope of ""everyone is a suspect"" extremely well.This movie has the best batch of characters in any slasher movie. All the characters are so memorable and the characterizations are brilliant. You cannot exchange one character with the other. There are no stock characters for extra kills or something like that. Every kill happens for a purpose, may it have a motive or may it be an act of a pure psychopath. And in that line, I would also like to mention that Neve Campbell is my most favorite actress (and Sidney Prescott is my favorite slasher lead character) when it comes to the ones who've been the lead of a slasher movie. Unlike a lot of such leads, she doesn't feel like a ""typically written to survive"" lead. She has more depth to her character than many of the leads from many different franchises combined! She does a lot of stuff that kinda reminds me of John McClane. She definitely does whole lot less of over the top things that McClane does, but she does have some great one liners, fantastic fight/action scenes and the vulnerability that makes us feel that she's one of us, and not a movie character. That being said, the performances are extremely great. Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Dewey, Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) as Stu, and Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis and all the others have given a fantastic performance.It's a movie which doesn't use its meta nature as an excuse for being lame, in fact, it's everything but lame. Being a meta movie, it serves as a celebration of almost two decades of slasher films by taking jabs on cliches while using that cliche in a much more grounded way. It gives a well written story and a whole bunch of well written characters and an intensely exciting storytelling. That's what makes it so great. If you haven't checked it out, don't waste any time. Please, see this movie. It's a highly underappreciated (though insanely popular) and a criminally underrated gem of a movie. .

And his name is Ghostface. That's right, this movie influencing horror to a whole new level with many fans considered it to be very unique featuring characters aware of real-world horror films who openly discussed the clichés that the film attempted to subvert. In the opening Drew Barrymore gets a phone call from an unknown person asking her that she's alone and she watches horror movies and he kills her boyfriend and then kills her. That unknown person turns out to be someone wearing a costume of the mask called Ghostface. The news reported that Casey and Steve got murdered and the police investigation begins now. Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell, is struggling with the death of her mother in the year anniversary. While news is still spreading, news reporter, Gale Weathers played by Courteney Cox, arrives to school among the media. Sidney goes to school with her mates, Stu, Tatum, Randy and her boyfriend, Billy played by Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich and Jamie Kennedy. While Sidney's waiting for Tatum to arrive, she gets an mysterious phone call and is attacked by Ghostface. Billy arrives and she suspects that he called her. He gets arrested and at Tatum's house she gets another ominous call. While at school, Billy is released and the school is suspended due to Ghostface killed the principal and while school is out, Sidney and her friends throwing a party to celebrate the school's closure. You know what really peaked my interest about this movie is that this is deep down to be a comedic slasher horror movie in that the way Wes Craven making it out where teenagers watching horror movies and talk about the killers of what their motivations are. And also I found out that Courteney Cox is in it. Her character is responsible for spreading rumors and conspiracy theories about Maureen's death. For those of you who knew she is known for Friends. Considering the fact that I haven't seen any of the sequels before hand much like Halloween, Friday the 13th and The Nightmare of Elm Street which is also directed by Wes Craven himself have a bunch of sequels and remakes or reboots, Scream is the prime example that will be having many sequels along with Saw and this movie is fantastic in it's own right that proves to be one of the best horror films out there. If you're a horror fan or a movie fan who is curious, I'd say this is one of those movies that you cannot go wrong. There are plenty of horror films that I have not seen but the ones I have seen are considerably memorable even the ones that really fit in the category and even when I give them a seal of approval. I'm not gonna lie, this is by far my favourite movie of all time and my favourite horror movie in general and every time I think about it, I just can't get it out of my head. So it might be surprising that if I find it anywhere, I will always watch it. I've already seen this film multiple times and I can't wait to watch it again. This movie is awesome and it's a lot of fun. Scream is the one that will be in every horror fan and movie buffs minds out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic Slasher,"Scream is the kind of movie that plays with its own identity and the genre it represents, delivering a fun and authentic experience. It leans heavily on classic slasher clichés, but instead of falling into tired tropes, it stands out by subverting expectations, using dark comedy as a key element in its narrative.Right from the beginning, the exaggerated atmosphere, near-caricature dialogues, and predictable situations make it clear the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Everything feels intentionally over-the-top - from the masked killer to characters fitting classic archetypes: the damsel in distress, the comic relief, the suspicious boyfriend, and the always-clueless cop.Despite its straightforward and simple plot, the film doesn't disappoint. Each character adds to the chaotic and unpredictable vibe, keeping the audience engaged. The script cleverly builds on satire and self-awareness, especially when characters discuss the ""rules"" for surviving a horror movie - only to break every single one shortly after.The ending delivers a satisfying twist that, while not groundbreaking, ties everything together nicely. It's precisely this blend of homage and critique that makes Scream memorable. It respects the essential elements of the slasher genre while offering something with its own unique identity, keeping viewers entertained without overreaching.In the end, Scream is simple, light, and fully aware of what it's doing. If you're looking for a traditional horror movie with a touch of sharp humor and engaging characters, this is a solid choice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Yeehaw!,"When I saw 'Scream', I was expecting a real horror movie.  After all, I had heard that this was a very scary movie from people who had seen it before me.  But, I wasn't hardly scared at all.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's because after living with my parents for the last 15 years, everything else seems a lot tamer.  But like I said with 'Halloween', just because it wasn't scary doesn't mean I didn't like it.  The movie made me laugh more than it made me scream.  It's hilarious but not because it's lame.  It's not lame at all!  It's funny because the movie makes fun out of other slasher films. Even in the middle of the climax, I was laughing my ass off because Stu had started crying about how his parents were gonna kill him.  This movie is awesome.  It's just as entertaining as 'Halloween'. See it if you haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Drop Dead Gorgeous,"With a new ""Scream"" film on the near horizon, it seems like an ideal time to go back and reappraise the previous ones in the series. There is nowhere else to start other than with the original, a film that's unbelievably now 25 years old.The town of Woodsboro is rocked by the brutal slaying of Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) and her boyfriend Steve (Kevin Patrick Walls). Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) whose mother was murdered a year previously, is the next teen targeted but manages to escape the initial attempt on her life. The case brings the media circus to town, principle amongst them Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) whose coverage of the Prescott case has made her a celebrity.It's hard now, in the meta world we live in, to explain how revolutionary ""Scream"" felt at it's release. Parody films had, of course, been made before - but that's not what ""Scream"" is. It's a knowing horror movie, where victims and killers have seen the classics of the genre and know what they theoretically should, and shouldn't do, to survive the situation. (Wes Craven's ""New Nightmare"" had been produced a couple of years earlier, which was also a meta-reboot but didn't get the kind of traction that ""Scream"" did). Indeed, ""Scream"" would kick start a major revival in horror after years of schlock and sequels with diminishing returns.In some ways, the film is starting to show its age now. The world without a proliferation of cell phones must seem alien to anyone seeing it for the first time, who is even a little bit younger than me. It's actually reasonably tame, in terms of violence to other horror contemporaries and in terms of emotional honest, the reaction of the town to the murders doesn't ring true.But it's still a great film, one of the 90's true classics. It's genuinely funny and clever and some of its scenes are amongst the most Iconic in cinema history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The ultimate tribute to Horror genre,"Way before its release, Scream was going to be titled ""Scary Movie"" as it's an homage to horror movies and cinema, a lot of references, funny, solid and clever script, believable characters and motivations, lot of coherent twists, perfectly paced and very well acted from the whole cast.

"Witty, unique, hip, Craven's ""Scream"" is loud","*** out of (****)Oh ""Scream"". What's there more to say? This was the granddaddy slasher of the 90's, and reasonably so. With witty dialogue, a slick atmosphere, and a nice line drawn between horror and self-parody, ""Scream"" resonates.The kills? This is the goriest of the trilogy. We get dismemberment, disembowelment, and tons of red fluids. Don't be fooled though. This film isn't competing for the most blood used in a film. Craven builds up suspense pretty nicely with a dark, sinister tone, unnerving music, and a few glimpses of the killer himself here and there. Strip away the profanity and gore, and ""Scream"" would still be a strong production.Not to mention the script is where it's at. The dialogue is cutting edge material, sprinkling in some welcome humor and sharp one liners. The performances are solid. Nobody here is trying to win the Academy Awards, yet everyone here is doing their job. And for once we don't have ""Friday the 13th part 38"". This is a unique film that stands on its own two feet. What I thought was pretty neat was how it references slashers that came out nearly a decade before. That's just an added bonus for horror fans.All in all, ""Scream"" isn't a film that I loved, but it resonates with me, and I found myself to still enjoy it. The dialogue, the characters, the story. It's all there. Witty, unique, hip, Craven's ""Scream"" is loud.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Of its time.,"I'm not really able to appreciate what this was for people. After we had all the, I guess you'd call them ""slasher classics"" but before we had ""Scary Movie 1"" this movie was there to give a little perspective at a certain point in the development of a genre.Ruminating a little bit not only on the slasher genre but on the presence of violence in the media, I'm not saying there isn't something there, but you really have to consider this movie in the very specific historical context in which it was made.For me this is really just another slasher. I don't really see how it deconstructs anything or satirizes anything. It just goes through the motions, ticks off a checklist of tropes and has some commentary (strictly through dialogue and self-conscious discussions) about its chosen themes.I'd hardly call it a comedy; it just has funny people in it.I suppose a horror movie on the nature of the horror genre itself needs to exist eventually but I'm not really a fan of the slasher genre unless they're retro over-the-top gorefests and not a sincere stab (no pun intended) at being scary.It is a cardinal sin (in my opinion) that a horror movie should mention the existence of other horror movies or even use the word ""scary"" or any conceivable synonym. I guess this one gets a free pass but ultimately, I cannot see anything in this movie except just another generic teen scream with a coat of satirical paint slathered onto it.Shout out to Courtney Cox diversifying, I cannot stand Monica sometimes.

Legacy of Scream,"It's amazing what time can do to a movie, by ""time"" I don't mean tHiS mOvIe HaSnT aGeD wElL, that some m*rons, pardon, I mean ""film critics"" use to describe a movie they dislike, saying that a movie has ""aged poorly"" is not an argument, all movies are products of their time, by ""time"" I mean SCREAM's legacy and influence it had on other movies in the genre over the years, and that influence was for the worse.Wes Craven was a wildly inconsistent director, for every NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET you got a VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN. In 1996, SCREAM came out, a self-aware teen slasher, and it was hailed as the savior of horror, in retrospect, the ""we're poking fun at the horror clichés but also playing them straight, aren't we clever? (winks at the audience)"" meta humor did more harm than good to the genre, because afterwards nearly every horror movie tried to imitate it. Meta commentary was done better by Wes Craven himself in NEW NIGHTMARE, not to mention THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD did the whole meta thing 11 years earlier, and also did it better,SCREAM is nowhere near as great or creative as the fans think it is, Film Twitter and L****boxd crowd have turned SCREAM, a decent slasher, into a ""classic"", a ""masterpiece"" and ""one of the best horror movies ever made"". Movies can't be straightforward and considered good anymore, oh no, you have to add self-awareness and irony, then ""horror fans"" can feel that the genre is validated, that they are watching ""thinking man's"" movies.

"Scrap, more like it.","I landed on this little piece of obliviousness on a lazy summer night several years ago while I was flipping by the usual crap-show TV networks dump on us on an daily basis. I'm a very restless kind of guy by nature and virtue of my sign (not that I believe in astrology, but Sagittariuses never believe it) and couldn't go through the whole movie uninterrupted by a snack, a beer and an occasional pee. So I decided to watch it thoroughly not long ago and make up my mind what all the hype was about. I got seriously disappointed. Having enjoyed some of Wes Craven's works, including the original Nightmare on Elm Street(and the only one of the sequels worth watching twice), I expected the 'this movie resuscitated the dying horror genre' marketing strategy to live up to the hype. But to no avail. First off, let me get this straight: the 'horror genre' never died or has been sent to the ICU. Not since Halloween and Alien gave it a definitive boost, drove a spike into the heart of the 'B Movie' stigma and catapulted sci-fi and horror to their rightful heights. So I never bought the flat out lie that sells this mediocre movie and franchise as 'new flesh in the dark heart of cinema'. There's nothing new, nothing original, nothing worth wasting 1 hour and a half and the only heritage this movie may have spawned was a hundred miles of expensive film rolls in the form of 'I know what you did last summer' and a dumbing down of horror movie standards proudly carried over by the cult followers of bad taste.2/10 for the effort.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

There are bits that it borrowed from elsewhere that everyone else forgot about, so SCREAM gets all the credit in most folks' minds.

A New Breed of Horror Films,"Scream (1996, Dir. Wes Craven)One year after the death of Sidney Prescott's mother, two students turn up gutted. When a serial killer appears, Sidney begins to suspect whether her mother's death and the two new deaths are related. No one is safe, as the killer begins to pick everyone off one by one. Everyone's a suspect in this case.In the mid-90's 'Scream' was released, and after disappointing horror flicks, was able to produces a new type of horror movie. A type which hadn't been seen for a long time. The great thing about 'Scream' is the concept of it. It's not just a horror film, but also a spoof of previous horror movies. Countless references to the behaviour of characters in previous horror movies add to the enjoyment of this movie. Everything you would think of when watching a horror film (and still do now) was addressed, such as what type of character died. Wes Craven changed these and created a film with characters who could actually be unpredictable. Another great thing about this film, is the fun behind figuring out who the killer. Most horror films have some indication of who the killer, but in 'Scream', everyone is a suspect. If you haven't seen 'Scream' yet, where have you been?""Damn little $hits."" - Principal Himbry (Henry Winkler)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Let's have a joke on horror's behalf.,"Sidney Prescott is a high school girl still coming to terms of her mother's murder over a year ago. But things get worst in Woodsboro when a couple of high school students are knocked off and even more so for Sid when a masked killer who loves their scary movies sets their sights on her with some threatening phone calls. Sidney survives the first attempt at her life with the police deciding to keep an eye on her and looking at the many possible suspects. Which range from her out-of-town father to her sex depraved boyfriend. Also the media circus has arrived, led Gail Weathers, which she and Sid don't have too much of a good relationship.The horror boom of the mid 90s is thanks largely to Craven's memorably, refreshing, but post-modern slasher flick ""Scream"". I notice this film really divides the horror fans. People either loathe it or like it, well I fit in the latter half. I'm a fan of the flick since it added something new to the dying sub-genre. Although, most of it imitators were painful, but ""Scream"" is miles ahead of those inferior rehashes. What sets it out from most of the artificial slashers is that it's exciting and it has brains. Kevin Williamson's cerebral script parodies the whole slasher set-up remarkably well in a self-aware attitude by exploring the rules that flood these type of films. The way he works in the inventive twists around the usual horror devices only enhances the film's originality and engrossing interplay. While, the gallant script might be cluttered with plenty of in-jokes and horror references. The character's also come to the party with rich details and strong persona's that seem real, which makes you really wanna see them get through. Humour wise it hits it off, but that's not discarding the highly suspenseful thrills. Like that of the well-staged opening that actually frightens and horrifies. Craven not only delivers some hacked up teens, but just like in he did in his ""New Nightmare (1994)"" film he plays around with plenty of horror techniques and themes in such a convincing fashion that it's unpredictably intense. Clues and hints are displayed with flair and the alarming amount of red herrings make the mystery even more enjoyable. The characters just seem more rational in their actions since they themselves know the vital rules of slasher flicks, which gives the film more of an urgency and this makes it harder to figure just who'll get out and who will not.The actors on board all put in solid performances with some being more exceptional than others, but at least there was a dynamic chemistry between them all. Neve Campbell nails down her role as the emotional wreak Sidney Prescott. Courtney Cox goes against the grain as the venomous TV reporter Gail Weathers. David Arquette manages to raise some chuckles as the dopey Deputy Dewey. But more so the buoyant Jamie Kennedy gets the laughs with the most interesting character - the horror movie geek Randy Meeks. Mathew Lillard generates a lot fun, Skeet Ulrich is perfect as the shady boyfriend and Rose McGowan gives the film the bite with her cunning remarks. There's also some small amusing roles from Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler. If you looking for some blood you shouldn't be disappointed as there's a fine build up and a good quota of it. Working with that element is the fitting sound effects which are crisply effective, like that of the knife swishing through the air. An atmospherically, suspenseful score by Marco Beltrami pierces the flick and the mellow soundtrack is rather well assembled in depicting the mood. Especially that of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' haunting tune ""Red Right Hand"". Another factor to set itself out was that of Mark Irwin's well displayed camera-work that lifted off the screen with many prominent shots. Craven keeps it fast moving and Williamson's script makes sure that it delivers a successful outing that works to it's strengths with flying colours.""Scream"" is a nice gruesome mix of irony and violence that started up the craze for mainstream horror again and turned horror conventions upside down.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Destined To Become A Genre Classic.,"""Scream"" is an above-average slasher film from Wes Craven, who some consider ""the modern master of horror"", and deservedly so - he's accomplished quite a bit. The film centers around Sidney Prescott, a teenage girl who is trying to survive high-school, while balancing all of her problems, including her boyfriend and the memories of the savage murder of her mother a year earlier. After a student and her boyfriend are found brutally stabbed to death late one night, the entire town goes into a frenzy, with zany news reporters questioning everybody, and a frantic police department trying to solve the murders. Sidney seems to be all caught up in the middle of it, and as people begin to die all around her, her boyfriend (among others) becomes a suspect.Probably the best slasher film of the '90s, ""Scream"" is nothing short of a horror classic. I've always liked Wes Craven's work (particularly his earlier stuff), and while this film is much more light-hearted (for lack of a better term) than ""Last House On The Left"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes"", it's very stylish and thrilling. The engaging storyline never lets up and keeps the viewer's attention the whole way through. Dashed with lots of dark humor and countless references to other horror classics (even some references to Craven's films himself), this makes for some fun for seasoned fans of the genre. At times the film almost seems as if it's poking fun at some common elements in the genre, but manages to be taken seriously at the same time. Suspense is pushed quite a bit, and there are some spectacularly scary scenes. The opening scene will more than likely go down as one of the most memorable openings in horror history - very well acted by Drew Barrymore (surprising to see her in this film), and just plain scary to boot. Watch the film and you'll understand what I'm talking about.Our cast is led by the wonderful Neve Campbell, the innocent protagonist who is caught up in the middle of a town in hysteria. David Arquette plays a quirky police deputy, and Rose McGowan as his popular sister. And Courtney Cox plays a nosy reporter who will do anything to get a good story. I liked the fact that this film really focused on the actual community and it's reaction to the murders, and how the town became a hysteric mess over what was happening. I also liked the fact that the killer wasn't superhuman - those who find themselves in the track of the killer fight back and give the villain quite a beating, and the villain actually runs (the alternative being taking a slowly-paced stroll while trying to pursue a victim, something that has always kind of bothered me about many slasher films).There's plenty of gore, mostly brutal stabbings and such, so all those gore hounds will be pleased. But besides that, this film has a good story going for it led by a very good cast. The ending was a shocker, and was half of what I was expecting, so I was pleasantly surprised.Bottom line is, ""Scream"" is one of the superior modern slashers of the 1990s, and can't be missed by horror fans. While the two sequels that it spawned were good, they were nothing like the original, as in most cases.

Still a fantastic film,"Most of the clever meta commentary aged badly (and was better done by Craven in New Nightmare anyway), but this film off the charts misanthropy remains very effective (seriously, save from how careful Rose McGowan's character is about Sydney, the only act of kindness in this whole movie is slice-throated cameraman pointing out to Sydney she could lock the van's door). Craven's set pieces remain very effective, but what is most impressive is how he moves slasher from the giallo inspired money shot kill towards a much more pervasiveness sense of violent doom. Most of reviews of the time were pretty obsessed about how gory this is, but compared with a run of the mill early 80s like The Prowler (with its Tom Savini assisted murders) it actually relative tame, only the violent scenes don't feel divorced from everything else but rather rooted in its character's high school existence. Also, Scream is so rooted in mid 90s it can't stop feel very dated, but by now that is very much part of its charm and much like Verhoeven's Starship Troopers the very 90s young cast actually adds to the wasteful feel that pervades the whole movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Still scares the sh*t out of me!,"I just watched Scream for maybe the 4th or 5th time, and i still got the chills while watching it. The way it's directed makes you jump all the time when people pop out of nowhere and attack. The suspense and lack of murders in the beginning is great, because it's not simply about blood and gore, it's about keeping the audience on the edge and making shivers go down their spine.I had to watch porno and comedy shows after watching this...that is always a great sign in a horror movie. The fact that i had to watch non-scary shows in order to flush out the frights from Scream shows how effective it really is.Even so, i still had to jog up the basement stairs when i turned off all the lights. And i know it will stay with me when i go to bed in about ten minutes(yes, i am still trying to avoid chills by delaying being alone in the dark)Also, as far as acting goes, there was some good acting in there. Jamie Kennedy was good(well, actually i liked his intelligent, paranoid character, but he played him, so i guess he gets credit for it). Matthew Lillard does a good show taking attention from himself and making it seem like he's not a killer whatsoever. Rose McGowan = Greatest Tits in the world.(Barrymore is good too) And lastly, Skeet Ulrich portrays the psychopathic killer tremendously, even if he couldn't fool me(until he got stabbed).All in all, an awesome movie that delivers exactly what it promises...Wes Craven's Finest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent Witty Horror Movie,A classic which satirizes the classics. A movie in a movie and the meta aspect is amazing. Hated all the sequels but this one fires on all points. All of the actors are great as well.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Good Horror Film,"There is a new Scream film out, but I haven't had the chance to see it yet, so I decided to watch the previous films in the franchise and here is my review for the original film. The premise of the film sees a slew of killings inspired by horror movies that aims at mostly young girls.Main Character
Neve Campbell plays Sidney and she is good in the film. She plays the damsel in distress pretty well but there is also some toughness to her that made her more interesting. She isn't amazing but I think she deserves a lot of credit for a good performance as a female lead character in a horror film can be a difficult role to play.Supporting Characters
Courteney Cox plays Gale, a news reporter who is trying to get a scoop on the murder investigation. She is good in the role and it is nice to see her play a different role as this would have been amongst the friends pomp. David Arquette plays Dooey and he is fun but doesn't really stand out, he is a young but lets face it pretty inept police officer. There is enough charm there though that manages to make him a good enough character. But the rest of the cast are just a bit too over the top, it comes across as a bit cringey and I am sure that is due to the age of the film but it is something that I noticed.Story
The story is interesting, it spoofs other horror films and basically deconstructs them which I really enjoyed. The focus on ghostface's killings is well handled and I liked seeing the variation and suspense that was given in each one. However, I thought a few elements were a bit rushed and underdeveloped, alongside a really rushed and uninformative ending holds it back a little bit.Script
The script is a bit like the characters, it does a decent enough job but hasn't exactly aged too well. It deals with the horror really well and the drama. At times the humour raises a wild chuckle but the film clearly thinks it is funnier then it actually is and it does suffer with this. But there is no doubt that there is some clever writing here.Style
The film is filmed really well, the horror scenes are great. They keep you on the edge of your seat throughout and when they do take place they are energetic and frenetic which really helps make this horror film stand out. The film is paced really well with plenty of death and scares, the first 10 mins alone is some of the best you will see in any horror film and makes you want to keep watching.Overall
Overall, Scream is a good film. I am not a huge horror fan but this is one of the better ones and if you like horror I can see this being right up your street.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A Horror film, but not only!","It is, I guess, the best horror film in the nineties, not only for his capacity to put into discussion the basics of horror, but also for his attempt to go deeper into the reasons of some  social problems, such as the education of the young generation, without falling into a retorical speech. At times it seems to be even too severe for the young generations, but, as it must be, it never gives advises of possible changes. It is a wonderful portrait of society, perhaps not only the American one, made with the irony that only a great director (thanks of course to Kevin Williamson) can show. A horror film, but not only!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the better slashers,"I'm not the kind of person who watches horror, much less slasher movies. In fact, I can't stand them. Knife-wielding maniacs, female victims, and lots of blood. Maybe this is why those kind of movies get such a bad rap. But this was actually decent and actually works like a mystery too. We get Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore and lots of dark humor and maybe some thrills and chills too. If you're a horror movie fan and haven't seen this, give it a try. It's not too scary and I wasn't too scared. It's more of a thriller. I'd heard about the sequels; the second one being as good, but the rest tanked. And now that Wes Craven is dead, I seriously doubt there'll be more. But maybe this is the crown jewel of his 1990s horror movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Smart horror film for fans of the genre and newbies,"""Scream"" is a good horror/thriller that works not only as a deconstruction of the slasher/dead teenager genre but also as a scary who-done-it? film. It follows high-school student Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is being stalked by a mysterious killer who wears a long black cloak and a mask based on The Scream painting by Edward Munch.What I like about this movie is that it's a lot smarter than your average horror show. An easy example that makes my point is that in this story, people have actually seen horror movies before. How many films have you seen where you can't help yourself, you end up screaming at the people inside the movie because they walk into a dark room without turning on the light or grabbing a flashlight, they don't grab a weapon to defend themselves or they put themselves in situations that give away what their fate is? This, combined with a solid cast, a well written script and a lot of funny moments will suck you into the story, while the mystery of the face behind the killer's mask will compel you to stick around. If you're a fan of horror films you'll be happy to see that not only the film makers, but the characters in ""Scream"" film share the same love and it's a lot of fun to go through the film and check off the titles that are referenced to, in order to see if you have seen them yourself. If you aren't a fan of horror films this is a smart one that doesn't linger on the gore as much as It presents a mystery with some frightening scenes here and there. I really feel like this picture has a lot of re-watch value despite the fact that it's a mystery because it gets better the more horror films you have seen. If you want to get Into the genre of horror films and you're wondering where to start, then of course you have your classics like ""Nosferatu"" and ""Frankenstein"", then you've got your 70s flicks like ""Black Christmas"" and Night of the Living Dead"" and from there, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"" but you better make sure you don't miss ""Scream"" on your way you're the 2000s. It might even make you appreciate some of the franchises that eventually devolved into bad R-Rated comedies or you might feel even stronger about pictures like ""Leprecahun 4: In Space"" being utter trash. It's scary, at times very funny, the characters are compelling and it'll keep you guessing all the way through. (On Blu-ray, November 9, 2012)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scream: A Parody Of The Slasher Film,"Scream is always wrongfully called a horror movie. To be 100% truthful, Scream isn't a horror film by any means. Some Contemparary horror audiences might find Scream to be terrifying, but true horror fans can find the gimmicks and little laughs to make the film entertaining. Scream is not entertaining by the horror standard at all. I first seen Scream when I was fairly new to the horror genre, and I didn't find it to be suspenseful or scary by any means. It didn't even get to the graphic scenes until the very end. I couldn't exactly appreciate what this film was until I searched further in the horror genre, then I re-watched Scream, and found all of the parody moments.Scream was directed by Wes Craven, who is mainly known for directed A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and several exploitation films from the 70s (Last House on the Left (1972); Hills Have Eyes (1976)). However, Wes directed Scream several years after directed A New Nightmare, which would be the final installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. A New Nightmare basically took place in the real world outside the movies with the actors playing themselves. Scream basically works in the same way. It parodies the films that inspired it. For me, this film is a first rate comedy. I'm sure that some people will find this film to be absolutely terrifying in the last half an hour, but others will just find it to be guilty fun. Which category do you fall into? Well, when I referenced Last House on the Left (1972), did you know what film I was talking about? If so, this will seem like a pure comedy to you.While Scream IS a comedy, it still supplies some fun graphic scenes near the end of the film as well as some decent performances by the cast. The twist at the end was expected looking at the rest of the film, but was still nice to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I excepted a better movie,"Good things: Ghostface looks cool, start sequence, Ghostface's voice actor is really good and the mystery of who could be behind Ghostface's mask.
Bad things: Ghostface is so weak (In the movie he goes down with like a one kick, which makes him look so weak), Characters are boring and not fun, ending is not good and acting is bad.

My scream review,"Scream is such a classic film, and I love it. I think that scream had a-lot of suspense especially in the beginning and end. I do however think that they made who the killer was a tiny bit obvious, I mean there still was a huge plot twist about the killer, but within the first 40 minutes I could already tell who it was. I also think that the suspense was amazing and it really kept you on your toes. Now if you're thinking about watching this movie I would tell you to get on your tv and watch it right away, it's such a classic everyone should watch it.

Great Horror movie,"This a great movie I love the characters in this movie. The actress that plays Sydney did an excellent job as playing the main protagonist. Along with everybody else in the movie.

One of my favorite horror movies of all time. Also one of the greatest slasher films as well.

I loved the cast and how obvious who were the killers which was the best for me, without mentionning how tiktoks edits on my feed made it even better.

Another original contribution by Wes Craven.,"Wes Craven has provided audiences with original, entertaining work which has left their indelible mark on the movie world. One only has to mention 'Nightmare on Elm Street' for it to be seen that he is a director who has made a massive impact on the horror genre. Both movies had large followings and produced characters that will be long remembered. Creating characters that become icons within a genre is difficult and Craven has produced two.Not only is it because the material is so original, it is also because Craven uses a talented cast who appeal to present day audiences. He is able to blend classic horror, that is, the bogeyman with the mask who stalks the main characters from the shadows, with the window dressing provided by photogenic actors and actresses which is obligatory for today's movies. In effect he has made horror movies appealing to mass audiences  something that only the very best could do. This has been accomplished by way of numerous means. As previously mentioned, the cast - window dressing - are usually fresh, bright, young talent. They can act. There is also a story of note. The central characters are all engrossed in conflict with each other and this is not only due to the fact that the characters have been created with a lot of personality differences, but also because they are given real dilemmas. A good example is in 'Scream' where Sydney is struggling to come to emotional terms with her mother's death and she then also has to deal with Gale Weathers who questions the legitimacy of her testimony which put away the main suspect. She also has to deal with her mother's promiscuity. This is a great basis for conflict and has a high degree of believability. In the hands of two good actresses, it enhanced the movies plot.The suspense is of such a high level, that you could argue the fact that this movie leans more towards suspense thriller rather than horror. Although it is argumentative, I believe that this movie is still rightfully classified as horror rather than suspense since the suspense is a catalyst for the horror. The suspense sets us up for the horrific scenes. The suspense thus provides a service rather that it being the recipient of a service.In accordance with present day adaptations of teenagers on screen, they are insightful with understandings of relationships, but not the emotional maturity to deal with them. This is well used within 'Scream' as the main characters have insight into the 'rules' of horror movies, but still put themselves at risk for the climatic sequence where they are secluded and vulnerable although probably feeling safe in numbers.Neve Campbell is excellent as the fragile Sydney Prescott. She has an extremely fragile way of speaking which makes her more vulnerable to the villain. She aptly portrays the emotional turmoil which seems to sap her characters strength. Her ability to show the dilemma concerning her testimony towards Cotton Weary aids in the audience acceptance of her trusting of her boyfriend - would she be able to deal with another questionable accusation?  Given her portrayal, we think not.Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard are equally commendable. Ulrich does not get too offbeat when his characters true intentions are shown. This keeps the transition more plausible. Lillard remains as over the top as he was before which thus keeps his character consistent and hence believable. They were the best villains of the franchise and were a healthy contributing factor to the first movies success and its reputation, earned quite correctly, as the superior.You could not comment on 'Scream' without mentioning Kevin Williamson. He is the one who after all provided the seed for the most successful horror movie. Although he penned a few of the movies that followed on the success of this one, this is still the gem. The audience is kept guessing throughout and suspects are numerous meaning that some members of the audience may have changed their minds on several occasions as to who the villain is. Who guessed that there were two of them? Not many, of that I am very sure. There is ample plot here to keep attention as well as multi - layered conflict. This gave a new dimension to the slasher flick and redefined the genre for the 90's.This movie is not reverential of the genre. It rather pokes fun at the 'rules' that moviemakers kept to in order to operate within the genre. Success of a movie meant that others would follow and many similar movies were produced which were mostly a paler version of the source of inspiration or source of plagiarism, as would have often been the case in order to secure sound revenue. Audiences became indoctrinated with the same ideas and thus familiarity gave birth to contempt. Although this is true, the rules' must be kept to even within the most original script. A fine balancing act needs to be struck. It is important to note that all genres have their own set of rules which must be abided by if audiences are going to identify with the movie. Notwithstanding this fact, movies made for the drive - in theatre age, the B grade support flick, generally followed these rules' without much attention to plot and were therefore ridiculed. 'Scream' makes the most of this. It could have so easily fell into the spoof movie trap, but does not thus securing its place in movie history. Of more importance, it reignited the genre which had long been without a leading torch. The last one was Elm Street' and this is not coincidence that the director was Wes Craven. He is that good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Fun and Clever Slasher with a Meta Twist,"'Scream' (1996) is a refreshing take on the slasher genre, blending horror and self-aware humor in a way that still feels unique.

The film doesn't just rely on gore; it builds tension effectively, keeping you engaged from start to finish.The cast does a great job, with Neve Campbell standing out as a strong and relatable lead. The script is sharp, filled with witty dialogue and clever nods to horror classics. The opening scene is especially memorable, setting the tone for the rest of the film.While 'Scream' is fun and inventive, some moments feel a bit too predictable, and the humor doesn't always land.

why it is not scary ?,"A little bit of history, in 1978 the movie ""Halloween"" were released, it wasn't the first Slasher movie, this go the Psycho but Halloween establish the rules for slasher movie ""the victims of the movie always will engage in sex and the last Survivor always will be the The pious character, who isn't engages in sex. After few years a bunch of horror movie were released and today they are horror classics for exmple Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street which was directed by Wes Craven who is also the director of the movie ""Scream"".I think the movie ""Scream"" try to do a different thing like to Combine horror and ""comedy"" and to talk about the Clichés of the horror slasher movie. There is experience here to honor the slasher and to talk about them and even to laugh, but the laugh is what for me ruin the movie, it's ok to Combine genre and there is many movie who do this, but the problem for me in the scream is the balance between ""comedy"" and horror, if the movie talk about the Clichés like don't split or look after your shoulder and the movie make the same thing I expect to ""jump scares"" therefore they don't scary me because I looking for them.I think it is original that the killer is like a Character from ""slapstick comedy"" he is falling and wounded throughout the movie it is different from the The classic killers of the horror movie like Freddy Krueger and Jason (a nightmare of elm street and Friday the 13th. I love that the killer talk with the victim before he slaughter them, it make the movie like a ""love latter"" for The classic horror movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. I think Although it is brave to make the killer this way it kind of ruin the feel of the horror, the killer is just not threatens.Ironically The thing I did like is part of my problem with the movie and this is the conversion about movies it like the director communicate with us the audience, we know this is movie and the Characters know sort of they are in movie (it is not breaking the forth wall). Like I said it is ""love latter"" for horror slasher movie and there is ester egg for this movies which I find the way of the director to honor the movies history which I find a positive. In addition there is some Innovations that the movie do that catch be me unprepared, it use some cliché of the genera but in way that break this cliché.In conclusion don't get me wrong this movie is not so much bad like it could be interpreted from this review. As I see this it is ""Horror movie paradox"" you try to be modernistic and to be something new but at the same time you forget the genre you try to innovate. If this is not disturbing you may might enjoy this movie, go and judge by yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

So satisfying.,I had to rewatch the original to get rid of the toxic filth in my head from watching Scream 5 and 6. This film was so satisfying to watch again after suffering through the new ones. Growing up in the 90s I just can't get on board with the new ones and the main reason is the characters in it. I can't relate to those kids from 5 and 6 whatsoever. I find them very cringy and with no spirit. They don't act well and don't get engaged with the story the way the originals did. Especially the main character who seems to be taking the place of Sidney Prescott. She's absolutely horrible.

Virgins don't die in scary movies!,"It's difficult to re-capture the first time you see this film, because once you know who did it, it kind of spoils the whole thing.
You can literally see them as they are pulling it off all the way through. It's like knowing who Kaiser Sosay (I have no idea had to spell that) is at the end of The Usual Suspects or that Bruce Willis was dead all that time in Sixth Sense. You just can't help seeing it with a different perspective.I do seem to remember that I had no idea who the serial killer was when I first watched it. There were so many people to choose from - The Principal, Her Dad, Billy, Randy, Gail, Dewie, Her Dead Mum, The Cameraman, The Sheriff, Her Best Friend, Shaggy Doo or evening Sidney herself having special episodes? It could literally have been any of them or none of them at all and you could see motives for all of them to want to kill. So it was definitely a clever film for a first time view.As someone who is not a fan of scary films, I actually find this one really accessible for some reason. I don't know if it is the tongue in cheek way it doesn't take it self too seriously or because actually the characters are all kind of obnoxious and you don't really care who gets killed off, because you have no bond formed with them, but it just works really well.You can keep your Saw and your Human Centipede and even your Freddy Krueger et al, I'll stick with a simple story and the curiosity to know who did it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Wes Craven revitalised the slasher genre for the second time with this wittily meta and wickedly entertaining horror flick.,"From its immediately and unexpectedly ballsy tone-and-stakes-setting opening to its fantastically frenzied and excitingly squishy finale, this fast-paced slasher constantly plays with its audience in an extremely entertaining way and represents the second time that director Wes Craven revitalised the long-standing genre (after 'A Nightmare On Elm-Street (1984)'). That's alongside his own career, this time by - along with writer Kevin Williamson - introducing a devilishly meta-textual element that isn't always subtle but is always accurate and consistent while also being enjoyably playful - even during some of the flick's more genuinely intense sequences. 'Scream (1996)' plays with conventions and tropes so often seen within the wider horror genre, which - no matter how eclectic it may seem - does share a spookily similar set of conventions across the board. The picture itself is no stranger to those conventions; it doesn't subvert them all so much as 'hang a lantern' on most. The other major thing that Craven brings to the film is his penchant for proper visceral nastiness. The scarier sequences don't hold back on either the suspense or the gore, which creatively contrasts with the colourful sets and almost comedic quiet moments to make the flick feel even further from reality and give it a bizarre tone that's cohesive yet slightly odd. It's almost like the whole thing is supposed to look like a movie, which - given the constant meta references - is a nice touch that helps solidify its themes. The piece is just brilliant; it's a landmark entry in its genre. In fact, it's perhaps one of the few reasons that the slasher is even still around today. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horromedy.... Comerror?,"An enjoyable horror satire, that delivers on humor, gore, and scares. Scream capitalizes on horror movie cliches without being obnoxious about it. The fourth wall breaks and references to other horror movies are worked into the storyline perfectly. The acting is pretty good, and the storyline flows well.

As a Filmmaker myself....this is Perfection of Art,"Perfectly done by Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven as usual. This is a classic 90's Slasher film. As a filmmaker myself... this is a work of Perfection. This is my personal favorite Horror Series of all - time. I am admittingly guilty of growing up with this series and a big fan of Kevin Williamson as a Creative Genius. The characters come to life ...in a genre full of (obviously) fake emotions.....this doesn't disappoint. The Story is emotional, realistic and makes you feel involved. The characters are relatable and the horror part gives you the (chill) desired. No over the top unexplained weirdness to this series. I'm obviously a film snob.....but my experience is that most all humans will love relate. As for the critics? Well ...Critics never seem to give the love to the (REAL) special films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So bad that it's good!,"It's a bit difficult to review this film seriously, for several reasons. The main one is because I've watched Scary Movie so many times! Other reasons are... This is one of the most clichéd movies I've ever seen... Also, there are so many jump scares but non of them works! And then this type of script, which is criticized by the characters themselves, falls into stupid decisions, cartoony characters, bad acting, and a villain so bad it's funny. But despite all this, it actually is an entertaining movie. I don't know if it's really the intention of the filmmakers, but I had a lot of laughs with this movie. It's really entertaining, even knowing the flaws it has.With respect to their technical aspects they are not at all reprehensible. Good soundtrack, good editing, good shots. Now, the best by far, are all the cinephile references there are. The characters are fans of horror movies, which makes them mention a lot of iconic movies, making it all the more fun.In short, a good movie for a weekend afternoon or evening, which is already a 90s classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The slasher that teaches you how to make a slasher in a traditional way,"One of the most recognized and notable films by Wes Craven that is characterized by being more than a simple slasher. This movie takes the typical slasher clichés that were popular at the time and turns them into something that many slashers haven't done before. The movie not only acts like any slasher, but parodies the subgenre itself. We have typical characters of any slasher, but rescuing one of them being a movie buff that the film uses to give clear details of how traditional slashers are made. It is a very intelligent and special film in that sense. At first glance it is a slasher with a masked killer, young victims, naive teenagers and black humor. It's basically a horror comedy that, by parodying itself, serves as an instruction to create your own slasher movie in the traditional way. It does not have a high production, but things in its favor. The Ghostface character is a very endearing villain with his voice performed by Roger L. Jackson. Sydney, Gail and Dewey become the most memorable trio in the film. Marco Beltrami's soundtrack is impeccable. Scream is a good movie for any lover of traditional slashers or for any movie buff who sees the true complexity of this movie. My rating for this movie is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Scream"" (1996) - A Genre-Defining Masterpiece","Wes Craven's ""Scream,"" released in 1996, is a landmark in horror cinema, revitalizing the slasher genre with a clever blend of self-awareness, sharp wit, and genuinely terrifying moments. Written by Kevin Williamson, ""Scream"" is not just a horror film; it's a commentary on horror films, deconstructing the genre's clichés while simultaneously embracing them.The story follows Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), a high school student in the small town of Woodsboro, who becomes the target of a masked killer known as Ghostface. As Ghostface terrorizes Sidney and her friends, the film unravels a twisted murder mystery, keeping the audience guessing about the killer's identity until the very end.""Scream"" excels in its ability to blend horror and humor without undermining the tension. The film's meta-narrative is one of its strongest elements, with characters who are acutely aware of horror movie tropes and actively discuss them as they try to survive. This self-referential approach adds layers of enjoyment for horror aficionados, who can appreciate the nods to classics like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th.""The cast is stellar, with Neve Campbell delivering a strong and relatable performance as Sidney, one of the most iconic ""final girls"" in horror history. Courteney Cox as the ambitious reporter Gale Weathers and David Arquette as the bumbling yet endearing Deputy Dewey also shine, creating characters who would become staples of the franchise.Ghostface, with his chilling mask and taunting phone calls, quickly became a horror icon. The killer's identity remains a mystery throughout the film, leading to a climactic reveal that is both shocking and satisfying, cementing ""Scream"" as a masterful whodunit.Overall, ""Scream"" is a genre-defining masterpiece that redefined horror for a new generation. It's a film that manages to be both scary and smart, breathing new life into the slasher genre and setting the stage for a successful franchise that would continue to thrill audiences for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brings the slasher into the nineties,"Not being a great horror fan, I was initially reluctant to see this. However, after the well-hyped opening sequence, I found this to be a funny, ironic ride of a film. The in jokes are superb, as is the acting, and Kevin Williamson's plot is brilliant.

It manages to effectively balance the horror and comedic satire qualities. Frequently, the horror archetype characters were critiqued in a fun manner.Some of the effects are a little dated, but it definitely feels like this on purpose to capture and satire the rather cheesy slasher genre. Also, a few of the side characters could have been explored a bit more even if it does capture the trademark ms of the genre is is critiquing.This film is one of those horrors that any film devotee has to watch at some point, so definitely check it out!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Still Excellent,"It's sometimes easy to forget how great Scream is.

It never forgets to be fun and it never forgets to be scary and make the audience care about its characters.

The gold standard of slasher films,"The perfect Halloween movie with all the twists and turns. The story keeps the viewer guessing who the killer is, and the audience will constantly second-guess themselves. For having a run time of a little less than two hours, the story manages to keep the audience engaged the entire time; no scene feels too short or too long. The movie's theme is initially unclear for viewers who try to find deeper meaning in the film, but can be described as retribution by critics. The characters and acting are on point. When rewatching the movie, the audience can notice subtle hints and easter eggs done by the cast that are perfectly hidden from first-time viewers. The dialogue is good for a slasher film. The meta dialogue is used sparingly, making it enjoyable for movie watchers. The sets and cinematography are charming. It gives the small-town community feel, while other scenes provide a scary ambiance. The movie makes good use of its surroundings, and the killer often adapts to the spaces they are in. The soundtrack is on point and ads to every scene; there is never a time the background music is too loud or used out of place. This movie is the gold standard of slasher films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This movie was an......,"....absolute scream.I avoided this movie like the plague for decades because I found most movies of the Halloween and Friday the 13th ilk to be far too predictable and for the most part boring. I just watched it tonight on a whim and I found myself totally engrossed from the very first minute on. Every trope that was covered was distorted into a delightfully violent and scary scenes with undertones of humor. What a joy this movie was to watch in every single way. The movie was perfectly cast and you could cut the tension with a knife (pun intended).

A very well reinvented parody,"The idea of serial killer who slaughter teenagers is maybe not new, but director Wes Craven has put the film to a whole new level. It' s much more than a normal horror movie, which provoked a huge amount of splatter-movies, which all tried to copy the idea of Scream. But Scream, as I see it, is also a parody of the older movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th which are both even mentioned by name in the movie.The characters and their attributes aren't surprising but advisedly and well chosen. Sidney Prescott (legendary played by Neve Campell), the main protagonist, is the typical young pretty high-school teen. Her obligate best friend (acted by a very cute blonde Rose McGowan) and her nerving older brother, who is additional the ""good cop"" (lovely staffed with David Arquette) can also be found in this movie. Of course the role of the unsuccessful sensation-seeking reporter (Courtney Cox, with a estranging hair-styling) has been established by Wes Craven.When you watch Scream at night and alone it will probably quit frighten you but if you have some friends around you, or you just love to watch horror movies, you will be amused by this ""blood-red"" humor, which is personalized in the character Randy (peak performance of Jamie Kennedy).Scream is definitive a ""must-have seen"" of the nineties.

At first I had a feeling that the plot was going to be a bit too predictive, but then it actually becomes quite unexpected near the end (saying any more will spoil). The beginning of the film was one of the best and exciting parts of the movie. The voice from the phone calls was cool too. Quite the bloodbath as well like a lot of horror films.

"Success commercially, failure film-wise","After reading a few reviews, I decided to register just to able to write my own. I cannot believe that such a dumb movie can get so much praise. I don't even know where to start. Firstly, if you haven't seen this movie and if you're older than 14 - avoid it! The cast is filled with the so-called upcoming stars, which do a pretty average job. The scenario is full of ""holes"" and barely holds itself together. You'll be wondering why the action took place or why the phrase was said and it won't be clear even after the movie is over. It is very sad to see that Wes Craven, the maker of the first ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" a truly original and superbly made horror movie, is involved in this pathetic show whose only aim is to gain as much commercial success as possible. The following sequels serve as an undeniable proves for this. One of the amazing things I found is that one version of the slip-sleeve packages says ""starring Drew Barrymore."" (I am not saying that she's an awful actress, but to me saying that she ""stars"" is great exaggeration.) In this movie she hardly ""plays,"" as she appears doing nothing but screaming and saying only a few words, and this lasts less than ten minutes. But this, most likely, was another commercial trick. So my advice would be - unless you have free tickets, do not waste your money and time. (With the free tickets you may go ahead and check it out - just to know what this ""commercial"" fuss is all about.)",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I expected more . . .,"Scream had an amazing point behind it, and I am glad that it was one of the first films to deliberately stand up for originality. With that said, ironically, the reason I didn't like it was because it was just a typical slasher with something to say instead of something to rip-off.The kill scenes were all well done and some of them were downright iconic. But they were few and far between, with way too much bloated dead space between them. I'll never understand why action movies and horror moviestwo genres that are meant to thrill youalways seem to think they have to throw in yet another overdone woman's channel drama, and that is one cliché Scream doesn't break out of, sadly. The drama takes up way too much screen time and dulled the amazing intro and secondary kill scenes. This would have been a near perfect movie if they would have just stuck to the horror.The blood is pretty minimal, and not really even up to the bar set by the older slashers mentioned in the movie. However, some of the kills were more intense than normal slashers.As all of you should already know, the main point to have made Scream is to show that movies were cliché and predictable without turning into one of those movies itself. I think it does that wonderfully, but a little bit more on the subject would have made it more solid, because some people didn't even catch that was the point of the movie.In the end, Scream is just another typical slasher played out on a anti-cliché soapbox. I expected a lot more from it, and I still see no reason for the boring drama scenes that played out through most of the middle. It's a must view for any serious horror fans, but don't expect to be amazed like I was.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

And the editing in this is pretty great. And its cultural impact is gigantic. And its cinematography is great. But im not a big fan of how long it is. I wish it was a little shorter.

2 and 4 are better in my opinion,"Scream is a pretty entertaining slasher film, but I think that scream 2 and 4 are better. The whole feel of this film is fairly fresh. Fresh meaning that it's not completely forgettable like a whole of past slasher horror movies. This movie is not comedic, but it is slightly satirical at times, it knows the horror movie clichés, and it plays off them and kind of makes fun of them. There are lines of dialogue among high school teens about the rules of ""surviving a horror movie"", and of course they're all the obvious cheesy things that teens in old slashers do. It is neat to see a movie that does poke a little fun at itself, but not in an outright comedic way, it still is very much a serious horror. The cast did a fine job with their roles. Neve Campbell does a good job with the starring role of Sidney. Sidney is a pretty tortured teenage girl who has recently lost her mother. And Courtney Cox (Friends) is a journalist/reporter who is writing a book on the murder case of Sidney's mother and is also trying to interview Sidney everywhere she goes. The plot isn't too complicated, crazy killer on the loose and you don't know who it is and people are dropping like flies. The goriness in the movie is in some scenes necessary and in others not so much. The ending is pretty thrilling and I enjoyed that, I also really liked the very beginning scene, Drew Barrymore does well with her 5 minutes of recognition lol.

the flick that started a new era,"For years horror was a not done in Hollywood until this flick suddenly hit the screen. Why it started a new era was rather simple. Wes Craven, the director was done with all those horrors full with CGI and almost no gore. After the end in the mid eighties of the slashers it was time to go back and restart it he thought so Scream came out full of red stuff and gory moments.What also did work was the fact that it was full of questions towards the old school horror. The killer on the phone did ask who was the killer in certain flicks so horror buffs did like the trivia throughout Scream. But it just all fits together, the acting, the story, the gore, the killings. Wes Craven was back and how. Suddenly horror was back on the list in Hollywood and even as Scream created a franchise it also spawned a lot of new horror flicks until this writing. Horror was back and made money, even today.A must see for all geeks out there because it's full of horror and not that much of blah blah like we've seen in the I Know franchise.

A Classic Hollywood Horror...,"Back then it was fresh and something that many people thought was extraordinary, but if you are watching now days, you see the old tricks used here and there. Tricks that just look fake. But it is still cool to watch, some old classics, and how people made scary movies before. Woodsboro is haunted by a killer in a ghost mask that wants to play a game by the rules of how scary movies are build up. That is the main plot of this scary movie. I liked the concept, and the actors were fun to watch as well. Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott is so iconic in this franchise, and she is cool to watch when she is younger. She was the star of the movie, and the rest, was ok, but Campbell was the best. The background and the effects was old schoolish that I liked, and that was also the best that they had that time. The music was suspending and atmospheric to every scene and the story was good built up. The negative sides was that it was 20 minutes to long and it could be shorter, and I did not like the killers motive, it did not feel good for what he was doing. I did not take it serious, to be serious😂But the rest was great. I am comparing this movie to the requel from 2022, and it is hard to say which is better, because they are really like the same, the both of them had the same good and negative sides, so it is very hard to say which is better. I am not sure at the moment, we will see about that some time. I think for the sake of the horror classics, you should watch this scary movie. It feels like a very classic Hollywood movie, and I think it is nice to see something like that. Other horror classics like Friday The 13th, Jaws and Psycho, is still one the way to be watched by me.

Modern Horror Classic,"Scream was made at a time when slashers were on their way out. Michael, Jason, and Freddy had lost their touch. They were battling psychics, going to New York, and all sorts of weird stories that went completely against what the franchises built themselves on. Wes Craven had some luck with with New Nightmare, a meta return to the franchise he built. But it was this movie that really rebuilt the genre and brought it back to glory.The movie is about a group of horror movie buffs who find themselves in a horror movie. Much like the original Friday the 13th, there is a mystery as to who the killer(s) is. It focuses on Sidney, the incredibly sexy Neve Campbell, whose mother was killed a year before and learns how she is tied to the killings. They are all aware of the movies this film references.New Nightmare may have been the first, but Scream was the first to popularize the idea of self-aware characters. Any movie buff will recognize the references (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Prom Night, etc) beyond those the movie directly references. The movie is a love letter to the genre and will make film buffs out of anyone. I know this movie is probably the reason I'm such a film buff, particularly of horror movies, myself.I love that the movie is a mystery. There's so few horror movies that include mystery aspects. The original Friday the 13th tried it, but Ms. Voorhees came out of nowhere. Prom Night did it, but the killer was pretty obvious. This is very much like an Agatha Christie story. The suspects are all there, and they're all guilty until they're gutted or the mask is taken off. The reveal is quite satisfying. Their motivation is fitting. Screams 3 and 4 would be disappointing, but this one was really good. And the movie just gets better with multiple viewings so you can see new layers to the real killer throughout the movie.The cast is good. Campbell looks great and is a great heroine along the lines of Alien's Ripley. McGowan isn't just a dumb, horny blonde. Cox proves she isn't just her Friends character. Arquette is hilarious. Though it's Lillard and Kennedy who steal the movie. The two are terrific and hilarious in every scene they're in, especially the ""Rules of Horror"" scene. My only complaint is that Ulrich looks a little too ""evil,"" though he otherwise does a great job. They all are convincing as high school students.Of course, what really makes this movie great is the frights. This is an incredibly effective scary movie. Like all the best slasher films, this one relies on suspense over gore. There's plenty of blood, but it's the build up to the kills that really scare people. The opening scene is probably one of the best in the genre. Anyone can make a person jump and enough gore will gross even those with the best stomachs, but suspense is the best way to really scare someone. The movie really spends the time to make you care about the characters, so when their time comes you're actually rooting for them rather than the killer, the main problem with later Friday the 13th films. This is one that will have you hiding behind blankets and pillows on your first watch.The movie's use of cell phones may date the film somewhat, but Scream is a terrific film otherwise. The movie knows the genre and is one of the best of it. This is a can't miss for any horror fan, and will likely make some new fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It's cool to not be cool now, and Scream works.

Scream is a post modern take on the horror movie,"Wes Craven's most mainstream horror film served to revitalise the slasher movie in the mid-90's after all the Friday the 13th, Halloween and Craven's very own Nightmare on Elm Street franchises fizzled out to ever diminishing returns. It was time for a new horror icon to get fans excited and that appeared in the form of Ghostface, giving Wes Craven the biggest hit of his career and spawning 4 sequels to date.Scream opens with a similar Hitchcockian trick of killing off the A list star in the first reel, like Hitchcock did to Janet Leigh in Psycho, but when we get into the real story of the murder of Neve Campbell's mother what we find is a smart, knowing, self deprecating horror movie that revels in referencing other movies, so it's not your predictable slice n' dice horror movie after all, despite Drew Barrymore's helpless victim succumbing to all the cliches at the start, which was put there just to lull the audience into a false sense of security.Screenwriter Kevin Williamson satirises the genre with in-jokes and characters who know the rules of how horror films work while Craven knows how to scare and surprise the audience. In fact he pulled off a similar self referential trick with Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) by turning the concept on it's head and having the characters be in the real world referencing the previous movies, Scream is a continuation of that post modern take on the horror movie.It treads a fine line between parody and being a horror film in it's own right, so it never becomes a spoof like Scary Movie (2000) which is built around lampooning Scream. Friend's star Courtney Cox and David Arquette met on the set and later married, Henry Winkler (The Fonz) makes an uncredited appearance as the school principle and the eagle eyed viewer will spot Linda Blair (The Exorcist) as a reporter trying to interview Neve Campbell's character Sidney.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Good,"""Scream"" slashes its way into my 6/10 rating, and I must say it wasn't bad at all. The film benefits from strong performances by the cast, especially Neve Campbell, who reprises her role as Sidney Prescott. The film editing keeps the tension high as it pays homage to the slasher genre while adding its own modern twist. The film's strength lies in its self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at horror movie tropes. However, it occasionally falls into predictable patterns and doesn't quite capture the magic of the original. The music by Marco Beltrami adds to the suspense, and the cinematography creates an eerie atmosphere. ""Scream"" may not reinvent the wheel, but it's a worthy addition to the franchise and my rating reflects that it provided some solid scares and a fun return to Woodsboro.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Slasher That Revived Horror with Wit and Terror,"Wes Craven's Scream (1996) is a game-changer in the slasher genre, blending horror and self-aware satire in a way that still feels fresh today. The film follows high schooler Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her friends as they are terrorized by a masked killer known as Ghostface. What sets Scream apart is its clever script by Kevin Williamson, which deconstructs horror tropes while delivering genuine scares.The film's opening scene with Drew Barrymore is one of the most iconic in horror history, instantly setting the tone for suspense and unpredictability. The cast, including Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Skeet Ulrich, adds depth to what could have been typical genre archetypes. The mystery of Ghostface's identity keeps the tension high, and the film's mix of dark humor and brutal kills makes for a thrilling ride.Even decades later, Scream remains a standout slasher that reshaped the genre, paving the way for meta-horror films. It's a must-watch for horror fans and newcomers alike, proving that knowing the rules of horror won't always save you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Garbage.,"I dislike torture porn slasher rubbish. Not sure why people enjoy this. You all must love to be frightened. Some sort of mental attribute attracts you to this dreck? Innocents getting killed graphically. Yes the innocent in real life get killed badly.

The Greatest Horror film Ever?,"For as long as I can remember, I hated horror films. I thought they were gross and that if I watched them, I would have nightmares. Then when I was in about 8th grade, I was on Netflix it recommended that I watch Scary Movie. I asked my mother what Scary Movie was; she said it was a parody film from when she was in college. I asked her what it was a parody of she said, ""A film called Scream."" After she told me, I noticed that Netflix had the first Scream film. I thought, what the heck, what's the worst that could happen? The worst thing that happened was that the movie started what is now an extreme love for horror films. The story does not end there, as It was three years before I watched another horror film. When a friend who was a huge horror fan recommended that since I didn't love horror films, I should watch Scream. So I rewatched the film that had sparked an interest in horror films. This time the horror bug stayed, and now horror is my favorite genre of film, and I watch nearly every new horror movie that comes out. Even though it is no longer my favorite still holds a spot in my heart that I will never forget.Horror icon Wes Craven directed Scream. Craven has directed his early-meta horror film New Nightmare. Craven also was in the works to direct a remake of The Haunting before he joined to do this film. This movie has fun and iconic characters with a great direction by Wes Craven. The film has three cast members who would return for the first five movies of this series. Sidney Prescott, Dewey Riley, and Gale Weathers. The three stars of this film all give great performances, none of which I could pick over the other. Courtney Cox, I knew from Friends. David Arquette, I had seen in the ""Best Picture"" winner Sharkboy and LavaGirl, and Neve Campbell I knew from Wild Things. I feel one part of this film that makes it so iconic is Marco Beltrami's score. In my opinion one of the best scores in the history of horror.My rating is a solid 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

What's your favorite horror movie?,"Scream. What's your favorite horror movie? Wanting to revive the horror genre, which was almost never heard of, Wes Craven decided to create his own masked monster.

In the film itself, apart from the final action, there is nothing memorable.

This is easily my favourite movie(and horror movie) ever, and since it was so enjoyable, I was expecting a high standard from the sequels...And I wasn't disappointed.Wes Craven(director)and his team set up the rest of the trilogy expertly with this movie. They did a great job in all aspects: the acting couldn't have been better, the choice of actors couldn't have been better, the choice of scene location couldn't have been better and the character development couldn't have been better.

A Satire on Horror Films,"Scream is a satire/mystery horror film from the 90's. It stars Neve Campbell who plays Sidney Prescott, a young girl in high school is suddenly terrorized by a faceless killer. The days that she is being attacked are the same days that her mother was killed the year before. There are also all the cliché horror characters like the boyfriend (Billy Loomis), the dumb couple (Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard), and there is the overly obsessed movie freak (Jamie Kennedy). There's also the protective cop (David Arquette) and a young ambitious newscaster (Courteney Cox). This movie speaks about other horror movies the whole movie like: Psycho, Carrie , and The Town That Dreaded Sundown just to name a few. This movie also introduced a new classic horror villain, Ghostface. Ghostface is supposed to resemble the painting The Scream by Edward Munch. He may not be as scary or gruesome as Freddy or Jason, but he would still be a very frightening figure to see in the middle of the night. Overall, it may not be the best horror film, but it's a great tribute. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Shockingly obnoxious,"I've gotta plead ignorance on ""Scream""; I didn't get it. It started with that Drew Barrymore opening, the stuff of icons; it was after all the centerpiece of the marketing, the movies lasting image, and what all the girls in math class were raving about in '96 (even I remember that). But my god, is it grating.And things never improve from there. The horror clichés are the point, but these characters are just there to rattle off references. With Craven at the helm and a veritable who's who cast, this was no lightweight movie. But even at an age where I get the horror movie callbacks, this did nothing for me.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Do you like scary movies?,"This movie wastes no time and hits the ground running with an iconic opening 15 minutes. It sets the tone right away while giving us some truly memorable lines like, ""Do you want to play a game?"" Easily my favourite element of this movie is that it's a murder mystery. Even though I figured most of it out before the final reveal, it was still fun to watch everything unfold. But what this movie excels at is how self-aware all the characters are to horror tropes and what not to do. It just makes everything feel more grounded in reality.However, as far as serial killers go, Ghostface sucks at his job. I understand that he's inexperienced, but then again, he somehow manages to move around like a silent ninja without ever being spotted. He was just a weak serial killer who was never scary, and quite honestly, I think I could have taken him down. As well, for a movie that is self-aware of horror clichés, it still falls victim to horror clichés. For instance, running and tripping on thin air or just dumb people dying in dumb ways. I also hate the fact that the movie constantly tried scaring us with ""jump scares"", which only turned out to be harmless friends popping up out of nowhere.I also acknowledge the fact that this movie was made for horror buffs and fans of slashers. Seeing as to I am neither of those things, I can still respect the amount of passion that went into this project. Particularly with all the call-backs and Easter eggs. With that being said, this movie was still a ton of fun and I'm curious to check out all the sequels now.Score: 7 out of 10

Scream references past slashers, and is also self-referential, but it doesn't work all the time.The cast delivers adequate performances, but the opening sequence by Drew Barrymore is very memorable.To conclude, Scream was a good slasher and it's even better that it could become a slasher franchise.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Why is this rated so highly?,"I don't get it. From the get go to the end this film: is cheesy, has poor acting, has weak editing, and is overall unintentionally laughable. Some of the characters are downright cringe; I don't understand. Very early on the film through the editing and acting it reveals what you're in for - nothing special. The shots which are chosen and the way they're cut together feels amateurish, I'm sure you'll notice. Anyway, the film is highly rated - 'maybe it gets better?' I think to myself, so I keep watching. The cast looks and feels like a bunch of 20-somethings but they're playing teenagers, it's so immersion breaking. There's one scene where a supposed teen is with his father at the police station - honestly they look like brothers. Mid film it is apparent they you're supposed to be guessing who the killer is, and I suppose this is somewhat clever in a basic way because a person who seems obvious is in fact the killer - but at the same time like any normal person you'd be thinking that this is a red herring. I mean, it's clever but it's not clever, it's about as smart as donating to a charity that says they'll stop people getting ripped off by nonsense charities. The end of the film was honestly the strongest part but even so - it was peppered with cringey bits. Tough to like this film, just seemed like poor directorial choices interspersed with attempts at cleverness - it doesn't really work.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Quintessential introduction to horror,"This movie didn't take itself too seriously. It seems to make fun of the horror genre while itself being horror.There is violence but it is not excessively graphic (mostly stabbing and blood).There are mystery and comedic elements. The film was clearly created by someone who loves horror films.Acting is great. They mention a lot of horror movies by name. Honestly if someone wanted to do a study of horror, it seems like a good thing to do would be take a pen and write down all the movies they reference. It's a great place to start anyway.I think truly if you don't like this movie you probably do not like horror/slasher movies (which is fine!).There are female characters who are pretty neat in the film.People are not always very good at their job-even the killer honestly is not very effective at times. I think this is a sign of good writing when people are flawed. You're not supposed to have perfect characters.It's, now almost 30 years old, kind of a historical relic too when you look at how life was like when phones were scarce. The movie would have to be written differently if it took place today because we all have cell phones.

A Timeless Classic that Redefined Horror,"The movie ""scream"" directed by Wes Craven, released in 1996, is still a topical and satirical movie. The movie is set in the fictional town of Woodsboro, where high school student Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) falls victim to a masked killer known as Ghostface. I would characterize this film as a combination of horror, satire, and suspense.While watching this movie, I was struck by the self-understanding of the main characters. They perfectly understand all the clichés of horror movies, but at the same time they can't resist their instincts and still resort to stupid mistakes in moments of horror.The cast of this piece does not disappoint at all. Sydney, played by Neve Campbell, is a refreshingly nuanced final girl reliving the trauma of her mother's murder while simultaneously confronting the horror unfolding around her. Likewise, I really enjoyed the work of Courtney Cox, who played reporter Gail Weathers. She added some wit and determination to this movie. At the same time, David Arquette makes a comic contribution as the awkward Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley. These are 3 of my favorite personages in this movie.By its nature, the movie ""scream"" is a rather long and intriguing investigation, as the killer is not known until the very end. And Wes Craven successfully copes with keeping the suspense. Also, throughout the movie there are several suspects, and it is really not clear to the viewer what is going on and what the final motive is.In conclusion, Scream is a landmark horror movie that continues to captivate audiences with its combination of wit and scares. The clever investigation and intertwining of genres really gives this movie a unique look and because of this, the movie is watchable in one breath.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A good slasher, but still a bad movie...","I think slashers are boring. They are neither funny, nor frightening, but this one is almost an exception to this rule. Why ""almost""? Because its not frightening. It's funny, mainly because of Randy. Randy and Dewey are the only characters that I didn't hate in this movie. Randy is funny and Dewey is pretty friendly. The others are all jerks that you hope will get killed in the most horrible way and never be heard of anymore, and that INCLUDES Neve Campbell. I have to admit it's hard to like a movie when you hate the hero. But the most annoying character is the one played by Rose McGowan. She is incredibly stupid. A real walking stereotype. The kind of character I absolutely hate. So, it's even harder to love a movie when you hate both the hero and her best friend... Annoying characters are bad in slasher, since you are supposed to like the characters being hunted down and fear for them, not hope they get killed, chopped down in pieces and die in the most horrible way you can imagine. Well, that is the way I felt during the whole movie, except when Dewey and Randy were in trouble. Some jokes about the ""rules"" when you are in a slasher are funny(and pretty realistic). But, I never screamed... It's not frightening! THIS IS NOT AN HORROR MOVIE!!! THIS IS A SLASHER!!! Horror movies leave a strange feeling, gives you the creep, have a lasting effect. Slashers go for cheap surprises(killer coming out of the closet, jumping from the roof, etc...). Maybe Scream is, in a way, an horror comedy, since it makes fun of slashers. But if it is, then it could never compete with the kings of horror comedies: Dead Alive(a.k.a. Braindead) and Evil Dead 2. So let's just say it is the king of cheap teen slashers. It is the best of the collection of bad movies that can be found in this category, but that doesn't make it a good movie. It's also better than the horrible sequels that followed, or any of the movies that where ""inspired"" by its success. If you love slashers, you will probably love this movie. One last thing: I guessed who the killer was in no time.5 out of 10. A good slasher, but that doesn't make it a good movie...",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A self aware horror flick out of the mind of Wes Craven,With horror dying in the 90's Craven thought of an amazing idea Scream a self aware movie with some comedy and some mystery solving put in as well. Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott the main girl who's confident and strong and she is just a perfect hero. Gale weathers is played by Courtney Cox and she does great at a women who just wants to make her place in the world. David Arquette is deputy Dewey who wants to protect Sidney but also have to follow police rules also in the men part of the cast is Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard were Billy and Stu who are 2 best friends who love movies and they are perfect at their knowledge of movies. Scream was a movie that i enjoyed it wasn't just a horror movie it was also a comedy and a mystery which kept us on edge for who the killer was and it was cleaver in referencing other horror movies but it also wasn't afraid to be different and that's why it worked and it would span into 3 more movies and a spin-off series which would would make fun of other horror movies so its always going to be a movie i could re watch.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Now a cult movie,"I remember seeing 'Scream' as a teenager when it first came out and being utterly scared. Yet, I'm not sure nowadays audience would really be scared. What we find scary changes over time--'Alien' was considered very scary when first released in the late 70s, yet today I doubt it would really scare any adult viewers ('The Thing' is another example). It does not prevent 'Alien' from being widely praised as an excellent, classic film. The same applies to 'Scream'. The opening scene remains one of the most memorable in film history. Cleverly written, witty, well acted and shot, 'Scream' is a masterpiece that reintroduced talent to the then decaying horror movie industry (compare it with series like 'Friday the 13th' for instance). Sadly, it is also its own victim as all the goofy parodies have resulted into depreciation of the original film.

What is it trying to be?,"After everybody else on the planet had seen this movie, I felt I should give it a try too. My decision came too late and I had to rent it on tape.Well the experience at the theaters would probably have been the same. There were a few parts where I jumped but aside from that, nothing really stood out about this movie.Scream tried to be a mystery in a way since the villain was never revealed to the audience until the very end. In most horror movies, the audience gets a third person perspective that's privy to almost everything. So Scream doesn't do that and therefore, it's a bit like a mystery. But the storyline never gave the audience enough information. When the movie finally reveals the killer, I got the feeling I was cheated since I probably would have been able to figure it out had the movie given more info. The motive the killer gave really sounded tacked on too.Scream also tried to be a horror movie but it got its' thrills through cheap ways (like loud and sudden noises). Nothing about the movie itself was really scary. There was gore, but that's not scary. Scream's stuff doesn't make you spooked from bumps in the night.So Scream isn't a horror movie, and it's not a mystery movie. I think it's more a drama but the vague character development (everything we learned about the main character's past was pretty much from the last 15 mins of the movie in the killer's big ending speech) doesn't qualify it for that.

The turning point of the slasher subgenre,"""Scream,"" directed by Wes Craven and released in 1996, stands as an absolute masterpiece of the horror genre, earning a perfect 10/10 rating without a shadow of a doubt. This film not only reinvigorated the slasher subgenre but also transcended it, becoming a landmark in horror cinema and a cultural phenomenon.What makes ""Scream"" exceptional is its brilliant deconstruction of the conventions of horror films while simultaneously delivering a genuinely terrifying and suspenseful experience. The film opens with a shocking and iconic scene that sets the tone for the entire movie, establishing a sense of unpredictability that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.The screenplay by Kevin Williamson is a stroke of genius. It cleverly references and parodies horror tropes and clichés while crafting a story that is both self-aware and self-assured. The characters, led by Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott and Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, are multi-dimensional and relatable, making us genuinely care about their fates.The casting of the film is impeccable. The late, great Wes Craven assembled a talented ensemble, including David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, and Skeet Ulrich, who all deliver memorable performances. However, it's the iconic portrayal of Ghostface by multiple actors that adds a layer of chilling unpredictability to the film.""Scream"" is a masterclass in suspense and tension. Craven's direction and the use of darkly lit settings, creepy phone calls, and startling jump scares create an atmosphere of palpable dread. The film is unrelenting in its ability to keep viewers guessing and second-guessing the identity of the killer.The film's self-referential humor and meta-commentary on the horror genre were groundbreaking at the time and have since become hallmarks of the ""Scream"" franchise. It successfully blends horror with humor without diminishing the terror, creating a unique and unforgettable experience.The iconic Ghostface mask and the film's chilling phone calls have become synonymous with horror itself, solidifying ""Scream"" as a cultural touchstone. The film's impact on pop culture, as well as its influence on subsequent horror films, cannot be overstated.In conclusion, ""Scream"" is a tour de force of horror cinema that remains as fresh, clever, and terrifying today as it was upon its release. It's a film that redefined the genre while paying homage to its roots, and it continues to be celebrated by horror enthusiasts and film aficionados alike. ""Scream"" earns its well-deserved 10/10 rating as a timeless classic that will continue to haunt and thrill audiences for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
not scary,"Typical plot for a horror film. A group of teenagers are being murdered by someone who dresses in funny costume/masks. The deaths are pretty horrific, with plenty of heart-racing chase scenes and gory, creative deaths. This film seems to have gathered a cult following, probably because most people did find this film to be horrific. However, when I saw the film, I just laughed at the antics and the character dramas unfolding. It is suspenseful, and it is gory, and most people did consider this frightening. However, if you do not like this type of film or are looking for something a little more than a cliché, then do not bother with this one. This goes for the original 'Scream' and 'Scream 3'; I have not seen the second one.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wes Craven Has Made A Brilliant Horror/Comedy,"Wes Craven (Nightmare On Elm Street and Last House On The Left) has done a great job with this horror. The horror genre became crap at around the time of the 80's. All we got were crappy rip-offs or sequel after sequel. Friday the 13th has 10 and Halloween has 8. It was about time for someone to come along and save the horror genre.The plot here isn't hard to follow at all. A killer in a ghost mask is killing of teens in Woodsboro High School. The story follows Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her life that is practically ruined. A year ago her mother was raped and butchered and her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) is pressuring her for a better relationship. All she needs is a killer that appears to be targeting her and her friends which include Tatum (Rose McGowan), Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Stu (Matthew Lillard) and Dewey (David Arquette). Also included in the bunch is Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), a reporter who reported on Sidney's mother's death.This horror/comedy is really one of the only great horrors of the 90's. It has tried to be duplicated but never bettered. The acting is great in this, the music chilling and the directing fine. The other great thing is this doesn't take itself seriously. This is a parody of the horror movies in the 70's and 80's. It has typical clichéd situations and many horror fans will recognise references to Halloween, NOES, Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The movie is filled with plenty of scares, especially the first 12 minutes, and is filled with plenty of gore. The climax is well played out and the killers identities are unexpected.4½/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"An Excellent,Scary And Funny Horror/Slasher Classic. Wes Craven At His Best.","Scream is an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic and one of the greatest Horror films of all-time that is filled with amazing direction,a wonderful cast,a terrific script and a creepy and memorable score. All of the elements make Scream an unforgettable Horror film and is Wes Craven at his best.Scream tells the story of Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell),a teen who on the one year anniversary of her mother's death discovers that a killer with a ghost face mask is stalking and killing people in her home town. When Sidney finds out she's next on the list Sidney has to try and stop the killer and stay alive.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen as dead by most critics and audiences I wouldn't say the genre was dead but was more in a coma and waiting to wake up and the film that woke up the Horror genre was Wes Craven's Scream,a brilliant Horror movie that was not only a critical and Box Office hit but also made the Horror genre hot again and paved the way for other slasher films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer(1997)and Urban Legend(1998). Right from the movie scary and now famous 10-15 minute sequence,Scream is an amazing and terrifying Horror movie that takes the Slasher genre and toys around with the Slasher movie giving us a film that is not only scary but also funny,smart and clever giving viewers a film that rethinks the Slasher genre while paying homage to Slasher films of the past. Scream is one of the few films I can think of that mixes Horror and Humor flawlessly with intelligence. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Scream are done with powerful and explosive intensity that punches you right in the face and during the scary scenes none of the characters are never safe or secure with violence in the air. The violence and gore that happens during the scary scenes are horrific and disturbing and reminds me of the in your face brutality of his earlier classics such as A Nightmare On Elm Street(1984),The Last House On The Left(1972)and The Hills Have Eyes(1977)because like those films Craven shows us the disgusting view and doesn't hold back one bit. The Comedy and Humor is funny and at times hilarious because it seems like the teenage characters know that they're in a Horror film are self aware and know all of the Clichés and things that happen in a slasher film(or all of the rules in order to survive a Horror film)which is in line with the post-modern film making of the 1990s. Scream also features terrific and fun references to landmark Horror classics such as Psycho(1960),A Nightmare On Elm Street,Halloween(1978)and Friday The 13th(1980)and some of the references are obvious while others are subtle. The balance of Horror and Humor makes the movie more intense and unforgettable. Sidney Prescott is one of the great Horror movie scream queens/heroines and that's mainly because like the other scream queens of the past Sidney is tough and can handle herself and you root for her to survive despite the viciousness all around her and when you see her going through terror you will relate to her. The Ghost face killer is a classic villain in the Horror genre because what sets this killer apart from other killers in the genre is that the killer calls on the phone and uses Horror movie knowledge to test the victim and if get the answers wrong Ghost face will kill you with no remorse. The Ghost Face killer will have you on edge when you see Scream the first time and will stick with you and you can say was one of the reasons caller ID was invented. Much of the film's success of Scream is thanks to the screenplay by Kevin Williamson which is amazing,terrific and in my opinion one of the best screenplays in Horror film history. Williamson script is filled with great dialog that is clever,ironic and done with a style that has been imitated but never duplicated. Williamson fills his script with Horror,Mystery,Comedy and Drama all within 112 minutes and giving viewers a unique story that never slows sown. Williamson has never topped his Scream script and I don't think he ever will. The ending of Scream is a classic conclusion that is filled with twists,turns and thrills that will catch you off guard and add to the movie's greatness. An outstanding ending.The cast is incredible. Neve Campbell is excellent as Sidney,one of the great Horror movie heroines,with Campbell bringing toughness,sympathy and depth to the role. Courtney Cox is wonderful as Gale Weathers,a heartless News reporter. Skeet Ulrich is terrific as Billy,Sidney's boyfriend. David Arquette is great and funny as Deputy Dewey. Rose McGowan is fantastic and sexy as Tatum,Sidney's best friend. Jamie Kennedy is outstanding and hilarious as Randy,a movie geek. Matthew Lillard is delightful as Stuart,Tatum's boyfriend. W.Earl Brown(Kenny)and Joseph Whipp(Sheriff Burke)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for credited and uncredited cameos by Liev Schreiber(Cotton Weary),Linda Blair(Obnoxious News reporter),Wes Craven(Fred The Janitor)and Henry Winkler(Principal Arthur Himbry).The direction by Wes Craven is amazing,with Craven always moving the camera and bringing a thrilling and intense style to the film. Wonderful direction,Craven.The score by Marco Beltrami is sensational,suspenseful and intense and adds to the atmosphere to the film. Great score,Beltrami.In final word,if you love Wes Craven,Horror films or Slasher films,I highly suggest you see Scream,an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic that you will never forget and will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic slasher movie,"The story is done really well and it's pretty clever on how self-aware is it. I do like the whole black comedy and whodunit that are in this movie to make it really memorable. It's also have a couple of suspenseful scenes in it and the tone works really well in the atmosphere of the movie. The movie makes references to other horror movies from the past and fits in really well for this type of movie. And the twist of the killer is really clever and unpredictable. This included the main character Sidney who have a tragic backstory. Gale a reporter who wants to prove a criminal innocent. Randy who does the self-aware humor. Dewey a officer who protects both Sidney and his sister. And Billy a possible suspect. I also really like the Ghostface killer who have a creepy voice, his knowledge of horror movies, and his great costume that he wears throughout the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Be careful who you surround yourself around,"This is my first time watching Scream. Leaving windows and doors unlocked, conversing on the phone with total strangers, and violating a curfew set in place to stop other homicides are all examples of how trusting small towns can be. With all the homes secluded away in the wilderness and far from one another, no one could hear you scream for help, it made for the ideal town to commit a crime and get away with it. When Sidney learnt about the deaths of her classmates and that the killer was still unidentified, she should have contacted her father to come home right away. Sidney's mother had been brutally raped and killed in their home just a year prior, which, in my opinion, should have made her more wary. In spite of being on the verge of being attacked, she went against better judgment and attended a party, a great tactic for a killer to blend in not realizing the trap that was set in place which will end with a catastrophe at the hands of someone she love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Screeeeeeeaaaaaammmmmmm,"""Scream"" is completely entertaining and totally terrifying. In a time when horror was losing its touch, Kevin Williamson wrote this clever script and Wes Craven brought it to life beautifully, reinventing the modern slasher and still remaining better than most of the films that followed it.Neve Campbell is Sydney Prescott, a shy girl who's life is turned upside down when somebody begins murdering her friends. In comes Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and a hilarious reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, the best character in the film) to investigate the murders and stay alive.The movie is funny and scary, with homages to famous older horror classics the entire way through, and the climax is excellently tense.

Neither scary nor funny,"First of all, I should say up-front that I'm not a horror movie fan. Horror movies have never appealed to me much, and I find most of them rather boring.  There are a few horror movies which I do think are excellent, for instance Poltergeist, The Exorcist, and Silence of the Lambs.  In general, however, the appeal of the horror genre is a puzzle to me.With this in mind, I rented Scream with an open mind.  I knew nothing about the movie itself, except that it had gathered good reviews.  I wanted to be scared and entertained.  As it turned out, neither wish came true.Scream is a movie ABOUT movies and the people who watch them. Specifically, Scream is a movie about horror movies and the people who watch horror movies.  I didn't know this beforehand, although it became clear soon itself.  A killer is on the loose, and Neve Campbell appears to be the primary target.  Of course, this isn't what the movie is all about.  The plot is merely a vehicle for the main characters, who all seem to be extremely knowledgeable horror movie fans.  Throughout the film, they endlessly discuss and remark about horror movies, making references to famous films and well-known devices in the horror genre.The satire didn't work for me.  I'm sure this has something to do with the fact I'm not a horror fan.  Or perhaps the satire worked too well.  Within minutes of the first scene, I was certain I was watching a ""movie within a movie"".  When the credits never rolled and the lights never rose on a sea of teenage moviegoers, I realized this was satire.  I sulked and hoped for the best.Unfortunately, even the humor which I understood well seemed heavy-handed and spoon-fed.  Then again, some of the cliches and devices of the horror genre are so glaringly obvious that it might be difficult to satirize them at all, without appearing heavy-handed in the process.The main characters painstakingly point out all the ""mistakes"" which the characters in horror movies typically make.  Then, they go on and make the same mistakes themselves.  I suppose this is in keeping in line with the rest of the satire, but it doesn't make for a very entertaining story. When Neve Campbell undresses for her boyfriend, she fails to reveal her top to the camera, and this exception only serves to highlight the rule of how closely the main characters mimic the characters they see.  After all, as is pointed out, ""there's always a *** shot"".Many people describe this as a ""scary"" movie.  To be honest, I've been more frightened at the thought of an upcoming topology midterm than I was frightened by this movie.  It was anything but scary.  In order for a movie to be scary, anticipation must be built up.  As Hitchcock said, (modulo a slight paraphrase), ""Terror is achieved by anticipation of the event, NOT the event itself.""  Scream is all event and no anticipation.  There's nothing scary about watching teenagers get chased around and hacked to bits.This is just my opinion, of course.  You should take into account my lack of interest and knowledge in the horror genre in general.  If you're a great horror fan, and you know a lot about horror movies, you may very well like this movie.  Myself, I'm not a horror fan, and I found it quite boring and tedious.  If you're interested in a movie ABOUT the movies, I would recommend The Player, which was far more clever.  If you're interested in being scared out of your wits, watch the original Dutch version of The Vanishing.  Now THAT'S a scary movie.-- 4 out of 10 stars",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Movies I've seen double-digit number of times, know virtually every line, highly quotable, etcetera. I wish I could give an unbiased, fresh review after seeing it my first or even second time.

Just a fun flick, horror for lack of a better word, a movie that kind of makes fun of itself in many ways, while still offering a serious narrative and original characters. References, in dialogue, to other horror movies is common and tactful, if not comical. The suspense is there, too, although in hindsight it seems quite obvious who the guilty party is. Given how many times I've seen it, that's not unusual. Another note of praise is the soundtrack; on point throughout, and not just the songs selected, but the little notes and sounds that would become signatures for the series. I won't bother naming names of people who I liked most, or who gave great performances, because everyone was up there.

A Cut Above the Rest,"I've seen SCREAM many times over the years, but I'm now realizing for the first time just how amazing, clever, and tightly-plotted the third act is. The way screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven handles the various characters and where they're located with respect to each other while all hell breaks loose is like seeing a magical balancing act that could crash and burn at any time. After all, it's hard for anyone to die in a slasher if everyone sticks together in a big group, and it seems like having the third act take place at a big party is setting up the film for failure. But Williamson and Craven somehow finds reasonable avenues to break the characters away from each other instead of having them split up that's typical of these movies. Overall, it's easy to hate on SCREAM while watching it in today's climate, but the film is handled with a lot of class, intellect, and reverence that's still absent in many of today's horror flicks.

I liked them that much.I also watched every movie I could find inspired by scream because I loved this movie so much, highly recommended. If you remember the 90's and haven't seen this movie, you are in for a treat, don't watch any more reviews just go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic meta,"This is a horror film in a small town where a girl and her friends seem to think about the ""rules"" of horror movies and find themselves living a real-life horror film. How brilliant. I was late to this one, cant get enough. Drew Barrymore changed the game.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Only your average slasher movie.,"I saw Scream only because I had to analyse it for an essay. I had avoided it up 'till then because I had thought it would be just your average slasher movie. I was wrong. It was a failed attempt to parody a slasher movie.Firstly, it didn't frighten me at all. Maybe it's not my kind of horror, but I still jumped in Halloween. There was just no atmosphere in the film, and the attempts at parodying the genre only served to lessen the impact of the film. Not that the jokes were all that funny, unless you were actually paying attention to any of it.The whole motive thing was a severe let-down. I ended up having to ask my friends why they did it because I thought I missed it in all the talking. When they told me I thought 'Wasn't that just an excuse to go around killing some teenagers with no real plot in mind?'I never rate a film awful because they all have something to offer, and Scream does. There are some good moments in it and some smart directing in it, yet its best attribute is probably giving Scary Movie something to make fun out of.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fantastic!,"Amazing movie for October/Halloween. I love this movie and its sequels. I havent seen the remakes yet cause I dont think anything can be as good as the OG Scream. For a lot of the actors and actresses, I imagine it was their first acting job, but they certainly made the best out of it. Ghostface has gone down as my favorite movie villain. Definitely up there with Freddy Kreuger in my opinoin. If you havent seen these movies, I highly highly recommend them. They have a message of dont answer the door for nobody you dont know and dont answer the phone for nobody you dont know. That's what I got anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cool movie!,"I love this movie!!!! The plot is so good, and it almost scared me to death! luckily I watched it with my friend!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Horror Movie That Brought The Genre Back!,"This is the movie that brought the horror genre back. Its the grandaddy of horror for the 90's and it still is worth watching for a good scare. The story will keep you guessing and the scary bits will make you jump. Original, scary, funny and a milestone for the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
obviously overrated,"It's true, this film did set a new standard: a low standard easily to be met by annoying follow-ups. Films which strongly deal with other films or mix several (film-)reality levels (""a film in a film"", or worse: a drama about a film) reflect one thing: inability to pick up new ideas from the outside. It's a pity that such a worn out recipe dupes so many people.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A classic one of the best horror movies ever,"I grew up watching the scream movies so for me it's my childhood and a part of me growing up. Scream for me into the horror genre. The film is perfect in every way there's great scares, comedy and it has a good storyline. The acting is top notch. It's the best slasher type horror Movie and is one of mine top 5 horror films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
