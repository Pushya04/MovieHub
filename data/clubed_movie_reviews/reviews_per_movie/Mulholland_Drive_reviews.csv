Sheer brilliance... but,"I feel it's hypocritical to call a movie a ""masterpiece"" (which this is), while at the same time slapping it a bit for the very essence of what it is and tries to achieve... but that's what keeps this from being a ""10"" for me. Because, after watching and then exhaustingly reading about the film (and understanding more about it that way), it's pretty obvious that many/most people won't ""get it"" fully the first time... and that detracts a little... even though the complexities are what ultimately makes it great. Does that make sense?It's a Catch-22. You can't KNOW about it before you start... that would ruin the presentation... and yet there's a very legit chance you won't fully understand it either if you go in cold. It needs either a 2nd viewing, or the post-movie research to understand (if you're willing to do that, and even if you DO, you're going to want to watch it again anyway). All the clues are there and it all makes sense, once you know. But it is so intentionally deceptive, it's hard to know what you don't know.But it's brilliant, artistic, evocative, and clever. It slaps hard at Hollywood and the dream machine, and the disillusionment of aspiration. There is quite simply nothing like it. It has been called ""the best film of the 21st Century,"" and I won't dispute that. But it IS hard to follow and understand and demands more of the viewer than almost any film I've ever seen. So I'd say watch it, draw your own conclusions, read about it, hear what others think and believe... and then watch it again. You will be rewardedBut there is no denying that it is absolute brilliance, and David Lynch's crowning achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Possibly Lynch's best; brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed","Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, ""Mulholland Dr."" was rejected. The next year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. He did so - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made.The film really doesn't have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita's lost her memory. She has no clue who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a ""Gilda"" poster in the bathroom. So the two set out to discover who Rita really is.David Lynch has been known for making some weird movies, but this film is the definition of weird. It's bizarre, nightmarish, and absolute indescribable. It's like a dream captured on film. By the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you've been watching closely, it will make perfect sense. Having watched the movie and then read an article on the Internet pointing out things in the film, I now understand the movie completely.The acting is very good. Watts is terrific. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. And the directing - hah! David Lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was.Is this your type of film? Well, that depends. You should probably view more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You'll need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues Lynch has left throughout the movie. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true.""Mulholland Dr."" is a masterpiece. It's brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed. I love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is why this movie is brilliant... actually... never mind.,"10/10Recently, I read an excerpt from a book by Dennis Lim called ""David Lynch: The Man from Another Place."" In it, the author mentions how much Lynch despises interpretation of his work. He writes:""Writing about David Lynch, it can be hard not to hear his voice in your head, protesting the violence being done to his work. 'As soon as you put things in words, no one ever sees the film the same way,' he once told me. 'And that's what I hate, you know. Talking—it's real dangerous.' Not for nothing does ""Mulholland Drive,"" the Lynch movie that has invited the most fervent flurry of explication, end with a word of caution: 'Silencio.'""This reminded me that 11 years before this edit I had written this very review on IMDb, which contained an interpretation of the film's plot. I've decided to remove all of that. Whether or not you are satisfied with a particular interpretation of the plot should be irrelevant to your enjoyment of the film. I enjoyed it before I had that satisfying interpretation. And I'm hoping that I can clear it from my mind the next time I watch ""Mulholland Dr.""I will leave one thing from my original post. A quote by Peter Greenaway. ""I would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don't be a film maker. Because I believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren't primarily to do with narrative.""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

My First David Lynch Film,"Like the title said, this is my first David Lynch film. I do not know who David Lynch is, nor have I heard of his previous films. So maybe I am missing something by not seeing the others. I do hope that this is not the case. I was told to watch this my a close friend as she regarded it quite highly. This is not an easy movie to understand, so to be fair, I watched it three times, each time with a different mindset. The conclusion, unfortunately, is that this film is not one that should be hailed for being a ""piece of art"" or anything extraordinary. This film has some beautiful scenes, but that is about it.Many people have claimed that this film is art. Well, I must respectfully disagree with them on this regard. If all art is is putting pretty pictures together, then anyone can be an artist. True art goes much deeper. This is where Muholland Drive fails. During my second time of watching, I was told to ""think less and let it (the movie) flow"". This is quite impossible as whatever flow this movie tries to achieve is destroyed by its inconsistency.My final time I tried to pick up certain parts of the movie, and tried to make some sort of sense to it. However, it leaves 40% of the scenes unexplained. Is the director trying to lure people in by showing us eye candy and hoping the rest would flow as people get too caught up with their desperate attempts to scrounge up some meaning for it? I think it might be the case.Should you watch this movie? I don't know. It is a beautiful movie but that is it. Pure eye candy with no substance. I really wanted to try to find some meaning to this film, but it seems that it is the movie that is preventing me from doing so.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"love lynch, or hate lynch, admit he's a master","""twin peaks"" and ""blue velvet"" have always been two of my favourite pieces of film-making, and even though past films by lynch have been slightly disappointing for me they have always been worth watching a number of times.  to be pretentious, lynch can be like a good wine - he must be savoured and mulled over.  but in the end you must make up your own mind about what you have seen, for lynch never gives you the full answers.many people will walk out of ""mulholland drive"" possibly wanting to throttle themselves over the mind-bending visual jigsaw puzzle that has just unfolded before them.  but there is a twisted logic to this film, you just have to look for the clues. betty (naomi watts) arrives in hollywood, doe-eyed and in search of stardom.  she then finds an amnesiac in her bathroom who has escaped from an attempted murder on mulholland drive. together they try to uncover the secrets behind the amnesiac's life.  this all leads to a club called silencio, where a blue box will reveal all. and that is when the film throws everything out the window.  people we thought we knew are entirely different people altogether... is it a dream?  a reminiscence about life's previous escapades? you will either love this film or hate it.  david lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers.  but as his universe itself is always about extremes, it is fitting that his films provoke such reactions.It is best to look at this film thematically, rather than as a straight-forward narrative.  and appreciate the fact that lynch is a film-maker who will still let you draw your own conclusions.  he has had many imitators as of late, particularly in ""vanilla sky"", where a mind-bending film decides to give you all the answers in the last rushed five minutes, and you will probably forget about that film as soon as you walk out of the cinema. mulholland drive will haunt you.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
maddening surreal tale,"Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is a naive Canadian aspiring actress who arrives in L.A. to stay at her aunt Ruth's Hollywood home while she's away filming in Vancouver.

There's director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux). There's a hit man (Mark Pellegrino) who has a hit that keeps going wrong. Rita remembers the name Diane Selwyn and Betty joins her to find the dead woman.This film is maddening. David Lynch has created a confusing surreal tale.

"Surreal, intriguing and frustrating","I've been trying to wean myself off writing IMDB reviews. But felt I had to respond to the reviews for Mulholland Drive.""It's an art film and I got it! 10/10!""
""It's an art film and I didn't get it! 1/10!""I'm right in the middle.It's an art film. I got the bits that it is possible to get. I didn't get the bits it isn't possible to get. 5/10.The premise is about a car accident that leaves a woman (Laura Harring) with amnesia, who then finds a friend in an actress (the excellent Naomi Watts) who has just arrived in a Hollywood that is full of danger and mystery. But this narrative is only loosely followed.For nearly 2 hours Lynch leads us on a dreamlike journey through the women's search for truth, with plenty of detours via a film director under pressure (Justin Theroux) and strange, often horrifying characters lurking in the shadows.And then in the last half an hour the movie flips everything on its head and goes to a completely different place.And it's this final half hour that is the movie's undoing. It just doesn't tie in well enough with the first part of the film. Certainly you can see the connections, but they don't stand up to scrutiny. There are far too many loose ends. And justifying it by saying it's ""surreal art"" isn't a good enough excuse.The real masterpiece would have been a film that tied everything together. Mulholland Drive could have been a spectacular mystery thriller, but instead it hides behind it's artistry.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Where does it begin and end??,"Hitchcock would be proud of this movie.  Even when nothing happens, it is suspenseful.  Director David Lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there, but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse.Altogether surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible.  I am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things I missed and which may help me understand it better.  It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together, so you must be patient and pay attention.  Get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts.  And yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques.The dual roles of the main actress, Naomi Watts, showcase her enormous talent.  That is, when I could get my eyes off of her co-star.  What an acting pair.Lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, the length/timing of editing cuts, jumping back and forth between scenes. Combined with smart use of music and sounds, it all helps to build suspense in our minds, doubtless a major objective of the director.  Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even had me talking to the actors to be careful here, and not be so naive there.  You know, the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mulholland Drive? That's where I was going!,"The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivaled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here.'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be unfinished work. In the internet I came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. Is it because it wants to destroy his toy? Does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it.David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible.When you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than Lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifest David Lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's world of films. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleeper  it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides, the film is a pay-off with Hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinctness was hardly dared before.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Strange-But-Fascinating Film From That Strange Director,"Wow, what a strange film. It's a David Lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird.I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can't be done. After some research following my second viewing of this film, I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. So, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts' character.At any rate, I find the film fascinating. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch's ""Blue Velvet."" There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In all, it's very well scored.Like Lynch's ""Twin Peaks"" television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since Lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out TV series. When that didn't happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. That may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.Both Watts and the other leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. Looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.I enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. It's not just a curiosity piece; it's a very intriguing movie.....just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""I had a dream about this place.""","Mulholland Drive ( David Lynch, 2001), one of the most ambiguous films to be unleashed upon contemporary audiences, dare one say ""abstract"" even. In an era where simplicity is preferred over mystery and intrigue, the average audience member may find such a film angering in all respects. It resembles the classic noir genre, in so much that the infamous street Sunset Boulevard even appears in the movie as an ominous homage to the Billy Wilder film of the same name. Like that 1950 film, this movie's themes and tone is dark, but nowhere near as formulaic, per say. Classic film noir still relied on a certain pattern of events and character niches; the femme fatale, the unsuspecting victim most often our male protagonist and of course the incorruptible detective figure. This narrative method follows the invisible style, making it generally easy to understand. Mulholland Drive breaks many of these rules without a second glance, clarity being at the very bottom of its intentions if at all. Director David Lynch sets this in motion in a number of ways.The music by Angelo Badalamenti electronic yet menacing, and creates a mood of a near horror-film like aura.One of the most startling traits of Mulholland Drive is its complete disregard for the traditional Hollywood narrative style. Clarity, it ignores in throughout the movie, as new characters and plot lines are constantly introduced, some not followed up on till much later. The unity is leaves one even more bewilderment. Over an hour into the movie one still has no real idea how all these characters are connected, and certain events and objects even mean. The characters themselves are left to the willful imagination of the audience, as the story progresses it giving off the feeling of a mystery combined with pressing psychological puzzles. The goals of the many characters are very obscure, and the threatening world around them is even more mysterious. As for the style of the story telling, many of the house hold techniques are used: such as the foreshadowing when the ominous stranger, Louise Bonner, warns Naomi Watts of impending ""danger"". Closure is practically rhetorical in the film and in the same sense as Donnie Darko (Richard Kelly, 2001) most is left to the viewers to discern.In the same fashion as Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950), one of the focal points of the film appears to be the decadence of Hollywood. The overhead shots of the city are accompanied by surreal, nightmare like music. The top brass of the industry appear inhuman, pompous and over all intimidating. Note the low angle shot of the apparent executive Mr. Roque. We rarely seem, and when we do no other figure is allowed to be in his presence apparently. The portrayal of Hollywood has many homages to the way it was portrayed by Wilder; with the apartments being dirty looking with their drab browns and dirty to look everything. In the daylight scenes, where it can be hard to use low-key lighting without delving into the extreme-gloomy Tim Burton trademark, the cinematographer Peter Deming uses this filthy look to the setting to establish the dark mood. Another particularly hard-hitting aspect would be the loss of innocence. As Naomi Watts rehearses her role with ""Rita"" (Laura Harring), she delivers the dialogue in an overly-loud cliché manner, but in the rehearsal with the studio heads, she becomes a whole another person it seems. The medium shot of the first rehearsal is replaced in the second one with a sensuous medium close-up, and the excellence of her acting there is fueled by pure unrestrained sexuality. Compared to her naïve depiction up until this scene, one would struggle to connect the two scenes.This is just a small taste of the complex mystery world Lynch sets up in his cryptic film. Lighting, setting and the way the characters act still are saying something, but the way the plot moves makes it a struggling endeavor to understand. In all its zaniness, one important theme to grasp is the freedom of artistic tactics in film making. From the dawn of Hollywood to this day the general consensus is that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation. There is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. The way the film is edited, credit to Mary Sweeney, plays an undeniable role in the film's perplexing beauty and terror to an extent.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Film that Begs for Multiple Viewings,"On my fourth viewing I finally felt like I got it - but still I have questions that I know will remain unanswered. Even without understanding anything the first couple of times, I was still enthralled with the artistry and the depth of the characters that Lynch evokes - even characters with only a line or two are striking.It was only after reading some User Reviews that I started to understand the ""plot"" - as simple as it is. I'm willing to look past some of Lynch's mannerisms - the mysterious man on the phone in the big empty room, for example - images and scenes that Lynch uses in several films I get it - he's the power pulling the strings.Or the obligatory theater singing scene. As much as I love Lynch's use of songs - my favorite being the studio scene with the group singing ""16 Reasons"". That scene alone is worth the price of admission.On my fourth viewing I began picking up on the ultra-subtle clues that signal ""flashback"" - lime telling you the first 2/3 of the film is a flashback - did not see that coming.Still, I have questions. If the first 2/3 is a dream- is all of it a dream? Especially in scenes where Dianne Selwyn/Betty is not in the scene - like the two lowlifes and the comedic bungled shooting/fat lady scenes. Or the parking lot with the hit man and the prostitute. Was that a dream? Or is it narrative background to set up the actual events to later unfold? And what about The Cowboy? In the end It doesn't matter. Dreams don't have to be connected to anything.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Defiantly not the masterpiece I had been lead to believe.,"Of course we scratch our heads in bafflement at what exactly Mulholland Drive all means, is it parodying the life of Marilyn Monroe or some other tragic actress? Is this a Mobius strip phantasm reflecting parallel dimensions, a rumination on fantasy and broken dreams? And what of the highly unpredictable ending and how much does it represent the protagonist's upbringing or her taking part in a jitterbug contest (???!!). And yes, all these points are all very well, but ultimately despite my admiration that the film has motivated viewers imaginations I am still left with how it has made an impression on me. It's not like I'm a film goer who equates the necessity to 'enjoy' a film in the sense that it should be a fun ride like in a fairground, but I do have a fairly important stipulation that a piece of art should have power. And Ultimately I wasn't completely won over by Mulholland Drive, I felt emotionally disconnected from its fetishism of Hollywood and quite bored with the purposefully ambiguous dialogue/plot. That it should transcend such barriers of quality control just because it's considered great art seems a ludicrous approach to film criticism, and thus I can only conclude that I didn't get Mulholland drive, not for the purposes of it being a surreal, satirical or even its confusing narrative but simply because I thought while it was at times interesting film it was defiantly not the masterpiece I had been lead to believe.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Drive You Mad,"I sat up, I stayed awake and really tried to stay with this highly regarded David Lynch film but in the end, I guess I failed the test. By then, I'd given up all hope that all of his interchanging characters and plot strands would come together and make some sort of sense. Well, maybe they did for some people but not for me.It starts off with a DePalma shock moment which is then promptly forgotten about as we witness the attempted murder of a glamorous, well-dressed woman who escapes her would-be assassins and takes refuge in a nicely-appointed apartment on Mulholland Drive in L. A. This turns out to be the accommodation of a fresh-faced young actress, whose aunt has let her use the place while the girl tries out for parts. It looks like her luck will be in as we sit in on a casting session where she is being forcibly promoted by the stony-faced representatives of a mysterious man in a wheelchair, much to the chagrin of the film's director whose day goes from bad to worse when he goes home, he thinks, to his loving wife and later encounters a weirdly menacing cowboy.Meanwhile the actress and her new lodger connect in more ways than one and try to find out the reason for the woman's attempted murder which leads them to the place of a missing woman named Diane Selwyn, who may hold the key to solving the mystery. Only she doesn't and as identities switch and motives change, many of the characters briefly glimpsed in disturbing scenes somewhere near the beginning return to complete the nightmarish confusion I guess was always the director's aim.Some films you just have to hold up your hands and admit defeat to. I remember in my younger days being taken so far down the road by Lynch's TV series ""Twin Peaks"" before similarly giving up the ghost before my head exploded. I'll let others try to make better sense of all that was going on in this one because frankly I couldn't.I'm afraid I've come to the conclusion that Lynchland just isn't a place for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Ultimate Rubik's Cube.,"""Mulholland Dr."" is something else. It is a film that will make you question your own sanity in many ways. Naomi Watts is the young, starry-eyed Canadian that wants to make it big in Hollywood. She is naive and thinks that dreams can come true if you want them bad enough. Watts discovers a very beautiful woman with amnesia (Laura Harring in a sizzling performance) in her aunt's house in L.A. and she becomes determined to help Harring out. Harring is mysterious and her near-fatal car crash occurred on the dark and winding Mulholland Dr. Throughout several oddball and very dark scenes take place. A young director (Justin Theroux) learns that Hollywood is run by strange underworld figures that are quiet, but ruthless. Another strange side-story is the mysterious man behind the diner that is seen in another character's dreams. An inept assassin also runs around causing unwanted trouble for himself and others. Then of course there are cameos by Robert Forster and Billy Ray Cyrus. The film twists into darkness as it progresses as Watts' and Harring's relationship turns sexual. A fine line between reality and fantasy is skewered and it comes down to a strange Pandora's box that holds the true secrets to ""Mulholland Dr."". Oscar-nominated director David Lynch also shows that not all you see and hear is real, even though one's mind might think so. The film seems artificial at times, showing Hollywood as a nice place where dreams can come true. But then the dreams are turned into vivid nightmares of what could possibly be the true reality. David Lynch somehow makes this whole thing work and he makes it work beautifully in this reviewer's opinion. The film is a trumped-up version of ""The Twilight Zone"" and it adds many techniques that made Alfred Hitchcock the true master of suspense. Many wonder what this film is truly about. I am not sure. I am not sure Lynch even knows, but I am going to give it a shot. ""Mulholland Dr."" is the dark side of the human condition. It is a film that shows how easy one can lose one's soul if bad elements are let in. There are figures that seem somewhat supernatural to me in this movie. It seems that many of the characters are ""messengers"" that are all after one thing: Naomi Watts' soul. Watts lets the elements in and in the end she cannot overcome them. What she thinks she wants seems attractive on the outside, but there are cobras on the inside that will be too strong to fight off. In short, ""Mulholland Dr."" is a brilliant piece of film-making and it is brilliant due to its unique aspects and the fact that it is what one thinks it is. There is no right or wrong answer and it is a film that makes you think. ""Mulholland Dr."" is a complicated puzzle for the minds of cinema fanatics. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Director used a few cheap thrill tricks to make the story confusing and the tricks worked.I am still trying to figure the climax and will probably have to see it again to catch things I missed and which may help me understand it better. It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together. Editing work was great, jumping back and forth between scenes was done properly. Combined with smart use of music and sounds, it all helps to build suspense in our minds.This movie demands alot of patience as you are seeing 2hr 30min dead serious drama. This is where main problem lies. Movie is so slow paced with dead serious plot and you might start getting frustrated and may loose patience.Overall, it is movie which everyone might not love watching. Some will love it, some will hate it. This movie demands audience which love dead serious crap.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lynch at his very best!,"We all love to have our minds toyed with but sitting through a David Lynch film is like having your brain removed entirely. This film is no different as it proves that Lynch (Next to Bunuel) is a master surealist film maker.The film sees a young girl known only as Rita trying to remember who she is. The whole ""girl with amnesia"" plot make a lot of sense until about 3/5 of the way through the film when something that can only be described as a Lynchian Pandora's Box is opened. We are then tormented with a demonic homeless man, a mysterious Spanish play house and shrunken people before it all finishes in very dramatic, surreal David Lynch fashion.This film is perfect. There is no other way to describe such a great piece of work. It is flawless because it is helmed by a man that knows everything about his craft and is not afraid to show it off. This sort of film has been sorely missed since his last outing, Lost Highway, in 1996. It's good to see Lynch at his old game and lets just hope in future that he produces more gems just like this.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mulholland Drive - Lynch's cinematic art - reality vs. fantasy,"Lynch loves to realistically portray logical sequences interspersed by fantasy diversions, which entrances but confuses the viewer. Blue Velvet is his best film, and works well because of its overall logical coherency spiced up by fantastic deviations from the norm (the fantasy element of the film). This technique reminds me of Fellini's 8 1/2, where fantasy was often interspersed with a logical and coherent plot.Mulholland Drive starts off logically but then gradually abandons logical coherence as dream-like (but realistically presented) sequences are brought into the plot. Then there is a shift in the plot, from the fantasy of the first part, to the reality of the second part where roles and identities are reversed and reality reigns.Lynch's genius is in his artistic slight of hand where he presents a fantasy scene realistically, sucking the viewer in to expecting a meaningful depiction, then upending these expectations in shocking the viewer with the fantastic elements of the scene. I can imagine Lynch laughing in the background as he plays his joke on the viewer.The film Holy Motors presents pure fantasy in nonsensical and unrelated sequences, and is bad art. Mulholland Drive has enough organization and structure, with more skillfully accomplished fantasy, to qualify it as good art.Naomi Watts gives us an outstanding performance - better than the typical ""Best Actress"" Oscar award winner's performance in the last 20 years. Watts usually gets roles that don't allow her to display her considerable acting skills, but this role does, and she more than meets the challenge.The plot is secondary for Lynch since cinematic art is his focus. However, the movie is totally baffling unless you have some guidelines. Basically Mulholland drive is the story of a young girl who comes to Hollywood with high hopes of becoming an actress. The film is told in two parts. My interpretation is that the first (Watts as Betty) part is psychotic delusions of the young girl as she reconstructs her past leading up to the promise of a brilliant acting career. This is presented as reality and the viewer has no idea it is false. The shift to the second (Watts as Diane) part shows some shifting of roles, and depicts the true story whereby the young girl fails to become an major actress. Her identity is valid, as Diane, in the second part showing her dismal failure, while Rita of the first delusional part becomes Camilla in the second reality part.Naomi Watts thus plays two roles with different identities, in part one and in part two. The two parts are cued by the change in her name from the delusional Betty (part I) to the real Diane (part II). In a clever signal of this personality change, the waitress at Winkie's is named Diane when Betty and Rita go to eat there in the first fantasy part, while this same waitress becomes Betty when Watts as Diane goes to Winkie's in the real second part.The plot shift from fantasy to reality mirrors the high hopes and aspirations as fantasy (Part I as Betty) and dismal failure as reality (Part II as Diane), that happens so often as young would-be performers seek fame in Hollywood but end up as failures.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"No one knows what this movie is about, and we all know that we will not find out","Despite everyone around me talking about it, this was the last David Lynch movie I watched.I remember being scared to start it because I had already fallen in love with David Lynch by that point, and, of course, I was afraid of being disappointed with this work of his.Years have passed, and I still haven't watched this. But one day, I said to myself: 'Hey, you have to look fear in the eyes.' And I did.It started with a scene of dancing pairs, and then transitioned to a truly stunning depiction of a car driving through a nighttime road. I believe this imagery holds a special significance for David Lynch. Since then and until the end, this story didn't set me free.Due to its setting in the filmmaking industry and the bright city of California, it made me fully immerse myself in this mysterious investigation. And the work of the entire film crew helped me with that.So, I believe that even if you are not a fan of David Lynch or surrealistic movies at all, this film has the potential to evoke myriad emotions and ideas in you.Definitely a masterpiece that I recommend watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Requires a flexible imagination and most likely a cheat sheet,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" is like one of those video games that the programmers make so amazing yet so impossibly difficult that in order to be fully satisfied you're forced to buy one of those walkthrough game guides. The film might be a masterpiece, but it's a Rubix cube of surrealism that prefers to leave you with more questions than answers.Psychological thriller barely begins describing ""Mulholland Dr."" Most notably, Lynch has no lack of ability to create suspense. Despite being a total mindfudge (implication of more explicit language necessary), the film is completely gripping and will not lose any viewer for a second. You could argue the beginning is not very deliberate, but to understand the film everything is essential.On Mulholland Dr. a woman (Laura Elena Harring) survives a fatal car accident but is left with amnesia, wandering her way to an apartment of a woman heading out of town who happens to be the aunt of Betty (Naomi Watts) a starry-eyed aspiring actress who has come to stay in LA while her aunt is gone. Together, the two try and find some answers as to the woman's identity. Meanwhile, a Hollywood director (Justin Theroux) is without his lead actress and being pressured by mobsters to select a particular one.But plot is a side dish in this movie. As hard as it is to do, the way it's best enjoyed (and I wish I'd known this pre-hindsight) is to take in the visuals and emotions and tame that instinctive plot detective inside all of us. The beauty of Lynch's work is best understood by what the events and images of the film suggest. Don't view them as tangible proof of factual happenings in the film, but as manifestations.Put on those lenses and Lynch's work is easier to appreciate. The slow movement through the sets, the symbolism, the bizarre but intriguing transitions and the way the film's score works flawlessly to direct your every thought and inclination -- it's all there if you can manage to let go of the plot when necessary.It's hard to analyze the film any deeper without exposing the cheat sheet -- even if you'll probably need to look at it anyway. Lynch has even listed a number of things to pay attention to to help understand his film -- you can look those up on IMDb or anywhere before watching and it could help.Does the fixation on surrealism hurt ""Mulholland Dr,"" not necessarily, but the best films don't require hints or cheat sheets to love and in order to love ""Mulholland Dr.,"" you have to know what's going on and that's a lot for the vast majority of movie watchers to handle. Appreciation for Lynch's skill is easy to develop, but it would be best if it were simultaneous with digesting the story.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
entiendes? ¡No!,"A lot of people say that 'Rosebud' is the greatest mystery from Hollywood, but actually I think that Mulholland Drive is. I've never experienced anything quite like it. Its plot is slow-moving and sometimes feels unconnected to anything, yet it's too engrossing to look away. Mulholland Drive is one of the most intriguing films I've ever had the pleasure to watch and it's one that demands viewing multiple times. It's that type of film where you think that everything will be explained to you at the end (like The Skin I Live In) however, being a David Lynch film, this doesn't happen and the film is all the better for it.Once the film had finished I hadn't a clue what I'd just watched, yet I couldn't wait to get onto that wonderful thing called Google and find the answers! The ten clues in the DVD also did not help one bit! It forces you to analyse everything and makes you realise what an astonishingly clever many David Lynch is. Every scene has a purpose, it just requires strong thought which is why a lot of people would instantly disregard this film as meaningless rubbish. However, if you dig deeper you may find yourself in awe at one of the most intricate plots ever established.I loved the whole metaphor for the Hollywood dream being a lie. Words can't describe how clever this film is. Any film that has a whole website dedicated to a whole range of crack-pot explanations is surely a masterpiece, and I truly believe that Mulholland Drive is. It stops becoming a film and turns into art. An extremely interesting and involving art-piece that I found myself being sucked into. The mystery is just captivating, with various scenes that seem like they've just been shoved in like the hit-man scene (which is hilarious) yet you can't stop watching it! It's very difficult to put into words.Reading various explanations only makes me appreciate this film more, and the amount of thought and care that has gone into it. Naomi Watts puts on a brilliant performance and I found myself completely captivated by her story. There are scenes that seem to go on for such a long time, such as the remarkable audition scene, however it's scenes like this which give Mulholland Drive such a dream-like atmosphere and pulls you into the story even deeper. The club Silencio goes on for an awful long time, yet I wasn't bored, just astonished at the film's atmosphere. There's something about it.Of course the film is fabulously directed and I can see myself becoming more of a fan of David Lynch now that I've seen the brilliant Elephant Man and the good but flawed Wild at Heart. He's certainly very unique and this film is unlike any other I've seen before. It's a film that will make you perplexed but also gripped. At a hefty two and a half hours long I was never bored and just wanted to see it all again! Mulholland Drive really is a masterpiece that will get your mind boggling like a boggle champ. It's incredibly haunting with bizarre imagery that is sure to always find a place wedged in your mind. It's one of those films that stays with you, and you don't really want it to leave either.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lynch is one twisted dude....,"To be honest, I didn't enjoy Mulholland Drive. It was kinda like...studying...to me....I mean some of it was enjoyable...but i had to crease my forehead and think hard toooo much to find it thrilling to watch. I found my self scratching my head till it hurt and repeating ""OK, that's weird"", a large number of times. The plot went totally mad towards the end...at first you feel you're with the flow of the story but then you just lose it. And it led me to believe that no sane person understood it completely the first time round. Lynch is messing with our heads...The reason I gave it a 7/10 though is simple: because it's goddam clever. The first thing I done after I watched it was read the complete narrative and narration of the movie. And finally then things started to make sense and the things I thought totally irrelevant were actually totally significant and actually quite clever.So, if I ever get down to it, I'll give it a go for the second time and I just might enjoy it.

One of David Lynch's best and one of the best of the decade- not for all tastes though,"I found Mulholldand Drive to be a fantastic film, having loved all of David Lynch's films seen personally so far (personal favourite being The Elephant Man, one of the most emotionally affecting films ever made) with the exception of Dune. For this viewer, Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best films and among the best films of the 2000s, but it is also one of Lynch's most love-it-or-hate-it films- from a love/hate him director- as seen in the reviews here. And it is very understandable why people would dislike it, it is weird (not unusual for Lynch), it is slow, the story mayn't be clear to some, the symbolism may go over people's heads and it does get confusing especially towards the end. And it has nothing to do with not getting it, it is just not for everybody's tastes and not everybody is going to connect with it. For those who love it neither of these are problems, admittedly it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style beforehand so that it doesn't come across as too much of a shock and also to watch it more than once. Justifying what was so great about Mulholland Drive, a good place to start would be the visuals, which are never less than scintillating with bold colours, symbolic imagery and some of the most striking cinematography of any film from this decade. The Silencio Club scene is so beautifully shot. The haunting retro score, thought-provoking dialogue and that it contains some of Lynch's finest direction and the best directing of all the films from 2001 are further things to like. The story is where those who dislike it are perplexed, granted there may be too many plot strands crammed in towards the end and not everybody's going to like how the ending is open to interpretation, but with me the thriller-drama story was gripping and I was captivated so much by the surrealist atmosphere, offbeat emotional intensity and sizzling suspense that the slow pacing didn't feel slow at all. It wisely focused on the relationship between Watts and Harring, and while bizarre it was very well handled. The cast carry the film brilliantly, especially with the sensational lead performance of Naomi Watts who has never been better than here. Laura Harring is enchanting and Justin Theroux is very good. In conclusion, while not for everybody's tastes for understandable (and quite obvious) reasons Mulholland Drive was fantastic in all areas. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So much more than a movie,"David Lynch has a saying. ""I don't like telling movies. Let the audience make up what they see"". After my 3rd watch, MD is the best movie made the last 20 years. It's funny, if you google it, smartasses want to appear more smart ""deducting"" everything and telling YOU what the movie is about. Ignore that. It's not important. MD is above all else an experience, and a tragic reality captured in fantasy about how Hollywood treat a young starlet. The audition with then unknown Naomi Watts, who gets groped by a far older ""male star"" says more about Hollywood after Cosby and Weinstein. Laura Harring brings that timeleas bombshell, who lookes like the 50s Rita Haywarth, Audrey Hepburn, Liz Taylor. Beneath it all, the movie is about tragedy, revenge and crushed dreams. My favorite Lynch movie, and the score is every bit as fantastic as Angelos job on Twin Peaks. Nothing more to say than Silencio.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

My favourite film,"How to do this work of art justice in a review... it would almost seem abhorrent to try to do so... it's an experience to be experienced. And then experienced again and again. You don't just watch this film. You go to a corral at night to meet a mysterious cowboy. You watch a wrinkled hand pick at a bowl of walnuts while the person it's attached to pretends to care. You ride a limousine up that very old, dark road towards some esoteric meaning. You go towards the back of Winkies towards some hidden monster... and you are that monster. This film took me to places I could never imagine and left an indelible imprint on my mind. To understand Mulholland Drive is, perhaps, to understand oneself.Every nuance of this film is perfect. Every frame both repels and pulls one closer. Everything makes me feel something. Terrifying top-down cityscapes shot at hellish angles and bleary eyed cameras heading out of their homes in the middle of the night and into frantic, rushing streets towards hidden secrets. The deep dark truths behind everyone's eyes and all their words. This film is a true gaze into the abyss.The story at first appears straightforward but it's frequently intercut with non sequitor scenes that appear at first to make no sense. And the tone of Betty's scenes especially seem overlit and fakely overdubbed, but this is on purpose. The perfect way to set up what's to come. A classic story of a doe-eyed blonde arriving at what she thinks is her city of dreams. But almost immediately something creepy happens. Of all things, it's two characters smiling happily.She meets an amnesiac brunette and they investigate a mystery. She practices for an audition. Two detectives seem to be preparing to try to find the brunette. A director fights mafia bosses for a casting choice in his film. A hitman kills a man for a black book and things go horribly awry. It's gaudy and goofy. It's gorgeous and horrible. Erotic and necrotic. Utterly surreal. The acting is cheesy and then it's phenomenal. But something more is wrong. Terror lurks under the surface of even the most mundane scenes.A woman comes to Betty's door. Betty introduces herself... but the woman says that she is not Betty. Something is wrong and something bad is happening. A woman is in trouble...Betty goes to her audition which is to be quite honest one of my favourite scenes in any film ever. It's so good I don't even want to talk about it but I wanted to mention it.And then it becomes absolutely terrifying. It has probably 6 scenes in it that I would nominate for the scariest scenes ever filmed. It makes absolutely no sense, and then everything makes sense. It's like peering directly into someone's mind. The moment when you realize what it all means is like a mind-shattering epiphany. This is so far beyond anything I've witnessed in all of cinema.David Lynch has created a work that skewers the history of Hollywood, celebrates the history of film, creates an insanely intricate dreamscape that is nearly impenetrable, delivers a stark warning for people who want to be movie stars, completely subverts all expectations and has some of the best acting I've ever seen. But this film is all Lynch. Cinematography, lighting, editing, sound design, music, set design, are maybe the best I've ever witnessed.Every scene is written and directed brilliantly. If I had to pick one favourite it would probably be the Club Silencio scene. It's everything. So much emotion from the actors and the singer that it brings emotion out of me, even when I can only sort of grasp why they or I am feeling that way. That's magic. It's an absolute catharsis before the bottom truly drops out from under the film.The last act is wild and bone-chillingly haunting. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring are jaw dropping. The transformations... the role reversals... the fantasy and the reality... a central character casually walks out of view of the camera never to be seen again... it's stunning, poignant, tragic and just about everything else I can think of.What else can I say? It's the greatest.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Decides to use her last moneys on drugs, a hit on her jilted lover and a gun.Her overwhelming failure to realise her Hollywood dream and guilt over murdering her ex lover and fear of lifetime prison sentence drives her to suicide...The end...Why so much unnecessary confusion had to be introduced in this movie, I dont know.

I'm not saying that everything is too confusing for your basic movie goer to grasp, but that there's just too much happening all at the end, like everyone had a long tug of war during the entire production, and the writers won and it came through in a jumbled finale.

Lynch's Masterpiece,"This is maybe not my favorite Lynch film, but I feel it is his masterpiece. All the threads he has been working on for years finally come together in one story. I prefer Inland Empire because of its truly dreamlike ambiance, but this film never ceases to intrigue me. The acting is excellent, esp Watts. The editing and cinematography are superb, the music sublime. It is shameful that the film only received one Oscar nod for Lynch (though he deserved it). It could easily and should have been nominated for film (as it was here in France), for music, for editing, for cinematography. Instead, we got typical John Williams type of music, a feel-good film, etc, as winners. I think Lynch perfected the language of cinematic-dream language in Inland Empire, but this one comes close. Kept my friends wondering for days what was really going on through the whole film. You can't ask anymore of a film: if it makes you think, you remember it, even if you hate it.

Throughout, we are teased with mysterious side scenarios that suggest there's more than meets the eye - a dream figure behind a diner, an incompetent hitman and a supernatural cowboy. Then the blue key is turned and the film's true nature is unlocked - sheer surreal chaos where identities and stories are in flux. I don't really get it all, but I suspect its not supposed to be gotten, just experienced for what it is. In some ways, the bait-and-switch feels like we are being cheated out of a traditional narrative, but in other ways, the characters and scenes were symbols of a hostile Hollywood dream all along.

The second part is the reality: Betty/Diane has a sad life: she is just an extra in Hollywood and her lover rejects her. For revenge, she hired a killer.3) The land of illusion! Lynch portrays a great vision of Hollywood, the two-sided city: a mythic place made up with dreams and artistic faith but where finally corporations and sex govern: in fact, it's a mirage!4) City slickers: It's good to have Lynch visit a great urban town and leaves country and rural town for a while. I don't like very much LA but Lynch finds great spots (the hills, the palm trees, Dinkies) to glamor it.5) Even better than the real thing: What I like with Lynch is that the fantastic, dream world seems normal and warm whereas the everyday life seems surreal and painful.6) the eye of the tiger: as the best painter or photographer, he pays attention to the sets, props and cinematography and always delivers stunning framed visions: the phones, the ranch, ....7) Who's who: His cast is always excellent: the newcomers to me, Watts, Harring Theroux were refreshing.8) There's always music in the air: Badalamenti is a genius to always catch some heart-ripping melodies (and he's also a funny extra) albeit this isn't his best score for Lynch.9) Elementary my dear Watson: The clues Lynch gave were a good idea to make the film interactive and this way is far better than 3D.10) Sappho is crying: I am nevertheless disappointed with the love story because its lesbianism seems here a mere toy, a gadget to appeal to the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You might be caught off guard by the true nature of the underlying mystery, and the denouement will keep you mesmerized for sure, making a re-watch essential, yet rewarding experience. As often with an eccentric filmmaker's work, this is a movie to only get going in your head once it's already over, and if you're willing to get immersed in it.Lynch's masterpiece invites to dig deeper, to uncover new layers, hidden references, multiple interpretations. The film is as psychologically profound as it is visually stunning and while it draws its fascination from what appears surreal at first glance, it is nevertheless firmly embedded in a reality that won't let us go, blood-curdling as it might turn out, a reality full of hopes, dreams, obsessions, fear, you name it. ""Mulholland Drive"" is packed with great imagery, dark humor, wonderful music and bizarre twists and turns and stars Naomi Watts in her most brilliant role. It's a blessing indeed that Mulholland Dr. as a TV series as Lynch original envisioned and pitched it, didn't happen and he had to rethink his ideas for a year - because that was when lightning struck. Pure movie magic. This one's a keeper.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Should have been better,"This movie was very interesting, but I kept waiting for it to go somewhere and it never did. The last part of the movie that should have wrapped things up just made things more confusing. I was disappointed. It had some unique elements that could have led to a great ending, but instead just got weird without any good explanation. I cannot recommend this movie, unless you just want to see a movie showing off Lynch's trademark style. The problem is this one just builds your expectations and never delivers.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mulholland Drivel.,"I would love to write an intelligent, detailed analysis of Mulholland Drive, I really would, but since I haven't got the slightest idea of director David Lynch's intent (other than to completely confound the viewer), I'm going to have to pass. Instead, let me tell you how my week has been so farMonday: Work as usual. Was involved in an RTA on the way home (not my fault—an old lady drove into the side of my car). Rang insurance company. Started to watch Mulholland Drive—fell asleep not long after.Tuesday: Dog ate a packet of ibuprofen and had to be rushed to the vets (no idea how he got them—suspect the cats were involved). Went to work. Came home. Visited the in-laws. Resumed watching Mulholland Drive—fell asleep not long after.Wednesday: After the two previous days, this one was fairly uneventful. Dog came home, hopefully without any lasting problems. Ended the day by watching a bit more of Mulholland Drive. Perked up for the lesbian sex scene between Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, but fell asleep soon after.Thursday: Car collected by body shop. Went to work in wife's car (being extra careful to avoid elderly drivers). Watched the rest of Mulholland Drive (managed to stay awake, largely in hope that Watts might indulge in some more sapphic shenanigans, but she doesn't).4/10 for the sexy scene, reduced to 1/10 for the self-indulgent, pretentious, and utterly pointless surreality of the whole thing, especially the opening dance number, the incomprehensible club scene in which a woman mimes a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's classic 'Crying' before fainting (???), the weird hobo with the strange box, and the bit where two miniature people crawl out of a handbag and sneak under a door.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dream cause reality is often much more painful,"I remember once seeing a behind the scene from Lynch filming Twin Peaks - The Return, where someone was reminding him about the runtime of the episode, which clearly was not long enough to fit in a scene he wanted to film. His answer was very clear - who the F cares about runtime?Lynch obviously doesn't. He is here to tell you a story, in his own way, as he sees it in his twisted mind. And he will do it even if it takes ages to do.For some people, the way he tells a story on screen will just be too confusing and long. In a decade where of instant information we expect to know everything immediately, people lack the patience needed to fully appreciate such a film. The fact that you have to watch mere 120 minutes of the boring part of the film before realizing how brilliant the story is, might just be too much for many. I know firsthand, as my less patient wife, not familiar with Lynch, threw the towel after some 90 minutes in. About 30 minutes later I was just - OMG, what am I just witnessing?The last 30 minutes just leave a very disturbed feeling in most of the people who watch the entire movie. They happen as a surprise, suddenly you try to forget the first part of the movie and realize that everything is different. And that is the reason people get so confused at the end.And then, you just sit as the credits roll and you try to figure out what was this all about.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best picture who have ever maid,"I cant explain what have i saw in the screen yesterday. It all was so beautiful, wonderful, and amazing. The main point that i love in that movie is not the story, but all the things behind it. The special what that David Lynch have made this film is just fantastic. The wonderful music, wonderful colors, wonderful effects, the actress was so good and the film was so amazing. The story is not the main point in here because you can never understand it. Its very hard to know what David lynch want us to think, but i love the movie so much that i don't even care. Before you watch this movie you should know how you are going to watch it. Don't you expect to see a normal movie because it doesn't. It is a movie that you should watch it like a dream. Don't look for an order or a normal plot because its not going to be like that. If you want to feel, to cry, to afraid, to fear, to be amazed and to be Doubtful, i think you should see that wonderful movie. if you don't- get away",,Anonymous,Mystery
"The desire for fame, the intensity of love","This is a work of such outstanding genius and of such subtle nuance and complexity, that a brief review cannot possibly do it justice. In this film, writer and director David Lynch restrains himself from being too gross and disgusting and manages to concentrate instead wholly on just telling this gut-wrenching tragic tale in its fullness, to the exclusion of his usual self-indulgent follies and distractions. (The many bizarre 'Lynch touches' found throughout this film are kept within bounds, so that they all work and are effective.) I have just seen the film for the fourth time, and it gets better every time, and definitely improves with (either its or one's own) age. There are many fans of this film, and there is a website I recommend, which is www.mulholland-drive.net/studies where many answers to enigmas in the film are to be found. For instance, the house at 6980 Mulholland Drive towards which 'Rita' is being driven in the limousine at the opening of the film is really at 6980 Macapa Drive, whereas 6980 Mulholland Drive is apparently an unoccupied spot directly below the Hollywood sign above Mulholland Drive, which is a long road which goes up towards the Santa Monica Hills and is an address of many famous movie stars past and present. The Hollywood sign on the hills features prominently in the film, and is of the essence of the tale. It is wonderful to see two old-timers and shameless scene-stealers in this film, namely Lee Grant and Ann Miller (it was her last film appearance, not long before she died). The moody and hauntingly effective music for the film is by Angelo Badalamenti, who has worked with Lynch on most of his films and on TWIN PEAKS. Badalamenti appears in the film as one of the two Mafia brothers who spits out his espresso coffee and keeps saying 'This is the girl.' (He does not speak in chords or octaves, however, but has a human voice.) The film is remarkable for the stunning, brilliant, and Oscar-worthy performances of the two leading players, Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring (her strange surname was originally Herring, which is a respectable English surname, and why she changed it I cannot imagine). Every frame of this film is totally mesmerizing. I do not know how Lynch manages to make every shot so full of mystery and menace, and although a lot of it is down to brilliant editing, the only real answer can lie in saying simply: 'That's a genius at work.' If only he were less unruly in some of his other films, or had somebody to restrain him from his excesses! Geniuses are naughty boys and need to be restrained by Nanny or they run out of control and make a botch of their work. But in this film, he kept down his wilder urges and just made the film work. The famous French producer Alain Sarde had the good sense to back this film, which was languishing unappreciated as a script in America and was misunderstood. It really is more of a European film, despite the intensity of its locale and its deep roots in that specific and uniquely American fantasy world of Hollywood. The film is dedicated at the end to Jennifer Symes (1979-2008), who was apparently an aspiring young actress similar to the character played by Naomi Watts in this film, though that is not information which I have verified, and is just from the internet. The beginning of the film shows Naomi Watts ('Betsy') emerging all fresh-faced and breathless from Los Angeles Airport, an ecstatic expression of excitement and anticipation on her face at arriving in Hollywood, where she hopes to become a star but will settle for being just a famous actress. She takes a taxi to an apartment which belongs to her aunt, who has gone to work on a film on location so that Betsy can stay there for a while. The address given in the film is 1612 Havenhurst, but that does not exist, as Havenhurst ends at 1500. The real address of this truly extraordinary art-deco apartment is I1 Borghese, 450 Sycamore Avenue, for those who want to drop in for tea with the aunt. (Why not? Hollywood is where fantasy is reality, isn't it?) Watts and Harring are totally spellbinding in their performances and in their relationship with each other, which becomes very physical and just about as intense as they get, not to say obsessional. There are electrifying scenes with both Melissa George as Camilla Rhodes and Michele Hicks as Nicki Pelazza. Both of them do wonderful sixties songs, as auditions. And there is a spine-tingling and magnificent rendering of Roy Orbison's song 'Crying' in Spanish by Rebekah Del Rio which Lynch films in full. One of the endearing traits of the naughty little boy Lynch is his love of sixties music. It seems that a jitterbug contest in Canada was cut from the beginning of the film. 'Betsy' is supposed to have won it, so what a shame we did not get to see it. Possibly there was pressure from the producer about the length, as the film is two hours and 20 minutes long, and in some versions as long as two hours and 27 or variously 28 minutes (I suspect a minute of the sex scene may have been cut). I wonder if there will ever be a director's cut, or perhaps this is it. David Lynch carries on the noble tradition of French surrealism in his films, whether he knows it or not. Every screen minute of this film is in an alternative reality, even when the camera stares at mundane things like a plate of uneaten fried eggs at Winkie's on Sunset Boulevard. Sometimes I could imagine that André Breton and Philippe Soupault secretly contribute to his scripts through a medium and devise some of the eerie, supernatural, and reality-piercing scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece,"it really cant get better than this . lynch is a genius , his brain and his soul and his level of being an artist is beyond a genius.i give this movie a 100 out of 10 , i can watch it over and over again and each time it will effect me strongly , who ever says this movie is crap clearly doesn't understand it , not everyone has the intelligence to understand lynch and his dark complex world. i wish there were more films like this being made instead of the typical Hollywood movies. the acting is also great in this movie. Watts is amazing . the music as all of lynch;s movies is extremely touching and beautiful. people that are seekers for deep concepts of life and are interested in the human condition are going to like this movie. the club silensio scene is one of my Favorite scene in the movie , and blue haired lady and the cowboy are my Favorite characters. there is so much depth and mystery in this movie . this movie takes you to a journey and you need to go within yourself as a human to be able to relate to it .",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Warning: watching this movie could activate confusion.,"David Lynch movies can confuse people, to say the very least. It's all because he picks an unique approach, with both his writing and directing, that isn't focused on explaining everything that is happening on screen.It's why basically everybody has their own little theories on what ""Mulholland Dr."" is all about. It's funny how incredibly diverse most of them are and this is also the greatest power of this David Lynch movie. Everybody can look at it- and experience it differently and form their own opinions about it. So it's basically pointless to read or hear other people speaking about ""Mulholland Dr."", since chances are you'll get something totally different out of the movie. So yes, also my opinion about it is also of course completely irrelevant.To be fair, it isn't unique for a director to tell his story in such a way that it leaves almost everything completely up to the viewer's own imagination and interpretation. But David Lynch is the only 'mainstream' director at the moment that still makes movies this way. It's the reason why he has such an huge following and every time a new Lynch movie gets released people go nuts over it, even when they have no idea what they have just seen.And no, I also really have no idea yet what I have just witnessed. Who knows, maybe I'll understand it better on repeated viewings but understanding it is not the key to liking or appreciate this movie, fore I regardlessly really liked and appreciated the experience that this movie offered me.Great thing is that the movie always keeps on fascinating you and is forcing to keep paying attention and search for clues that are hidden in it. The movie is basically a mystery, in which different story lines and different characters get followed, that seemingly have very little to do with each other but at one point do come together or are relevant to each other. It keeps you glued to your seat, even though you might have no idea what is exactly going on. The movie forces you to put things together for yourself, since the actual movie itself offers very little explanation to anything. As a matter of fact, the last few minutes even make the movie all the more confusing, instead of wrapping things up and explaining to you what the story was truly about and what exactly was real in the movie and what wasn't.Personally my theory about the movie is that it's all about alternate realities, coexisting with each other, that at one point got somehow mixed up (due to the accident?). Every time the blue box gets used, a new alternate reality get opened, which explains why some of the characters in the movie switch identities and certain events seem to have changed or never even happened. But who am I to explain a David Lynch movie to you, while David Lynch himself is probably the only one walking this Earth that truly knows what the movie is all about or perhaps he himself also doesn't. He just loves to mess with people's minds, so it isn't even completely unthinkable that some elements of the movie were never supposed to make any sense at all and he's laughing at all of us for trying to explain his movies.But really, this is a movie you could talk about for all day long but in the end it really is something you have to experience for yourself and form your own judgment and interpretation on it. But let me just tell you that no matter how confusing this movie, you still get intrigued and sucked in by it, due to the way it all got shot and told by David Lynch.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Revenge Leads To...,"Plot: it's a mystery with some suspense and a few scene in horror style. And it is also quite weird.Actress and Actors & Acting: in my opinion Naomi Watts did a stunning work in this movie with all her expressions. And just Laura Hurring and Justin Theroux did a good job, all the others where pretty not so good in acting, they were unnatural, I'm sorry.Soundtrack: there is not so much during the movie, but those songs that there are are good.Conclusions: since reality is blended with fantasy it's pretty much a mayhem comprehend it all immediately. I guess that this is one of those movies that needs to be watched again in order to get all the important details.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Like the scariest nightmare and the most life-changing dream at the same time,"I'm not much of a Lynch fan, but this movie, it transcends all the narrative limitations of cinema that are based on language/dialogue alone. It shows art and emotions can be evoked in images through the film itself, and somehow everything makes sense when it gets tied together in the end. But sense doesn't mean quick rationality, or quick wit. Lynch definitely has a lot of that in his film, but it's a transcendental film. It's not meant to be looked upon with the same magnifying glass that a scientist might use to study bacteria. You have to look at this with all your life experiences, and then it will seem like a revelation that you never expected to find. A masterpiece in cinema, literally like no other.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Mystery of a Film,"David Lynch's Mulholland Drive seemingly has fascinated and divided viewers since its debut. There's a mystery driving the plot. The mystery is not the viewer's attempt to unravel the backstory of the beautiful amnesiac Rita who shows up unexpectedly the same day in the borrowed apartment in which perky Betty temporarily is staying while trying to launch her acting career. Instead, the mystery is whether any of the first two-thirds of the film really is ""plot"" at all or whether it's a dream, an allegory, or something else entirely.Twenty years later, there is no clear answer to what, exactly, happens in Mulholland Drive. The film is so open-ended that viewers can adopt their pet interpretations - you can root for the idea that it's a parable or side with the team cheering for a hallucination - without much risk of being disproved. Perhaps part of what drives such interest in the film is the obsessive rewatching and dissecting of the movie in an attempt to nail down an answer that likely does not exist. Some may find enjoyment in that, but it is not to my taste.Overall, Mulholland Drive is an interesting, baffling film. I have a general dislike for movies with cult followings where - as you will see in many reviews for this one - the only way the movie isn't a masterpiece is if you don't ""get it."" Watch the movie and decide for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Timeless Masterpiece - A must watch,"First things first: This Movie is a must see - Even if you hate it afterwards. The story of Mulholland Drive is built and woven with layers. Each layer when peeled off takes viewers a step closer to the conception of ""truth"" or perceived truth.When watching this movie, one must be very very careful in not judging it at first by simply viewing it at face value, if you do so, you'll be surely disappointed and be scratching your head over what you just witnessed. Every scene, every moment, every act(s) is a consequence of previous act for sure, but also has deeper layers (deeper causes), To describe the layer/deeper causal example in a practical way: if you were driving on the street and suddenly a bank robber stops you and gives you a 100$ note and you gleefully accept his generosity because you are in dire need to do so, is the cause of your glee bank robber giving 100$ bill, or his insidious agenda to take money away from someone and make others happy? or is it simply play of events and its a coincidence and your ""luck"" that caused all of it; Or is it that you drove on the street hoping that perhaps today is the day when someone will come and help you since you are dire need As we can probably make out that there are different sides, different causes of a simple event, how we perceive such events and are affected by it is what makes our reality. Like if we go in even further, what motivates us to act or participate in the event and affect our own reality?Mulholland drive is a that confusing road that leads to nowhere until some agent flushes our misperceptions and takes us to the ""higher truth"" whatever it be using a secret path, and perhaps when all of it plays out, our illusion gets over. To all viewers, I won't talk further in riddles, but there are some important elements you need to consider when you watch this movie:1. Each segment is important, so be careful to watch and let it run through your minds.2. This movie relates and centers around a woman and what goes on in her mind, and beyond the conjured up world. Understand that sometimes thoughts running in mind are hard to describe in their physical sense of meaning so a lot of expression that comes out in the movie maybe hard at first to fathom, but movie is clearly able to distinguish between: correct, incorrect, devoid of thought patterns (blankness)/deep sleep, imaginary(hallucinatory) and memories. Not only that sometimes colorings of thoughts, our state mind (one-pointed, dullness etc.) are very hard to describe in their physical counterparts: movie to some extent is able to put that forward as well.3. Movie centers around how other characters spun out from the woman's mind and how she ""feels"" about those characters (this can be far from truth), characters like betty or Rita or characters like ""the girl"" for example. (No Spoilers for you guys reading this and have come this far).4. Movie can be complete but still incomplete - that is how mind works and there is a limitation on how all things/patterns fit together based on observer and what is being observed and what are the colorings of the thought stream that have been witnessed thus far.5. Movie has some sexual acts that some may find disturbing, but again its mind field, in the world of mind-field anything is possible, we all have fantasies, we all have hallucinations, we all have objects of affections.Many of the elements seem apparent but they really have deeper meaning to them, like ""It is an illusion "" or Silencio at the end. Overall I would say, this movie requires a lot of patience to understand and grasp, if you are looking for pop-corn drama, go watch inception or some other flick that gives you just that, there's a lot of those out there (nothing against those as well, they are fantastic but they are too apparent and too easy to follow). Movie often is like life - it can be as easy as you make it to be, or as hard as you make it out to be Overall a fantastic value for money.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely brilliant.,"""Mulholland Drive"" is Lynch's most powerful and stunning work since his 1986 masterpiece ""Blue Velvet.""  The film combines the mysterious noir elements of ""Blue Velvet,"" the dream-like horror of ""Fire Walk With Me,"" and the bizarre structure of ""Lost Highway.""  People going to see this film expecting everything to tie up in a nice little bow at the end will be severely disappointed.  However, anyone who wants to take a strange and wonderful trip that sucks you in and keeps your mind churning for weeks afterward are going to love it.Lynch has clearly proven himself as a narrative storyteller with such films as ""The Elephant Man,"" and ""The Straight Story,"" and now he is taking the art of filmmaking in a new direction.  I believe some people will be frustrated with the movie because they simply have no point of reference to compare it with.  Others, who are more open minded to entering a dream world where things are so real and yet so unreal at the same time, are going to watch this film over and over and over.  The film at times is horrifying, at other times hilarious, and features one of the hottest sex scenes in motion picture history.  The performances are brilliant.  To describe the plot or give anything away would not do the film justice; it simply has to be experienced.""Mulholland Drive"" brings to mind Billy Wilder's classic ""Sunset Boulevard,"" which also explored the darker side of both Hollywood and human nature in an unconventionally narrative way.  Mulholland Drive, the road, parallels Sunset Boulevard the road in Los Angeles, yet it is much darker, with many hidden twists and turns.  ""Mulholland Drive"" the film works the same way, except this time we are experiencing Hollywood and human nature from the point of view of David Lynch.I think that with the right distributor, this film could do very well. This film should win Oscars.  When ""Fire Walk With Me"" came out, it bombed critically as well as with audiences, yet it is now considered one of the best films of the 90's by many critics and fans.  I think people are ready for a film like ""Mulholland Drive,"" as an alternative to the God awful crap that the studios are feeding us on a weekly basis.  If this film had been a television series, it would have been popular than ""Twin Peaks"" was at its height.  As a feature film, ""Mulholland Drive"" will stand as an landmark for the next wave of filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

10/10,"As I watched the plot of Mulholland drive unfold, my ability to follow an already tenuous narrative from the start waned with every passing minute. As the incoherence of seemingly random juxtaposed scenes and circumstances piled up faster than they could be resolved, I felt myself feeling overwhelmingly angry at David Lynch for yet again sucking me into his LSD fueled fever dream. This movie walks a fine line between being unwatchable gibberish and a surrealist masterclass. It offers just enough intelligibility to keep you invested. I have read that Lynch does not like discussing the meaning of his movies. Yet the first thing I did upon finishing it was spend many hours reading volumes of analysis, in quiet contemplation. Of the use of symbolism, or non linear story telling or psychoanalytic dream interpretation. Of the countless subtleties and nuances I was not cognizant of watching it the first (and only) time. I don't even know if you can attribute these critiques as being suggested by the movie rather than created entirely in the mind of the viewer. There are certainly strong arguments for the latter as well as no one interpretation explains every plot hole. In the end, my appreciation for this movie goes beyond the time I spent watching, and is equally owed to the thought provoking discourse surrounding it. Like all great surrealist works, the beauty comes from the transformative relationship between artist and audience. So by wanting to discuss and dissect it, maybe I am exactly the kind of mouth breather missing the entire point that Lynch detests; but for me, it is only through this process I have a new found regard for having witnessed something magnificent and beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Luckily for me because I could get into the movie by getting it out of my head and rather than feel betrayed, I just took it in.Unlike a song with scattered lyrics that can tell a story to a listener that never existed in the writers mind, or the Red Dot in a corner of a black canvas that is called Art, this movie falls short of that conquest only because it tries too hard.

"The Rosetta Stone To David Lynch's Mind, Amazing...","Puzzles can really tie up your mind. After hours, days, years of toiling to resolve a conundrum you may abandon it, defeated. But a good puzzle - a truly great one - will always beckon you back mercilessly. After first experiencing Mulholland Drive in 2001 I was completely baffled. Had the 2 1/2 hours of cinematic hysteria merely been a hoax? A highly stylized scam? Could it be that this confounding, bewildering pantomime of Classic Hollywood tropes only been contrived to taunt me? That's certainly what it felt like, sitting there in that velvety shrine as the credits rolled past. Had I been conned? Deceived, duped, swindled? Or had I missed something? I decided, as did my group of fellow film goers - because we somehow intuited that David Lynch had wanted us to be so initially mystified - that we had best reexamine this daunting riddle. We sat through another showing that very same night & damn if we weren't just as flummoxed afterward. No one had a convincing theory to explain the relentless parade of captivating confusion that we'd just again witnessed. The solution, apparently, was going to require some diligence.Deciphering this film became a chronic challenge for my group of determined detectives. Over the next 3 or 4 weeks we spent countless hours analyzing, discussing, dissecting, & debating its meaning, but nothing felt conclusive. Eventually we watched the queer dark spectacle yet again & came away with a whole fresh crop of notions, but these all soon withered under the intense heat of our examinations. We would ruthlessly eviscerate one another's forced & impractical conjectures. We each began clinging defensively, helplessly, to our own feeble theory, mechanically repeating it to one another in a tragic display of denial. We were all stumped but refused to accept it. It started to get ugly, even vicious, as we'd denigrate one another in our fury to be relieved of this terrible burden. We had to desist or we'd all end up with our throats torn out.Fast forward five years to the low key, un-hyped, nearly unnoticed release of INLAND EMPIRE & the 3 core members of that old gang of Lynch fans. We were going to a Special Screening at a specially selected theater to which a friend of a friend had connections & we'd be among the very first in the entire tri-state area to attend Lynch's latest cinematic psychic assault. We were as giddy as school girls, but strangely, undeniably, we were all unusually polite with one another. We were treating each other rather gingerly, as though tip-toeing around some unseen sleeping monster. The heavy weight of our old Mulholland Drive encumbrance was upon us once again, but no one spoke of it. At least not then, not till after we had experienced that unbelievably, impossibly gargantuan Goliath of a mind f#@% that is INLAND EMPIRE.INLAND EMPIRE so utterly crushed us, so completely destroyed us. Our awareness, our consciousness, our wit, our entire being - thoroughly pulverized. It was astonishing just how nullified we were by what we had just witnesses, had just endured. Our minds were arid, desolate, vacant expanses of vacuous nothingness. What WAS that?!! A horrendous demonic courier from the deepest, vilest recesses of David's Gothic psyche had just delivered to us a most outrageously sinister parcel that was now demanding to be inspected. It felt as though I had been immersed in a vat of pure uncut dread. A cloying, claustrophobic curtain of doom had descended, obliterating all light of reason. That unrelenting barrage of horrific paranoia had overwhelmed me with an unbearably thick avalanche of hopelessness. This was going to be a very hard movie to ""get"", is what we all three were thinking.I have veered off here onto the INLAND EMPIRE trail because it had inadvertently rekindled our debates of Mulholland Drive. We seemed to sense that perhaps there may possibly be a key to unlocking Mulholland somewhere in the dense, impenetrable quagmire of INLAND EMPIRE. But where, and in what form would it be, and how would we even recognize it? Gaining entrance to INLAND EMPIRE was just too intimidating, and so soon, by default, we focused again on Mulholland Drive. Someone suggested that there seemed to be something of a circular form to its structure, but was clueless as to a point of entry. That phrase ""Point of Entry"" echoed in my gauzy mind, and then I recalled something that the agitated Polish men at the beginning of INLAND EMPIRE were discussing so emphatically: A way in. A way in to WHAT, I pondered? A way into the Rabbit Hole? What does that mean? I dunno. A way into America? Maybe. A way into the meaning of that damn movie?! Hmmm... AHA! OMFG! Lynch, you devious, sick bastard! I think I'm onto something here, I thought to myself. And indeed, I was because soon, and very effectively, I was scaling that formidable facade that had so discouraged me with its pretension to impenetrability. As I figured & felt my way into the INLAND EMPIRE labyrinth, I became aware of a very definite, precise mechanism at work in the action of its structure. The astounding realization of just exactly WHY INLAND EMPIRE was initially so impossible to fathom ignited within me a tremendous realization of just exactly what was also going on with Mulholland Drive. I began to test this theory, to see if the parts lined up, and it all very soon clicked perfectly into place. WOW! The whole film, rearranged & reconstructed in my mind, had gelled into a superbly coherent, fiendishly rational tale. Amazing! Absolutely gorgeous, the elegant beauty of its convoluted design. Mulholland Drive Solved!!! I didn't tell my two friends what I had discovered for at least one week, I was savoring that sweet rich feeling of superiority. It eventually occurred to me that they both might be doing the same...",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Was this film really necessary?,"I watched this movie a while back, and haven't taken the time to comment on it until now.Before I begin my rant, I must say: This movie is a VERY great idea and concept. It had a nice plot and a good amount of potential, but more importantly it did have what I feel was a great concept and way of portraying Hollywood.That was the ONLY reason why I gave this a 6/10...and that was being nice.The movie is so confusing and tries so hard to be something greater and awwing that it ends up a disaster. You could analyze the film for hours, and still not truly ""get"" it. People keep on trying to ""get"" this movie just because they ""get"" the idea. Let me tell you now...just give up.You can look at this movie from a million different angles, perspectives, over-analyze every single detail. It still will only lead you to the main theme about Hollywood, and won't really give you any further insight.When making a movie like this, a point does need to be made, yes. However, at the same time, that point needs to be made clear and concise, not overflowing with randomly inserted scenes that not only remain confusing, but won't contribute to any greater knowledge of the movie's main point. As a result of the telephone sequences, the boss, the homeless man that looks like a monster...all of these scenes present interesting ideas, but it is just redundant and restating it. Not emphasizing, but literally restating it in another way.We don't need 2 hours of reiteration of a main point. We would prefer to have a good movie. I'm not even asking for it to entirely make sense...I'm just asking for it to add something new, something interesting that can be analyzed and gained from.I personally feel that there isn't anything that could be added after the main point that Hollywood is a dream that becomes a nightmare...it could have just been a story of two lesbian actresses, one with amnesia and one who fails in Hollywood, yada yada yada...it could have NOT had the excessive scenes that amount to nothing. Was it all really necessary?Personally, I think not. This movie could have easily been a half hour shorter if it had been edited, but instead it had to be dragged out. It destroys the movie, leaves the viewer confused, and ends up making Lynch's entire point worthless. By the end, we don't CARE what great ideas the movie may present. We just want it to be over so we can go home and go on with our lives as far as possible from the nightmare of Hollywood that presents movies just like this.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting movie,"Enter the mysterious realm of David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive."" This psychological thriller, which defies traditional narrative structure and takes viewers on a strange tour into Hollywood's underworld, is a neo-noir maze of dreams, wants, and illusions. ""Mulholland Drive"" is fundamentally a reflection on the dark side of ambition and the elusive nature of identity. The boundaries between truth and fiction are blurred by Lynch's skillful directing, leading viewers to wonder what is genuine and what is just the characters' imaginations. The film's nonlinear storyline, in which Lynch skillfully interweaves seemingly unrelated strands to create a tapestry of mystery and intrigue, heightens the sense of suspense.The connection between Rita (played by Laura Harring), an amnesiac lady who enters Betty's life, and Naomi Watts (played by Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress full of innocence and naivete, is central to the story of the movie. Their bond acts as a trigger for the revelation of wants and secrets that lie underneath the glittering Hollywood exterior. The lines separating their identities become increasingly hazy as their adventure progresses, building to a finale that is both memorable and unsettling. A remarkable feature of ""Mulholland Drive"" is Lynch's painstaking attention to detail. Every frame is filled with symbolism and hidden meaning, inviting viewers to peel back the layers of the narrative and uncover its deeper truths. From the eerie Club Silencio sequence to the cryptic blue box, Lynch keeps viewers guessing until the very end. The performances in ""Mulholland Drive"" are nothing short of mesmerizing. Naomi Watts delivers a tour-de-force performance as Betty, capturing both her innocence and her descent into darkness with aplomb. Laura Harring is equally captivating as Rita, exuding an air of mystery and vulnerability that is utterly compelling. To sum up, ""Mulholland Drive"" is an incomparable cinematic masterpiece. A haunting music, excellent acting, and David Lynch's creative directing make this a picture that stays in your head long after the credits have rolled. ""Mulholland Drive"" is an experience that should not be missed, regardless of whether it is perceived as a psychological thriller, a bizarre mystery, or a critique of Hollywood's delusions.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
classic lynch (godawful),"I have never fallen asleep so many times during one movie. It's the usual puerile, masturbatory, pretentious, inane, shock value piece of drivel that Lynch always does.

One of my all time favorites,"I know many people found this movie hard to follow, and so gave it a poor review, but what they don't understand is that this was exactly the reason so many others loved it. The film certainly doesn't take the viewer by the hand and lead them through step by step, instead it leaves things up to their own interpretation, making it necessary for their own neurons to participate in the process of creation, not unlike in an abstract painting.We see movies all the time with plot holes the size of mac trucks and silly premises, but this is not what we have here. Instead this is a very simple and common story told in a very unconventional way, with a skillful blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality, thereby letting our own minds make connections that might be unexpected. What more could you want from art or a film?Beyond this the acting is incredible, especially by Naomi Watts, who not only has to act, but also has to act like she is acting, which she does in one very memorable scene, which is just one of many scenes you won't easily forget.Final advice: Watch this movie as you would look at a piece of art. Let your mind go where it wants, without regard to whether it makes sense at the moment, and you might begin to understand the acclaim this film has received. Multiple viewings wouldn't hurt either.Cheers",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Bad Dream from David Lynch (In a Good Way),"What can I say. Each time I see a David Lynch film, I see my own disturbing dreams in them. The fundamental story has to do with two people whose paths cross; a woman who survives a murder attempt because a group of teenagers are joyriding and crash the car she is riding in. She finds herself at a home in a bedroom which is the temporary quarters of a young actress. That would be enough for an interesting film, but Lynch would never do that. He brings in other sets of characters in counterpoint to the main ones and after a while we don't know who's who anymore. We also have some of that crazy cinematography and visuals that are left to our imaginations. All the participants show up together, yet they shouldn't have that relationship; or should they. I did enjoy seeing Billy Ray Cyrus get his clock cleaned. I was content to let the whole thing wash over me. I wondered what happened and then I didn't care.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loose ends vs. hypnotic images (as usual),"And who's winning the big prize? It's hard to tell. Every Lynch film has to be evaluated this way, I think. On one hand, you've got the surreal and beautiful happenings, and on the other, all the nonsense. You put it in the scales, and usually the first outweighs the second. By far.This is the first time I found myself doubting about it, because the mind toying was just way too much. The last minutes felt like a rehash of 'Lost Highway', but even more hallucinatory and illogic, and condensed in much less time. The fact that the crazy part started just when the story was getting REALLY interesting was a pain too. They were all noticeable symptoms of what everybody knows: Mulholland Drive was meant to be a TV series, in the same vein of ""Twin Peaks"". So the first half of this movie is, basically, a pilot (introduction of characters, some action, a bit of thriller, humor...) with a zillion of loose ends, and the rest, a milk shake of undeveloped ideas. Creepy and fascinating, but too much incoherent even for Lynch.The main reason this movie is, despite of all, a winner, is that Lynch has outdone himself this time. First, there are four or five shots in this movie which I can describe simply as unforgettable. Second, we are introduced to hilarious characters (the cowboy, for example) who are worth the movie alone. Third, we are presented with a few sequences in which Lynch shows a great sense of humor. And fourth, Badalamenti is still at top form.So, yes, he has done it again. But the margin is getting narrow. I'm really looking forward his next movie, because I have no idea which path will Lynch take. I'm already waiting.RATING: 7.4",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best films of 2001!,"From the brilliant, yet eccentric, mind of celebrated director David Lynch (TWIN PEAKS, LOST HIGHWAY, and BLUE VELVET), MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a wonderful film that shows audiences the dark side of Hollywood.Since I do not want to spoil anything for viewers, I will just say that it is an excellent piece of cinema that must be seen more than once to be fully appreciated. The cast is solid, the writing is clever and poignant, and the direction is atmospheric and eerie.MULHOLLAND DRIVE is an unforgettable, mesmerizing, kaleidoscopic, cinematic experience that should not be missed!My Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The Vertigo of XXI century. Lynch genious, Naomi Watts amazing acting, and that last half an hour!","Mulholland Drive is a miracle. Lynch often talks about how in his works he starts from ideas, fragments, that make him fall in love and which he later manages to organize into a suitable plot.MD is Lynch's biggest triumph since Blue Velvet, continuing some of the themes he had already introduced on Lost Highway.Something very interesting, and that is decisive for the final result, is how it was conceived and developed. Mulholland Drive was born from a TV mistery serial drama project, like Twin Peaks, but providence decided that the pilot was not liked and was shelved without being broadcast. This happy circumstance possibly prevented the project from ending up as another Twin Peaks (in its first and second seasons), in the hands of dozens of writers and directors, scattered and ultimately disappointing. Mulholland Drive is much better source material of course, and Lynch's style has come a long way since then (as shown in Twin Peaks Season 3).In any case, MD was interrupted in the state of an incomplete pilot, full of enigmas, unconnected situations, great ideas without form or finally defined context, and all with that sinister and naive dual vision, so difficult to keep in balance and so characteristic of the director.Serial dramas ussually begin with a series of unrelated puzzles, until little by little, from that chaos a form begins to emerge. The problem is that in serial dramas, which are usually totally conventional, the form is routine and boring, and as soon as it is clarified, the story loses interest and begins to develop along well-trodden paths. In Mulholland Drive the pilot unfolds chaotic, often unintelligible and disjointed, between hilarious scenes of masterful execution, but the moment necessarily comes when connections emerge from that chaos, the plot begins to take shape, the girl meets the boy. And abruptly there the pilot ends.I don't think anyone knows how the serial was going to develop, and if it would have anything to do with what the movie is, but I'm sure Lynch would end up turning it around in some way. Anyway, there came the catastrophe and the miracle. The pilot is shelved, the sets are destroyed, is it all finished?A year later, Lynch has a brilliant idea that, starting from scratch, reinterprets all the scenes from the pilot, integrating them into a totally different story with multiple and profound meanings. To begin with, he adds a few short scenes before the credits, essential to understand the film, also add the intriguing first scene at Winkie's, and then some scenes changing the romantic interest of the film. The atmosphere is more and more rarefied, everything points to an underlying reality that we do not know, until we reach the wonderful scene of the Silencio theater, and suddenly... emptiness. ""It's time to wake up,"" says the cowboy, and we wake up again to total chaos. When this chaos takes shape again, we will begin to reinterpret the entire film in a radically different way.It is then that the last half hour of the film begins, among the most brilliant in the history of cinema, and the puzzle is solved in a totally unexpected way.It is interesting to compare Mulholland Drive with Lynch's next project, Inland Empire, where the absolutely overwhelming torrent of ideas and fragments forms a nebula that is never resolved, the breaks and reassessments of the material are continuous, when we seem to begin to recognize the ground, suddenly we are totally lost again. If MD is basically understandable in its plot, it's because we have a system-wide benchmark, we wake up once; while in the Inland Empire we seem to wake up many times, always to find ourselves in another layer of sleep that we don't know if it is deeper than the previous one or not. We have a matryoshka where we no longer know which doll is inside which doll.One need to highlight Naomi Watts in one of the best performances of recent decades: showing excessive enthusiasm in the first part, intentionally over the top, and a naive and almost cheesy touch in the first part; the contrast with the vulnerable, desperate and vindictive Diane of the last half hour of the film could not be more devastating. The decisive dinner scene at the party, where we learn the real story of Diane (there is an absolutely miraculous video that shows how this scene was shot, and which is definitive proof of the genius of the Lynch-Watts tandem) is one of the most painful in the history of cinema.It has always been for me a movie very close to Vertigo, with a longer first part that ends up being revealed as a fantasy, and a second and shorter part that rewrites everything we have seen, and transforms it into a sordid story of failure and crime. . Judy Barton and Diane Selwyn are two young women fleeing deep America in search of a career in prosperous California. The two films are in part the story and the consequences of this failure.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Captivatingly Pointless,"Though it's far more coherent than its predecessor `Lost Highways', David Lynch is beginning to show signs of repetition and this noir fantasy-nightmare is so reminiscent of other Lynch films that it ends up signifying nothing. Still, nobody does David Lynch better than Lynch: he's an artist when it comes to evoking dread and the film is never less than morbidly fascinating. There's very little point in going over the plot because it's far more of a mood piece than anything else; suffice it to say the primary issue here (much like `Lost Highways') is shifting identities. To that end, the characters are blank though gorgeous. Worth seeing as long as you recognize you're spinning your wheels.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Lynch's Best Since ""Blue Velvet""","While ""Wild At Heart"", ""Twin Peaks"" - The TV Series, ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"", and ""Lost Highway"", among others, were all excellent this ranks as Lynch's best since his divine ""Blue Velvet"", arguably the first real American surrealist film.Many of the people I've watched this with (i've seen it a few times) have dismissed it as silly and shallow, just a - to quote one friend - ""movie with no plot disguised as a weird film noir"".Not at all. If anything this movie is a deep and indeed deeply interesting & intoxicating exploration of human life and - of course - Hollywood!Too easily dismissed as a simple ""it turned out to be all a dream"" movie, this is best left to the individual (with the help of Lynch's 10 clues) to figure out, and interpret on their own. Everyone will have a different opinion for what Lynch's (including many of his trademarks - red drapes, unusual characters like the Cowboy, etc.) symbolism means, his clues, strange plot twists, etc.The direction and script as usual with Lynch are both top-notch, the photography is stunning, and the cast is excellent, particularly Naomi Watts, who gives a fantastic levelled performance both as the sweetly innocent & idealistic Betty and as the troubled bitter Diane.A stunning mystery thriller/romantic drama that is in itself a mystery to unfold. When a movie can let the audience participate and interact with it to an extent such as this, it is quite simply marvellous.Have fun figuring it out! And enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent Lynchian routine - the twin of ""Lost highway""","This movie is another surreal piece of art by David Lynch, but it's not as great as the amazing and twisted ""Lost highway"" or the wonderful ""Twin Peaks"" series. Those movies ore episode are simply over the top. But it is still a movie that is more intense, intelligent and surprising than most of the other so called psycho thrillers and is worth a ten star vote.A little advice: You must also watch ""Lost highway"", because this movie is like a twin of this unique masterpiece! Now, let us begin with the bad points, because there aren't very much. This movie is not as twisted, surreal and surprising than ""Lost highway"". That doesn't mean that you might be able to understand it when you have just watched it once, but your not that literally lost as in ""Lost highway"". I also think that this movie copies the structure of ""Lost highway"" a lot and is less innovating. There is also a slow paced beginning, then a key event, the looking for the truth beyond dream and reality, the sudden change and the twisted ending connecting the end of the movie with its beginning. With the scenes of the house party in the ending, Lynch gives a lot of possible solutions and keys to the viewer and doesn't let him or her just stunning and without any clue like in his previous work. But if you think by now that this movie is easy to understand than David Lynch gives you such a strange element in the last scene of the movie that makes you desperate and that makes you think that you are back in ""Eraserhead"". But why should Lynch change his style after he had created a true masterpiece a few years ago? We should just see those points as minor critic points. It is not an ten plus extra star masterpiece but just an excellent ten star movie.Now, there is another negative point that I have to mention in a more general way: David Lynch wanted to start a new series around ""Mulholland Drive"" and this would have been such a great experience as ""Twin Peaks"" was or even better and David Lynch put all his creative imagination and dedicated a part of himself to the project - but Americas blockbuster-minded, easy-watching-commercialized Hollywood bosses didn't believe in a success and didn't accord the necessary amounts to one of their genius - the series might not have been popular and a good sell. That's why David Lynch was never able to finish his dream of a new series and we might have never seen parts of his filming if some French investors wouldn't have supported him and convinced him to make at least a movie out of his filming. David Lynch got financial support and an open-minded entourage and that's why he turned some new scenes, worked out a slightly new screenplay and created this new movie. A big thank you to the French supporters and thumps down towards the American film industry which let fall one of their best talents. And maybe all those complicated circumstances are the reason why Lynch made cartoons and worked as a producer in the next years and we had to wait seven years before he came back with the low-budget semi-masterpiece ""Inland Empire"", it's a really sad thing.Now, let's talk about the very positive parts of the movie. It has a little bit less dark atmosphere in the beginning than ""Lost highway"", but there is a key event and some action right after the introduction that make this movie easier to watch - the ""accident"" on the Mulholland Drive. But after this happen some really strange scenes that create a really thrilled atmosphere and that make the viewer of that movie think, guess and analyze - the strange old couple, the guy who has strange nightmares, the killer who's doing some stupid mistakes... There are many interesting details in this movie, even more than in ""Lost highway"" and the viewer becomes somehow an analyzer or detective. This movie requests multiple viewings and personally, I discover new elements after each viewing and I have seen the movie at least three or four times by now and it wasn't the last time. You really see that Lynch was supposed to do a series with this one because of all the well thought details.""Mulholland Drive"" lives also from the great acting of the two feminine main actors, especially the really charming Naomi Watts who does the job of her life. Every character is unique in this movie even the smaller roles like the nightmare guy and this point is even done better and more intense than in ""Lost highway"". Only the role of the cowboy has a lot of similarities to the role of the mystery man in ""Lost highway"", it is just a pity that he has not much space in this movie.And there is the same advice that I gave for ""Lost highway"": expect the unexpected! That may not be as clear in the first three quarters of the movie, it is less disturbing that other works of Lynch, but in the last one, you should better be prepared for some weird stuff that was worth the wait. I agree with critics who say that this movie has a certain Lynchian routine - but his routine is far away from being boring and especially the final thirty minutes should convince you! So, if you want to see a movie that makes work your mind and feelings, a movie you must concentrate on and that may request multiple viewings to understand, you will really appreciate this one. If you're looking for an easy movie for a DVD night with some friends - go for something else, because your party people might get frightened!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Lynch has made cryptic cinema his very own and an art form, and all the better for it.","Say what you want about David Lynch, but he remains one of the world's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Love him or hate him, his works could be strange, beautiful, and extreme at the same time. But there is no doubt that Lynch's cinema is one-of-a-kind. It is difficult not to have an opinion after viewing his films. The Oscar-nominated director of The Elephant Man (1980) and Blue Velvet (1986) is rewarded with another Oscar nomination for Best Director for this film, which has since regain a newfound appreciation after frustrating viewers a decade ago.Mulholland Dr. could tie with Blue Velvet as Lynch's magnum opus. Weird, horrific, and most of all, haunting, it is an experience that defies expectations. Written by Lynch himself, Mulholland Dr. could either be the most brilliant film conceived by the most bizarre of human minds, or the most useless, illogical, and downright unfathomable ever.The plot of Mulholland Dr. is not crucial to understanding what the director's vision for the film is (thankfully, as I wouldn't know where to start). Lynch takes two simple concepts of dreams and reality, and draws up a complex relationship between them. He merges them together, then dissects them, then attempts to turn them into each other. And if that is not enough, he confuses us further by not establishing which is which in the first place. When the dust settles (if it does), the question to ask is: Does it all make sense? Does it even suppose to make sense? Curiously, Mulholland Dr. works more effectively as a film when it is left to vagueness and the bewilderment of the viewer. Apparently, it works even better when one is puzzled and comprehends the ""puzzlement"" as key to appreciating Lynch's dark, twisted tale. Even if the film is picked apart and understood with clarity, it still stands firm and strong as a near-perfect piece of storytelling, one that is surprisingly without any discernible loopholes.The performances by the cast are generally excellent. The chemistry between the two lead actresses – Naomi Watts and Laura Harring – is outstanding and provides the film with a strong emotional core. Watts, in particular, makes her acting breakthrough here, with a daring performance that is perhaps only second to her career-best display in Alejandro Inarritu's 21 Grams (2003). There is some controversy over the quite explicit homosexuality portrayed by the two leads. However, under Lynch's assured direction, it becomes integral to the building of character relations in the ""dream"" half of the film, and the instigation of tragedy in the ""reality"" half.The intoxicating music by Angelo Badalamenti adds a sense of the unknown to the film, appearing to come from deep within the mystery that is Mulholland Dr., rather than as an aural accompaniment to its dreamscapes and nightmares. There is a noirish quality to Lynch's film that makes it visually captivating, and atmospherically dense. There is also the feeling that all is not right in Hollywood, where the film is set, and in which it tries to satirize.Even though Lynch gives us a shocking climax that concludes the film powerfully, in essence, it is still incomplete. There is no ending really. In fact, it is a pseudo-ending because Mulholland Dr. works like an endless cycle filled with Lynchian ambiguity and his brand of ""hallucinatory (in)sanity"". Each round brings one deeper into what seems like a bottomless abyss, raising questions on the temporality of reality and dreams, and the ""reality"" of imagination. With Mulholland Dr., Lynch has made cryptic cinema his very own and an art form, and all the better for it. This is the cinematic equivalent of the ultimate Rubik's cube.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A truly unique and dreamlike viewing experience,"I can honestly say after watchingMulholland Drive (2001)that I've never seen anything quite like this... it helps to come into this film with the sole expectation that you are entering a dreamworld. Rather than being presented a straightforward plot with conventional tropes and rules, we are given from Lynch a succession of images, ideas and sensations - in that sense,Mulholland Drive (2001)really feels closer to a dream than a movie.To say thatDavid Lynchhas a unique cinematic style would be an understatement - as a result, his films can be extremely hit or miss with people. But here, everything just seems to come together so well - the disquieting music coupled with the dreamlike surroundings creates a nightmarish and otherworldly environment to which you simply become a part of. Lynch re-creates the place we all see in our dreams that feels so real and yet is only a part of our subconscious.There are many highlights in the film (the acting fromNaomi WattsandLaura Harringspecifically is outstanding) but what resonated the most with me was the beautiful imagery Lynch has crafted in this film. Ambitious in its deliberate approach to avoid conventional plot elements, the pieces of the film are so hard to put together that trying to do so would simply be futile. People have tried to solve its mysteries and contrivances but MD is meant to be left in its bare, enigmatic fragments.Upon finishing the film, I was left with the same feeling I have waking up from an amazing dream: Unsure of what I had witnessed but stuck reminiscing at the mystery and beauty of it all. And until this point, I had never seen anything quite like this surreal, neo-noir experience. I seriously doubt I will ever come across anything like it again.

Confusing for most but the most rabid Lynch lovers,"Mulholland Drive will appeal to aficionados of David Lynch, but for those who merely like his movies - or, worse, haven't seen any of them (Elephant Man, Eraserhead, Dune, Lost Highway), it'll be a thoroughly incomprehensible mess. I suspect it's not, really, but figuring it out calls for mental powers the like of which I'll never have. The movie does more than merely blur the line between reality and fantasy, it obliterates it.For about two thirds of the film, everything sort of makes some kind of sense. It's weird enough, sure, but it seems to follow some logic. Then Something happens, and the movie goes off the rails. Intentionally, I'm sure - it's the kind of movie for which clues are very, very subtle, and it's entirely up to the viewer to piece them together. Even so, different viewers will come up with different explanations for the events in Mulholland Drive.The basic gist is this: Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), fresh off the plane from Canada, arrives in Hollywood to make her fortune as an actress, along with approximately 40,000 other ingenues each year (taken from the Great Book of Stats I've Made Up). She has it a little easier than most novices, though, in that she gets to stay in the nice apartment of her aunt, an actress who's conveniently out of town and has permitted Betty to stay. Ah, but Betty quickly discovers that she's not alone - there's a naked woman in her shower, and it turns out she's an amnesiac. The woman takes the name of Rita from a nearby movie poster, and Betty decides to help her find out who she is while keeping nosy neighbors out of the loop.Now, the viewer knows that Rita was in a car accident on the titular road in the opening scene of the movie. She was being driven in a limo, and the driver pulled the car over and pulled a gun on her. Before he can shoot, though, two drag racing cars careen around the turn, and one smashes into Rita's car, killing everyone except her. She subsequently wanders into Los Angeles itself and hides out at Betty's aunt's place.As with most Lynch movies, though, nothing is what it seems. All Rita has in her purse is a mysterious, oddly shaped blue key - and stacks of money. When she and Betty visit a diner, Rita thinks she recognizes the waitress's first name - Diane - and maybe even flashes on a full name, Diane Selwyn. Could Rita be Diane? The ladies figure out Selwyn's phone number and call it, but they get a recording. Then they visit it, but when they find the woman's apartment, they find Selwyn had switched with someone - and at THAT apartment, they find a dead body.But that's not where it gets weird. In the middle of the night, Rita wakes up with the word Silencio on her lips, and she brings Betty to a strange club with the same name. In what's been described as the most moving sequence in the film, the women watch an interesting performance - first an emcee tells them that ""There is no band"" and that all is just a tape, and then a singer belts out a Spanish version of Rob Orbison's ""Crying,"" which apparently has quite an effect on Rita (who cries) and Betty (who shakes). After the performance, Rita discovers she has a small blue box, and back at the apartment she opens it. And that's about when the movie goes completely nutso.What does it all mean? I do not know. Who are all of these people? I do not know. I don't know much about this movie, and I just saw the thing. I fear it's entirely beyond my comprehension, but I did find a good analysis of it online.I like mysteries. I like having to figure things out, but I don't particular enjoy movies that have a zillion possibilities, depending on how the viewer wishes to interpret things. Or, if that's how the movie's going to be, I kind of wish the clues made some sort of sense.

"Odd, for sure","I saw this 22 years ago and disliked it a lot, but I've grown since then. However, while I appreciate much of the film's technique and some incredibly eerie scenes and sequences, I really cannot say that I suddenly like it. I bluntly have to admit that I don't understand a lot of it and some of it, no matter what anyone says, simply does not make sense. Is the whole thing a dream?! Is part of it a dream?! Or is none of it a dream, which seems not very probable, but it's a David Lynch film and probability and logic are not always obvious. I hadn't any memory that Justin Theroux was even in this and he gives an odd performance that is not very believable, but I think that is intentional. The two female leads, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring are both very effective. Odd that I don't recall ever seeing Harring again in anything. She's very effective here in a stilted way. Watts is the true focal point and she is very good. This is for Lynch fans, which I don't appear to be one, but it is visually extremely interesting and I loved the one musical number. Talk about haunting.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The boulevard of broken dreams as Emerald City, with Lynch pulling the levers behind the scrims","Moviegoers from around the world respond to the names of streets they've never walked or driven down: Hollywood and Vine, Sunset Boulevard, Mulholland Drive - staple locales in films since their beginning. The first clue in David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. (and it's a grab-bag of clues, many if not most of them pointing to ambiguous answers) lies in its title. He uses the abbreviation 'Dr.' to summon up not so much an address as another movie that also used the short form as its title, another fable about Hollywood dreams, dashed or unfulfilled: Sunset Blvd.Several strands of plot are superimposed one upon another, often but not reliably interlocking. The dominant ones concern Laura Elena Harring as 'Rita' (a name she steals from a framed poster for Gilda), who has lost her memory after a car crash during what seems to have been a contract hit on her life, and Naomi Watts as 'Betty,' a wide-eyed kid from small-town Canada come to California to try her luck in The Industry. (Quotation marks around their names indicate that these identities are at best tentative.)A third major plot line belongs to Justin Theroux, a young, hot-shot director who's casting a movie - a piece of nostalgic '50s kitsch (though the jitterbuggers under Mulholland Dr.'s titles suggest the late '40s). His own inclinations are thwarted by what seem to be backers from organized crime, though behind them operates an even more sinister presence, right at the vanishing point where conspiracy thrillers cross over into sci-fi. When Theroux balks, he ends up having a very bad day (all his money electronically vanishes, and he finds his wife in bed with pool-guy Billy Ray Cyrus -- maybe the last time he's been sighted, except in Branson, Missouri).When Watts arrives at the posh garden apartment her traveling aunt lets her borrow, she finds Harring cowering inside. They become friends (and eventually more) who try to solve the mystery of Harring's lost identity. That's not as easy as it sounds, for Lynch is playing a high-stakes truth-and-illusion game, where facts are as slippery and mutable as dreams, or in this case nightmares. (It's a movie that demands, but may not deserve, as much exegesis as Vladimir Nabokov's dazzling conundrum Pale Fire - it lacks that novel's essential rigor.)Watts improbably aces a convenient screen-test and seems about to shoot to the top of the A-list - possibly starring in Theroux's movie. Harring's memory, meanwhile, starts functioning; she thinks she may be 'Diana Selwyn,' living in another courtyard bungalow several notches down the scale of affluence from the one where she's currently snuggling with Watts. Then one night she wakes up babbling in Spanish and decides it's time to find out what a mysterious key in her possession might unlock. The pair dashes off, in the middle of the night, to an underground cabaret in an unseemly part of town.Here Mulholland Dr. strips its gears, reversing abruptly from floodlit glamor and Nancy-Drewish mysteries into the grim reality of dashed hopes and broken dreams, of addiction and despair. What has gone before appears to have been a masochistic, wish-fulfilling reverie - actually, a masturbatory fantasy - on the part of Watts (no longer Betty, she's now the missing Selwyn, jilted by her rising actress/lover Camilla Rhodes - Harring). Other characters shift identities as well: Concierge of the upscale garden-court Ann Miller, replete with spit-curls and garbed in Chinoiserie, turns into the mother of Theroux, who's engaged, to Watts' chagrin, to Harring. And so it goes....David Lynch is a master technician of the movie medium, a shatteringly original talent who leaves little persuasive evidence that he knows entirely what he's doing. These contradictions came to the fore in Twin Peaks, a pinnacle of 'event television.' The two-hour premiere proved unsettling but always engrossing, directed with glacial perfection. But as the series progressed, it grew more and more incoherent - laughable. Lynch never found a way out (the series just ended).Mulholland Dr., too, started as a television project; when that fell through, and was recut into a feature film, he may have been forced to cook up something that could pass for a resolution. Whether he could have come up with a better one with the time that a TV series would have bought him is open to debate. But the one we have is an infuriating tangle of loose ends. (An early scene about a trigger-happy lowlife, for but one instance, seems only to pay homage to Quentin Tarantino and goes nowhere.)Part of the problem lies in Lynch's oneiric approach to the medium: More than any American director, he works along the shifting perspectives of dreams, the loony logic of the unconscious. Yet one man's dreams may be nightmares for the rest of us. Too many themes dredged from Lynch's id recur, uneasily, in movies from Eraserhead on: The heavily draped, windowless rooms; the ogres and grotesques and vermin-like tiny people; the cartoonish characters, like The Cowboy, who all but carry bullhorns blaring 'symbol;' the bizarre theater performances; the queasy descents into black holes that open out into whole new universes. He reverts to these signature tropes when he isn't sure where to go next.And yet, If we're even half-willing, Lynch can really work us over, boring into our skulls and slithering under our skins like nobody else. He shows a wizardly grasp of the doubleness (duplicity?) of things - the horror just under the humdrum, the macabre that's the flip side of the mundane. Nothing is so freighted with the unspeakable as sex (and in his sadistic eroticism Lynch is neck-and-neck with Brian De Palma, whose contemporaneous Femme Fatale was another violent and voluptuous exercise in multiple realities). Mulholland Dr. can be as forbidding yet enticing a fantasy world as the Emerald City, even though we realize that it's an elaborate con-game - that the old humbug Lynch is pushing our buttons, knowingly, gleefully.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
lynch makes a collage of his previous work,"Don't get me wrong, I am a great admirer of Lynch's work.  Not just his beautifully strange haunting films, but his painting and photography as well.  I have seen Lost Highway at least five times and it still intrigues me.  I think Eraserhead is one of the scariest cult horrors I have seen. The calming beauty of Straight Story couldn't have been captured by anyone else but Lynch.  The image of Bob from Twin Peaks can stil make me shiver thinking about it... but... Mulholland Drive didn't do those things for me.I think it is Lynch's most overrated work so far.  When these other films came out people were probably not ready for them yet.  When Mulholland Drive came out, I guess they were, so it was hauled by the press and audience as something they had never seen before.  And this is exactly where I think the film gets stuck!I almost feel bad giving this critical review, but I feel by doing this I am actually doing credit to the genius of Lynch's mind.  Although I'm not sure if the man himself would agree!  I think Lynch could do better. Let me start by saying that I did enjoy the film.  The atmosphere was still beautiful dreamy like.  It did miss the nightmarish dimension of Lost Highway though. Maybe cuz Betty, even when she turns darker, was so annoyingly nice and sweet.  There was a fair amount of your regular dry humor and some of the characters managed to give me the creeps for a moment, be it that they never had a deeper function.The plot itself soon lost my interest.  Maybe cuz I already knew the trick not to look for a binding thread too much.  You know with Lost Highway I still look for a missing piece of the puzzle, but in Mulholland Drive there are so many missing pieces you soon give up. Maybe it's not fair that I'm comparing this film to Lost Highway so much, but what can you expect when even the music, pretty decisive in creating the atmosphere, was identical at times.Then there was the dwarf we know from Twin Peaks.  Didn't Lynch have any new ideas of creating some other crazily disturbing characters?  As if he put them in for people unfamiliar with his work.  Or is Mulholland Drive an ode, a collage, to what he did before.  An ode out of the mind of some disturbed girl with a multiple personality syndrome?We know Lynch has a very typical way of handling the camera, which was one of the reasons to make a film with such a common story as The Straight Story still so beautiful and strange.  The camerawork of Mulholland Drive was too identical to Lost Highway though, but not as effective.  I didn't get any goosebumps.  I just felt dreamily entertained for two and a half hours.The love scenes between Rita and Betty were nice and seemed sincere.  Their relationship as a whole was convincing. That's were I liked the twist in the plot.  But then a lot of the rest seemed kind of useless entourage.  I don't know but Mulholland Drive really disappointed me coming out of this brilliant mind, I'm sorry to say...",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This film is NOT like a dream...,"... because dreams are filled up with symbols which uncertainly indicate desires and anguishes, and it's contexts aren't clear, nor linear. This movie is actually based on a straight-forward, symbolism-free story that tricks you with the idea it's a dream by adding mysterious characters doing things you can only guess how and why, but indepedently of their reasons you can clearly understand their intentions, and by adding multi-explainable plot twists that all in all lead to nowhere.So it's basically a film that acts like mindless suspense and soap opera at times. MY OPINION ABOUT THAT: I hate both genres, and find the represented situations in this turd unoriginal and uninteresting, so watching it soon got boring. Since it lasted two and half hours, it was quite a pain. Nevertheless I enjoyed the sex scenes.It can be enjoyed by people who like the genres I listed above plus mindless guessing on what's happening. The photography and direction are great, the plot is awful and the ""Dream-like movie"" idea behind it turns out a total disaster, just like the overall quality of this one.

And it makes perfect sense as a Love Story Or as Last Dream of Broken Soul !!,"Like everybody else i didn't understand he movie when i saw it first time...and i wasn't sure what it really meant. But there was something else that mattered more to me than literal meaning what the film is about . And it was that experience...it was scary..surreal ...dreamlike ...n haunting...like having a lucid dream..you cant get this feeling out of your head even after you finished watching it. And that's pure cinema ...its about affecting people at deepest corner of their emotional core...at their desires n subconscious mind something with they themselves can not explain or articulate but still feel it and feel it very intensely. This movie was was like that..expressly effective though i must say i found it scary first time around. I normally never find any ""ghost movies"" or ""gory movies"" scary ; what really scares me psycho thrillers ..and this was perhaps best psycho thriller since ""The shining"".But when i saw the movie second time my views were changed. The scariness was gone and you feel like watching a tragic love story. The sweetest love story of young girl filled with innocence and dreams in her who is broken in her soul...who is wants to love and be loved but instead gets cheated n hurt . Who is desperate to have a moment of happiness in her life but not sure is she will ever get it. Thats as tragic as it can get but just like eerie and surreal atmosphere affects you ..the sad tragedy of her life (which is using ""Hollywood "" as atmosphere here) affects you. At some level it is story of all of us ...big dreams shattered by harsh realities of unknown harsh materialistic entities of ""big world""which we never really understand as its always faceless ..(represented by the mafia shown in movie as formless , shapeless , incomprehensible but still affecting everything that she did). The mafia doesn't go out to hurt Betty ...they don't even know her ...but her life , her dreams , her love is shattered as unintended or indirect consequences of their actions. Doesn't that sound familiar to our life? some random act somewhere done by someone have a far reaching impact on our life which we were not even responsible for. This is what the song ""Na He banda"" perhaps means...no one one is playing the music ...its all going on ; while we live in an illusion that we control our life , in reality we being there or not being there doesn't really matter...music goes on. We control nothing about it ..we are as helpless and inconsequential about our own life like puppets in a show. Someone somewhere else is plotting our life and we have no clue who is doing it.The second aspect of this broken soul is loss of love. She wants to love and be loved back and what hurts her is not just that she lost her love but also got betrayed and person who cheated her doesn't even care about hurting her. Its like she takes some ghoulish pleasure is rubbing her wounds by kissing others inf front of her . That is as painful as it can get for someone who loses her love. Its not just feeling of losing love but anger at oneself for being with someone who never cared about you. Who doesn't care if you are hurt but instead enjoys it, the guilt , shame , frustration , agony of being with such a person is unbearable. It makes u hate yourself ..and see yourself as not being treated a human but a toy..a sex toy at worse...used n thrown. It is that despair n pain that prompts the ultimate desire to ease suffering by freeing the broken soul from this body. And that's what she does.What would any person think of just moment before they kill themselves? That I wish I had another life..A beautiful life ...where all my dreams had come true..in a parallel universe i am happy AND satisfied !! Where person i like is so dependent on me that he/she loves me unconditionally. (and hence altered reality lover Rita who is totally in love with her) That everybody loves me for my talent. That all my dreams are withing reach ( so successful auditions) , that anyone who hurts me gets punished for their karma (so director getting beaten up, being cheated n bullied) and everyone cares about you, likes you (so all nice people meeting Betty while they r rude to Diane). The movie is about the last dream of a broken soul. Its a sweet tragedy of broken dreams n broken hearts that ultimately makes you cry since you know this can be story of any one of us.To me this movie makes perfect sense, every single shot of it as this is exactly how I would feel about the life I wished I had, had I been killing myself. First time as i saw it as a mystery but when i saw it again as love story in a dream, it made a satisfying viewing! Something which cant be captured in words but only be felt ..and be felt right at our subconscious level.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You won't get it on the first watch,"Avant-garde director David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" is an eye-popping, sultry, mesmerizing experience that ultimately requires all kinds of mental gymnastics and deep thinking in order to solve a teasing, dare I say sexy, enigma. Certainly not for the casual moviegoer, Lynch employs candy-like colors, deep focus, and other optical tricks to disorient the viewer. Watching the film is as close as you'll get to hellucinating with out the aid of hellicinogens.To explain the story and plot in a way that would make sense would be impossible without completely giving it all away (not to mention several detailed paragraphs). Therefore, I'm just going to focus on the technical aspects. The acting is superb, with even the most minor characters delivering solid performances. Of course, Naomi Watts carries the film and truly demonstrates the caliber of her skills in a part that demands heavy emotions. The look of the film, as described earlier, is fantastic and endlessly interesting fascinated; you find yourself staring at the screen like a child in a toy store. The direction and writing is some of the best in recent cinematic history. Lynch somehow manages to continuously and relentlessly build suspense during even the most seemingly calm or mundane scenes, and the eerily twisted score by Angelo Badalamenti helps drive this constant feeling of anxiousness.I wish I could say a lot more about the film, but literally every aspect of it is so important and critical to understanding the film that to discuss it could spoil the experience.

Didn't work for me at all.,"Despite more than a little praise from the masses, and a general consensus which names this as Lynch's best (if not Blue Velvet), I have no problem with being cynical of Mullholland Dr.To call it bad would be an overstatement, but more than anything else, this motion picture is aggravating. It suffers a major case of over writing and direction. The scenario is utterly hammy, unbelievable, and badly acted with Lynch trying too hard to force his motifs on us that it gets annoying. Mullholland Dr. is very mean spirited towards Hollywood. Part of the movie feels like an attempt to flip off the concept of big studios and executives being nasty and indecent towards everyone. The other part of the film is pure surrealism. The whole thing doesn't come together well enough.Outside of Lynch Fan's, Mullholland drive 'may' be of interest to some others. Anybody who embraces films like David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch or John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness (with their out of this world storytelling that crosses into fantasy) may get a kick out of Mullhollond Dr.The film is artistic, no denying that, but unfortunately the end result proves to be pretty unlikeable.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Equally confounding and brilliant, and I cannot wait to watch it again","For as offbeat and idiosyncratic as the man's style generally is, David Lynch is not a filmmaker into whose works one can dive headfirst. In the very least, it's perhaps best suggested that one defer investigation until one has explored a considerable depth and breadth of cinema and opened themselves to all the possibilities of the medium. Take it from me: the first of Lynch's pictures I sat for was 'Lost highway,' and I was so flummoxed that it took me a long time to try another - notably including this, which has garnered a tremendous amount of acclaim from and since the time of its release. All these years later, though, after slowly seeing more of the director's oeuvre and loving it, I was ready to take a chance. And I'm so very glad I did: I won't pretend for one moment that I've found any more answers in 'Mulholland Drive' than other folks have, but this is a weird, wonderful ride that is absolutely worth investing some time in.It's truly a feature that one just needs to see for themselves; you can read what others have written about it, and their interpretations, but there is no understanding to be meaningfully gleaned from secondhand accounts. There are reasonable conjectures to be made, perhaps, and fragments of narrative of varying size, but watching this is not unlike looking for shapes in clouds, or examining ink blots - it really is a viewing Experience, with a capital ""E,"" and the substance isn't necessarily so much what we're given as what we subjectively, individually take away from it, or read into it. Emphasizing the point, for much of the length it seems like disparate story threads are possibly heading toward an intersection, building a mystery to be unraveled, yet when the turn in the ""plot"" comes, all conventional semblance of storytelling order is thrown into chaos. It's one thing to conjure a fictional mystery that fictional characters will solve within an allotted span of written pages or audiovisual minutes; what Lynch did with 'Mulholland Drive' was to concoct a film that is, itself, a mystery for audiences to scrutinize. How many writers, directors, or otherwise storytellers could ever make the same claim?Make no mistake, this is outwardly confounding. Honestly, it's inwardly confounding, too. But nothing here is sloppy or accidental; no matter how far-fetched, outlandish, out of place, or odd an inclusion might seem, it's all perfectly, carefully calculated, and executed with marvelous skill and finesse. The cast is roundly superb, with Naomi Watts and Laura Harring naturally standing out most in the chief roles; individually they illustrate tremendous nuance, range, and emotional depth, and together they have outstanding chemistry as scene partners. That's hardly to count out anyone else on hand, for even in smaller parts co-stars like Mark Pellegrino, Rebekah Del Rio, Angelo Badalamenti, and Justin Theroux definitely shine. Speaking of Badalamenti, the composer's score is terrific, a layer of somber, brooding ambience that adds to the overall dark airs about the title. Yet the tone actually does vary considerably here, from wry and dry, to sensual or passionate; from plainly funny to tense and thrilling; and everything in between - yet rather than feel scattered or disjointed, these tonal shifts kind of feel natural, like sands shifting in the winds of the whimsical ride on which Lynch takes us over these two and one-half hours.The stunts and effects are excellent; the costume design, hair, and makeup are lovely; the art direction is flavorful. Peter Deming's cinematography is smart and refined, Mary Sweeney's editing is sharp, and in addition to brilliant, focused direction at large, Lynch also demonstrates a keen eye for shot composition. This really is exceptionally well made in every capacity, and rather outshines many or even most fare that has been produced in the past twenty years. And as to the screenplay, well, it's as rich and enticing as it is enigmatic. The scene writing and characters are exceptional in and of themselves, and filled with endless possibilities - which is exactly the point, as the curious, imaginative narrative writing goes from loosely but increasingly cohesive to challenging our notions of what narrative fiction is, should be, or can be. With all this firmly in mind, I've watched some other films that I didn't ""get"" and while I could say with fair confidence that I enjoyed them, or at least appreciated them in some capacity, they left me nonplussed, and I had nothing more to say about them. Nor had I any especial interest in watching again. In contrast, in the case of 'Mulholland Drive' repeated viewings are both necessitated for how utterly enigmatic, challenging, and provocatively stimulating it is, inspiring us to return for more, and invited for how intoxicatingly vibrant, tantalizing, and obliquely satisfying it is. No, I don't know what to make of this, and here that makes me want to revisit it in the future.It's safe to say this won't appeal to everyone. This is not a movie for the casual viewer, for popcorn fiends who want the latest blockbuster or a tearjerker. It's a brainteaser, and not in the way of making us work to figure out the plot, but in the sense of making us work to find for ourselves whatever we may in the conglomeration. 'Mulholland Drive' is a celluloid road into nebulous, amorphous fog where, fueled by our own lived experiences, inclinations, and fancy, from one person to the next we might see something different within. That might make this 2001 modern classic a vexing irritant for some, but if you're ready and willing to see all the wide potential that cinema has to offer, this is a trip that's well worth taking again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I didn't like the story very much, but the way it's told is interesting","If you're a fan of David Lynch, skip this comment. Watch the movie instead, you'll love it.I don't think the story is very interesting. A young actress comes to Hollywood, starts a career, and has a love affair with another actress. Of course that's not the whole story, but most of it, and I think it could have been better.But the way the story is told is interesting in my opinion. The sequence of events isn't linear, and a lot of points weren't shown directly but through symbols. It was different from everything I've seen before.However, that doesn't make it a truly great movie in my opinion. Judging from what I've read, nobody or nearly nobody understood the meaning of it without watching it at least twice or without reading some hints (or full interpretations). That's not the way it should be in my opinion. The mystery should be solved at the end of the movie; that would be less frustrating. There were some other points that I didn't like. The first part has some dragging passages, and the second part seems rushed at some points. I guess it's because the first part was filmed as a TV-pilot but wasn't accepted and the second part was then added to make it a feature film; so the second part is much shorter than it was intended to be (too short in my opinion); it was intended to be a (mini-) series (see the 'trivia'-section). Perhaps the series would also have offered a solution (in addition to a better pacing).Though there are some good hints (in the movie) that may help one to find a good (or the right) interpretation, there are also some points that are too misleading in my opinion. For example, when Betty and Rita meet Diane's neighbour, she recognizes neither of them. That may be o.k. (and was probably intended) if you consider the context of that passage, but it's still too misleading in my opinion.All in all it's o.k., but could have been better in my opinion. I think if you like stories that are mysterious, symbolic, and different, and don't mind having to read an interpretation to understand it, this one is well worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I only have one good thing to say about this flick...,"...and that's ""Naomi Watts"". Lynch, in an apparent effort to stretch, appears to becomes obsessive about this noir nonsense which by all accounts is a huge movie but which exit polls at theaters would probably reveal to be a loser. Bottom line, I about fell asleep from boredom as Lynch took his own sweet time pulling together the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle which develops into just so much excessive silliness. On the up side Watts turns in a stellar performance and Lynch limps along with no big names. On the down side is everything else: No characters we can identify or empathize with; no hero or anyone we can care about; a shoddy convoluted plot which just gets more ridiculous as time wears on; etc..yadayadayada. Bottom line, this movie sucked except for the titillating nude chicks making out part which only engages the limbic system.

At first you might get a sense of a absurdist drama being directed on screen but by the end if you somehow figure out all the detail and hidden meaning Lynch has left through out each act you will get a grand film noir(as close to Sunset Blvd) ending that you will appreciate with each passing day and viewing leaving a immediate impact on your psyche and Hollywood dream as a whole.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mysteries of the Night,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is a mesmerizing and enigmatic journey into the dark underbelly of Hollywood, where dreams and nightmares intertwine in a surreal tapestry of mystery and intrigue. With its labyrinthine plot, haunting imagery, and mind-bending twists, the film offers a tantalizing glimpse into the hidden depths of the human psyche.Lynch's direction is both hypnotic and disorienting, as he guides viewers through a maze of shifting identities, fractured narratives, and surreal encounters. From the sun-drenched hills of Mulholland Drive to the shadowy corridors of Club Silencio, every scene is imbued with an eerie sense of unreality that keeps viewers on edge.At the heart of ""Mulholland Drive"" are the mesmerizing performances of Naomi Watts and Laura Harring. Watts delivers a tour de force performance as Betty Elms, a bright-eyed aspiring actress whose dreams of stardom are overshadowed by the dark secrets lurking beneath the surface. Harring is equally captivating as Rita, an amnesiac woman whose mysterious past becomes intertwined with Betty's quest for truth and identity.Thematically, ""Mulholland Drive"" explores themes of identity, desire, and the seductive allure of Hollywood glamour. As Betty and Rita navigate the treacherous waters of the entertainment industry, the film delves into the dark undercurrents of fame and fortune, revealing the price that must be paid for success in a world where illusion and reality blur.But perhaps the most remarkable aspect of ""Mulholland Drive"" is its ability to defy easy interpretation and invite viewers to engage with its mysteries on multiple levels. Lynch's surrealistic approach to storytelling challenges audiences to question their own perceptions of reality and invites them to uncover the hidden meanings lurking beneath the surface.In conclusion, ""Mulholland Drive"" is a haunting and hypnotic masterpiece that rewards repeat viewings with new revelations and insights. With its mesmerizing performances, surreal imagery, and enigmatic storytelling, it stands as a testament to Lynch's singular vision and his ability to captivate and confound audiences in equal measure.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

David Lynch's Culminate Magnum Opus,"As of this week, legendary filmmaker David Lynch has sadly passed away from emphysema. To commemorate his passing, I took it upon my myself to watch his 2001 acclaimed masterpiece, Mulholland Drive. Seeing it recently for the first time ever, I was astonished at how abstract yet relatable it was in showcasing the seediness of Hollywood and the downfalls that can come from actors trying to make it in the industry. Add on a strange mystery behind a sudden accident relating to the titular street boulevard, and you've got a recipe for fascination all around.Much of the film's intrigue comes courtesy of its lead actors, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, whom both have great chemistry in spite of their differing roles, both within the feature's subtext and context. It's next to impossible to find just one highlighted scene of their's that holds up well, since their impeccable dynamic keeps the film on on its shoulders. While there are many notable characters that play a part in both the film industry's shadiness and the mystery angle, Watts and Harring keep their roles alive well enough to make the experience worthwhile throughout.I don't know what else to add here that others haven't said before, but I can safely say that this film culminates Lynch's absurdist views on hopes and aspirations turned into a seething bleak reality done to near perfection. Even if you walk away confused, you won't forget this experience, and there's so much to interpret that any theories are welcome. Knowing full well that the now late Lynch would want us to discuss this film wholeheartedly through our own individual lenses, works like this make me feel happy that we can appreciate the surreal without feeling too challenged at the end of the day.Thank you Mr. Lynch for your contributions to art & cinema; may your legacy live on for those looking to be experiment the best way they know how.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great opening moments, but  self-indulgence and audience disrespect take over!","On the outskirts of Los Angeles a car accident results in a stunning young woman wandering the neighbourhood suffering from amnesia. Hiding in a bush she takes the chance to enter the apartment house of a departing stranger.David Lynch is a name that you almost have to pause after saying. He comes with more baggage than Elton John on a short skiing trip! While the man has something having (in my opinion) produced two great movies in The Elephant Man and Wild At Heart - and some others that are not at all bad. However he is in an extended period of disintegration and decay.His direction of Dune (a simple action movie that Lynch treated like it was a talk piece!) made his name in to an industry joke. Careers have been ended for less. Naturally he blamed others!I am a believer that the audience should have half a chance of understanding what is going on. At least things should be explained (hinted at even!) later. Lynch doesn't. I am not saying all cinema has to be linear, indeed many great movies are from that, but we deserve our chance because it is our money he wants (and don't tell him he doesn't because he tells interviewers that he is a staunch capitalist Republican).The story of how this film came from a junked TV series is actually clear from the length of one the actresses hair. It wouldn't grow that much in the course of any movie shoot! TV execs wouldn't pick it up for a reason, the reason being that you have to know what you are buying - how could they be anything other than confused? Only French (the people that think Jerry Lewis is a genius remember!) money saved the day.This world is full of movies and the fact that this is mediocre isn't anything unusual. The tragedy is that this could have been a classic with more control and better editing. The opening is really quite excellent and I hoped that Lynch had learnt his lesson and could keep it going, but no, he gets bored with it and starts his weirdness for the sake of weirdness trip. It isn't even original weirdness just bits culled from previous products.As we reach the end Lynch has decided that we don't even have to see what is going on and the soundtrack goes muddy at some points too. These things would be considered amateurish in other people's products, but skimmed over in the minds of many friendly critics. Before I try and solve a puzzle I have to believe that the puzzle is worth solving. This movie that isn't worth solving because no matter how much work you put in, I am sure I would find parts left over. There is no answer only theories.I am sad that the chance of a great movie has been wasted rather like a man stranded on a dessert island that has chopped up a boat to make a raft out of it. He prefers a raft to a boat - but should he be applauded for it?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A brilliant film, but it has a comprehensibility problem","As a collection of weird, intense vignettes, this is hard to top. But it has comprehensibility issues. The plot grabs one at first, and then takes a turn for the surreal. The ""it was all a dream/fantasy"" explanation appears to be the most popular one, but who knows? It contains some of Lynch's most striking images and memorable characters, and that is saying a lot.I read a long time ago that many more scenes were filmed than appear in this version, and that it was originally meant to be a televisions series, like Twin Peaks. I don't know how true that is, but I would like to see more of this if it exists. Maybe someday. I would also like to register my disappointment that Lynch mostly stopped making feature films after this, with the exception of the thoroughly loony Inland Empire.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Tripping Ride Mulholland Drive,"Mulholland Drive by David Lynch is a complex, surreal film that blends dream logic with psychological exploration, making its meaning intentionally ambiguous. Here's an interpretation of the movie that might help you piece it together:The Structure of the Film:
1. The Dream (First Two-Thirds of the Film): A fantastical, idealized version of reality.2. The Reality (Final Third): A harsh, fragmented depiction of the truth.The shift between these two parts can be disorienting, but it's key to understanding the story.The Characters:
Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn: Betty is the idealized version of Diane. In the dream, she is innocent, ambitious, and talented. In reality, Diane is a struggling actress filled with jealousy, regret, and despair.Rita/Camilla Rhodes: Rita is the mysterious, vulnerable woman in the dream. In reality, she is Camilla, Diane's ex-lover, who has left Diane for a film director.Adam Kesher (the Director): Adam appears both in the dream and reality, symbolizing Diane's feelings of powerlessness in Hollywood and her romantic jealousy.The Dream (First Two-Thirds):
This part represents Diane's subconscious attempt to rewrite her life:Diane creates Betty, a version of herself who is talented, kind, and full of potential. In this dream, she ""saves"" Rita, who represents Camilla, turning her into someone dependent and loyal.Adam Kesher, the director, is portrayed as incompetent and humiliated, reflecting Diane's bitterness toward him for winning Camilla's affection.The surreal elements, like the Cowboy and the blue box, symbolize Diane's guilt and suppressed trauma.The Reality (Final Third):
This part reveals the darker truth:Diane is a struggling actress who had an affair with Camilla, a more successful actress. Camilla leaves Diane for Adam.Consumed by jealousy and humiliation, Diane hires a hitman to kill Camilla. The blue key left on her table signifies that the murder has been carried out.Diane's guilt and despair over her actions manifest in hallucinations (e.g., the elderly couple) and ultimately drive her to suicide.The Ending:
The elderly couple, seen earlier as Betty's cheerful supporters, morph into grotesque figures chasing Diane. They symbolize her guilt and self-loathing, which she can no longer suppress.Diane shoots herself, unable to cope with her remorse and the stark reality of her life.Key Themes:
1. Dream vs. Reality: The film contrasts Diane's idealized dream with her harsh reality.2. Guilt and Regret: Diane's guilt over Camilla's death and her failed dreams overwhelm her.3. The Illusions of Hollywood: The movie critiques the superficial and cutthroat nature of the film industry.The film is intentionally fragmented, reflecting Diane's psychological breakdown. It's not meant to be fully ""solved"" but to evoke feelings of confusion, guilt, and longing-mirroring Diane's emotional state. Lynch's use of dream logic allows multiple interpretations, so your feeling of disorientation is exactly the point.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mastery in surrealism; one of, if not Lynch's' best film","And here I thought Inception was the best dream related movie I've ever seen.. Mulholland Drive easily takes the cake given how the plot is structured. From a general standpoint, no other film has left such a lasting impact on me like Mulholland Drive; it's dreamlike story which also boasts some unique horror elements have not left my mind since I've watched it and probably won't ever do so, which I'm not entirely opposed to.Lynchian visuals are always going to be one of the highlights of any Lynch film. In this case, the way light bounces off figures in certain long takes/sequences along with the ambient music masterfully composed by Angelo Badalamenti created a very dreamlike atmosphere. Almost whimsical in a way, but definitely foreboding in other aspects. Speaking of dreams, its just so impressive how David Lynch is able to completely blur the line between dreams and reality in this movie. For a fair portion of the film we're given fragments of a story then led to believe and care for it up until we as the audience are taken by surprise and given another narrative. The specific plot elements Lynch chooses to flip are so unexpected and thus more appreciated as well. However much we accept or reject the ""new"" reality is ultimately up to us but in the end, Lynch's message is a bit more clear. A film director who has a very specific idea for a story and sticks to it all the way through is deserving of all the praise they can get, especially when done in a successful fashion such as Mulholland Drive.The two biggest schools of thought about films are that they should either be politically and/or socially significant in its portrayal of certain relevant ideas or that films should depict a ""magical"" world that the viewer can immerse themselves into for a while and think on the experience afterwards. I didn't watch Mulholland Drive much more than I felt it. It's hard to contextualize my ideas because not only do I have almost no idea about what I'm saying, Lynch seems to favor the style of film making that's aimed towards making the audience feel things upon losing themselves in Lynch's world. From him using cinema to dig into the audience's psyche, I'm not surprised that some people can dislike this movie just as others, myself included, will absolutely love it and the idea of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Magnificent directing but a Lynch-hokum ending,"It's not so easy to get in the film. You have the time to make the most of the frames, the actresses... the directing to put it in a nutshell. Lynch builds several parallel stories round the main one and it pays off as several very good scenes: a funny one (the two guys discussing in the office or how to commit a clean murder), a very good one about acting (my personal favorite) and a very hot one (for that one I would perhaps forgive Lynch for all the mess he adds near the end).Unfortunately when you feel you like the story (that is when Lynch develops the main story without digression) it's blown by what I call Lynch-hokum. Something those who won't go back and watch Eraserhead are sure to dislike. It's like a mess in some very perturbed artist's brain. Something that doesn't interest me until it makes a masterpiece.For Mulholland Drive to be a masterpiece it would have to change for a less heavy-elliptic ending. As for me I don't care to be among those fans of Lynch who can't explain you this ending but just repeat he is a genius with popping eyes. If what Lynch wants to tell in the movie is too complex, well he can take more time or find some writer to finish a story he doesn't know how it shall come to an end.Overall a disappointment (as a full-fledged movie experience not as a Lynch movie - Eraserhead is very really much more annoying) on account of the last 20 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Lynch's best,"Betty (Naomi Watts in a fantastic performance) tries to help an amnesiac ""Rita"" (Laura Elena Harring) find out who she is.  There's a lot more than that to the plot, but you should see the film yourself to find out.  Almost as good as ""Blue Velvet"", this is David Lynch's newest mind trip.  It makes sense for an hour and 45 minutes (it was originally a pilot for a TV series that was rejected by ABC) but then things change drastically and images (and characters) go barelling out of control...but that's expected from Lynch. Characters and things change in very unexpected ways...alternate realities seem to step in.  Or do they?  This last section is wide open to interpretation--like the best Lynch films this demands multiple viewings. If you're a Lynch fan (like me) or if you like films that are adult and challenge you, go see it.  If not, stay away.  Also, there's a not so explicit lesbian love scene.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

They are naomi watts and laura harring and both are enjoyable to watch, in some places more than others. We also have adam played by justin theorux. A man thats a casting agent. The movie follows all three and does well and giving each character the time they need.

Ed Wood with a Budget,"This is the worst movie I have seen in a decade.  I tend to like so-called ""art films"" and don't have any need for all of the loose ends in a movie to be neatly tied up.

A masterpiece of cinema. No film has blown me away like this for years.,"Part Fellini's 8 1/2 part Bergman's Persona, the key to Mulholland Dr. is to imagine that you're dreaming. In your dream, you're with a good friend, but there's something different about them. You're in a house that's strangely familiar, but you're certain you've never been there before. Your friend leads you down a dark hallway and you follow. Something in your gut tightens. You stop and call out your friend's name, but you realize that you're alone. You can't breathe. You can see the light at the end of the hallway, a soft glow, and you know that something wonderful or terrifying (or both) is waiting for you just around the corner.That kind of uneasy excitement is what I felt throughout the entire running time of Mulholland Drive, which may be the best film David Lynch has ever made. Sure, Lost Highway captured the bleak, nonsensical feel of a nightmare lost in a huge, windy world, but Mulholland Drive reaches another level entirely, playing on the emotions with a ruthless precision that's absolutely stunning and makes you even go to extreme lengths to question your own sanity...a film that can achieve this deserves all the praise it gets.The film is centered around naïve, overly ambitious blonde named Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives in Los Angeles with dreams of becoming an actress. As Betty is settling in at her absent aunt's apartment, she walks in on a woman taking a shower who calls herself Rita. Rita was in a tragic car accident the night before (on Mulholland Drive) and she can't remember who she is or anything about herself. Betty takes a liking to Rita and offers to help her unravel the mystery. While Rita and Betty are embarking on Nancy Drew-style adventures of self-discovery, a film director (Justin Theroux) is ordered to cast a specific actress in his new movie (or else) by a cryptic cowboy who doesn't like smart alecks.Sounds simple? Well no. It certainly ain't, keep in mind, this is a David Lynch movie. In the last half of the film, a transformation process happens and everything is messed up. Nothing is clear, and every scene seems like assorted pieces to a puzzle that has been dropped all over the place. And that is what is so amazing; Mulholland is intriguing and will not fade on multiple viewings like many films of its kind. It becomes a completely different experience/interpretation every time.This is a movie that makes cinema feel exciting again. It takes you so deep into its world that it ceases being a movie and becomes an experience. It keeps you on edge, laughing in morbid delight at one moment, then recoiling in fear the next. Consider, for instance, the hilarious sequence in which a hit man's simple hit goes terribly awry, one little mistake starting a domino effect that causes things to go from bad to worse as he realizes that this just isn't his day. It is like being on a thrill ride, a roller coaster that has many different aspects, many different turns that evoke a new feeling each time.Mulholland Dr. is clearly going to go down as a cinematic masterpiece. It has become famous for its plot, and perhaps more so for its lesbian sex scene between Watts and Harring than has been discussed countless times. But there is more too it. Just go ahead and watch it, twice and then again. You wont be watching the same film all three times, I guarantee it.GRADE: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A puzzle best left unsolved.,"David Lynch's hallucinogenic journey opens during an unsettling hazy dream. A woman is turning and twisting restlessly in a dark bedroom, eerily followed by heavy breathing and silence. Only Lynch can make something
so simple seem so intriguing. Mullholand Drive is an exhilarating, psychological battle, not only the viewers, but for the characters the storyline follows. The film is broken in two halves. Firstly we see aspiring young actress Betty (Naomi Watts) arrive in Los Angeles to begin her acting career. She's like many actresses that are driven by the fantasy of fame, but are naive enough to want it beyond unknown consequences. She is unexpectedly joined by a woman who has escaped a car accident and isn't aware of her own identity. The pair unite in a compelling detective like mystery, both women becoming allured to each other as a stylish seductive twist takes place. The second half isn't as straight forward. In typical Lynch fashion, we see a lucid nightmare strangle the main star to reveal a puzzle that is best left unsolved.

The dialogue is the best I've seen in a Lynch film: well-paced and meaningful throughout.Narratively and thematically, this movie is very typically Lynch.  It is very reminiscent of _Lost Highway_, but better done and definitely scarier.

Of course, the less you know beforehand the better; that way, the more fun you will have putting the pieces of the jigsaw together.Performance of the year, too, from Naomi Watts in the pivotal role of Betty/Diane, robbed of an Oscar last year from a too timid Academy.

Mulholland Dr. (the truth),"The truth behind the meaning of a film is, simply, to watch it. David Lynch is a genius in the realm of filmmaking. Mulholland Dr, for what it is, may be considered a masterpiece, a piece of crap or just a regular film. But in all honesty, it is what you make it.Lynch is a man that isn't going to give you a simple explanation to a film's meaning, he wants you to decide that for yourself. Because in almost all of David Lynch's films he not only writes, but directs plots and situations that give the viewer a sense of confusion. A sense that not everything is meant to be understood. And he is good at it.A film is something of an abstraction. A puzzle that is made broken to be solved, not by the director, but by the viewer(s).David Lynch makes the kind of film that you can watch over a million times, only to find hidden clues that you didn't see the first million times that can chronologically, and inevitably change your insight of the films purpose.I have seen ""Mulholland Dr."" over and over, and I can for one say the film could be about one of many things. David Lynch is a man who doesn't believe in telling people what the his films mean to him, because thats just his opinion out of another six billion.A film is meant to be strange, obscure, and even abstract to the viewers. Because if a film was to give one and only one purpose of meaning to the minds of everyone's imagination, there would be no diversity. No mystery. and that's what ""Mulholland Dr."" is.

"No film is ""overrated""","Its interesting to read the comments left by IMDB users towards this film. People will either love it, hate it, or be too puzzled to figure out how they feel towards it.  I enjoy reading people's interpretations of the film, but most of the comments are frustrating.  A lot of the movie's criticizers have managed to convince themselves that the movie is overrated; that it is only praised so that people can feel ""artsy"" and intellectual.  Some of the fans of the movie are no better.  Many say things like ""Only the people who have a high IQ can solve this enigma"".  How wrong they are.A low IQ has nothing to do with how much a person dislikes ""Mulholland Drive.""  Most of the people who hate this movie most likely either (a) don't know how to approach it, (b) refuse to view it with an open mind and/or with a sense of wonder, or (c) simply aren't used to this kind of movie.Most anti-fans of the film are quick to judge those who like it as ""pompous"".  But, honestly, what could be more pompous than assuming that, because you were incapable of enjoying the film, nobody else can?  The word ""overrated"" pops up quite frequently when this film is being discussed. Personally, I don't believe that such a term is fitting to any movie. ""L'avventura"" doesn't interest me in the slightest bit, but that doesn't mean it's overrated, it means that the movie doesn't fit my tastes. ""Overrated"" is simply a term for those with too much pride to admit that they didn't like a highly rated movie.I think the main reason of why so many people can't appreciate ""Mulholland Drive"" is because they haven't been introduced to Lynch's style.  What people often don't realize is that a movie really doesn't have to make the slightest bit of sense, nor does it have to be understood, but it can still be just as amazing of an experience.  Does ""Mulholland Drive"" make sense? Is there a puzzle to uncover?  As discouraging as it is to some, I would guess that the film really is more abstract than people like to think it is. Much of the movie is part of the television pilot, and the rest of it, Lynch admits, were supercaffeinated brainstorms and last minute ideas. Personally, It really doesn't make a difference to me.  I love the film nonetheless.What is there to love about this film?  The dreamlike atmosphere.  The variety of different storylines and moods.  But the greatest moments in movies are almost always without dialogue.  They are moments when the music fits the visuals so perfectly that one has a mild feeling of euphoria. Lynch has a gift for creating this kind of moment, and ""Mulholland Drive"" may be the ultimate example of this ability of his as a filmmaker.  The opening credits for example has us following a lone car late at night. These images are so fitting to Angelo Badalamenti's music that one feels overwhelmed by it's beauty.  Of course there are dozens of other moments like this in the movie, and there are also great scenes made up entirely of dialogue.I don't expect anyone who hated ""Mulholland Drive"" to have read any of my comments, but I wish that those that disliked the movie so strongly would give it another chance.  Don't try to make any sense of it; just sit back and let yourself be immersed into a totally sublime cinematic experience.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent movie in parts.,"First one and half hour of this movie is excellent. Very fine acting by Naomi Watts. This movie reminded me of a story by W S Maugham, where the main character is trying to escape from his murderer, the story is written in first person, and in end he describes, how he was killed. This, in my opinion, though a good experiment, but kind of deceive the reader.Same is true for this movie in a way; in end 30 minutes you realize that what ever you have seen so far, an excellent and engaging plot, is either a dream sequence or a fantasy.The scene where Hollywood director is persuaded to cast the lead actress by Cowboy (an underworld person) reminded very much Mario Puzo's Godfather; only difference, it was better.Over all, I would say this movie is still worth watching, just on merit of first one and half hour.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bizarre and beautiful,"Before I saw this film I hadn't seen any of David Lynch's work though I was well aware that he is an individualist with a flair for the surreal. This movie was like a breath of fresh air to me. If you're sick of the cookie-cutter films trotted out of Hollywood ad nauseam these days then ""Mulholland Dr."" is the cure.One of the keys to this film is the look. I don't even know how to describe it, so no wonder his films have their own adjective (Lynchian). More often than not the stellar visuals are paired with audio that complements them perfectly. The performance of the Spanish-language version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" is one such example.The performances are all first-rate, with the two female leads being especially noteworthy. I don't know quite what to make of the plot but, boy, what a ride. This is one I'm definitely going to have to see again in order to sort out the details but, strangely, I enjoyed it immensely even though the latter developments utterly baffled me. That is the strength of the film's dream-like quality; it is so satisfyingly surreal that accurate interpretation is merely an afterthought.If you're the type of viewer that sticks to prosaic box office hits then this movie isn't for you. However, if you're looking for something with a little more depth and verve, this film delivers those in spades.Addendum (November 29, 2008): Upon seeing this film for a second time recently I have to admit that it did not hold up as well as I had hoped. Inevitably, much of the suspense had been drained, which hurt the film's atmosphere. That is a problem for a film that basically requires multiple viewings in order to make any sense out of it. So, I stand by my rating of 9 for the initial viewing but cannot deny that repeated viewings do not hold quite the same appeal. Therefore, my rating for a repeated viewing (should you choose to partake of it) would be an 8.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Controversial but breathtaking movie,"First of all, I want to say that it is a movie that takes your breath away.You watch it keenly from beginning to end but it is highly certain that you will be confused.In fact every part of the film has an importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time.While you are watching it,you feel that you are trying to solve a complicated puzzle.Everything falls to you to solve the puzzle.Namely,understanding the movie.For that reasons,I respect for the quality of work that was done in writing and filming it.This movie makes you be open minded to entering a dream world where things are so real and at he same time so unreal.David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to struggle with everything beneath that. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible.Thus.it worths watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Afraid to bad-mouth this movie? Don't Be...,"An pathetic attempt to imitate the plot switcheroo of ""The Usual Suspects"". But without any of the character development, and no characters that you can care about.  The plot switcheroo at the very end has nothing to do with the excruciating hours that preceed it.These types of films should only be attempted by those capable of subtlety. David Lynch has none, as one can plainly see by the coarsely integrated acting. Like so many other minor moments of this movie, it is a poorly executed attempt at suspense, that is not done by gradually building rapport with the viewer and proceeding with a momentum that has you wondering ""where it will go?"", but rather by tediously stagnating at a point until you are wondering ""when will it move on?"".It also demonstrates how NOT to do mystery.  A good mystery would lead the viewer through a series of incremental insights that when realized awe the viewer with how tied together the whole story is.  What is unknown to the viewer in this flop throughout it's plot is the plot itself, which is unrelated to the majority of the film itself.It is a pathetic attempt at ""Jacob's Ladder"" but without the directing skill needed to capture the existentialism. As far as it's existential qualities go: it has none.  It's moments aren't filled with an experience of any kind. It's moments are focused on the tedious suspense, and the big question of ""Why this experience at this time?"" whose answer is ultimately randomness, or a contrived purpose which can only be explained by the author.  Any experience that might escape that, fails to escape the horrible acting.I laugh at the fact it was recommended to me by someone who hated it also, but was afraid to bad-mouth it because want to admit that he didn't get it.

Mesmerizing. Terrifying. Fascinating. One of the best films of this decade,"Wow. Simply wow. Words cannot describe Mulholland Dr. Probably because I simply cannot explain the whole plot. I am prepared for the worst when I say this, but I had never watched a David Lynch film before this. Yes, it is crazy to say, but it's the truth. However, after having watched his first film, I am completely fascinated and mesmerized by it. I have watched confusing and surreal films before, like Donnie Darko and Memento, but this must be the highest anyone can go in terms of an interwined plot. The acting is great. Naomi Watts was robbed of an Oscar nomination, and this goes to show how great of an actress she is. In some of her scenes depicting lust and sensual feelings, she is completely captivating, I could not help but feel lust towards her. The direction is amazing. The film gathers a mysterious and dream-like vibe, with some amazing music and some great cinematography. The film cannot be described in terms of words, but one thing is for sure, it is a masterwork, and the definition of true cinema.",,Anonymous,Mystery
No Blue Velvet but still a Lynch movie,"Mulholland Drive has a very surreal structure which is the central part of the movie. If you like the surreal narration of David Lynch and aren't too afraid of mediocre acting, you might like this movie, because that's what Mulholland Drive's mystery is all about: Who's who and how are the different situations related.There is something in Mulholland Drive that gives all the madness some kind of logical meaning; but first of all it makes you more distanced from the actions in the movie contrary to Blue Velvet which was surreal, too, but still very serious, near and frightening, since in Mulholland Drive it's all some kind of hazy dream; and second I'm personally not too fond of movies that MUST have some kind of meaning to it. If you hated Videodrome because it was too confusing and it didn't make sense, you might like Mulholland Drive where the craziness make sense and don't pull you too much into the story.Mulholland Drive is definitely a Hollywood movie with Hollywood actors but it tries to move away from the Hollywoodness by having a critical view on Hollywood movie making, but in my opinion Mulholland Drive doesn't succeed in this the way for example Adaptation does; mainly because of Naomi Watts and Laura Harring. The selection of actors has a Lynchian kind of irony to it but in Mulholland Drive it is far too obvious.If you are mostly in to very mainstream movies, Mulholland Drive might be a nice change which still isn't too hard to digest, but if you are mostly in to movies that are a bit more crazy, this might be too mainstream.Mulholland Drive isn't too bad if you take it for what it is: A light version of a David Lynch movie, but personally this movie just makes me like Blue Velvet much more, since it reveals all the mistakes Lynch avoided making in that movie.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Interacting with the spectator,"In this movie David Lynch follows the same path that gave us ""Twin Peaks"" or ""Lost Highway"" with the same criss-cross pattern of appearance and reality, dream (sometimes nightmare) and verity, sanity and madness, humour and drama, sentiment and coldness. But the atmosphere in ""Lost Highway"" was much more consistent and dense than here, keeping us all the time stuck to our seats in awe and suspense during the whole projection. This movie although made with talent, shows some weak points and some gaps in the story structure and in the criss-cross combination of several stories and possible clues of the plot. As usual in most of Lynch's movies the plot which requires the spectator's complicity to get to a possible solution that he himself can chose and discover in some kind of interaction. Lynch's talent is also present in the slow camera travellings in which it acts like one more character, accompanied by a terrific and obsessingly oppressive sound track making apparently harmless scenes appearing ominous. This style that consists in telling a story in which the conducting thread loses itself and is here and there broken in episodes that seem to have no relation to it, coming to the extreme of an almost complete rupture like it happens here in the last scenes of the movie, has much to do with the technique of the French school of the ""nouveau roman"" in which each scene has its own value and meaning leaving its interpretation and integration in the global plot to the reader. In short, I think that Lynch doesn't keep in this movie the density of his previous movies but even so it's worth to be seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Greatest movie ever (for whom can understand it),"I can't actually know where to begin. This is an aswesome Lynch masterpiece and it's like some other world's movie.

Mulholland Dr.,"No piece of art has ever had as profound an impact on my life than Mulholland Dr. I say, in a very literal way, that Mulholland Dr. changed my life.I had never looked at cinema as an art form before, I actually had hardly looked at cinema before. I grew up in a single parent home with a childhood filled with independence and responsibility. Needless to say, there was no time for films or television. I was that person on the other side of mouth open stares hearing ""how have you never seen (insert film name here)"" I don't begrudge my childhood, I read a lot and enjoyed time with my friends, started working at a young age and never through about movies much. I was always out of the pop culture loop all the way through high school. I worked more than full-time in politics before college which led me to start my undergraduate work when I was 20. I took enough credits to need a signature from an academic adviser and in all the hustle of meetings and trying to gain approval for taking on so many hours I had forgotten even signing up for what I thought the most inconsequential class would be: Introduction to Film Studies.Mulholland Dr., which many consider David Lynch's masterpiece, is even gaining traction as one of the best films ever made. Released in 2001, Mulholland Dr. stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. The film follows a woman after a car accident leaves her amnesiac with her only lifeline being a naive woman who just moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of being an actress after winning a dance contest in her hometown. The longer the two women are together the more they discover more about the murder attempt against the amnesiac woman who has taken to calling herself Rita (Laura Harring) Her naive friend Betty (Naomi Watts) looks at the whole ordeal as an adventure despite the fact that Rita's life hangs in the balance. Rita is even willing to put her acting dreams aside to attend to Rita and engage in some amateur sleuthing.From my first viewing, I have never cared whether or not I understood what was going on in Mulholland Dr., nor did I ever look at the plot as a puzzle that needed to be pieced together. I enjoy what David Lynch does with his art and am pleased to simply experience his output. Of course, at this point in my life, I have whizzed through Lynch's entire filmography multiple times, and even through Mulholland Dr. isn't my favorite Lynch film, I have no problem admitting that it is probably his masterpiece. Lynch was on another level. Every aspect, each scene is perfect visual mastery. The one place that I find the most resistance to the perfection of the film are the people who claim that the opening scene is ""weird for the sake of being weird"" and unnecessary to the film. I wholeheartedly disagree with that assessment. The scene shows an insight into just how naive Betty was because we see her seem to truly believe that winning this dance contest was going to open doors in Hollywood for her. One of my favorite aspects of David Lynch's work is the fact that throughout his entire filmography you can see a similar thread running through each of his features yet he is not that director that is trying to recreate any of his previous films. I appreciate the newness of each of Lynch's films yet the familiarity of what I love about his work. I can't think of a more introspective filmmaker more capable of exploring an individual's failings in life and how it could have played out differently had career aspirations been realized better than David Lynch. The way in which he displays repressed fears and mixes past and present, proving part of our memories to be false is not only an exceptional example of filmmaking but an exceptional example of artistry. It's incredible, on paper, nothing about Mulholland Dr. seems as if it will make sense, yet the complete product is perfect. The seamless way Lynch transitions between two realizations of a life is incredible. David Lynch is my all-time favorite filmmaker, yet, I find that I must be in the proper mindset to enjoy many of his films. Mulholland Dr., however, while it is not my favorite Lynch film, is one that I can watch anytime and will always be all-in on. Fun fact: my personal favorite tracking shot in cinema history is tucked inside Mulholland Dr., the shot into Club Silencio is just beautiful. The whole film is incredible, and I firmly believe it is one of the best films of all-time. I don't know what my life would be like if I hadn't accidentally ended up in a film class on a semester when a Lynch film was being screened. I became a cinephile because of Mulholland Dr. and I couldn't be more thankful to Lynch and his art for inspiring that change in my existence. I am so thankful to David Lynch for Mulholland Dr., more thankful to David Lynch for Eraserhead, and the most thankful to David Lynch for bringing cinema alive to my eyes and heart.I never did take that Shakespeare course, but I did take three more film studies courses.

Enjoyable but as futile as its narrative,"I really enjoyed this film most of the way through. It is well-made and entertaining but what is it all about? I see it as a mash-up of the dreams that Hollywood inspires and how they can both come true or turn into nightmares. It doesn't really matter what the names of any of the characters are, and even their roles are interchangeable as yet more aspiring stars arrive to have their dreams put through the mill every day. It could turn out any and all ways for each of them. The obvious character to examine arrives in LA fresh off the plane but even more established characters in Hollywood like the director are being turned inside-out day in, day out all the way through the film. How many of the characters are trying to live their dreams in hope (or dread) of them coming true? There is much more that can be said about the film, and many interesting theories about how the narrative can make sense in a less abstract sense exist, but I don't consider it worthwhile to pursue any of these. Regardless of how the it came into being, it must be considered on its own as a whole film. That is where it falls down: it is so deliberately opaque that it is an affront to the audience and deserves to be treated with a proportionate amount of contempt. Not so much that the film falls below the enjoyable, diverting and watchable - just enough that it doesn't deserve all of the analysis that is has gotten. There are similarities to Sunset Boulevard, but that film is so much more focused, and ultimately has something to say about Hollywood that is tangible and not so deliberately confused as to be worthless.By all means watch this film, enjoy it, dissect it. There is fun even in the dissection, but I feel that if you do not approach it in the spirit of mockery, you allow the film to make a mockery of you... and perhaps that's what it sees you deserve for being the root cause of all the fakery that results from so many trying to present a pleasing image for some audience or other.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mulholland Drive,"I do like movies that at least make some sense. ""Mulholland Drive"" made no sense except at the beginning of the movie and gave me a headache. I did enjoy certain scenes in the movie but that did not make up for the fact the further I got into the movie the less sense it made to me. Kudos to Naomi Watts for her terrific acting job, however. After years I thought I'd finally give this a watch. I can see what Lynch was trying to do and it's what he does best. However, there were a lot of things that were a bit of a cop out or unnecessary. Movie could have been 60 minutes. Looks like a TV movie in certain parts. The building of tension is good in some scenes and if you're a fan of having to interpret the mind of Lynch then great - sometimes it does feel though that people like this because it's cool to like it - ask them to explain the full plot and I doubt many could. I guess that's why movies are subjective. None of this film made any sense whatsoever. I had to Google it after to find out what exactly happened and you shouldn't have to do that after a film - it should explain things at least a very tiny bit but this explained NOTHING. One very overrated film that was nothing but a messy mixture of weird scenes that didn't connect and characters that never got explanations.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Typical Lynch nonsense masquerading as clever and meaningful,"If I were a film-maker, I honestly believe that I could conceive of a number of disconnected and unrelated scenes for a movie (let's say 85 of them), each starring some or all of the actors I'd managed to persuade to be in my movie.I could then just throw the whole pot full of scenes together in random editing and then just leave it to those who see the movie to invent its meaning, a meaning that was entirely absent in its conception.And there, ladies and gentlemen, you have David Lynch. Certainly, in my opinion, one of the most over-rated directors ever.Mulholland Drive is a mish-mash of nonsense that makes no rational sense at all. For just one of many examples, what the Hell was the purpose, or even the symbolism, of that bloody midnight cowboy?Unfortunately for me, and unlike the Rita character, I will retain a memory of MulHolland Drive.

Mind-Bendingly Brilliant,"Whatever one might make of the mysterious meanings behind David Lynch's enigmatic neo-noir, one thing is almost inarguable about Mulholland Drive: Every second of it is perfectly rendered into a beautifully spooky Rubik's cube of a movie. At the heart of it's narrative lies a young woman apparently named Bettie. She has travelled from Cananda to pursue a fairy-tale like career as a movie star in Hollywood. Upon her trails she encounters a dark haired woman who, after suffering a car crash, has a case of amnesia. Agreeing to help the woman regain her true consciousness, the movie then proceeds to unravel a simmeringly dark tale of reality and unreality, within the realms of movie stardom. Or perhaps not. Since Lynch remains tight-lipped about the movie's true interpretation (if there really is one) even if you find yourself completely bewildered by the mind-bending narrative, don't let that get in the way of your sheer enjoyment of this feature. It is mesmerising stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sorrow at the heart of it,"Years ago this movie was aired – late one night – on a local TV station. Perhaps it was the hour, perhaps it was its brilliance, but I remember sighing out an emphatic 'What the fack??' I watched it again the next day; it failed to lessen my confusion. I watched it again the next day and I found that as my confusion faded my fascination began to creep up higher and somewhere along the way my understanding and appreciation for Mulholland Drive began to settle in – an understanding and appreciation which are still growing today – almost ten years down the line. There really is no other film quite like this David Lynch masterpiece; never before has a movie gotten into my head the way this did, and never since. It's a cerebral exercise that insists on multiple viewings to be truly realised, and its complexities will never cease to inspire.We are introduced to 'Rita' (Laura Elena Harring) in the opening scenes of the film, being the lone survivor of a car crash on Mulholland Drive; she stumbles her way into town and ends up taking residence in an apartment of a woman departing on a trip. The apartment belongs to Betty's (Naomi Watts) aunt. As it unfolds we learn that 'Rita' is in fact not 'Rita' at all – she can't remember who she is, suffering amnesia from the crash. So Betty decides to help her find her true identity and as they tread along the path of discovery, they find something darker lurking in the unknown. Much more, I cannot really say, as I feel it would detract from the discovery and interpretations you – as a viewer – must make for yourself.I will, however, share what the film meant to me, and keep in mind that this is simply my opinion, what I took away from the film; whether it's 'right' or 'wrong' or something you find you can't agree with – I will afford you that. It's a story of sadness; of dreams gone wrong; of loss of trust and loss of faith – of oneself; fractured realities. I found it to be, at the heart of it, a beautifully melancholy story, and this was really something I only found with the denouement. It was then that I realised the pervasive, dark sorrow on which the film hung itself. It explores often the very tenuous divide between love and hate and how so very easily those two emotions are confused. The characters are driven by their own desperation, whether the motivation lies in selfishness or spite or heartache, and the hurt that transpires from those acts – at least in the latter part of the film, anyway. It speaks of longing for something that – deep down – you know you will never have, and through that desire you find that even the most meagre pieces of that something will satisfy, even if ultimately it leads to an even deeper state of despair. There is a scene where, one night, Harring takes Watts' hand, and I felt that to be a profound gesture; I think it's overlooked of how much trust, how much hope, can go into the taking of another's hand, and just how devastating it can be to let that hand go. It is also a movie of the darkness which I believe breathes in every one of us, and how close we really are to embracing it. And while perhaps - for the most of us – we would never consciously and wilfully act on those shadowy impulses, there is always a dark fantasy world in which we would happily play.Technically it is, of course, rather extraordinary. Lynch is a master when it comes to infusing a surreal sense of dread into his scenes; even with the bright sunshine over Los Angeles you can't really help but feeling unsettled, because inherently you know something just isn't quite right here. Add to that Badalamenti's score and what you're left sitting with is a breathing, waking nightmare you're almost thrilled to be a part of. Harring and Watts are brilliant with their dual roles and frankly, why Watts was overlooked for most of the major awards will always be something that confuses me.And lastly: Mulholland Drive also boasts what is to me, one of the finest scenes ever committed to film: Rebekah del Rio's exquisite rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' ('Llorando'); this scene never fails to (literally) send shivers up and down my spine, and really epitomises the entire theme of the film: loss.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

On the other hand, if you like a movie that forces you to exercise your mind, develop your own theories, opens the door wide for interpretation, and leaves you wondering about what it really means for days, then MD is probably going to be your cup of tea.

"Get ready for Mulholland Drive, a drive you won't easily forget","David Lynch's never finished TV project/pilot turned into this movie, Mulholland Drive (2001) after more money was given by new producer and additional scenes filmed and the whole thing re-edited. I agree with Lynch that it is perhaps better not quite understand everything completely in the mystery, because if so, we lose something inside ourselves even if we don't know it. I won't go into trying to explain what exactly happens in the story and who is after all who, I will write about this piece of cinema and what Lynch has managed to give us this time with the magic of his art; his films are much more than just solving new and complex mysteries.Without spoiling anything, I can only tell that Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring) are the two leads here. Betty is a young and excited girl traveling to Hollywood for hope of the film role of her life as she arrives to her aunt's apartment in the City of Dreams..Or nightmares? Soon after she meets the mysterious Rita unexpectedly in an unexpected place, the latter state of the City seems more valid. More characters are introduced all the time, many think it is gratuitous and just mixing the viewer's mind little more but that's not the case: if the viewer accepts to sit through the film with care and really concentrate on it, it all makes sense and all the happenings and characters are given explanations for their existence and motives, no matter how mysterious they seem, look and are.Of course the two leads are incredible and beautiful as angels again. Lynch loves beauty and purifying and relieving elements in his films, and usually they are in the form of a beautiful and sensitive female. Betty's light on the top of her head in the beginning really tells who is going to be the angel of the show in that side of the reality and consciousness. But what's the strongest element of beauty and stunning atmosphere in the film is the music by Angelo Badalamenti and how the camera goes with the music and sounds already familiar with Badalamenti from the earlier films he's composed for Lynch. It is not hard to shed some tears during these scenes of cinematic magic and sensitivity, and Twin Peaks also is a great example of this. Lynch and Badalamenti really are extraordinary couple giving power to each other's work and effort, and the result is always larger than life and worth the shed tears and moments of total amazement.The cinematographer Peter Deming has shot also films like Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and more recently From Hell (2001) for the Hughes brothers and their Jack the Ripper adaptation with some gorgeous images and settings in the London in which Hell and terror was on the loose in the form of human being. Deming's work in Mulholland Drive is also extraordinary with the incredible scenes shot at night and especially inside apartment(s). The scene in which Rita and Betty suddenly experience ""something"" which makes them wake at night is among the most outstanding bits of camera work I've ever seen as the ""living darkness"" is completely under control of Lynch and the cinematographer. It is about little things that the whole scene would go into a messy blur and nonsense, but not in this case, because in Lynch's films, darkness and menacingly empty and lightness rooms are important characters even though the film's human characters don't necessarily know it, and most importantly, Lynch controls this darkness and emptiness all the time so there's nothing there which isn't supposed to be there.Lost Highway has some incredibly shocking and frightening images and segments even though it is not any horror film. Lynch can create menacing and scary images and illusions of things which are not menacing or scary themselves, normal old human beings for example. But in Lynch's world, even the most familiar and safe things may turn into threatening monsters who will haunt you if they are not kept in the darkness and in the other side. Some scenes in Mulholland Drive are also stunningly powerful and scary with the strong usage of soundtrack and other elements which give Lynch's cinema its power. A dead body itself isn't necessarily scary or evil, but if human nature's evil sides have been activated and used, then nothing is safe or trustworthy and definitely not dead and harmless.That is again one theme in the film, or one theme I managed to find after just one theatrical viewing. Mulholland Drive has bad thoughts and deeds by its characters because selfish and bitter human being is weak and grabs a gun. This element of evil is strong, but it is also (occasionally, not all the time) handled with almost surprisingly obvious irony as, for example, one little criminal loser really messes things up at the beginning of the film! That cannot be seen seriously nor it is meant to be; During these scenes, Lynch really wants to smile at himself in the mirror, and also the brief discussion between Robert Forster and other police officer at the beginning isn't the less memorable bit of that irony! Maybe..Mulholland Drive is also a film about sweet love which turns into a series of jealousy and wicked thoughts which lead to wicked deeds. Love can be a beautiful thing, but human nature and world can destroy it and its participants. Even in that situation man should know what ""love"" is as he/she decides how to react to the situation, but in Lynch's world humans can be and are as rotten inside as in real world and thus the nightmare has its roots created. In Lynch's films there are always the characters who seem to be completely good and pure (Betty) so all his characters are not necessarily evil and wicked, not even inside and ""un-actively."" Still the message from his films about humans and our nature comes very clearly visible through those elements of wickedness and evil which are contrasted with the elements of purity, how things fortunately can and could be.Mulholland Drive is another piece of Lynch magic which can be and desires to be seen and experienced several times without losing any of its power and importance as an achievement of cinematic surrealism. This should be seen definitely on big screen but sadly too often after the theatrical run that is not possible, but if in the future the possibility occurs, then I'd warmly recommend to take advantage of it for all those who understand and appreciate Lynch's work, as he, too, did and does his films to be seen in the theatre, because there his soundtrack and imagery achieves their full impact and level of the beyond, which cannot fully be achieved in home on video. Lynch takes us every time to his weird and wonderful (and often very horrific) world which isn't too far away from our safe and familiar place we live in every day. Another 10/10 miracle for David Lynch.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a masterpiece,"It seems to me that there is a sort of ongoing fight between people that have been genuinely moved by the film, gushing about it, and people who hated the film and think that anyone who liked it is saying they 'get it' to feel intellectually superior to those who didn't like it (this is absolutely ludicrous).To all of the naysayers out there-you don't have to like the film.  You don't, and you are completely entitled to voice your dissent.  The problem I've been noticing from negative reviews, though, is an almost complete ignorance of what goes into filmmaking.  People seem to only be talking about the 'message' of the film, or lack thereof.  Other things that make the film everything that it is-sound design, cinematography, editing, imagery, etc.-seem to not even matter.This is David Lynch.  Criticizing his movies for not having a linear narrative is like criticizing a football player for not hitting a home run. Stanley Kubrick once said that an artist feels his films, he doesn't think them, and I believe this.  I think the people who say things like 'he cannot tell a story', or 'he is weird for the sake of being weird' are just dismissing the film.  They're engaging in the intellectual snobbery that they accuse others of, because if they can't find an easily identifiable 'message' or something that makes them feel like they've been thinking for the past two hours, they dismiss it as trash.  Meanwhile, David Lynch is working on an intuitive level, not an intellectual one, and so people looking for a 'Usual Suspects'-type plot or even something like 'Memento', where things can be pieced together, are looking in the wrong place.  It's apples and oranges.That being said though, I think that intuitive filmmaking is a much more powerful and effective use of the tools the cinema provides.  Lynch can capture, better than any other director I've ever seen, the feeling of dreams and the powerful and almost unspeakable emotions that come with them. It's like when you have an incredibly powerful dream that moved you in ways you never thought you could be moved, and then you try to articulate that feeling to a friend and can't even come close to accurately describing what you felt.  The same is true with Lynch's films, especially, in my opinion, this and Fire Walk With Me.  And you don't need to.  The idea that movies have to give you some sort of message and have a linear structure that actually ends at a specific point is an idea that stuffy pop film critics have given the American public, and it's just not true.  In terms of sheer artistry, and a near-perfect grasp of every single element of the cinema, Mulholland Drive is leagues ahead of a film like American Beauty, but which one has the best picture nomination?Anyway, just pouring out some of my feelings on what I feel is Lynch's best film to date (although he has no bad films, with the exception of Dune). The reason that people who hate this film see no value in it is because they immediately dismiss it as 'weird' instead of just surrendering to it.  You feel it, and the emotional payoff is more of an experience than anything I've seen in theatres in a long time.  Lynch always says that the last reel of a movie should play out in the viewer's head, and that is the case here. He avoids specific meanings of things because this allows the viewer to project their own subconscious thoughts onto the proceedings, making it a personally different experience for every viewer, and I can't think of a better way to describe 'art'.I'm not going to say anything about what happens in the actual movie, because it's all been said, but I will say that Lynch is one of the most creative, fertile, valuable artists we have living today, and everyone should be at least a little appreciative.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

wildly confusing and lacking a deeper meaning,"This movie was supposed to have an ocean of depth, instead I found it shallower than a kiddie pool.  Recently, we have been getting these types of movies, abstract, dark, ""deep"" movies that are supposed to lead all the intellects to the theaters, this one was one of them and it was a flop.  The characters and the situations are different and interesting, the videotaping wasn't bad, it wasn't the actors either it was the story.  The story lacked something that a script needs and deserves, sense.  This isn't bloody Alice in Wonderland! This was portrayed in a real place and since we're not all hooked on opiates we can't all understand it's deeper meaning!  I found it's biggest problem was it was generally confusing.  I spent half the film trying to understand what was going on, and then, they decide to change everyone's names, which made it worse.  It's just another example of Hollywood trying to create a dark, uber-foreign type movie and it didn't work.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Love or hate? What about in between.,"First off, almost all reviews here are 1 or 10.. That's just plain silly.This is a decent movie. Perhaps not as intriguing or interesting as I had hoped. Sure, the ""twist"" is not bad, but that's just one part of the story. The weirdness in this movie is also not bad but not near perfect. I guess Lynch could have made some of the dialog a bit less unpretentious. They sometimes comes out so perfect you can't help but thinking of the written lines. I wasn't really captured by the movie experience, nor was I bored. I have to admit that even without the fact that it's supposed to be a acclaimed movie, I felt the lack of interesting characters.

The movie takes off in a bizarre direction (and I use the term direction very loosely) and never makes any attempt to reconnect.  The movie may be thought-provoking, but I don't think David Lynch deserves any credit for creating a confused audience by throwing out the plot.

Prepare to go off the deep end...and love every second of the trip.,"""Silencio"".An aspiring actress from out of town (Naomi Watts), a film director suffering from a series of bad luck (Justin Theroux), and a mysterious woman with a purse full of money, amnesia from an accident, and people searching for her (Laura Elena Harring), all intersect in Los Angeles. But something seem odd. Off. Strange. What's going on, and how are these people connected?Naomi Watts is my favorite actress, so there's absolutely no excuse for it to have taken so long for me to see this movie. Especially considering how fantastic Mulholland Drive is, and how great she is in it. From the very beginning, you have no idea what's going on. Strange things occur, and you're left wondering what in the heck is happening and who these people are. But the ambiguity never becomes frustrating. It only serves to make you more and more eager to continue on and see what everything is leading to. I literally said out loud at least three times, ""I have no idea what's going on, but this is awesome."" It's been a while since a movie has caught my attention so strongly from the very beginning and held it to the very end.Despite my adoration for Mulholland Drive, I'm vaguely aware of the fact that some people might find this movie ""too weird"". As I mentioned before, you're given a lot of scenes without the initial context to make sense of them, and I know that can annoy some people. The film is also quite surreal, at times, and while I may have found that scenes like those at the corral and Club Silencio (and really the entire last half-hour) to be incredible, I can (sort of) understand that they may be just flat out odd to some folks. So be warned, this movie is DIFFERENT. And yes, the all-caps really is necessary. If you only like your movies literal and straight-forward, do yourself a favor and choose a different movie.I don't hand out ratings this high very often, but Mulholland Drive leaves me no choice. It's was so unexpectedly and unconventionally amazing (especially if it's your first David Lynch film, as it was for me), that I have no doubts that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's startling, mesmerizing, and it'll bend your mind so far that it may never snap back to its original shape. I've seen nothing else like it. I'll admit that I can't help but wonder what the story would have been like without the hard left turn 2/3's of the way through (otherwise you'd be looking at a perfect rating), but this movie is a gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Lynchian Reverie: Rediscovering 'Mulholland Drive' After a Decade,"I revisited this film recently after a decade, having watched it a couple of times back then. Initially, I regarded it as an absolute classic, unlike anything I had seen before, quickly becoming one of my all-time favorite movies. It was my first exposure to Lynchian cinema, and it drew me into the realm of one of the best filmmakers in the business.The film's intrigue and mystery are relentless, maintaining its immersive quality throughout. The second half, in particular, ramps up the tension to an intense level. Lynch's mastery of tension-building is unparalleled, exemplified in scenes like the one where Diane Selwyn is discovered, and Rita's haunting sleep-talking of ""Silencio! Silencio!"" in bed. The theater scene is a standout classic among many others in the film, including the dinner and diner scenes, and the unforgettable ending.Certain dialogues, especially those delivered by the cowboy character, linger in memory long after viewing, highlighting the film's unique and enduring impact.While I still grapple with understanding the film, even after reading various explanations, I recognize its artistic brilliance that transcends conventional cinema and ventures into the realm of art. Despite my ongoing efforts to unravel its mysteries, I appreciate the film for its unparalleled quality and singular artistic vision.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another over-rated David Lynch film!,"David Lynch has been successful in confusing art with just plain confusing. There is nothing deep about his films. He has taken a formula (albeit, created by him) and used it over and over again. Misfits, dark settings and the evil disabled people are his signature. He takes this mystery mix and churns out films that we are suppose to ""think"" about. Well, it is very easy to create dreams and confusing plots and then tell the viewer, ""figure it out."" I don't want to figure it out, not when you don't give me the clues I need or a sensible script to work with.Mullholland Drive is a disaster, a terrible movie that seems to be filmed in real time. It takes forever for a character to walk down the stairs, answer a question or do anything. It felt like it took weeks to view this movie. I was actually relieved when it was over and happy to delete it from my DVR.

And they play with identity and purpose, and their place in this insane make-believe world. It also works as a purgatory, a place between worlds, that threads the line between beautiful dream and nightmare.And it doesn't hurt that it is a beautiful film, every technical aspect thrown out the park.

Mulholland Drive Is A Near Perfect Film,"Mulholland Drive is a sparingly flawed, near perfect film. The greatest elements of Lynch's work present themselves beautifully.

The performances from all involved are quite strong, and the fusing of plot lines is satisfying. Mulholland Drive is a classic for a reason, and a century from now, this film will continue to receive analysis and praise.

A beautiful work of art that fails to be a movie,"The problem with Mulholland Drive is that if you try to say it's a bad movie, anyone can simply fall back on the classic ""You just didn't understand it"". I finally brought myself to watch it for a second time, and I still don't see the merit. And let me make it clear, to the extent that anyone CAN understand this movie, I do. But for one thing, David Lynch's make-it-up-as-you-go style always leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, I like a movie that leaves some things up to the imagination or open to interpretation. But there has to be something concrete underneath it all. For instance, as difficult as it may be to grasp, there is a distinct sequence of events that Luis Bunuel wants to depict in L'Age d'Or; and distinct ideas he wants to invoke. This is why his work is satisfying even to those who don't fully understand it, whereas with Lynch's films, even if you do understand it you're left feeling unsatisfied, as if something was left unfinished. And more than anything, this is an unfinished work: a television show that was dismissed and forced into the constraints of the feature film. Characters left undeveloped. Plot lines left unresolved. Ends left loose. It is an entrancing movie, credit where credit is due. There's nothing stale about it. There's purpose behind each shot (however undefined), and the shots themselves are beautiful. I've given it a six, and for artistic reasons I'd like to give it more. But a movie can't just be art, it still has to be a movie.

Original film making in a class of its own,"What is behind the curtain? Or just around that bend? Behind the door? Behind the words? Where will our hopes and dreams take us? If we succeed, they become part of who we are. But if Fate is unkind we face our own fallibility. In the multifaceted and unreal world of Los Angeles, a city of dreams and nightmares, being true to yourself can be as hard as discovering who you really are. The way can be littered with mobsters, hit men, and pressures that can drive you crazy. A great setting for a noirish thriller and a mystery within a mystery.In the glamorous and sometimes dangerous world on the fringes of Hollywood, two girls (played by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) are drawn into a lesbian relationship that is unequal in more ways than one. A sense of foreboding is never far away. A top director, Adam Kesher (played by Justin Theroux) is having to re-audition a lead role, but if he doesn't do as he's told he will lose everything. Who knows what will happen when the road ahead is dark? As we piece together opening scenes, a woman is ambushed in the back of her car on Mulholland Drive. We watch an accident and a narrow escape. We see her drawn under the wing of wide-eyed Betty, whose idealistic vision of Hollywood seems almost too good to be true. Amnesia, a hit that goes wrong, strange occurrences around a Wendys Diner, and lots of media-mogul double-talk. We are assaulted with a barrage of clues to solve a puzzle which remains tantalisingly out of reach.Then there's a major twist.Mulholland Drive is not a mystery that you solve by the end of the film. You have to go away and think about it. The movie uses a broken chain of cause and effect that challenges and forces an audience in on itself. Remember Memento, where we realise the film is shot from the point of view of a man with short-term memory loss? Expect the unexpected. And once you work out the 'beginner's' or 'classical' interpretation, new avenues will open to explore, like a poem as it blossoms.One of the beguiling aspects of the film is that each scene is so captivating, so unusual, so colourful that we are tempted to enjoy it for its own sake. We race from horror to laughter to romance to mystery. A simple hit-and-run for an address book turns into Tarantinoesque mayhem as the clean-up operation gets hilariously out of control. Adam is prone to imaginative violence with golf clubs or pink paint when told who to cast or is cuckolded by the pool man.High production values and fabulous sets add to our visual enjoyment. Perfect editing brings every shot home hard. But the script increasingly tries to force a more Brechtian analysis upon us, making us stand back from the characters where we had suspended disbelief. When Naomi Watts' is auditioning for a part, the intensity of her performance moves us as if we had finally connected with her character. In a nightclub, when an act is pre-announced as lip-synched, we don't want to believe. Images are absorbed faster than logic, but they are so beautiful we may as well leave logic until later.Just as the characters in the film, if we do not explore different sides of our make-up consciously as an actor does, through creative channels, then our subconscious may do it for us. We all dream. Some of take us might take recreational drugs. Most of us indulge in wish-fulfilment and sexual fantasies. Mulholland Drive should be avoided by those who like straightforward stories without too much of a challenge. It is not just a passive viewing experience. But if you like exploring strange byways and have the patience to see what is around the corner, Mulholland Drive is one of those films to put on your all-time must-see list.Want a starter?

A masterpiece that I'll never truly understand,"I'll start things off by saying that my mom would hate this movie. It's confusing, it doesn't follow a traditional storyline, characters come and go, it's scary as hell, and the ending leaves you feeling extremely out of sorts. There are loose ends that never connect and when watching movies with my parents throughout the years, they don't enjoy films that don't have a definitive 'meaning' they can explain to themselves...and others.Mulholland Drive definitely doesn't have an ending you can explain. Well, some people can (or attempt to), but Lynch made this film under his direction, his vision and his own meanings that we will probably never know or understand.Just know this, do not go into Mulholland Drive expecting anything that you know from movies you've seen throughout the years. It will bend every expectation, trope, and stereotype you've ever seen on film. That's all I can really say. You'll contrive your own meanings from it. I think Lynch knows this too. He has this fascination with human curiosity and his pure genius comes from the fact that he can create a mystery film that ends with more mystery than it began with.If you do a Google or Youtube search on this film, you will see countless theories, threads, forums, and opinions on what it means and how certain scenes connect (or don't) to one another.

How do you film a dream? Ask David Lynch.,"This movie has become somewhat of an obsession for me and I have a very different idea of what the movie really is about. In my analysis, the movie really has two central themes. The first is a grim depiction of the reality that awaits those who come to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune, and how many who go there end up in very bad shape. The second theme revolves around David Lynch's attempt to literally film a dream/nightmare and contrast it with the reality of ""Diane's"" life. ""Diane Selwyn"" is the ""real-life"" character - a naive Midwestern arrival (who is also lesbian) seeking fame and fortune in Hollywood. In ""reality,"" Diane is the waitress at the diner who, between shifts, scurries to and fro doing screen tests, looking for her big break. Diane meets the ""real"" Rita during a film shoot and they do some other gigs together and develop a romantic relationship. All hell breaks loose when the ""real"" Rita announces her marriage to the director Adam Kesher at a cast party held at Kesher's Mulholland Drive home. Thus begins a downward spiral for ""Diane,"" who realizes that her ""big break"" (as well as her love life) will vanish once ""Rita"" is married. Also at the party, she realizes that ""Rita"" has another girlfriend on the side and has ""moved on."" Soon, Diane is hiring hit men to kill Rita, who (I think) end up killing, not Rita, but Rita's new girlfriend who was in the wrong place at the wrong time (I say that because it looks like the dead body in bungalow #12 has blond hair, so it can't be Rita). That is the ""reality."" The ""dream"" is Diane's psychotic nightmare after everything goes down and the police want to question her. In Diane's dream/nightmare, she is innocent ""Betty"" who comes to Hollywood and becomes a star. And rather than the reality of trying to murder Rita, she dreams that she is helping an amnesiac Rita remember who she is as they wander through Diane's dreamworld seeking clues. Various characters from Diane's ""reality,"" like Kesher's mother Coco, assume different identities and roles in the dream. In Diane's dreams, she was screwed out of fame and fortune by Rita, Kesher and other sinister forces who control the movie industry (Dan Hedaya's movie mafia). Towards the end of the movie, we realize that ""Diane's"" life is unraveling. The movie, then, is a glimpse into the mind of a shattered soul who is cornered and hours away from ruin. I won't go any further into the plot, but I marvel at Lynch's attempt to film a ""dream."" The movie is not perfect, but it is a wonderful type of ""whodunnit"" that simply cannot be understood in one viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Waking Up,"David Lynch is a unique artist who not only understands, but is able to convey the nature of dreams by creating a highly emotional, abstract environment.This film made me scratch my head many times, not because I couldn't comprehend the plot, but because I was puzzled by my own response to the characters. Like a dream, it makes almost no sense in the hindsight. The roles that people play in this picture reflect the nuances of dream reality where personalities often interchange and morph, yet never appear confusing to the dreamer.Most of Lynch's films I'd describe as raw perception - not reality, but it's appearance through the lens of subconsciousness.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dadaism... Huh?,"I grow weary of giving David Lynch a chance time and again.  Mulholland Drive exemplifies this.  Once again, David Lynch has managed to gain the funding to mish-mash some sort of sad, sexual wet dream into what is again being pawned off as ""film.""First we had to endure Eraserhead.  I don't know what was up with cancer cheeks in the radiator and falling brain stem worms, all I know is that after about an hour of weird fetuses and ostentatious attempts to make me feel uncomfortable, I had fallen asleep, and been kicked, promptly, four times.  My best friend has this valuable quote to contribute: ""I'm not watching this s*** alone!""Then there was Dune.  While managing to formulate a coherent plot, mostly due to the fact that it was based on a novel, it still missed the mark, bordering on seemingly ten hours length.  Lynch, don't try to fit six novels worth of political intrigue into a movie ever again.I have to offer some congratulations for the exceptional direction in Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, and I will always cherish these productions... and claim them as the reason I continue to endeavor Lynch film.Then travesty of travesty struck.  Lost Highway...  Lynch's ""Dadaism"" at its ""best.""  This film completely disregarded all sense of plot or anything otherwise central to most film.  ""But James, narrative film isn't the only type of film,"" say you?  Well you're right, it isn't, but that doesn't negate the pseudo-surrealistic, pretentiously ""thought provoking"" nature of the film.  Or the fact that it invoked, like a demon, complete boredom.There were a few others, but due to limitations, I shall speak now of Mulholland Drive.  This film is simply a reiteration of themes in Lost Highway.  And that is distinctly what makes it worse.  It is simply Lost Highway with better film quality.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the narrative structure has never been so dissolved as it is now. Anyway, don't see this Dadaist crap; you'll only end up wanting the two and half hours of your life (and rental fee) back.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Oneiric,"Mulholland Dr is the best modern portrayal I have seen of the oneiric, film noir aesthetic. Oneiric means dreamlike, and it is the most appropriate word for describing this film, in which the viewer can barely tell if they're watching someone's dream, real life, or a movie about a movie, or perhaps some alternate universe. An unlimited plethora of theories abound as to what is actually going on throughout this confusing and engaging movie. It is a Rorschach test, a beautiful ink blot without a label. And that adds to its enjoyability, making me want to watch it again.The film is filled with surreal, repetitious motifs, lesbian eroticism, and intriguing symbolism. Watch it, but don't expect to make any sense out of it. To quote Ebert's review: ""This is a movie to surrender yourself to. If you require logic, see something else. ""Mulholland Drive"" works directly on the emotions, like music.""This will always be a cult classic, but it will never be a classic. I gave it a 7 out of 10 because a higher score would require that it had a coherent plot and meaning. Symbolism and cool aesthetics are interesting, fun, and artistic, but the plot is what makes a true classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece that stretches the boundaries of cinema.,"""Mullholland Dr."" is the kind of film that manipulates your very idea of a what a movie can be. Most notably the plot and structure of the film is so original, so artful and interesting that nearly every review i have read seems to confuse me more by trying to describe or make sense of it all. The best thing to do with this film is just watch it without any preconceived ideas or notions of what it is. Don't try to understand it, just feel it creep into your conscious until it becomes your obsession the way it has for me.

Quite a ride.,"The female leads in this movie really shine. While Naomi Watts and Laura Harring both excel, I find myself wondering why Ms Harring has not had more big roles in recent times as she is obviously a very talented and beautiful actress. I also thought that Anne Miller was well cast as the apartment block manager and she displayed a great deal of that ""Hollywood charm"" that is completely lacking in modern cinema.David Lynch as a director is quite special. The way he layers a story and his quirky photography make it obvious who is at the reins here. But as he he done many times before, he forgets that the cinema is first and foremost a place to tell a story. If one makes a story difficult to follow that doesn't always make it art. Lynch is capable of telling a great story with films like ""The Elephant Man"", but he's gone off on a bender here trying to appease God knows who.There will be many who didn't understand the film trying to point out out the genius, the relevance or even the brilliance of this movie, but they are kidding themselves. It is painfully obvious that a re-edit of this film, while removing some of Lynch's style, would transform this film into the masterpiece it could have been. As it stands, watching Mulholland Dr. is too difficult and asks too much of its audience.Despite all of these shortcomings, I actually liked the film as I thought the actors did an incredible job. It's just that it could have been so much better. It could have been a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More Crap for people who Love Crap...,"This is just more crap for people who love crap.  It's typical David Lynch, with bad acting that would only fly in a 1950's sitcom, and a plot that is written solely to make you wonder what's next, yet really has a story behind it, and never goes anywhere.If you liked Twin Peaks, you'll love this.  Because both were `what's going on' and challenging to think about.  But, as usual, David Lynch fails on all but one point.  Everything is bad, everything except for one thing, he keeps you constantly asking `why?What's bad?  Well among the things that suck are, the plot, the direction, getting the best work from good actors/actresses, the discontinuity in what could be awesome visually relevant scenes, the subplots that do nothing except show their faces, the characters that seem interesting but aren't played out, etc.David Lynch has a talent, don't get me wrong.  He manages to get every single element of a good film together in one thing.  But he also manages to drop the ball on ALL of them, as in most of his works!If ANY other director could manage to collect even half of the elements in a David Lynch film into one movie, and make them work, it would be a blockbuster!  David Lynch has again triumphed in getting every possible good element of a project into one effort, and then making every single element fail.More crap.  If you want to study movies, study David Lynch.  He is a mast er at SOMETHING, and that is, defining and bringing the key elements, and many many of them into a project.  But, don't study what he does with them, just study what the elements are in the project.  He can't deliver on a `suspense', because there never is a climax and an ending.  He can't deliver on deep characters, because he just keeps trying to build them, but never makes them have significant meaning to the plot.  He can't deliver on the plot, because he brings a great plot to the table without ever bringing a `shocking' or `meaningful' conclusion to it.If there is anything Lynch is good at, it's this..  He is a mold breaker, and does away with the conventions of the typical Hollywood movie. Unfortunately, the parts he does away with are the best parts.  It's groundbreaking, no doubt.  But if you break all of the ground and leave nothing left to walk on, you can't go ANYWHERE.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Took me some time to process afterwards....,"Wow!! What a complex film! I mean I don't think I've ever seen a movie that makes you think more than this one does, but hey that's why it's so excellent. Mulholland Drive stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. It even has a short Billy Ray Cyrus cameo lol. The acting is just wonderful! I adored Watts and Harring! Naomi Watts can go from being so kind sweet and simple in one version of herself to being disheveled and washed up. She handles the lead role with such skill. And Laura Harring plays her role very well, realistic and believable. And Theroux does a pretty good job with his performance, his isn't quite as big/important as Harring and Watts's are. The script is very close to perfection. A script for a film like this must to be written very carefully and be very specific and detailed. If it wouldn't have been then it wouldn't have been nearly as interesting. That's the main thing about Mulholland Drive, it is COMPLEX and WEIRD lol. But I think that's a great thing. We need more mystery thrillers that are made like this and do this to viewers. I know now after doing some brief research how and what the movie was saying at the end. At first I had absolutely no idea, but then the pieces started to be put together. And it started to make some sense. This really is an excellent movie that will give your brain a real work out!

She is utterly incredible here.I'm not going to be elitist about it, though, I get that Lynch isn't for everyone and I can't help but feel some measure of sympathy for those who genuinely don't like him work because of the nature of it, but I think those of us who DO like his work would agree that he's rarely in better form than here.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fantasy meets reality in Lynch's perplexing masterpiece.,"David Lynch, the acclaimed filmmaker known for his unique blend of reality and fantasy, has captivated audiences with his masterful storytelling techniques. One of his most renowned works, ""Blue Velvet,"" exemplifies his ability to craft a logically coherent narrative infused with fantastical deviations. Reminiscent of Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2,"" Lynch employs a similar approach by interspersing fantasy elements with a logically coherent plot.In ""Mulholland Drive,"" Lynch takes audiences on a mesmerizing journey that initially adheres to a logical structure before gradually abandoning it in favor of dream-like sequences presented with astonishing realism. A significant plot shift occurs, transitioning from the fantasy-laden first part to the reality-dominated second part, where roles and identities undergo a mesmerizing reversal.Lynch's brilliance lies in his artistic sleight of hand, luring viewers into a fantasy scene by presenting it with an air of realism. Just as the audience expects a meaningful depiction, Lynch shatters those expectations by introducing fantastical elements that shock and surprise. One can imagine Lynch gleefully laughing in the background, reveling in his ability to play such pranks on the unsuspecting viewer.Contrasting with ""Mulholland Drive,"" the film ""Holy Motors"" presents pure fantasy through nonsensical and unrelated sequences. Regrettably, this approach fails to resonate as effective art. Lynch, on the other hand, exhibits superior skill in organizing and structuring his film, infusing it with fantasy elements that are skillfully executed. This level of craftsmanship elevates ""Mulholland Drive"" to the realm of great art.Naomi Watts delivers an outstanding performance in the film, surpassing the typical ""Best Actress"" Oscar winners of the past two decades. Often confined to roles that don't fully showcase her exceptional acting skills, Watts finally finds a character that allows her talents to shine. Meeting the challenge head-on, she brings depth and authenticity to her portrayal, captivating audiences with her compelling performance.While the plot may take a backseat in Lynch's cinematic vision, it remains an essential component of his artistry. Without some guidance, ""Mulholland Drive"" can be utterly baffling. Essentially, the film tells the story of a young girl who arrives in Hollywood with lofty aspirations of becoming an actress. Divided into two parts, the first (with Watts as Betty) delves into the girl's psychotic delusions as she constructs a false past leading to the promise of a brilliant acting career. Unbeknownst to the viewer, this section is presented as reality. However, the second part (featuring Watts as Diane) unveils a different truth, revealing the girl's failure to achieve stardom. Diane's identity is authentic in this second part, highlighting her dismal journey, while the initial delusional character Rita transforms into Camilla.Naomi Watts adeptly takes on two roles with distinct identities in the film. In the first part, she portrays the delusional Betty, while in the second part, she embodies the genuine Diane. This shift in personas is cleverly indicated by the change in the waitress's name at Winkie's. When Betty and Rita visit the diner in the fantasy section, the waitress is named Diane. However, in the real second part, when Watts portrays Diane, the same waitress is now referred to as Betty.The transition from fantasy to reality mirrors the often-occurring cycle of young aspiring performers in Hollywood. Initially, they are filled with high hopes and aspirations, akin to the fantasy depicted in the film's first part (Betty). However, the harsh reality of failure awaits many of these dreamers, which becomes evident in the second part (Diane). This dichotomy serves as a poignant reflection of the allure and ultimate disappointment that plagues countless individuals seeking fame and success in the city of dreams.In conclusion, David Lynch's mastery of the cinematic craft is evident in ""Mulholland Drive."" Through his seamless blending of reality and fantasy, he takes audiences on a captivating journey that oscillates between logical coherency and dream-like sequences. Naomi Watts delivers a remarkable performance, surpassing the standard set by previous ""Best Actress"" Oscar winners. While the plot may be secondary to Lynch's artistic vision, it remains a vital aspect of the film, offering audiences guidance through the perplexing narrative. ""Mulholland Drive"" stands as a testament to Lynch's genius, showcasing his ability to simultaneously entrance and confound viewers with his distinctive storytelling techniques.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Greatest Movie Of All Time,"Years ago I saw 2001 A Space Odyssey. I thought it was spectacular and that no other movie could match it. Its artistic vision combined with wonderful entertainment, and deepness were things that had a huge impact on me. I would consider it the best movie ever made.But it was also sad that with only 17 years old, I had already seen the best movie of all time. That every other movie was going to be below it. That no movie could match it.Anyway, after watching Inland Empire (and disliking it) and Blue Velvet (and loving it), I thought I should watch Mulholland Dr. So I did. I watched it when everyone in my house was sleeping and there was nothing but silence. And at first, I disliked the movie.As day passed by, I began thinking on it, and I decided to watch it again. And that was a wise decision. After watching the whole movie for the second time, I knew 2001 was matched. Everything in this movie is SO intriguing and genius, that you may dismiss it on your first view.The movie is a GIANT puzzle. A puzzle that is at times dramatic, and sometimes frightening. This is THE MOVIE that I had always wanted to watch. A movie that had a lot symbolism for you to figure out what happened. Lynch's directing is just top notch. He creates this masterpiece with facility, and uses the perfect music for his perfect scenes. Watts acting is just hypnotizing. I couldn't believe she was Australian, because her American accent is amazing. You will know what I am talking about when you watch a scene where she is acting for a movie inside of the movie. A Hollywood paradox, right? Well, that is my point. It is a dreamlike movie. You will see what I mean.This is the greatest movie of all time-tied with 2001 A Space Od. Go watch it.

The only film I have seen that truly captures what dreams are really like.,"I remember when I was younger I had a dream that really fascinated me. It had the start of a strange and mysterious story but it was never concluded. When I woke up, I was obsessed with it. There was something about this weird story that took place in my head when I was asleep that meant a lot to me so the fact I woke up before the conclusion and was brought back to the boring and ordinary real world that really bothered me. I wanted a conclusion to this dream story! I wanted to find out what happened and why parts of it made no sense! But is was the fact it had no ending that fascinated me so much. It was the fact that parts were left unexplained that intrigued me so much. There's something about ambiguity, especially in dreams that are wonderful but make no sense, that really interests me. If this dream had an ending, it would not have stuck with me as much. I wouldn't have thought about it after waking up and thus wouldn't be so intrigued. This is why I think 'Mulholland Drive' is one of the greatest films of all time.I had never seen anything that resembled this incredible dream of mine before I saw this Lynch film. Nearly all dreams that are represented in films are always wrong. There is never any mystery or ambiguity to them and the atmosphere is always off. All my life I looked for something that resembled this fascinating dream of mine but couldn't; until I saw Mulholland Drive. The mysterious and fascinating dream world that is represented in the first three quarters of the film was just like this dream of mine. There was a mystery that needed solving, interesting and bizarre characters that didn't seem to make sense, a fascinating, and idyllic world that never felt real and finally; the mysteries were never solved thus capturing the beauty and ambiguity of my favourite dream.Who says a film is supposed to tell a story? Film is art. You don't look at abstract pieces of art and expect it to tell a linear story so why should you will Mulholland Drive. I believe the entertainment you get from Mulholland Drive is purely gained through experiencing it as one big piece of art which is what it is. Mulholland Drive is not a story, it is literally a dream recreated as a film. And as I love dreams, I Ioved this film. This that does not mean that it does't have significant messages and meanings which it does; like other pieces of art. This film seems to look at the corruption and bitter sexism of Hollywood and thus gives the film a meaningful and tragic undertone.In conclusion, this film is a masterpiece.

This is the girl,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is a confuse movie.

Besides, this movie is for that... because is a mystery that you must resolve. For that reason, the director give to the audience Ten clues to discover the mystery.All that i say is enough to affirming that the work is maybe more than a masterpiece. ""Mulholland Drive"" or (i write it just for curiosity) the Spanish title ""Sueños, misterios y secretos"" (Dreams, mysteries and secrets) is a really an excellent film. Besides an amazing soundtrack. Other thing that i love of this film is the cast.

One of the best films of all time!,"This film has easily shot into my top 20 all-time favorites--right back to the dawn of the ""talkies"".  It will confidently stand with the best of film noir like ""Sunset Boulevard"" (is there an oblique nod at that movie in Lynch's title?) or ""The Big Sleep,"" as well as with other great puzzle pics like Resnais' ""Last Year At Marienbad,"" or ethical fantasies like Tarkovsky's ""Solaris.""People complain that the film diverges from a credible mystery thriller into some sort of haphazard surrealism; but this is far from the case.  You simply need to see that the end of the film is either; 1) the beginning of the film, its unseen preface,as it were; or b) a much later ending, after our heroine has been dragged into an unhealthy love affair; or c) both of these.There is nothing nonsensical about this picture.  Ambiguous, yes; symbolic, yes; even, yes, non-linear. But not incomprehensible.But ""Memento"" is also non-linear.  And that is a great film because both the nature of film itself, as well as the nature of the protagonist's illness, results in a story more powerful, not less, for being outside the usual stream of narrative relation.I've studied this movie a lot, and I could write a dissertation on it; but I won't bore you with explaining the film to you.  Let it suck you in, and you can't help flash on the meanings and implications of Betty's/Diane's story.Let me add that the actress who plays Betty/Diane, Naomi Watts, is clearly going to replace Laura Dern as Lynch's star of choice.  Whatever it is that attracts Lynch to young, intelligent, but vulnerable blondes, Watts has got in spades.  But you have to watch this woman act to believe her.  Watts plays a wannabe actress, and Lynch crafts several scenes were she gets to play her role within a role to jaw-dropping perfection.  Beleive me, she is flat out astounding.Another bit of sublime magic is the performance of female vocalist in a cabaret act where a pop song gets sung in such a remarkable manner that it transcends its humble origins and achieves the status of true art song.Where did Lynch find this singer?  And when will she be coming out with an album of her own?All I can say is that this film is simply an amazing tour de force.  It is both quintessentially Lynch, and yet it raises the bar on pure film making another notch.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Surrealism taken too far,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is in many ways a hypnotic, well-directed and well-acted piece of surrealistic film. I'm still somewhat unsure of whether it is artistic genius or pretentious schlock, but right now I fall somewhere in the middle between these two extremes. I acknowledge the ambition and artistic integrity that went into making a movie such as this, and just how dinstinctly David Lynch and wildly different from any other movie it is. It's a very visceral movie experience, relying mainly on ambient music and visuals. At the same time I am also highly aware and annoyed of the fact that this is a movie that deliberately barely makes any sense without some sort of pre-conceived notion of what is going on.On first viewing (which is what I'm basing this review on, as I only just watched it for the first time), it's nigh impossible to understand what is happening. Only after reading up on the plot of the movie does some of the events fall into place. Some might see that as a plus, that it has many additional layers that get unravelled on repeat viewings. I would agree with that, if there were any initial layers to process. Instead, from a story perspective I got absolutely nothing out of it without looking it up, and that is a storytelling sin in my book.A large part of my frustration with the movie comes from the fact that the fantasy/surrealistic part of the movie goes on waaaaay too long in comparison to the 'reality' part. There are also no real hints that this is a fantasy/dream other than of course the fact that some bizarre stuff happens. This bizarre stuff happens equally in the 'real' section of the movie though, so that's not really very enlightening.Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for weird psychological tales with surrealistic elements, but if those surrealistic elements take up three-quarters (2 hours!) of the movie before coming to anything resembling any sort of sense, you have overdone your surrealism in my opinion. It made the end of the movie feel really rushed, as there was not enough time to properly connect the fantasy to the reality. If it was a more even 50-50 split, or if there were a few more specks of 'reality' interspersed into the fantasy part, I think it would have strongly improved my appreciation for the movie.As it is, I dig the whole hypnotic and surrealistic vibe of the movie on a visceral level, as well as the performances (especially Naomi Watts'), but the deliberate lack of any sort of coherent story just rubs me the wrong way. Which is a shame, because the underlying story beats that get presented at the end are actually really moving and deeply human.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Laura Elena Harring is absolutely gorgeous as Rita. The Late Ann Miller was great too.To me the highlight was David Lynch. He wrote a great screenplay, which was originally going to be a TV series, and his direction was absolutely superb.

A splendid masterpiece by David Lynch,"I personally think 'spoiler alert' has nothing to do with this film. Nobody can make a 'spoiler' for this film, I swear. Hence I deliberately avoid spoiler alert here.Mulholland Drive is one of the phenomenal work of David Lynch. It proclaims the brilliant direction of Lynch and I feel a trifle uneasy to find out a suitable genre for this movie apart from neo-noir. Since this is an ambiguous movie, viewers are given the freedom to decrypt it according to the didactics of their subconscious mind. Apparently the director hesitated to impart the gist of this movie thinking that the audience should criticize it without his assistance and certainly, this is what that distinguishes Lynch from the other directors. His movies are far beyond the standard perspective of Hollywood film-noir thus I feel a trifle uneasy to tag it as neo-noir or film-noir. David Lynch is renowned for his surreal style applying to the general precis of genres like film-noir, neo-noir, thriller, mystery and so on. Rather than exerting the graphical aspects of surrealism, he utilizes the epistemological angle of surrealism by means of the complicated story. The chronological order of the story turns indefinite as it proceeds and especially when the viewer start confounding what reality is. Even with a reasonable chronological story line, the logic of the events is still very illusive. He presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing through his juxtaposition of cinematography, cliché, surrealism, background music, lighting, nightmares/fantasies and nonlinear story lines. Apparently he avoided dramatic dialogues deliberately out of the film.Naomi Watts achieved an outstanding performance. It's really challenging to impersonate two mutually exclusive personae (Betty/Diane). Laura Harring supported her well taking the role of Rita as well as Camila and she had a great chemistry with Naomi. The other actors did their role very well regardless of the importance of their roles. The intensity of light has been wisely utilized in order to scale their emotive status. Diane's dreams were shown in bright light especially during her arrival at the apartment. Also her emotional breakdown was rendered with darkness. Lynch used different camera positions throughout the movie most of then were hand-held point of view, so that the viewer identify with the suspense of the character in his or her particular space. Discrete style was also adopted to make deviations from the expected hand-held views, so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling our sense. Also sound-mixing and editing was excellent. Mild background-scores enhanced situations.Apart from the eerie and mysterious atmosphere of a set of problems, the objective of this movie is to bring out the language of an unconscious mind. The objects we see in our dreams have a relation to our real life, some of them would be easy to interpret while some may be metaphorical representing some qualities or emotional aspects. The tagline for Mulholland Drive is ""A love story in the City of Dreams."" As we can see, Diane's struggle to love herself is what gives the film its poignant power, even more so than her doomed struggle to love Camilla. And that is as it should be, because we do not get much help understanding why Camilla is the person whom she is, but Diane's mind is laid open to us. In the end, Diane shoots herself and it shows Betty and Rita beaming at each other after which a woman in the Club Silencio balcony whispers ""Silencio"" as the screen fades to black. These images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image. This indeterminate zone ended up by 'Silencio' which makes it hypothetical. I felt an indirect fatalism from that scene as if an external authority suppressing her unconscious mind to be silent. I felt it uncomfortable to watch such a pessimistic ending where everything became static and dark. I believe that the ending scene can be interpreted pessimistically as well as optimistically depending on the subconscious of audience. For me, it was pretty much pessimistic. I should not have said that. Erase it. Unleash your mind and enjoy the eternal ride to world of David Lynch. Good luck!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"I fell in love with this movie and the master behind it, David Lynch.","I'm used to seeing different movies. I have prior to this never seen a David Lynch movie though I've heard quite a bit about Blue Velvet and Mullholland Drive for sure. I rented Mullholland Drive because of Naomi Watts, an actress I admire greatly. The first time I watched the movie, it played as a straight up tale of an aspiring actress mostly, if jumbled and what I thought was blah oddball blah /messy at times. Like I say I have never watched a Lynch movie before.Since I had the movie on rental I decided to make the most of it and give it another go. I have now become obsessed with it. You see I went along with the movie, I went with the flow.At the moment I am in love with Betty's storyline but the movie has a lot more going on. It will take me time and a re watch, oh what a hard life, of Adam's (played by Justin Theroux) interactions with the producers and with The Cowboy. I also still don't have a clue about the two dudes laughing one minute in an office, and quite a different story the next. And much has been made of the kiss scene. To me, it's not that big a deal, I would say more sad than titillating, and even though I enjoy titillating, it's not the thing that sticks in my mind about Mullholland Drive. Sad that people talk about that over a brutal shooting in a movie.I had read some time ago the different interpretations of Mullholland Drive. The movie is haunting not because of the interpretations but because of the Winkies diner scene and the ending. And now, I see something else that gives me creeps in such a way I fell in love with Naomi Watts for being able to convey something through one look, the power of mental strength. Wanting something so bad. I will say no more!I don't know if I follow the interpretations religiously but I do know that I am grateful for putting in a DVD in that requires all of me to pay attention. A movie has been made that isn't mindless entertainment or lazy in any way. I LOVE David Lynch for truly creating something and for introducing me to a world of a movie that is so different to the ones I know and love. I'm a lay person when it comes to all things ""Lynchian."" I can't define yet what Lynch does that makes him different to the other greats, directors like Peter Weir, Antoine Fuqua, but if you know their work you can understand what I mean.After I watched the movie for the second time, I got the strangest dreams. What's real? I read a criticism of Lynch's work, that if his characters had any soul he wouldn't have to create oddball or quirky. I had been watching movies before Mullholland Drive all about the souls and characters, I am now thinking there is more so called quirk and odd ball in this world than deep, meaningful events, our ideas are deep and meaningful but strange, strange things happen and whilst Mullholland Drive is not quite just about strange things happening, it's a movie that you give your own meaning to. If you need to do that.This movie inspires me. I want to see all of David Lynch's work and I can't get the song, I Have Told Every Star out of my head. ""A poisonous ode to Hollywood."" I like that but it's not the be all and end all statement for this beautiful, intelligent and mysterious movie. A class above.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lynch's masterpiece. One of the best psychological suspense thrillers ever made.,David Lynch creates an amazing film here. He is one of the most under-rated director/screenwriters in film of the last 25 years.  Naomi Watts turns in a magnificent dual role which garnered her few awards but heavily snubbed from an oscar nomination. Lynch excellently convinces the viewer the film is heading one direction as he grasps the viewers full attention he pulls a 360 on the audience.  Lynch is a master of mise-en scene. The suspense and mystery he creates behind this story is wonderful and amazing.Mulholland Drive leaves a lasting effect on the viewer for a long time. There are many notable performances but outside of Naomi Watts the star is David Lynch that proves why he is a master auteur in his own right. The film might even keep a good number of viewers guessing after the curtain goes down.  Some scenes can't be fully solved but its meant to be that way. Only Lynch in his deranged mind fully knows the true puzzle of Mulholland Drive.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant! A Masterpiece!,"Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the Master of cinematic expression. At the screening last night I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are astounding, the score entrancing, and the photography mesmerizing. David's ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is unequalled. As I watched Mullholland Drive I couldn't help but realize that with David Lynch in this world we are truly blessed. The cinema is blessed as well for, in the films of David Lynch, we are shown that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only path. We realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. has brought Spanish cinema to Hollywood,"David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. has brought Spanish cinema to Hollywood. Mulholland Drive captivates audiences with its sheer storytelling,characters and bold visuals without reliance on, or even the existence of a steady plot. The audience does not know for the most part, what the movie is about, who some of the characters are, or how they even play apart in the story, yet, it doesn't seem to matter. There is something spellbinding about the film and you are captured and drawn into this non-linear mystery with little sense of control.The analogy to Spanish cinema is made as it reminds you of Latin American classics such as ""All About My mother"" (1999) and ""Open Your Eyes"" (1997).Lynch's usage of bold colors and dreamy photography also invites this comparison. The non-linear nature of the film is also reminiscent of earlier Hollywood works such as ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1998) yet Mulholland Dr. is in a class of its own. It stands out and is interesting because you have never seen a film quite like it before.Unlike, traditional Hollywood narratives, there is a mystery, but the audience doesn't care for it to be solved, rather the awe comes from watching the characters trapped in it and how they man-oeuvre their way.Mulholland Dr. is a full drama wrapped with elements of horror, fantasy and is a thriller in its own respect. It is one of several films which have discarded the Hollywood dream for many. It adds to the likes of ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1956) and ""All about Eve"" (1950) but is darker and more eerie, but in equal parts expertly acted and directed.Naomi Watts as the perky Hollywood hopeful, Betty, and later as failed actress Dianne Selwyn is arguably one of the stronger and more ranged performances of an actress on screen in recent time. However, Laura Harring bravado performance as the amnesia-tic ""Rita"" carries the film and acts as a canvas for Lynch's unconventional direction. The cast is excellently rounded out by Justin Theroux as the perplexed movie director, Adam Kesher, and Ann Miller as Coco, the ever-present landlady.After watching Mulholland Drive you will remember three things: a small blue box, a haunting post midnight performance of ""silencio"" and the line ""you don't stop here."" What you won't remember is what the film is about or where it began or where it ends for that matter. Nevertheless, you will know you have just witnessed an incredible piece of cinema, known only by the name of the street, Mulholland Drive.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

8.0???    What the f..........????????????????,"I've only seen two movies by David Lynch. This is one of them, the other one is ""Blue Velvet"". After seeing those two, I've no problem in telling you all that I'm as far from being a fan of him as it's possible to be. He gives the expression ""Weird movies"" a new dimension. I really don't know how it's possible to enjoy his movies. ""Mulholland Drive"" is no exception. OK, It's better than ""Blue Velvet"", but the main difference is that I didn't fell asleep during this one. In fact, I got excited about it for the first hour or so. Although there were lots of scenes I never understood at all, the main plot seemed interesting enough. The atmosphere in the movie was also interesting. But that was before I had seen the whole film. At the end, I didn't have a clue about anything. A hint for you, Lynch: Movies are meant to entertain, not to irritate the viewer with tons of really hard riddles. I have read some persons ways of 'solving' this movie, and I have to say that it was VERY complicated, and I could never done that myself. 'Solving' movies like this are not for normal people, no doubt about that.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Now for the plot, it exists, and it's very metaphorical and very referential to the story of Los Angeles and Hollywood (kind like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). There's the want to be actress from a little city with extreme gift, the femme fatale, the mafia, the cowboy, the old actor who can't act, the genious young director and his neurotic wife,the psychic, the list goes on and on.

no reason not to like this movie.,"I must start of by saying this was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.First of all, the suspense was really killing throughout the whole movie, and even at times when really nothing much was happening, I was still afraid that somehow it could all turn into a nightmare in less than a second. I must give a lot of credits to the music/sound as well because it did not only influence my own film-making, but It really completed this movie.The acting and directing was superb, I really don't have much to say about it. Lynch was Lynch, only the surrealistic plot seemed less hard to believe than some other films he had made. there's nothing wrong with any of his films, I just thought it would be worth mentioning.I suggest that, when you want to watch this movie, that you pay close attention to ALL details given in this film. from the very first second it begins! I cannot stress that enough. I do not want to give any spoilers because if you only know 1 it would be a hell of a lot less fun to watch. however, if you have seen this movie and still do not get it, just watch it again until you're really sure you can't figure it out by yourself.I can only give away that the outcome of this movie is worth thinking about. Oh, and I'd like to recommend having a high IQ for this film, or watch it with someone with a high IQ. Cause it will help. It won't be crucial, but it will help.Now, I started writing this with a rating of 9 out of 10 stars (9/10) but when I tried to explain why I didn't gave it 10 stars, I couldn't find any possible explanation. So here you have it, 10 stars. Lynch is without a doubt one of the greatest directors of all time. this movie convinced me of that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A new perspective of Lynch,"I must say, I was never a huge a Lynch fan before. I was always curious watching his films but it was merely because people had told me they were spectacular and brilliant. I had watched Blue Velvet before. Probably his most famous work, but I just didn't get how it was.... ""amazing"". I found it a bit cheesy actually. So, here I was having my doubts about this man, and one day I remembered I had a DivX (shhh, told tell the feds) of Mulholland Drive and I think I only put it on to test the DivX player on my Xbox. 5 minutes in, I was already keen on watching it all. It sort of grips you in from the start. So I let it run on untill the end, and then I was totally amazed. I had loved this. BUT (there's always one of those). It does require a decent amount of concentration, so I didn't fully get everything the first time around. I searched on the internet to confirm my thoughts of everything and I was right about most things. The week after, I watched it again. This time knowing what to pay close attention to. I was just astonished. You realize how much depth and emotion that is the foundation of this masterpiece. I rarely use that word and I'm highly cynical of everyday type of film, but this is really just mind blowing. I give this 10 out of 10.For those who realized. I did not mention a thing that happens in this film. That was intentional... for if I told you, it was spoil allot more than you think.Happy watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hollywood Ending?,"Every time I venture out on Mulholland Drive, which is fairly often, a wave of amnesia washes over me, (not unlike one of the principal characters in the film) and I am suddenly unable to remember how the story unfolds.Then slowly, as the film progresses, images and words appear strangely familiar and the dots begin to connect.Much like an exercise in hypnotism, the subject only has vague recollections of the experience, if any at all.Lynch is a master storyteller and manages to seamlessly weave an elaborate web of mystery and intrigue.His genius lies in exploring intangible, philosophical concepts like identity/illusion via an interesting and accessible format - the genre picture (I use the term loosely).The filmmaker has almost single-handedly resurrected Film Noir from it's untimely demise in the late 50's, infusing it with doses of surreal horror/humor and other now Lynchian trademarks.Whether my amnesia is a result of the daedal construction of the plot or my subconscious subverting my memory is perhaps irrelevant.What is important, however is that Mulholland Drive is one of the most compelling exercises in Cinematic Hypnotism you are likely to ever experience.You won't forget it, even if like me, you have trouble remembering.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""I'll pretend to be someone else""","Mulholland Drive has a neo-noir feel to it, and the aesthetics are undeniably impressive. David Lynch creates a visually stunning world, filled with dark, neon-lit streets that echo the haunting vibe of Hollywood's dark underbelly. The cinematography is on point, and it's easy to get lost in the darker world he creates.However, the film often feels like it's trying to be too clever, which, for me, ends up being its downfall. It's as though Lynch deliberately keeps things opaque and ambiguous, making it more about the experience than the story. While films like ""Fight Club"" and ""Memento"" (both of which make my top 20 greatest films of all time) also play with fragmented reality, they manage to keep me hooked, providing satisfying emotional payoffs. Mulholland Drive, on the other hand, offers plenty of confusion but not much in the way of a gripping climax that makes you go ""wow"" or leaves you with a lasting emotional punch.Yes, there are deep psychological twists, but it all feels a little uninspiring in the end. The film's dreamlike quality works for some, but I personally found it hard to fully appreciate. It leaves you thinking, but also scratching your head. The constant back-and-forth flashbacks near the end between what's real and what's imagined can be disorienting, and while some people enjoy that, for me, in this film it detracts from the emotional investment.That being said, the performances were undeniably strong. Naomi Watts (Diane) and Laura Harring (Camilla) were incredible, with Watts delivering a standout performance that perfectly captures Betty's transformation from an child at a theme park when entering L. A to someone much darker im reality. The chemistry between them adds a significant emotional weight to the film. Justin Theroux was another solid performer, and there were some surprising cameo moments from Billy Ray Cyrus and Melissa George.One standout scene is the hitman kill scene, which had that eerie, unsettling vibe reminiscent of Pulp Fiction. It's one of those moments that is the films core set piece for action instead of romance.Another was the Silencio club, which strikes as a truly beautiful scene, and it's eerie atmosphere all contribute to a sense of deep melancholy and unease.Overall, Mulholland Drive feels like a film that will divide audiences. For some, the surreal, dreamlike trance might be a fascinating puzzle. For others, like me, the complexities outweigh the intrigue, and the lack of depth and clarity makes it hard to fully engage by the end. While Lynch's artistic vision is apparent, I couldn't quite connect with the film in a way that would make me call it magnificent. It's more of a film that makes you think about all the clever subtiles that Lynch incorporates, and upon multiple viewing might give more clues, but this is not necessarily a film that leaves you feeling truly fulfilled.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fantastic film that requires your brain to be switched on.,"I should've commented on this film a long time ago, but better late than never. I have now had the opportunity to watch it again on DVD, an experience I will repeat frequently in the years to come.Being a long-time Lynch fan I knew roughly what to expect when entering the theatre. I was expecting the unexpected so to speak (about the only time Lynch has really surprised me was with the Straight Story). Unfortunately, a lot of the audience had no idea what to expect, and admittedly Lynch can be hard to deal with at first glance. With that in mind, I have little trouble understanding all the negative comments the film has gotten on this and other sites. The average movie-goer expects to have everything spelled out for him/her in broad brush strokes and have everything wrapped up nicely by the credits. Luckily there are those that refuse to conform to this bleak standard, and those willing to back them up so the films get made.About the film; there is little I can say about the plot that hasn't already been said. Personally I thought the plot was rather straight-forward once you got the timeline sorted out in your head. I certainly never felt the need to be on top of things as the film played out. The cinematography was so beautiful, the performances so electrifying and the scenes so intriguing that I was happy to just be swept along for the ride. And what a ride! Seldom do we see such powerful cinema, and as the pieces started coming together all I could do was sit back in awe of Mr. Lynch's vision. This isn't weirdness for the sake of being weird, this is carefully chosen imagery produced to make us think at more levels than a more straightforward motion picture would.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes films a little out of the ordinary. If you prefer lighter fare like your average blockbuster then hey, whatever floats your boat.

The irony of Diane's illusion.,"The biggest clue to Mulholland Dr. comes from the most disturbing scene.It's difficult to select a most disturbing scene from this movie but the one that consistently made me feel uncomfortable was the masturbation scene. Diane desperately tries to continue the fantasy as indicated by the blurred image but unpleasant reality continues to invade. This is how I think of the initial portion of the movie. It is Diane's attempt to create an ideal fantasy to replace the awful reality we see later. As in the masturbation scene, however, reality refuses to remain submerged. Hints and echoes of the real world intrude.  Finally the truth is revealed in allegory. There is no band; it's all a recording. Memorex, not live. So open the box and release reality. Diane's ideal world is ironic because the visions we see reflect her impressions of how things work. The meeting room with the espresso man, the sullen old man who controls from his isolation room, the stern cowboy, even the two unseen men from the bank all reflect a young girl's perspective.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Any mystery you want solved devolves into boring scenes about the others involved rather than the main characters we are introduced to. The actors in this film deserve the most praise. They kept things interesting and played the heck out of these roles. Good movie, not great. Needed to make a bit more sense to be great.

It gave me the most terrific cinematic experience in my life. I watched this movie and got plunged into the most dramatic plot ever. the film started pretty simply with a aspiring small town girl Betty making her way towards the mighty Hollywood who goes to live in her aunt's exotic apartment and finds a completely clueless amnesiac woman who just had escaped from a terrible accident at Mulholland Dr. Betty helps her to find out who she is. They end up falling in love with each other then bizarre things start to happen. Lynch cleverly introduces two new characters Camilla Rhodes and Diane Selwyn and establishes a drammatical relationship between them. Guess what Betty is Diane and the amnesiac woman is Camilla. The film then explores the astonishing chain of events which will just blow your mindYou will just be overwhelmed by the intrigue, thrill and suspense David Lynch has produced. After the movie completes you will just go wild and think ""What the hell happened in that movie"" and you will start developing your little theory about this movie. I have watched this movie thrice and pretty sure what happened in that movie but next time I watch it I will try to make justification about the characters which I had ignored during my last three watches. That's what I like about this movie each time you watch it different it will offer.My recommendation.. ""Oh Yes,, go for it and get blown by the most psychic, bizarre and awesome cinematic experience ever.............",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Life is But A Dream (after a reviewing),"David Lynch's Mulholland Drive brings him in the territory of Twin Peaks, Eraserhead, but more-so a highly-charged form of surrealist thinking singular only to Lynch regarding Hollywood to make the best films of the year, and of his career. The film is a twisting, meticulously crafted and acted cinema piece about many a lot of things. At FIRST, the basic plot: a woman (Laura Elean Haring) survives a car crash and stumbles down the hill next to Mulholland drive and walks into a woman's house she has never met before. She also has amnesia, and when the woman (Naomi Watts), an actress, who is currently occupying the place lets her stay for a few days to get her memories together, the plot unfolds. Other side stories are interestingly blended into the rest of the movie involving a troubled director (Justin Theroux) who is forced into things he didn't intend on, the woman living in the house who tries and goes for auditions, etc.But the plot (even the part involving Haring) isn't even the big part of the movie. Lynch, like he did in Eraserhead, exposes the audience to logical and realistic (er, in Lynch's sense) scenes and then sidesteps into a surreal and dreamlike world...or what one might THINK is the dreamworld. Yet it's really about dreaming, one might think, as reality and fantasy become part of the pieces of Lynch's method. What is it to have a dream, anyway, Lynch may be essentially asking the audience? And what is it to have things both idealized and ugly in equal measure, reflected in the subconscious, and drifted back during sleep like some kind of wavelength that is personal but psychologically sound, more or less? And, most importantly, why do we need fantasy? Well, there needs to be a divide, Lynch may be supposing, between fantasy and reality, but at the same time, for the sake of art and cinema, the line needs to be blurred as well to reach underlying truths about what it is to create, what it is to act, what it is to be controlled in the measures of creation and reinterpretation.These might be pretentious points presented by another filmmaker, but Lynch, for all of his abandoning of conventions (albeit with a firm, knowing embracing of the intent in conventions, archetypes and clichés from Hollywood films), is nevertheless a superlatively entertaining writer/director/sound editor, who makes some of the most profound and everlasting statements ever about Hollywood and the illusions created from reality (whether manufactured ala 50s singers in a booth then put on film, or in some capacity regarding a dirty dude behind the Winkies) while never losing the power to make it one hell of a ride. And by 'ride' I mean the ride of a filmmaker overwhelmingly yet carefully confident in what he wants to convey: of the corny light and contorted ideals that comes out of the darkness of Diane's dreams (I'll relent and say that it makes the most sense, even though I'd love it just as much if it didn't go so easily for sense), and that, of course, it's all about emotional response.In short, it's one of the must-see films from the 2000s, not just for Lynch fans but for those who might never think of going near a Lynch film: it's funny, it's tragic, it's mysterious, and it's both dense and simple in equal measure. Like music, it'll either rock your boat or leave you dry and for me it still rocks my boat to this day.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Refreshingly different... (or differently refreshing?),"A much as I fancy myself to be a proud lover all of the classic, popcorn munching, money-making box office blowouts (i.e. The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc etc.) I must admit that I loved this movie.  Heck, I'd place it right up there with my hobbits and Harrison Fords.It's a different movie, that's for sure, but in this case it's multi-layered storyline is what makes it so appealing.  It creates so many different thoughts and emotions that by the end of the movie, you're never quite sure what to think or how to feel.  And every time you see it, your thoughts and feelings change. I LOVE that.It's all open to interpretation, and you can make of it what you'd like.Naomi Watts does an excellent job with the role (or 'roles' I guess you should say...) and she has GREAT chemistry with Laura Harring.  The supporting cast is excellent, as is the layout of each scene.  There are some really and truly terrifying/disturbing images in this film that will stick with you far longer than you might wish them too.Worth watching once... but infinately better each and every time after.Much as I love 'Dune', 'Mullholand Drive' puts in some rough competition for David Lynch's best.Get's the clowns_n_cookies seal of approval.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Complex and Ingenious,"If there was ever a filmmaker whose films fuel discussion and divided opinion long after the final credits have rolled, David Lynch is certainly a prime candidate.Almost every film he has made so far is classed as either a work of genius with a unique point of view, or incomprehensible arty-farty rubbish. Despite whatever anyone thinks of his films, however, it is undeniable that they are all very well-crafted, well-directed, and will unfailingly cause a reaction.Mulholland Drive, while originally intended to be a TV series in the same vein as ""Twin Peaks"" was restructured and recreated into a fascinating piece of film-making and storytelling, with a dreamlike and almost detached atmosphere all of its own. Employing several set pieces of mysterious dwarfs, blue neon, red drapes and vintage microphones, chanteuses singing Roy Orbison songs, enigmatic and dangerous femmes fatales and '50's memorabilia, the setting is perfectly ""Lynchian"". Everything is stylish and chic, caught in a hazy lens with an element of something dark just behind the scenes.What causes the most controversy in Lynch's films, however, is the plot itself, or more particularly, the conclusion. Some people will wonder if there was a point to watching the movie, expecting an ending that is handed on a plate. Lynch, however, likes to make his audience work for their own answers to the movie (and personally, with the case of Mulholland Drive, I do believe that there is an underlying solution that does make sense of the entire film). Moviegoers who enjoy something cerebral and enjoy a challenge will love this movie. Others who do not attempt to understand the movie will either be entranced by the imagery, or be appalled at the apparent lack of a coherent ending.Ultimately, though, the key to Lynch's films, including Mulholland Drive, is to switch your point of view. Lynch's films centre heavily on dreams, and once the viewer realises what they are watching, the film takes on a different perspective, with a satisfactory conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
CONVOLUTED BUT COMPELLING,"If you appreciate good cinematography, direction and like to drift into dreams this is the movie for you. It is confusing and convoluted but compelling. The movie should be seen in the theater to appreciate the beauty of the filming but you have to rent it later if you hope to make any sense of it.Part of the problem yet an incredibly unique idea is having the cast play different roles in what are sometimes dream sequences, sometimes flashbacks and sometimes just the regular story. Which by the way isn't really that much. The two leads are involved in a lesbian relationship which Watts takes more seriously and gets dumped when Harring gets to be full fledged star. So naturally she hires a hit man to kill her ex-lover and the film actually starts with the botched attempt on Harring's life.Then the dreams and flashbacks come along with the audience left to figure out what order they belong in.I've heard Lynch described as surrealistic by some while others say he just clips portions of a movie together in any sequence to seem ""artsy"".I don't know the answer to that but I have to say Lynch is consistently confusing and this film is typical of his work but certainly superior to the vastly overrated ""Blue Velvet""/I gave this 7 out 10 bearing in mind that it should be seen twice or more. 2 1/2 out 4 if you are at the theater and don't want to bother.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Yes indeed, the best of 2001!!","I watched Mulholland Drive twice only. The first time around I was able to deduce what part was dream and what part was reality, but otherwise was still left confused about apparently disconnected scenes and obscure symbols that appear throughout the movie. The second time the pieces fell together (also after some research on the web). I wasn't a big David Lynch fan before, but I always enjoyed the quirky characters and especially the mood and atmosphere that he achieves in his movies. But, by far, this movie was the one that struck me as having the best plot of them all! Of all the movies I saw in 2001, Mulholland Drive comes up on top.The beauty of it is that, not only does he create the atmosphere of mystery and tension (remember the ""monster"" behind the alley?) and brings us another array of strange and funny people, but most of it does make sense and can be explained - and the real story justifies the melancholy that flows through the movie.If you figured out that the bulky first part of it is a dream, and she wakes up after the blue key opens the mysterious blue box (and the cowboy says ""wake up, pretty girl"") - then you will probably also have noticed how everybody in the ""dream"" part have their names and roles switched from the ""real"" part, and that the ""dream"" part of the movie operates pretty much in ""dream logic"" (that is, the protagonist gets her way, Hollywood is an idealized place, her lover is at her mercy and the way she wants her to be - a blank sheet of paper). The ""Silencio"" club and the blue box are provided as symbols - for ""what"" there are plenty of theories out there. Another symbol is the (disjointed) cafeteria scene in which one character discusses his dreams and then has to confront it - this looks like the same cafeteria where she ordered her lover killed, so it makes sense to think of the ""monster"" as her guilt in real life surfacing on her dream. Many of these elements where reality tries to pierce into the dream are quite spellbinding (the other one is when she sees her own body).But what holds the whole movie together is a sense of sadness - after all the ""reality"" is that our heroine lives a terrible life of guilt for having ordered her lover killed and is about to commit suicide, and that is the time and context in which she has her dream. And right away, in her dream, her lover is miraculously saved from murder... This is also a nice twist, bending the two storylines together.Naomi Watts does such a beautiful job, reinforcing the dreamlike and unreal qualities of her character in her dream - and then forcing us to confront the reality.I am looking forward to watching this movie again and again... It's a great experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Warmed over TV Pilot served a' la mode'.,"Before damning or praising MULHOLLAND DRIVE one should first understand its background and what the director's original intent was. Roughly the first 90 minutes of this film are composed of footage from a 1999 TV movie that was to have served as a pilot for a proposed series on ABC. They apparently did not like what they saw, or perhaps felt that the story line --- ""small town girl goes Hollywood, meets bizarre characters, gets embroiled in mystery"", was just a bit too odd for the sedated cop/medical/sitcom/reality crowd. Either way the film languished in the vaults for over a year. Director David Lynch however, found a way to salvage his project --- simply tack on an hour of typically Lynchian sex and weirdness, then release it theatrically and hope that audiences worldwide would embrace it as a viable, multi-layered, groundbreaking work of art.Well, to me that sounds a bit like micro-waving a piece of old apple pie, serving it up with a large dollop of cherry vanilla ice cream and hoping no one notices. Recently there have been lots of user comments stating that the film's first half should be viewed as an extended dream, and its second half as actual reality. The problem with that interpretation is that it has been embraced 'after-the-fact' by viewers who think they see some artistic master plan on the director's part. This could not be further from the truth. The scenes from the pilot had been shot with no such thing in mind. Even if the dream angle was something Lynch was going for in the refurbished theatrical version, those early scenes still come off as too firmly grounded in reality to seem convincingly dreamlike. No, I don't buy this dream angle at all. In the end, I believe that the reason many of us are drawn to this movie is not because of the bland pie underneath, but rather the rich, intoxicatingly sweet ice cream that's been dumped atop it.Let's get down to brass tacks.  There are basically 2 reasons most of us are fascinated by this movie. First and foremost, the lesbian sex scenes. Make no mistake about it boys and girls, many of us in living in these modern, liberated times have come to appreciate the aesthetically titillating aspects of watching two beautiful women making love to each other. If you disagree with me, simply try imagining yourself being as enthralled with this movie as you currently are had 2 'guys' played the lead roles. Well, now that we've established (surprise) that sex sells, we should ask ourselves if that in itself makes something great art? I certainly don't think so, --- If it did, half the pornographic films out there would be considered works on par with CITIZEN KANE.Now for the second reason this film seems to fascinate us --- those amazingly disconcerting and typically surreal Lynchian moments that abound in the movie's final hour. Of all those moments, the most hauntingly memorable, in my opinion, is the scene at Club Silencio featuring the Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"". Moments like that, coupled with the aforementioned scenes of sapphic bliss, build an atmosphere of brooding mystery and exotic sensuality that is quite alluring indeed.It should come as no surprise that those scenes were part of the new material shot to help sell the film theatrically. Unfortunately, they simply feel like colorful afterthoughts --- material that was never truly part of the director's original vision for the film. Knowing this, at least for me, makes the overall experience of viewing MULHOLLAND DRIVE somewhat less than satisfying. In the end, its a bummer to think that there was never truly an artistic intent on the director's part other than to salvage a failed project by injecting  moments of signature weirdness and steamy sex into it. Judging by the reviews on this site however, I'd say he'd managed to convince most of you otherwise.This film gets a  6 out of 10  because I have a 'soft' spot for David Lynch. Not surprisingly, when it comes to Laura Elena Harring, the exact opposite seems to be true.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Mulholland Dr.,"Mulholland Drive is often referred to as David Lynch's masterpiece. While my favorite Lynch movie is a toss-up between The Elephant Man and The Straight Story, I wouldn't argue with that claim. Mulholland Drive certainly seems like the ultimate Lynch headtrip. It's a delirious, movie-mad fantasy, a surreal film noir that steadily reveals seductive, disturbing layers. That haunting, oddball but compelling vibe found in all of Lynch's best films is here in spades.Lynch returns to the realm of schizophrenic weirdness after the gentle, G-rated Straight Story, but the results are much more satisfying and compelling than his previous Wild at Heart and Lost Highway. From the opening moments, the strange artistry of Mulholland Drive is fully evident. If Blue Velvet was the most demented Hardy Boys mystery ever, than Mulholland Drive is like a deeply sinister Nancy Drew mystery on acid. Our bubbly, attractive heroines become Los Angeles sleuths, but the giddy vibe is held up by an ominous and seriously weird undercurrent. Mulholland Drive only grows darker and stranger as it goes on, going to some seriously disturbing and surreal places by the last act. It's about as sublimely orchestrated as films get, although occasionally hurt by the overly lurid approach that damaged other Lynch movies. Thankfully, Mulholland Drive is kept afloat by Lynch's directorial genius, and the fact that it actually does have a soulful center. It's nowhere near the emotional powerhouse of The Elephant Man, partly by design, but Lynch clearly has sympathy for his main character - a Hollywood outcast whose failed aspirations have left her an unstable, perhaps-psychotic wreck. This is partially due to Naomi Watts's monumental performance. It cannot be easy to give a human, emotional performance in such a fractured and bizarre movie, but Watts more than lives up to the challenge. She is alternately dazzlingly beautiful, appealingly innocent and horrifically damaged. A great performance in a weirdly great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wonderfully subversive movie,"Saw this for the second time last night & I really love it. It's a masterpiece - the weirdest yet most enjoyable film noire I've seen.Those who 'explain' the plot are doing a grand job ... but in many ways the point of this movie is that subverts all plots. Just when you think it 'works', it doesn't! No reviewer quite manages to put their finger on how the plot holds, and I love that! I couldn't help but wonder at times if Lynch was taking the p*** out of Hollywood in general, and maybe Tarantino in particular. Whereas Pulp Fiction (a favourite of mine) 'works', Mulholland Drive deliberately subverts the plotline. The result is gorgeous. Oh, and talking of gorgeous ... Naomi Watts. She puts in a stunning performance.Terrific film - a dream-like trance mixing humour and dark, dark, thoughts. What a great antidote to the 95%+ pap that comes out of Tinsel town.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best films of this decade so far,"David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. is undoubtedly one of the best films of this decade. The film takes the viewer down an ever-more disturbing path, one that will evoke every feeling in the book before it reaches its raw, nerve-shattering conclusion. As one reviewer put it, ""Mulholland Dr. gets in your head and stays there."" This statement could not be more true. No film is harder to decipher than Mulholland Dr., but from David Lynch, we would expect nothing less. The non-Lynchian crowd will be frustrated to the point of fury, while those who respect Lynch's work will be drawn to this film's complexity and dark symbolism. It takes a special person to enjoy a movie with more metaphors than actual plot, and more symbolism than hard fact. Those who dwell on what is real and what is not will not be able to fully absorb the sheer brilliance this picture. In fact, I recommend that a first-time viewer simply ignore Lynch's cryptic ""10 clues to solving the thriller,"" and just enjoy the film for what it is: a masterpiece of modern film-making which does not rely on big-budget action or cheesy romance, but rather on a consistent and intriguing script and an absorbing, real-life quality that many films lack. Lynch's camera may resemble that of a horror film to many, and indeed at least one scene pushes the gates of the horror genre nearly wide open. The throbbing, often hostile soundtrack will only add to the feeling of fear incurred by this picture. Overall, I found Lynch's newest film to be a piece of cinematic brilliance with few flaws and much to offer for the philosophic, or simply just observant, viewer. Any film that has the ability to lead to hours of pointed discussion between recent viewers (as Mulholland Dr. has a reputation for doing) has done well for itself. Indeed, Mulholland Dr. is a love-it-or-hate-it film, with little or no grey area. Those who love it will watch it countless times, and develop and redevelop long-winded theories and themes that they believe Lynch has hidden in the film. Those who hate it will denounce Lynch has an arrogant surrealist who believes that the more complicated something is, the better it is. For my part, I loved every minute of this film, and each time I watch it, I discover something new. I was speechless after watching this film, with thoughts racing through my head so fast I thought it might explode. Films rarely have that effect on me. For those who are tired of the Hollywood big-budget summer blockbusters full of testosterone-filled men slaughtering each other with machine guns and beautiful women in bikinis disarming nuclear weapons, try something new this summer. Try David Lynch's Mulholland Dr.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Don't feel bad if you don't ""get"" the movie, there's nothing much to get anyway.","About 10-20 minutes in, I thought, why have I never heard of this movie before? If it's this good and well acted, some people might still be talking about it in 2021, right? I kept watching and kept asking the same thing almost throughout the movie. And then I finished the movie. And then I understood why this movie was never really talked about. I personally enjoyed the movie from start to finish. As a thriller, it managed to keep me curious throughout the movie. But once it's finished and you take a bit of time to yourself to sort out what you have just watched and mental strip everything that isn't really necessary, the magic is pretty much gone and you're left with this sad story about a girl and her love affair. To think about it, I probably prefer the drama aspect of this movie better than the ""mystery"" part of it. The drama part is the part that stays with me. Naomi Watts was brilliant in this, as she always was. Everything else to me was just routine psycho-thriller sequence to make a thriller a thriller.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Nevertheless, I remain hesitant to label this work as one of the greatest psychological thrillers ever created. Whilst the climax resonated with me, the remainder of the film did not have the same impact.On a side note, I must commend Naomi Watts for yet another exceptional performance.

Watts out because Naomi will be a name you will hear a lot of during the next several years; and Harring's Rita Hayworth looks is worth the price of admission. Their lesbian thespian scenes will be in your top 3 list of the most sexiest scenes of all time. But most important, their performances are of oscar-caliber. Also, this just-in  Justin Theroux also delivered an oscar-worthy performance as the constrained male director.

Three Words: Worst Movie Ever!,"Some of you who are reading these user comments may have read that this movie can be compared to Memento.  That is simply not correct.

It has absolutely no point to it and it left me with a headache trying to figure out a possible point.There are numerous subplots that are never elaborated on.  Example: the cowboy, what was his deal?  I wouldn't know because he was in and out with no conclusion to his story.  The homeless person comes into the movie all of the sudden and than again towards the end with the mysterious blue box but yet just when I thought that would open up my eyes to some hidden, brilliant meaning that I was simply missing, it went nowhere.  One more example, who were the two guys that forced the director to pick Camilla as the actress. Why did they want Camilla?  Oh, that's right, they never say why.  Why should they?  The movie never says why it does anything.  I rented it knowing that I would hate it.  I have always hated David Lynch movies.

Mind-blowing,"Marvelously clever and stylish. The first two hours require patience, as it's unclear what's going on and how all of the disparate threads tie together, but when they do in that last half hour, it's mind-blowing. I love how Lynch created a puzzle that's so sophisticated that even once you grasp the basic concept, your analysis with those around you will probably continue on for awhile, e.g. for what various things mean, and how all of the elements of reality are incorporated into the dream. The ambiguity is fantastic. It's an understatement to say that Lynch elevated a pretty simple story with the surreal, out of order way he told it, and the narrative device went very well with the dashed dream of stardom in tinseltown and the satirical elements of the industry he incorporates. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring are amazing in it too.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Many commentators here are sure they have 'figured it out,' i.e., what parts are dream, etc. I've seen it a few times (I own it, ok?) but am not completely convinced by anyone's explanations, so far, although some insights have been helpful. I celebrate Lynch's sound and vision. On one (important) level, he is showing how sensual the medium can be. Perhaps one should resist a bit the temptation to over-intellectualize it. In my opinion MD is intended to be felt too. Ideally one enjoys the experience without it being all reductively sorted out.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely Mindblowing !!!,"This is one of the best movies I have seen for a long Long - LONG TIME. Definitely David Lynch's best.(Although haven't seen ""The Straight Story"") Its fractured time shifts bend and twist and demand the viewer to be with the actors in their own free and fractured dream consciousness. When the first cross cutting in time begins it is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubricks 2001 in the White Room, its almost a scene by scene technical duplication. There are also references to Alain Resnais ""Providence"" in the multiple time shifts and viewpoints. Except Lynch takes this principle and takes it much much further to the absolute edge of reality. If it had gone too far it would almost be a totally confused film but it is at the very knife edge of total confusion and a concrete multi view pointed reality, (seen in several different ways and times of course).Naomi Watts is an equally brilliant Actor, whom I thought was parodying Laura Dern at first. However I realized she has a much greater depth and brilliance than Laura Dern.Overall an Absolutely Mindblowing Experience! and a gift to the world of Cinema History, this film will be a cult classic for many followers of David Lynch (Myself Included)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fabulous Visuals, Byzantine Plot","This film is visually arresting.  It also is a challenge.  Just to give you a hint, as I was leaving the theater, people were actually yelling across the parking lot, ""But I don't even know what it was about!""  Make no mistake, this is an intricate film.Before I get to my interpretation of the plot, a few general comments. There are some shots that are extremely colorful and fun, including the title sequence of swing dancers (which has nothing to do with the rest of the film), a gorgeous scene of singers in a film-within-a-film, and an eerie nightclub rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" in Spanish (""Llorando""). There are the usual Lynch signature elements, such as mysterious strangers, expressionless cops, and over-the-top scenes involving humorous violence (an inept hit-man) and unnatural responses to events (such as an odd, but strangely true, line delivered by a pool man found to be bedding a leading character's wife.)  You may wind up remembering this film from one or two truly striking scenes.  That is not a trifling accomplishment, many films are completely forgettable.The actors are really put through their paces.  They certainly look good. Some are over-taxed by the eccentric script.  I'll never understand why Mr. Lynch feels he has to put leaden 1940s-style dialogue into the mouths of his characters (""If you do good, I will see you one more time.  If you do bad, I will see you two more times."").  It works on a cerebral level, given certain plot elements, but makes some actors look like mere line-readers.  Which may be the point.  But what point is that exactly, pray tell?  It works for me, in a goofy sort of way.  But is Mr. Lynch trying to be goofy, or simply obscure?  Inquiring minds want to know.Anyway, we are on familiar Lynch territory (I even found the female leads vaguely reminiscent of Laura Dern and Isabella Rossellini).  Beautiful moments, odd juxtapositions, eccentric dialogue.  Mr. Lynch really should try his hand at music videos.But what about the plot?  Ah, the plot.  Clearly, part of the action is meant to reflect ""reality,"" while the remainder is ""fantasy.""  But which is which?  Perhaps it doesn't matter, since, as the Spanish say, ""La vida es sueno, y los suenos, suenos son"" (""All of life is but a dream"").  But since we are trying to understand this particular dream, let me give it a shot.My interpretation is that the entire film takes place, non-chronologically, immediately preceding and following a failed actress' suicide.  Much of it takes place in the seconds immediately before and after, though some scenes occur long before and after (she even visualizes her own decayed carcass long after her death).  Toward the  beginning of the film, in what I take to be the actress' final thoughts, there is a romanticized depiction of her naive introduction to Hollywood, fantasies of how it could it all have turned out well for her if only she had had all-powerful guardians forcing various Hollywood losers to recognize her genius, and nightmares and guilt about having let down her adoring small-town parents (the ""little people"" who terrorize her with cackling laughter and seem to be the main impetus for her pulling the trigger.)  The last part of the film focuses, retrospectively, on what really happened, shorn of fantasy, where the major problem is revealed to be the actress' use and discarding by a powerful lesbian lover, on whom she took bitter revenge.Throughout, there are quick switches back and forth between the fantasy/dream/nightmare and the reality.  Various jabs are made about the Hollywood casting process, boorish actors, and the dissonance between the artificialities projected on the silver screen and the hard realities of the people creating them (Silencio!  It is all on tape!).  In fact, the main plot could be seen as an extended meditation on that dissonance.You will enjoy the film if you like colorful, European-style cinema that is confusing and which strains a bit to be opaque, but which forces you to piece together the jigsaw puzzle yourself (if you have the inclination and patience).  If you want mindless entertainment with a happy ending, consider seeing ""Bandits"" instead.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Dreams are not excuses,"Don't focus on the movie or the praise, focus on the feeling from your heart.I don't say this randomly. This movie has been talked about as if it is a masterpiece. I respect the creative and somewhat strange perspective of the director. But people have flattered this movie because they are too confused about the story and the ending. The truth is that you cannot create a story with all the facts and characters and then say it is a dream.The impressive points of this movie are the songs, the acting of characters like Betty (Naomi Watts) or Coco (Ann Miller). I like the two scenes: the scene where the two girls (Betty and Rita) discover the dead body and the bed scene after that. And this story? It's interesting enough to give us a sense of the ""American dream"" message - where young girls like Betty are immersed in and cannot escape the trap of fame, only to receive a tragic ending. This is not exaggerated at all, it has been the truth in Hollywood for decades. A sad truth. But basically, David Lynch's film, from the idea of bringing a confusing but mysterious story, created redundant or irrelevant characters like Dan and the other man_ his friend, two detectives, details that are exaggerated to shock the viewers like the man spitting coffee into a handkerchief or Betty suddenly jerking like having an epileptic seizure at that theater. These details are useless and hateful. And the detail of the blue box, if this is the door to returning to reality, I don't like it. So what's the scene after that when Betty's aunt returns, for what? The Matrix? The confusion did not give me a memorable experience, but rather annoyance.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An absorbing movie if you are willing to figure it out,"My wife and I watched this movie on DVD. We found the atmosphere and acting to be absorbing. The plot was complex and mysterious, difficult to figure out. In reading comments about this movie, it seems that those who made some progress in figuring it out enjoyed it. Those who could not or were not willing to give it the effort it requires didn't like it so much.We located a list of clues attributed to David Lynch on the web. They involved paying attention to who did what and where at a specific time. For instance, who are the older couple that arrive at the airport as the movie begins? Something is happening during the opening credits: what is it? We watched the movie a second time paying attention to the hints.Then we watched the movie a third time with the knowledge we had gained from the hints. It unlocked whole realms of additional meaning hidden in the movie. What a satisfying experience.We like it when a move asks an investment from us, and then rewards us for making it. We have nothing against movies about muscle-bound men shooting at each other or stupid people acting stupid, but we like this, too.If you're not willing to give this movie a little effort, then you have no one to blame but yourself for being in the dark.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
disappointing,"Having seen Eraserhead more times than I would like to admit, plus each of David Lynch's subsequent films at least once each, I found Mulholland Dr. fairly disappointing. There were too many familiar elements that he did in his previous works, some of them not worth repeating. Like the dwarf in the curtained room (groan!) from Fire Walk. Having said that, there are moments that are brilliant. Like Betty's audition scene. Naomi Watts is quite a find. There is 'the' scene at the end that looks more than a little like the one at the end of Polanski's ""The Tenant"". Still, I found it quite easy to sit through the more than 2 hours because of the striking visuals and the usual twisted Lynch atmosphere.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Just a little, OK?This one started off very confusingly and I was thinking that as time progressed the pieces would all fit together. That was a foolish thought, as it turned out. The pieces didn't so much fit together as disintegrate.So perhaps David was trying to tell me that I shouldn't make such assumptions, that things don't always fit together.

"An extremely interesting, intelligent, imaginative and absorbing psychological mystery thriller","""Mulholland Drive"", 2001. Written and Directed by: David Lynch. * * * *This is one of the most expertly directed, imaginative and fascinating psychological mystery drama films I've ever seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I really admire this film. I consider it a masterpiece.Made in Lynch's signature dreamlike, dark, weird and complicated storytelling style, involving changed and uncertain identities and character relationships. As a bonus, Lynch manages to skillfully add and execute a scene of dark humor into the story. It's a film to pay close attention to, with clues presented from beginning to end.""Mulholland Drive"" is similar to the weird ""Lost Highway"", 1997, which most critics dismissed as mediocre. Both have strange and complicated characters and stories. Personally, I liked ""Lost Highway"", but admit it's shortcomings. It's all style and not much else. ""Mulholland Drive"" is superior mainly for it's superior direction. For it's genre, it's more engaging and convincing.Clearly, Lynch has mastered his unusual and very unique storytelling style and technique with this film. Lynch's ability to set up scenes of troubled characters in strange circumstances and the acting performance he gets out of them is especially impressive. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring both give very good acting performances, making memorable impressions for the film year of 2001. Another impressive, haunting and hypnotic music score from Angelo Badalamenti.The story of ""Mulholland Drive"" is set in present day Los Angeles and concerns a young woman who suffers from memory loss after a car accident. She befriends a hopeful and optimistic woman newly arrived and seeking acting auditions in Hollywood. This is not quite the truth. The real story is very different. The film is very non-linear and thematic. Very much a thinking person's kind of film. Part real life, part fantasy, part dream and part hallucination. ""Mulholland Drive"" is all of these things. There's a lot of different layers, elements, ideas, characters and themes in the film and it all doesn't come completely together until the chilling sequence of the final minutes of the film. This scene really threw me off a lot, the first time I saw it. That's just Lynch's style. To mystify and hypnotize the audience all the way through and then through in a radical, bizarre twist at the end. I consider myself of above average intelligence and to be highly visually attentive. It took me several viewings of the film to better understand exactly what happened in the story and the meaning and relationship of all these different characters to the two lead characters (Watts and Harring).Nominated for a Best Director Academy Award, nominated for The Golden Palm at Cannes and winner of the Best Director award at Cannes. This film deserved more Academy Award nominations than it received, only Best Director. My guess is the film is simply too weird for Hollywood to fully acknowledge. At least Hollywood gave Lynch a Best Director nomination. Screenplay, cinematography, sound, music score and the lead acting performances of Watts and Harring are all excellent, yet the film received no nominations at all, in these very obvious and deserving categories. Overall, the film looks great. It's hard to believe the budget for this film was only $7 million dollars, far below the typical budget of a Hollywood film of 2001.A must see for any discerning, serious film buff.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not a complete story,"I'm a big-time David Lynch fan -- I even like his original cut of ""Dune."" And, without question, ""Twin Peaks"" is my favorite TV series ever, even the second season (well, most of it, anyway).All that being said, I was looking forward to Lynch's new TV series ""Mulholland Dr."" and was quite disappointed when I heard it wasn't going to be picked up. When I heard he was releasing the pilot as a feature film, the only thing I could think was, ""Twin Peaks pilot, European release.""""Mulholland Dr."" does exactly what the European release of the ""Twin Peaks"" pilot did -- set up lots of interesting story lines, and then have to rush to a conclusion that made little sense and didn't tie up anything. The only difference is that we had the rest of series to make some sense of ""Twin Peaks.""""Mulholland Dr."" simply isn't a complete story. At a certain point, roughly about the time Betty and Rita start getting naked, the story became incomprehensible.Sure, I can piece together a story from the mess that Lynch threw together here, but why should I have to? It's one thing for a story to be ambiguous, another thing entirely for it to be so obscure as to be little more than random scenes tossed in a bowl and flung across the screen. And, honestly, the story that I piece together is so trivial and banal that it really isn't worth the effort.Of course, the same could be said of all of Lynch's work -- much weirdness to disguise the complete lack of anything to say, all form and no substance.Even so, I sure did like it, more or less.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Many will disagree with me but...,"I thought of giving this an okay score, I can admit the movie was well shot, good acting etc.. all the components of an average to good movie.

If there was some grand point to all the character changes and plot changes I missed it and I have a feeling that all my friends who said they loved it were saying that because they thought they should. Sort of like Shakespeare, I like his writing but I suspect that many who say they love it say it because they feel they are supposed to.This movie tried way too hard to be different for me, it was neither entertaining, nor moving, nor purposeful.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nancy Drew goes to Hollywood.,"The young and beautiful but naive Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) leaves her home in Ontario for Hollywood and immediately finds herself mixed up with a mysterious amnesiac woman who calls herself Rita (Laura Harring).  Betty has come to tinseltown hoping to become an actress, and, while trying to help Rita recover her identity, Betty crosses paths with film director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux).  Slowly a bizarre love triangle unfolds between the three characters, and Betty finds herself in an inescapable nightmare that may just be of her own making.After his surprisingly successful experiment with sentimental American heartland drama in `The Straight Story,' director David Lynch returns with panache to the psycho-surreal territory he has claimed as his own. `Mulholland Drive' creates a new neighborhood in Lynchville bordered closely by `Fire Walk With Me' and `Lost Highway,' and echoes of those two films are heard throughout `Mulholland Drive.'  Here are eerie archetypal messengers, an illusionist, mysterious puzzles and keys,  an inexplicable corpse, malignant evil, and the most terrifying of dreams.Lynch's cast is, as usual, excellently suited to the strange goings-on.  The three leads give subtly nuanced performances and are surrounded at all times by a number of excellent supporting actors.  Dan Hedaya and Robert Forster have very small parts, as do Michael J. `Twin Peaks' Anderson, Ann Miller (a veteran of old Hollywood), and Lynch's longtime musical collaborator Angelo Badalamenti--but all of them add a wonderful spice to their scenes.  Richard Green as the Magician and Layfayette Montgomery as the Cowboy both create defining and unforgettable Lynch characters.Two other spectacular features of the film bear mentioning.  First is the soundtrack, which does a great deal to enhance the film's mood, from Badalamenti's typically brooding numbers and supporting tunes by Lynch and John Neff to the heartrending performance of Roy Orbison's `Crying' sung in Spanish,  a capella, by Rebekah Del Rio.  Second is the delicious non-linear plot, evoking inevitable associations with `Lost Highway.'  Anyone who had trouble with `Lost Highway,' however, should not stay away from `Mulholland Drive.'  While one cannot promise that `Mulholland Drive' will be easier to swallow, comparing the two films will certainly do much to illuminate the exquisite madness of Lynch's method.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing Yet Confounding,"Mulholland Drive is a film that certainly has its merits. David Lynch's direction is visually striking, filled with atmospheric tension and a sense of eerie mystery that I find compelling. Naomi Watts delivers a standout performance, navigating a complex character with skill and depth. The film's ability to create an unsettling mood and its cinematic craft are commendable and keep me engaged through its first half.However, the plot can be incredibly challenging to follow. The narrative is deliberately ambiguous and fragmented, which makes it difficult to fully grasp the story's intentions and meanings. While I appreciate Lynch's artistic approach, the disjointed structure and surreal elements sometimes feel more frustrating than thought-provoking. The lack of clarity can detract from the overall experience, leaving me more puzzled than intrigued.In short, this film offers a visually captivating and artistically ambitious experience, bolstered by strong performances. However, its convoluted plot and abstract storytelling might leave me struggling to fully connect with the film's intended message.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece and my absolute favorite film,"I've been a huge cinephile throughout my entire 26 years of life (ok, that's not THAT long but I've watched a lot of movies). Somehow I missed Mulholland Drive-probably because I was born in 1992 and no one else in my family is into films and especially films like this one.This is my all time favorite film. I saw it for the first time in 2018 and immediately watched it three more times (one each day for the three days following my first viewing). I can genuinely, 100% promise you the film became more brilliant with each watch. Then, I did some research. Wow. How could someone be so brilliant.David Lynch is a mastermind and this film is why I love film as much as I do. It's more than just a film, it's a feeling, an experience, a journey. And it's a journey worth taking, my friends. I assure you.Go watch Mulholland Drive if you have not already. If you have already, go watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good Lynch, but no Eraserhead","This one may be the closest to Eraserhead of all Lynch's work.  It's strange, wonderful, weird, wild, sexy, funny, violent, and non-linear.And no, I don't mean to imply there was anything sexy in Eraserhead, but there is a sexual undertone to all Lynch films, including The Elephant Man (though I don't recall such an undertone in Dune or The Straight Story ...). In this one, Twin Peaks and of course Blue Velvet it is front and center, an indelible part of the ""story,"" such as it is, as a whole.For those seeking a truly Lynchian experience, this one's hard to beat -- but I'd generally recommend it to his fans only.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I think a lot of people were duped.,"I get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie (not all people, but a lot of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. People of middling intelligence, if you will, who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think Lynch is a genius.Lynch, to me, is like Tarantino.  They're both great, but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe.  No director can change the world, so chill out.  And both make sucky flicks sometimes, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day.  And clearly, since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack-jobbed into a feature film, it wasn't made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie.  Face it, much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which cannot be understood.  We can all make up meanings, Lynch may have his own view, but none of that matters.  It was strewn about the screen incoherently.  Admittedly, the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story, but then it falters.The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls, the lawyers... come on.  I can almost picture David Lynch yelling cut, forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all ""Look how crazy and weird I am! Isn't it great?? It's so weird and crazy!""  Weird and crazy works if it's a by-product of your style.  However, it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that.  It's like all those half assed Pulp Fiction throw backs that came out after Pulp Fiction. It's just not cool.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A meticulously crafted, mind-bending masterpiece","Mulholland Drive is an incredibly divisive movie; everyone seems to view it either as a masterpiece or an abomination, and this is understandable, as it is extremely confusing and subtle. Most confusing movies give enough clues and clear plot points to formulate a theory, although it still takes a lot of thought to piece together these clues. Mulholland Drive still gives these clues, but they're very subtle; it's hard to tell what's important, what isn't and how all these seemingly unconnected occurrences all connect. The narrative is far from conventional too, and this only adds to the mystery.This makes it quite clear why this movie is so divisive, because on first appearance, it can seem severely disjointed, incoherent and simply a mess, if you try to view it as a straightforward narrative. Nothing is made clear to the viewer, and so much is kept a mystery for so long, that it is completely understandable as to why it is such a frustrating and pointless movie to some, however I felt myself intrigued throughout. The constant mystery and subtle hints made me very interested and entertained for the whole movie; it always gave enough information to keep the viewer interested, but not a single bit more. The final 15-20 minutes gives many answers, but creates even more questions, the answers to which are all alluded to within the movie. Many criticise David Lynch of having no idea of what he was doing, and view this movie as only being liked because people think they are finding meaning in what is merely an incomprehensible mess, and I understand how people would think this given the subtlety of the clues and plot, and if you approach the movie thinking it's going to have a straightforward narrative then you will come out disappointed and confused. However, the clues are there, and David Lynch has crafted this movie so carefully and precisely that if you put a lot of thought into it afterwards, you will be able to put together your own theory and ideas.As for the other aspects of the movie, the cinematography is spectacular, particularly in one standout scene early in the movie, in which the camera is used effectively to create maximum tension. I was apprehensive about the acting at first, mainly due to Naomi Watts' character, as it felt a little forced and unnatural, but soon I realised that it was just the character's personality and she displayed some great acting throughout the movie. The musical score was great too, and overall everything was incredibly well done, I didn't feel that anything dragged down the quality,But of course, the standout feature was the plot, which was masterfully crafted with intense precision to elicit intrigue, and remain in the minds of the viewers for a long time afterwards. It truly is a masterful, if often misunderstood movie, which I believe fully deserves its praise.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thoughts on the meaning of the blue box: dont read if you havent seen the film yet as I think it is a crucial plot element!,"A main theme of the film is the fakery and lack of substance or meaning behind the pompous glamour of hollywood: Betty, on arriving at Hollywood is evidently seduced by the Hollywood dream, and dazzled by its grandeur when she first arrives. However, she soon discovers that inside this pretty packaging there are sinister secrets and ugly truths, as shown by the suicides and the attempted murder. The filthy bum too is especially representative of this internal rottenness. It is also made clear that in Hollywood, nothing is as it seems. This is illustrated at the club, Silencio, where what is thought to be live music and singing turns out to be a series recordings, and the actors seem to be hollographic projections. The falseness is also illustrated by the Hollywood agents, actors and general cronies at the auditions and on the sets: they are very shallow, superficial and incompetent. The blue box is a metaphor for this since it is intriguing and rouses anticipation as to what riches it could contain. However, it is found to be empty and dark inside, just like Hollywood inside the seductive packaging.Further, the box echoes the structure of the film, full of ""red herring"" plot lines that appear to lead nowhere, such as the scene where the hitman shoots some people who appear to have no significance to the plot as a whole is never followed up by a concrete explanation, and the scene in which the director's wife is found in bed with another man: this likewise appears to lead us knowhere. Similarly, the box, mysterious and tantalising, contains nothing, contrary to our expectations. In this way too, it undermines our expectations of the film: we think everything will eventually be made clear, but instead we are left to make our own conclusions. Nothing is made too obvious.There is also the pandora's box metaphor: the key, given to Diane by the hitman, indicates the havoc created by her request to him. Hoewever, the fact that it is Rita/Camilla who opens the box shows that it was infact Camilla who began the chain of events that leads to all the tragedy in the stroy: indeed, as soon as she opens it we are shown the key scene at the dinner where she rouses Diane's anger and hatred. In this way the box indirectly does contain/reveal something: the fact that Rita, previously thought to be more or less innocent, infact instigated these sinister events.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
David Lynch's best movie.,"I have to admit that I had my doubts when I rented this movie. After seeing it I have to admit that it's one of the best movies I've seen in years.One has to watch very closely even if they can't figure out what's going on, because almost everything falls into place as the movie closes out. Subtle ""reality to fantasy"" changes take place at crucial moments to underscore Lynch's story, and if they're missed - so too will be the viewer's realization of them.Are there a few things left unsettled in my mind at the film's end? Sure - the monster in the alley probably being the most debatable, but all in all this movie pulls together in an incredible fashion. Make sure you have a quiet and undisturbed couple of hours to view this thing, because missing a line or two can make all the difference in the world. But definitely watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Is this a film?  Who knows.,"I got this film out purely because it was by David Lynch.  I don't know why, I'm not a big fan but there is a certain stigma attached to the films he has done.  This one takes things to the extreme as far as I am concerned.  I would go as far as saying it is not even a film.  It has a beginning middle and end in relative terms but that is about it.  Nothing makes sense and it is not supposed to.  But why?  It would be nice to come away from the experience actually knowing whether you enjoyed the film but I just felt cheated, almost like I had been duped into sitting there watching something that meant nothing.  I am not saying that this film isn't any good it is just that because it has no meaning it is hard to justify it a rating.  I have read the other reviews on this site and I feel that a lot of people who have rated this film have done so not on its merits but on some imaginary and profound understanding of the mind of David Lynch.  Personally I think after he finished it, he sat back and had a little laugh to himself that everyone that watched it wouldn't actually know why they sat through it all but would then claim that it was a masterpiece purely because it confused them.",,Anonymous,Mystery
As Homer said...,"As Homer Simpson said of Twin Peaks...""Brilliant!  I have no idea what's going on.""So true of this movie.  I think it's David Lynch at his most cryptic, as some of my friends argue about which half was reality, let alone what was happening in that reality.Unfortunately, unlike any other Lynch movie, I think maybe there isn't an overall theme or concept that ties it all together.  Granted, I've only seen it once so far, and many have commented that it needs to be seen 3 times. I disagree.  If the movie doesn't hold up under the first viewing, then there is a real sense of loss with viewing it.  The structure of the film is compelling, and the lead actresses were great, especially Betty/Diane. Very versatile performance, as the movie demanded a LOT from her.  I think that ultimately, viewers just have to make up their own minds, as there is no ONE accurate interpretation to this film, and I suspect that multiple viewing would lead to completely different takes.  I probably WILL watch it again, but I suspect that there isn't a true internal logic to this movie, which can be evidenced by the fact that over half of it was originally a TV pilot, and extra footage was shot to make it a feature.  I think this provides the evidence that the sense of cohesiveness was shoe-horned in after the fact by Lynch.Unlike Lost Highway, which was just as ""out there"" and still his best work to date.Mulholland Dr. is a distant third (I still love Eraserhead to no end - in fact I watched it just after Mulholland Dr).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A woman with amnesia attempts to understand what's happened to her,"This is an educated and well crafted film with many of the hallmarks that make David Lynch one of the finest directors working today.  There are moments of great tension and vivid cinematography.  Lynch imbues the film with intelligence and thought provoking ideas.  He creates in the viewer a sense of sympathy for the main character's plight but also keeps the plot tight and full of intrigue.  You are repulsed (intentionally) by some of the darker characters but paradoxically it is quite difficult to ""take sides"". The sugary sweet nature of the secondary lead is soon left behind as we realise that she too has a more ambiguous nature.Lynch squeezes every ounce of talent out of the performers who turn in believable and convincing performances.

Like A Bad Dream,"Wow, what a movie. I had been meaning to watch this one for a longtime I heard it was dream like. And it definitely was.It's one of those films where you have no idea what it all really means and it's completely open to your interpretation. There's no real answer to it. The movie never really explains anything. And it's very artistic in every way.You were taken down a rabbit hole trying to find out what was what. At first I was feeling disappointed with the movie. It definitely had a lot of weird. The entire soundtrack was eerie and yet the film wasn't eerie. I found the love story was too quick and definitely more pleasing to a guys eyes then a girls. They really loved to show the breasts of the actresses. I lost interest in the first half because everything felt too fake and phoney. Too perfect. Too off, nothing was quite right.And then the second half of the movie hit home and finally I was interested. I wont say what happened because it will spoil the movie. But let me say it went from weird to weirder real fast. And it got very interesting as your brain is trying to figure out what on earth is going on and what just happened. And then by the end you're left with your own interpretation. Because the movie doesn't really explain anything. But it's fascinating when you finally realize what this all might mean.Honestly I think I would have enjoyed the movie better if the second half would have been first and then the first half after. But by doing that I guess it would have made the film more straightforward and less weird. It would have given us a better sense as to what was going on. Which I really would have enjoyed.This movie honestly deserves at least two or more views to try and understand it better. Even then, it's up to you what it means.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not Masterpiece but Fine,"As some other commentators said,i can't say that Mulholland Dr. was a masterpiece actually,but yeah it was nice and worth watching.Firstly i have to say that this film isn't an easy one, so u have to pay great attention to what's going on.Maybe u can't make sense of it at first,but be sure that second viewing will be more useful to grasp minor but important details.In the film u see how human psychology is affected;what to do when he gets hurt;how ambition and jealousy spoil human life;and as a last point,the other side of the medallion,Hollywood.MD tells the story of Diane(Betty)coming to L.A. with a dream of being a good actress like her aunt.And in an audition she meets with Camilia(Rita)and falls in love with her.Actually,Camilia is more successful than Diane and gets roles.While Diane tries to advance herself hopelessly,Camilia wants to break up and she gets engage with a director.With the effect of both being left and jealousy,Diane decides to have Camilia killed by hiring a hit-man.However, she can't get rid of feeling guilty about what she's done and kills herself at the end of the film.Here is the plot for u,but wait a minute,if u expect to see what i've just said clearly or in order, u are definitely wrong.I've said that this is't an easy film at the beginning.In MD,the first part comprises the imagination of Diane and the second part explains the truth that lies behind this.Moreover,while u're watching it,u will see scenes that include a blue box and its key;an undefinable visage of a woman;a cowboy;a place called silencio.Don't get confused,but be careful upon watching.And i should also add that Naomi Whatts'and Laura Harring's performances were deeply moving and they were both up-and-coming.If u ask my opinion,i say that u can spare your 2 hours for this film and watch but with a friend of yours,'cos u may need to discuss it with somebody else!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Lynch in all his glory.  Interpret it.,"This movie is more or less about a women referred to by an alias Rita (the beautiful Laura Elena Harring) trying to find out who she is with the help of her newfound friend Betty (the equally beautiful Naomi Watts).  There are other things going on like a young frustrated director trying to recast the lead of his film and a paranoid man worried about the nightmare behind a diner but most of the movie is Rita trying to find out who she is.  The earlier part of the film is weird but easy to follow but the last thirty minutes are crazy!  Don't go psycho and bash Lynch all you people.  Calm down pay attention and get your own interpretation.  I'm not listing mine for the simple reason I want you to get your own.  There are probably one-million interpretations and none of them are wrong since Lynch probably intended for people to have different interpretations.  That's the beauty of films like this.  They give you freedom which is more than I can say for normal movies.  If you like weird movies like me rent this!  You will also be treating to some disturbing scenes a bum that looks like he came straight from hell, miniature malicious old people crawling under the door, a strange stage performance, an accidental suicide, and a rotting dead body. There's also blue haired woman whispering ""silencio.""  Then there's a rather pointless but sexually stimulating lesbian sex scene (Enjoy guys!). 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sexy, Mysterious, and Thoroughly Lynch","David Lynch may be the sanest madman working in film today. He is a dark, sinister, and cynical overlord trapped in a world of Eisenhower-era optimism. At his best, Lynch can cast a long, menacing shadow of doom and dread over an idyllic and innocent tableau. And when he really excels, his films -- like ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wild at Heart"" -- smolder with a psychosexual tension that's hotter than Georgia asphalt.Immediately sexy and mysterious, ""Mulholland Drive"" plays with the conventions Lynch toyed with in the underrated ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me"" and in his truly bizarre ""The Lost Highway"". Characters are not whom they seem to be, lightness and darkness collide with a cool, enigmatic flicker, and people and objects vanish without a trace. Welcome to Lynch's world: a world that is simultaneously comforting and unsettling. But if you take a few deep breaths and relax, it's a strange world that you wish would extend beyond the film's two and a half-hour running time.With only one viewing, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint exactly what ""Mulholland Drive"" is all about. This aspect is sure to frustrate moviegoers who look for easy answers to the point of exhaustion. But for those who exercise patience and have an appreciation for auteurism, the payoff is worth its weight in dancing midgets.As with nearly all Lynch films, the protagonists do not necessarily remain the center of attention. The supporting cast of creeps and oddballs are just as important to the director. And the weirdoes and wackos are in no short supply in ""Mulholland Drive"". To the viewer's delight and confusion, they keep crawling out of the woodwork that frames Lynch's seedy vision.But as fascinating as the peripheral characters are, their vastly unexplained existence mars the film. It's as if Lynch was so enamored with his own character concepts that he chose to ignore that they don't propel the plot forward. The viewer is constantly in a state of wanting to know more about the characters, their seemingly inexorable duality, and their frequently iffy motivations. Despite this, though, ""Mulholland Drive"" is richly entertaining in its own disjointed way.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wow,"Wow, I just watched the movie for the first time last night, and it was thee best movie I have ever seen, and probably the best I will ever see. The movie is a modern impressionists view on dreaming and the subconscious. I will probably end up watching this movie over and over until I find out what each piece of the puzzle symbolizes. Somebody tell me If I'm wrong: Man Behind Winkies: Manipulates peoples dreams Cowboy:Helps peoples nightmares turn into dreams Diane: Makes peoples dreams turn into nightmares Red Lamp: is always in a scene when the phone rings Old People:Her Emotions, at the beginning she is happy and the old people when she met the old people, but at the end her emotions(the old people) are attacking her. Blue triangular key: The beginning of a relationship Blue Box: the end of the relationship.Before the second credits begin at the beginning of the movie it reveals that Betty is falling asleep, it shows her in a dance contest, she wins and starts becoming famous, and everything revolves around her, until she goes to club Silencio, where she finds out that everything that she has been experiencing is an illusion.

"Great most of the way, but...","I enjoyed this movie most of the way. It started off well and the story was very intriguing, with great acting especially from Naomi Watts. The oddball characters were funny and there certainly were some humorous lines and moments. The overall tone and feel of the film was very surreal, almost creepy to an extent, and that must be attributed to David Lynch. But what the heck happened in the last part of the movie? I think people give the movie far too much credit by trying to make sense of it all, because I don't feel there is any sense to be made. When the movie had nowhere else to go, it essentially just tried to confuse everyone and cheat them out of a logical, coherent conclusion. So basically, it was a very stylish film which I would have liked a lot but for the stupid final part of it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting,"This is an interesting movie. Without the first two hours, the last half hour makes no sense, and without the last half hour, the first two hours is rather bizarre. Seen as a film, putting the two parts together makes an interesting movie.But, the first two hours never drew me into the movie. I was never intrigued by the characters though it kept me interested enough to continue watching. Though in truth there are a few excellent scenes (such as in Silencio and the audition scene). Oddly enough, i remember thinking at one point the lead actress (Naomi Watts) was either a really BAD actress or a really GOOD one. Halfway through I figured she was quite bad... until I saw the rest of the movie in which it is obvious she is very good.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A paradox of perfection,"Drama, mystery, suspense, intrigue, eroticism, love, existential questions, brooding philosophy, worldly parallels, nightmarish visions.................... such is the world of Mulholland Drive. Simply put: This is David Lynch at his invariable finest.For some, the words: ""A David Lynch Film"" will be all the review you need. Fans of his previous work will instantly understand where I'm coming from. For those new to Lynch, his work is really something that you need to experience for yourself. No words can adequately describe what you will obtain from Mulholland Drive as no words can adequately describe the workings of your own inner psyche. Your interpretation of what unfolds will to a great extent be a reflection of yourself, what makes you tick, how your mind goes about interpreting and analysing information and emotion. Do not expect a literal storyline, do not expect anything clear-cut, do not expect anything to be handed to you on a plate, do not expect the film to be one of escapism, and do not expect to turn your brain off.To quote from Blue Velvet, ""It's a strange world"", and Lynch knows this only too well. Prepare for a perfectly executed, beautiful and arousing cinematic venture into the unknown.In a sense you can in fact look at Mullholland Dr. in a literal fashion, although I think this is cutting yourself short of what can actually be obtained from the film. One of the more literal interpretations I had of the movie is just the whole basic play with the 'dark underbelly of Hollywood' theme. After my second viewing of the film I always saw the first half of the film as a dream(non-reality) and the second half of the film as the actuality of the situation (reality). Take away all Lynch's moot cryptic clues and random scenes of unrelated (or are they?) madness, and what have you left? A woman who travels to Hollywood to follow her dreams of becoming an actress. In the first half we are shown her dream (or a manifestation of her dream): She is instantly loved and recognised by some of the Hollywood 'powers that be', scores a part as an actress almost simultaneously, falls passionately in love, lives in a beautiful house, etc, etc. And in the second half we are shown her reality: she scores small parts and even then, only as a favour of a friend who is dating a famous director, she remains unnoticed, yearns for love that is eternally unobtainable, lives in a small and crummy flat, and worst of all...... her dreams are nothing more than that, and will never ever eventuate.This is but one interpretation. There are many more. And each cryptic clue or Lynchian twist that you add (the blue key, the cowboy, the dark man, the ashtray........and so forth) changes or gives entirely new meaning altogether.Another way to look at it is as a jumble of metaphors. For example..... the dark man in Mulholland Dr. is nothing more than a visual representation of Hollywood (the actuality of Hollywood, not the glamorous one we are led to believe on television). The dark, seething underbelly of tinsel-town itself.For me, I look at David Lynch films in the same way I would look at my own dreams. I find this the best way to describe to people, or at least make them understand where he's coming from. You know how in a dream things are all a bit mixed up and yet to you, at the time, they make perfect sense? Friends of yours who have never met talk in dreams like they have known each other their whole lives, locations by no means near to each other are walking distance in comparison, something that happened to you five years ago and something that happened five days ago blur together seamlessly in your dream and yet....... TO YOU..... it all makes perfect sense. It is more a representation of ideas (like a dream) than a linear story. And what you make of it really comes down to your personal interpretation of what it made you feel............ which may or may not be what Lynch intended you to feel in the first place.Perhaps his most poignant work since Blue Velvet, Mullholland Drive is a cinematic masterpiece from a director at the height of his craft. A riddle within a riddle. A paradox of perfection.""Now you will see me one more time if you do good. You'll see me two more times if you do bad"".",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Could well be the most impressive film I have ever seen!,"I think that this is my number one most impressive film I have seen so far. This has it all, lesbianism, mystery, horror, comedy, action, emotion, romance, thrills, sex... you name it! Naomi Watts showed me the most powerful and emotional performance I have probably ever seen in a film. It provokes just about every emotion a human is capable of feeling all in one weird, confusing, yet intense and lovable ride.I came to love David Lynch through my love of the Silent Hill games (which are inspired by his works). I found that whilst his story telling can be too complex and abstract for people to handle, his use of imagery and direction is actually stronger than his storytelling abilities. With his previous weird film, ""Lost Highway"" I wasn't overly impressed with the story (or Bill Pullman's acting LOL) but what made me enjoy the film most is just how well he works the camera. His surreal, dreamlike imagery is so unique, intense and beautiful even during the most sinister and horrific of images. His films are works of art. Like abstract paintings that can be looked at so many different ways and give each viewer a unique interpretation.Although I could call most of his works true classics of cinema, personally I feel Mulholland Drive is where Lynch's skills all come together. Though the story could be his weirdest and most confusing yet, it is definitely one of his most incredible. The only bad part is when I had to explain to my friends what the hell was happening in this film after I showed it to them! If you are turned away by this film the first time round and just see it as pretentious, I hope you don't be too soon to dismiss it, as I have found that repeat watchings reveal more and more depth to the film. Topped off with a beautiful and diverse soundtrack, some insanely good acting by Naomi Watts (don't worry, it's supposed to be cheesy to begin with). Mulholland Drive could well be one of the best and most memorable films in history. You won't be able to forget most of the scenes, nor find anything (except perhaps another David Lynch work) to compare it with!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
very confusing,"Extremely complex! I have to rewatch this again to really appreciate the movie. Threw me off multiple times. 2 hours of scenes and dialogue turned out to be a dream. Later on there is a much more confusing 30 minute that goes by fast and you have to make up your mind to what just happened and connect everything together.A lot of loos ends in the beginning of the movie which made me think that everything will be connected later in the movie. However, more confusing shots were introduced. Also it's very long for my liking, especially considering I have to really concentrate and connect the dots in this movie and notice small signs Lynch is throwing.Later on after watching some reviews I understand the story more. Love the story but to be honest I didn't get it at first cause i was trying to connect the last half to the beginning. Now I understand that the beginning is her perfect life she lived in her dream. Later, the dark side of Hollywood and how she was used by her lover. Then decided to assassinate her lover and committed suicide due to the guilt she had.I think If i watch it again i'll appreciate many parts of the movie. Like the dream part where her mind is sending signs for her in the shape of people to warn her. A lot of that happened but considering that I didn't know it was a dream I didn't notice them.Great acting!!Good watch but very confusing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Eerie, provocative take on Bergman's ""Persona""...","Byzantine, brilliantly-acted drama parallels Hollywood glamor girl on the wrong path with freshly-scrubbed young actress who has just arrived in Los Angeles for a movie audition. Writer-director David Lynch shrewdly guides this jitterbug dance into a dreamy-nightmare world where fantasies and rude awakenings crisscross in coldly masterful style. It's a complex jigsaw of a movie--something along the lines of Bergman's ""Persona"" yet even more treacherous. You may not know where you're heading (or, indeed, where you've been) but you trust that Lynch does. Do concrete conclusions ever materialize? Some say yes, some say no, and some are still scratching their heads. There is no final summation, though that doesn't mean the picture is incomplete. It's a delicious film experience. David Lynch's world is a wicked one, and he's happy to invite us in. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece!!!!,"If you know a thing or two about David Lynch, you know what to expect from him. In this case, Lynch had created a beautiful and weird love story, full of plot twists. The non-linear structure he uses it's perfect for this film and lets you thinking over and over about the sense of time and ordering in your mind several scenes and dialogs. I was very impressed by this film. I can compare its effect on me, solely with the hard and long-lasting emotions of books like Faulkner's The Soung and the fury or Borges' Fictions. It's the kind of film you love, or hate, but anyway, you ought to see it. I almost forget it. Naomy Campbell's work is astounding, by far her best ever.

Icons and US myths,"What I love most about this movie is its allusive qualities. MD draws on mid-20th century US culture so brilliantly. The heroine's arrival in LA and her quest to help a ""dark lady"" whose path crosses hers come straight out of a Nancy Drew mystery. (Just as the boy & girl sleuths in Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" come straight out of a Hardy Boys mystery -- that is, until the plot lurches into the seedy, realistic side of US life.) Unless you grew up watching TV westerns during the Eisenhower adminstration, you will not get what Lynch is doing with his Cowboy character -- a Cowboy with a silly, oversized sombrero -- whose friendly warning to the heroine strikes terror into her heart. Also, two fairy tale characters who are icons in western folklore appear in opening scenes, and -- if you know your essential fairy tale plots -- will provide clues to the tragic crime story unfolding before us.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Mimicry being the sincerest form of flattery.My only criticism is that a lot of crap from the aborted TV series was left in. The dwarf gangster, who just disappears half way through, and the pointless scenes with Adam, which you can fast forward through and lose nothing. Plus the scenes with the tramp and the dreamer guy. How were they possibly related to Diane's POV ? They could only be seen by the omniscient director not her character.But still. This wreaks your head and is still there days later.

the story of famous people's interesting life in Hollywood,"I think film was very interesting and strange.The plot of Mulholland Dr is fluent and accurate.

This is a movie where you as a viewer are rewarded for replaying it over and over again.Your perspective regarding the details in the plot as well as what's actually happening in the movie, can change fom one watch to another.Don't try to understand it in terms of logical sense, just let it lead you through the surreal journey that is this movie.Since this movie is very much up to interpretation, you as a viewer will be rewarded for having an open mind and not read to many explanations regarding the plot, even after you finish watching it. Don't see it as a story arc that needs to be understood to enjoy (which is the case for many movies). Instead, let your imagination run wild and find your own interpretation.That goes for most of Lynch's work.For me, this movie in particular, as well as much of his other stuff, has a certain aesthetic and surreal atmosphere that can't be found anywhere else.Simply put, this is a must-see for people drawn to these types of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enlightenment!,"Mulholland Drive is a beautiful, masterful and hypnotic portrait of the human condition and contains Lynch's sharpest observations so far. David Lynch is a practitioner of transcendental meditation and clearly presents within this film a deep understanding of Eastern concepts regarding states of consciousness, desire, ego, greed, love and death.This is what it's about: It is about IDENTITY. We follow the adventure of a woman submerged in Western ignorance, pursuing a dream that is in fact a nightmare. She wants to be an actress. ""Mulholland Drive"" itself refers to the winding road on the outskirts of L.A., like the life of the protagonist, winding, unpredictable, with steep cliffs, what's around the corner? The tagline, ""A love story in the City of Dreams,"" presents the ultimate in human weakness; ego, desire, greed. For as long as she is pursuing ego, desire and greed, she is moving further away from her real identity. When she dies we see images of her parents, a reminder of her real identity.The cowboy, the fifties dancing at the beginning, the film director, the hit-man; these are all stereotypes of Hollywood Movies; artifice. At the theatre, we are reminded, ""It's a tape, it's a tape;"" artifice. Her perceived love; artifice, dazzled by surface charm and fake smiles. For as long as she pursues the life of an actress she is living artificially, she is not her own IDENTITY. The amnesia: she forgets who she is! The film ends where it begins, yet she can't figure out how to escape this CYCLE - get it..? The hit-man shoots the cleaner, the vacuum cleaner sets off the fire alarm... a chain of events a bit like karmic cause and effect, no?Surrounding her is the private nightmare she herself created, in the pursuit of desire and ego. Those miniature old people, so admiring before in the car, now so deranged and small, those old people are her ego. She is driven over the line. Where is happiness? In this City of Dreams? Or in reality? Mulholland drive is a modern day, very intelligent Dharma from David Lynch, a very wise man.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lynch's best film,"Mulholland Dr. Is quite a polarizing picture, but there is no doubt in my mind that is truly a classic for the ages.David Lynch has made some great films, but this one tops them all. Amazingly, it began as a TV-pilot (there is no suggestion of this in the finished product, it looks tailor-made for theatres). ABC, to cinema lovers' eternal gratitude, rejected Lynch's pilot, declaring it was too weird for mainstream network television. So Lynch was stuck with what he must have known was some of the best work he'd ever done, with no one to ever see it.According to Lynch, one night sitting alone in his Minnesota home, the solution just hit him and he knew what to do. A French company had offered financing to finish Mullholland Dr. As a feature, so Lynch didn't have to worry about that, and I suppose his one-of-a-kind movie-loving brain just said to him ""Hey, Dave, this is what you should do.""This anecdote (from Lynch himself) is mind-boggling, after you see the final version of Mulholland Dr., which ballooned from around 89 mins. To a swift two and a half hours. The theatrical release is seamless and upon reflection, it's hard to believe Lynch didn't write all of this from the get-go.The movie does not grab you right away until a second viewing (which, you should know going in, is an absolute must). The first time I saw it in the theatre, and I am a big Lynch fan, it seemed meandering, unfocused, and kind of masturbatory. I was peeved at Lynch at how he botched the final episodes of his Twin Peaks television series (one of the best TV shows ever, at least in its first season), so I thought, ""Here Dave is jerking me around again."" It was obvious to me why ABC ran from the screening room when they first saw the first two-thirds of what Lynch presented to them. I imagine there was screaming.But then: there is THAT scene. Naomi Watt's audition scene with (of all people) Chad Everett, perfectly cast as a smarmy actor. At this point, I thought, Oh, I think I see what this is.And I was not disappointed, for after that scene, there is one gorgeously weird moment after the other and it all begins to gel. It may not gel immediately for some viewers, but I urge patience. And when you see it the second time (and I could not wait to do that, so I went back the next day), you will likely be blown away at what Lynch pulls off here. Audacious doesn't begin to describe Mulholland Dr.It is apparent midway through that the then unknown Naomi Watts (in a ""dual"" role, or should it be ""duel"") was going to go places fast. Other cast members are equally well-served: The ravishing, made-for-the-movies Laura Elena Harring (who deserved better after this release), a sardonic yet appealing Justin Theroux, and a bunch of typically well-cast Lynchian supporting players (particularly screen legend Ann Miller and veteran Lee Grant who gets a tiny bit that gives a LOT of hints).Mulholland Dr. Is a hybrid of mystery, horror, and thriller. I love every second of it. I've seen it several times, and each time, there's something new to discover.Predictably, Oscar shunned this masterpiece, but they did have the balls to give Lynch a Best Director nomination. But nothing for his screenplay, Watts or any of the other cast, brilliant cinematography and editing, outstanding sound design, and most glaringly, Angelo Badalamenti's brooding, sinister yet lovely music score, which complements this material as perfectly as anything Bernard Herrmann wrote for Alfred HItchcock.Mulholland Dr. Is a polarizing movie, but I strongly recommend it. At the very least, you won't shake it off easily. Even if you haven't figured out what exactly is going on, the imagery of the last fifteen minutes is pretty unforgettable.Give it a shot.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The visual style of the movie progresses from his earlier work, continuing to find new and thought-provoking viewpoints of his subjects. So far, so good. The problem for me in this movie was that it seemed to lose its way half-way through. Too many undeveloped threads (female lead for director's movie), too many broken threads (still haven't sussed the link between Betty and Diane) and maybe he didn't quite succeed in tying all the diverse threads together into one entity (a movie).

What he wanted it to do was confuse people who enjoy being confused, make people think who enjoy thinking, and tick people off who don't like either of the previous two. I am completely capable of being wrong and could easily be wrong now but this is what I think on the subject. I love the film and enjoy just as much hearing about people hating it as I do them loving it. Great films should make people argue points.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a long strange trip its been,"WOW! This movie was awesomely David Lynch. Even the soundtrack bore eerie resemblance to Twin Peaks. I found it had all the necessary elements to a great film. There was violence, creepy characters, sex, nudity, humor and most of the times it was scary and thrilling. But, in the end. I didn't get it. I spent three hours watching what seemed like there would be an awesome ending and everything I gathered the previous 3 hours would all come to a deciding close. I didn't. I'm confused and left bewildered. Now I either have to see it another 20 times to understand, or I have to have someone explain it all to me.

mulhollan drive,"It's a great film. I don't have it fully figured out, and perhaps it can't be, but if you take into account that a large portion of the movie is a dream, it makes it a little easier to understand. Exactly where the dream begins and ends is not so easy to understand. The first half or so is her dream. I think this accounts for some of those bizarre scenes. She has had her lover killed; now she dreams of how she wishes it to be. A mixture of fear, regret, among whatever other emotions you may experience is such a situation is twisting the dream about. The movie is loaded with symbolism, and if you are into dream interpretation you can go a long way with it as well. The scene with the singing woman is great. She sings ""Crying"" in Spanish. She is a representation of her love for her lover. She cries because she loves her, but she is now gone. The singer collapses, apparently dead, but the singing goes on; her lover is dead, but her love for her still lives on. Great film because you can watch it so many times and pick up new things. What I've said here is, of course, just my interpretation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
NOT TOP 250,"Here it goes... this movie does not belong on the top 250 movies of all time. Yes, i did only watch it once and I'm sure everyone says it makes more sense the second time around, but I'm not a masochist. i feel that this movie had decent acting and some good camera work and music. going by this alone, it deserves maybe a 4.I have seen some movies with complicated/ disoriented story lines that leave me guessing, and i enjoy them very much, but this incoherent movie is ridiculous. with the little research i've done it seems that the movie is about a dream (very original), but no one knows what the last 45 min mean and the director intended it this way. I think that people gave this movie a good rating for the sole reason that they say to themselves, ""I don't understand it so it must be good, and if i give it a bad rating, i'll seem stupid."" well I for one am secure with my intelligence and a movie that has random useless scenes with no meaning whatsoever does not have the right to be considered one of the best movies of all time. I see that in the demographics, males under 18 gave it very good ratings, not because of the lesbian scenes of course, but because the symbolism was so intriguing, right?If you truly enjoyed this movie, then thats fantastic, I am not not trying to insult those who liked it for whatever reason, I'm just trying to make a point of how it should not be considered one of the best movies of ALL TIME.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Films Just Don't Get Much Better,"While not strictly a horror film, ""Mulholland Drive"" scared me more than most bona fide horror films I've seen. I remember going out to the alley to throw away some trash after watching this movie and looking over my shoulder the whole time.""Mulholland Drive,"" while enigmatic, is one of the more accessible of David Lynch's puzzle pictures. Naomi Watts blows the lid off the joint in a tour de force performance as a young woman who goes to Hollywood to become an actress and is swallowed by the rotten jungle that is the city of dreams as it exists in Lynch's brilliant head.I used to dismiss Lynch as too clinical and cerebral a director. His movies always made me feel bad without understanding why. But after seeing more of his work, I'm struck by the strong, almost aching, emotional quality that pulses through much of it, underneath the visual and narrative sleight-of-hand. ""Mulholland Drive"" is scary as hell, but it's also deeply sad and moving.This was the best film of 2001.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The general plot is very simple and consists of several seemingly unconnected events that connect in a stupid and unnatural way in the end with a device that I personally think is ridiculous, that is not making the viewer understand anything. Otherwise the film is a good film that still requires a lot of attention to be effectively understood and is not meant to be watched lightly.

Dreamboat,"Star ratings are irrelevant at the best of times, never more so than with a film that can only really be enjoyed by subscribing to its writer-director's modus operandi. After that it's a process of unravelling. On a surface level Mulholland Drive, looking like a Sunset Strip murder melodrama, seems shallow and schlocky. Which is, of course, half the point.A film set in an ostentatious city of extremes, the action shifts from mystery, through horror and farce, to tragedy with unshowy elegance. Lynch's techniques might be bamboozling, but this can be seen as a simple, sad tale of a starstruck loner, Diane (Naomi Watts), spurned by love, and now in love with an impossible dream. What emerges from Lynch's seductive, oneiric aesthetic is a powerful, angry attack on the poisonous hierarchy of celebrity. This is about the obliteration of the individual; the destruction of one woman's sense of self.Diane, as her imagined alter-ego Betty, conjures a dreamworld in which she arrives, starry-eyed, in the City of Angels, and finds a fallen angel: ""Rita"" (Laura Harring), a beauty in the classic Hayworth mould, who has lost her memory after a car accident. In her fantasy, Diane/Betty not only lives a life of intrigue and wealth, but also retains her integrity - both in terms of her acting ability and in the grace she shows toward her secret roommate. In her fantasy, Betty is as strong as the jealousy that sucks the life from Diane. Those she hates - specifically, Rita's director and lover, Adam (Justin Theroux) - are condemned to squalor and emasculation. Betty satisfies Rita sexually. Betty makes Rita whole, and Betty is loved for it.There's dread in droves. A blind woman comes to the door, but she cannot wake Betty. There is a ""monster"" lurking behind Winkie's Diner, which could be the embodiment of Betty's fear. Fairy tale motifs abound: keys to open curiosities, and dangerous red in abundance. But poor Betty is blinded by the stars.Lynch dallies once more with the Moebius strip narrative. Is this what hell looks like - to relive our life on the fragments of memory, shattered like a skull by a self-inflicted bullet? Or is Lynch simply shuffling the narrative pack, portraying these dreadful events as an abstract artist envisions the horror of death, in a way that movies will never quite manage? As the camera explores the catacombs behind the façade of the boulevard like a prowling creature, Lynch's sense of space and light has never been better. We are guests in the grey area between waking and sleep, only to find it's been painted all gaudy. Scenes - such as when Adam is summoned to a ranch to take counsel with a sage cowboy - are seemingly conjured by Betty in the way one recalls a conversation in a dream: rationalised, making purposeful the philosophical, retrospectively plotting a narrative, writing our own film. Perhaps that's the delight of Mulholland Drive: in filling the gaps, we are allowed to make the film our own.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What's in that box?,"Read Brandt Sponseller's excellent review elsewhere here for some insight into this flawed TV movie. Yes, MULHOLLAND DRIVE was indeed a TV movie that was later expanded for a brief theatrical run. It is surreal to say the least, and as far as I can tell, it is Canadian director David Lynch's acerbic take on Hollywood and the creatures that inhabit it. Naomi Watts stars as a Hollywood-bound miss who goes to stay at an aunt's apartment, only to find a mysterious woman holed up there. The woman has amnesia, and the two try to figure out who's who and what's what. They also have a very nicely done love scene, which is one of the few reasons for seeing this sometimes nutty and disjointed flick. The other big reason for catching it is for the ""Silencio"" sequence,which takes place in a theater at a bizarre hour and where nothing is what it seems. The story, such as it is, is part murder mystery as well as a knock at the vapid Hollywood lifestyle. It is not told in linear fashion, and there's an awful lot of symbolism to mess with your mind. I'd say stick with BLUE VELVET, Lynch's superb reworking of a classic noir plot.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Lynchian magic at its best,"One of David Lynch's most misunderstood films (they're all probably misunderstood). The film is structured as a mystery set in Hollywood, although, in typical Lynchian fashion, this version of Tineseltown is decidedly dark and skewed. The plot weaves together several strands: a young, fresh-looking Canadian girl who has come to La-la land in search of stardom; an established actress who avoids being murdered by an act of dumb luck and loses her memory as a result; and a director who is being forced by ominous powers to cast a particular woman in his movie. It's all intriguing stuff. The film is drenched in atmosphere. That shouldn't be a surprise. Credit the cinematography of Peter Deming and the score by Angelo Badalamenti. Mulholland Drive is filled with its share of ""Twin Peaks""-ish moments. If you like David Lynch films chances are you'll enjoy this film although it will take a seating too many.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"When your mind says, ""What the F..."" It's one of those movies","Mulholland Drive (2001) :
Brief Review -When your mind says, ""What the F..."" It's one of those movies. There are some movies that are complicated to understand, but as a hardcore movie fan, you like such challenging movies. You want to understand that part, oh no, that part, and so on... But yes, there are some movies that are actually not so difficult but only make you feel difficult with the structure. After 'the end' appears, you are like, ""What the F just happened?"" It takes you a minute or two, and then you realise what actually happened. Then you feel like you are ready to tell others about it. Can you relate to what I just said? Yes? Oh, I take it as a YES. Now, you are ready to watch Mulholland Drive. Because it's that kind of movie. David Lynch has a simple story, but he narrates it in no simple way. The structure is what makes it complicated and, therefore, worth watching. ""Silencooo.."" and the film ends.. you are like, ""Okay. What the F.. "" after a minute or two, you come to your smart movie critic senses and realise that it was actually nothing. It's just that instant effect, that instant impact, that leaves you stunned. The idea of conflict between a dream and a reality is not new to any movie buff, but it is always the narrative that has to be unique. Lynch does it without the help of an extraordinary story. Kudos to him. Yes, he could have trimmed it by 15-20 minutes and made it more gripping. The eroticism may not go well with a certain section of the audience, so here's the warning for you. I can't really believe that the man who has made an emotional and heartbreaking classic like ""The Elephant Man"" (1980) can also make a film like ""Blue Velvet"" (1986) and then go wild and uncompromised like hell with ""Mulholland Drive.""

I really didn't care about the plot twists and symbolism since the film was so emotionally resilliant that I really felt for the girl and what she went through during at that party, whether it be because of sexual molestation, jealousy, a setup or whatever. David Lynch makes everything seem heartbreaking, and that's just not an easy thing to do. Though this is not a film for mainstream viewers (DAMN that Oscar nomination-the source of all of these undeserving bad reviews) David Lynch has reassured my faith in modern day filmmaking and I will watch whatever he creates next, even if it is another failed television show pilot.

David Lynch Likes to Play With Your Mind,"The psychological thriller Mulholland Dr. is directed by David Lynch and stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. The film takes place in modern day Hollywood.A young woman Rita (Harring) is in a limousine that gets crashed into by a bunch of crazy kids driving and loses her memory. She wanders around the streets of Hollywood until she enters an apartment complex while the residents of the apartment she goes into are leaving. Then the apartment owners niece, Bette (Watts), stays at the apartment hoping to become a movie star. When Bette finds Rita she tries to help her discover who she really is and go around Los Angeles looking for clues. Adam Kesher (Theroux) is a film director and is being forced by some unknown threatening people to cast an actress into the lead role of his new film. Adam is very angry by this and goes home early to discover that his wife is cheating on him with Billy Ray Cyrus. Adam has much bigger problems than that though because he is being followed by some very bad people...The writing by David Lynch for this film is masterful. This film is completely unique and no other writer can write like Lynch. Everything about this crazy, twisted film is pure genius, what I love about it most is the first time that I saw it I was thinking the whole time this movie seems really bad but I can't stop watching because I secretly love it. The complexity of the plot is so complex that no one has even found out how complex it is yet. Just a brilliant script and if you see this film you are either going to love it or hate it. And if you watch it and you like it then it just hasn't sunk in yet that you actually love it.David Lynch's direction is as insane as his writing, and that is obviously a good thing. The shots are absolutely stunning, and this is one of the few films I find addicting. After I watched this film the first time I said to myself I must watch something else of David Lynch's direction. He really knows how to get great performances from his actors, and a lot of people say they are acting poorly but they are supposed to be and they are doing it extremely well.As I said in the last paragraph the acting was really good, but easily the weakest part of the film. Naomi Watts made me love her after seeing this movie because she is just so good the whole way through, I would elaborate more on it but that would kind of give spoilers. Laura Harring was alright, nothing too special though but she wasn't really supposed to be. There was nothing wrong with her performance though but she could have added a little more depth to it. The same really goes for Justin Theroux as well, he did fine but he could have added more. The supporting cast all did great, giving exactly as they were supposed to and supplying a lot of mystery with their performances.Overall I give this film a solid 9/10. It is a must see for anyone who wants to get their mind bended, much more than this summer's Inception. After you see this film I suggest you see Lynch's Inland Empire which will completely destroy your mind, I still have no clue what that film is even about.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Eraserhead redux,"From the beginning of the movie, I kept thinking this reminded me of those movies college friends with movie producing aspirations would bring friends over to watch at their apartments or which got screened in Cinema 101. This, by the way, is commenting on the QUALITY of the movie -- before I knew it would also take a globally nutball Eraserhead spin. Then, as one another poster noted, it borrowed heavily from other films, or, to me, from Eraserhead. As if David Lynch was saying, ""I'm now going to make Eraserhead in color, not black and white, and put real stars in it."" Especially the scene in the theater -- no bando or whatever -- same exact feel as the girl tap dancing in Eraserhead. Alright, we all know boxes are ""spooky"" and, ever since, was it Hellraiser, we know they are a device for supernatural ""wierd"" things. This hardly added much to this otherwise college effort movie. Yes, Watts was good. Liked the wierdo cowboy too. Liked the heavy woman fighting the hitman with such force.

Watch it twice or give up,"David Lynch says he doesn't want to manipulate his audience. I can't quite believe this. While I was watching the film and trying to understand, there was more than one moment where I could imagine Lynch sitting somewhere, watching us and laughing sadistically.But I don't grudge him that pleasure. Lynch has done a great job in thrilling his audience, which is actually not so easy any more. There are unforgettable scenes in `Mulholland Dr.', some of them even funny.But, although this film is almost beyond any possible criticism there is a bit left to criticise about it. If I hadn't known that it is a TV series pilot that was later re-cut as a movie for cinema, I could have guessed. Although I am far from `understanding' the deep meaning of the movie (to manage that, I would have to watch it a second time), I feel that there are somewhat too many unnecessary features, too much short scenes filmed just anyhow. And it's a pity that TV stations refused to produce Lynchs mystery series because as such it would have been absolutely brilliant and I would have watched every single episode. In cinema, `Mulholland Dr.' is also a great experience. But there is that one drop of bitterness that it actually doesn't belong there.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Cultivation of the Lost Highway,"Whenever people talk about this movie like some kind of indistinguishable puzzle that you have no reason to solve because David Lynch decided to be cryptic for the sake of it and you just need to ""feel it,"" I always question if they just turned the movie off at the 2-hour mark. The movie gives up all pretence and starts painstakingly showcasing where all her delusions came from. I doubt you can figure out 100% of the details of the name swaps, projections, etc. But you if sincerely cannot figure out the basic foundation of the plot. You are either overthinking it or watching it with one eye on the ceiling or the phone.The ludicrous plot about coping with self-delusion aside, the presentation is just marvellous. It perfectly conveys the initial soft innocence Betty exudes in her perfect fantasy, which later descends into a dreadful, sporadic nightmare as the reality of what she has done starts knocking louder and louder. Badalamenti's soundtrack is fantastic and captivating, and it highlights this transition very well.It is hard to overstate how hard it grips you from the opening scene onward. The pure definition of unsettling. I do think it warrants more than one watch to at least pick apart some of the more obscure details, such as what amounts to a C plot line about the misadventures of the director. Who's pathetic life then gets a completely different meaning when you realize that it's just a projection from Diane.

"Frustrating indecisive story, well directed","I won't pay to see any more of Mr. Lynch's movies.  The screenplay was full of stupid, expositional dialog (i.e.  ""I'm so exited to be here in L.A. after my long flight from Canada, so that I can be an actress"").  That's not real conversation, that's characters explaining what we should be able to understand from WATCHING. The plot started lots of scenes, some interesting character, never to make use of them later.  The now-famous sex scene was, frankly, not so good.  And it's shamefully the only thing holding viewer interest until the movie decides to try make some sense of all the unnecessary and unbelievable mystery, which it only does in a very vague, indecisive way, with some laughable symbolism to appeal to movie buffs.That said, Lynch get great performances from his actors, really excellent, and puts together great visuals.

An intricate labyrinth build by David Lynch,"In ""Mulholland drive"" the relationship between a blonde and a brunette stays central. Actually there are two relationships, because the brunette (played by Laura Harring) lost her memory on account of a car accident.The first half of the film plays after the car accident, when the brunette calls herself Rita and has a relationship with Betty. In the second half of the film her memories slowly come back and the brunette reminds her relationship with Diane. Both Betty and Diane are played by Naomi Watts.The story is rather complicated and I shall not go into the numerous theories that try to explain the plot. For me the central theme is the competition between the women in the ruthless movie industry of Hollywood.In the first half of the film the blonde (Betty) is more succesful than the brunette (Rita). In the second half of the film it is the other way round and the brunette (her real name is Camilla) takes precedence over the blonde (Diane).In ""All about Eve"" (1950, Joseph Mankiewicz) the competition between actresses was decided by age. In ""Mulholland drive"" it is even more banal, it is decided by type. Sometimes blondes are in vogue and sometimes brunettes. Actresses as a kind of fashion article.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The cinematic equivalent of Finnegans Wake,"Mulholland Drive is the cinematic equivalent of Finnegans Wake, not just because Lynch created a film that transcends most typical cinematic conventions, but because he seems to have created an entirely new genre all to itself. Mulholland Drive is a puzzle within a puzzle, it has no plot, no beginning, no end, no overall theme, no structure. And yet it has enough structure for any person to have a rough idea of what's going on, granted if one looked closer. It's as if, and you know this can be taken literally, Lynch took his entire television series, cut random reels, put them in a box, and randomly edited one reel with the next. A lot of people have a problem with Mulholland Drive for the very fact that it was intended for T.V. According to their logic, how can you praise a film that came from a television series, when it never premiered on...well...television. I say, why not? The Hollywood of Mulholland Drive seems to have more in common with their criticisms then they would care to admit. In Lynch's movie, the film industry turns out careless bubble gum entertainment, while the industry itself is controlled by a closed society where all of the artistic decisions are pre-arranged, and sometimes by coercive means. If only more artists could learn from Lynch's example. No wonder Mulholland drive never made it to television, it's too good for a medium where every other show involves a court case, a ""reality theme"", or family foibles. I say why a court drama? Why not a film about the context of their dreams? In essence, Lynch hasn't created a film about film, Mulholland Drive...is film itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What the...?,"While this visually impressive film is nowhere near as...odd as some of Lynch's early work (i.e. Eraserhead) it did leave me scratching my head and wondering what just happened.  Twenty-four hours later, I'm still wondering what happened and recommending it to friends so that they can tell me what happened.  I won't go into the plot, not out of fear of spoiling the movie, but because it seemed to not matter to the movie itself.  The closest equivalent I could make would be to describe this movie as the film making equivalent of stream of consciousness storytelling.  It's confusing and jarring if you aren't expecting it, but it will leave you wondering and thinking.  I'd recommend this movie for anybody who likes the obscure and odd.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Typical enigmatic puzzle from Lynch.,"You could probably have a direct link into David Lynch's brain and still not figure out some of his films. That's really part of the fun and appeal--the gestation period that follows when viewers want to explore the options and meanings of what they've just seen. It works for me. I'm a big fan.One thing that stood out to me is the strong anti-Hollywood subtext. Take for instance when Betty (Naomi Watts) first arrives in L.A. as a fresh-faced, bright young thing. She's full of naivity and hope even when the troubled amnesiac ""Rita"" (Laura Harring) shows up at her pad with a scar on her head and a dark secret. The women set out to explore the mystery, develop a trusting bond and become lovers. It may all be a dream. This all changes when the women flip-flop characters and then we get a look at what life in shallow Hollywood can do to a person. Harring's ""Rita"" becomes Camilla, a devious bisexual actress who's taunts her lover Diane (Watts again) by flaunting her infidelities in front of her.The studio setting is painted as creepy and mysterious, yet oddly alluring. The film is full of biting commentary on the Hollywood system which I felt to be the core issue, but what do I know? Only Lynch can know for sure. The strong use of light blue and red all over the place instantly allude to good and evil simultaneously at work within the city. A scary witch-like vagrant pops up from time to time and may be the devil or may just be those cruel, life-crushing, superficial forces at work inside the Hollywood system that have claimed many victims over the years. There's a lot going on in the film, which is great. Movies that make you really think are rare nowadays.I'd also like to say that Naomi Watts is stunning in the dual role that requires her to run the gamut of emotions. Try not to melt during her breathy audition scene and try not to feel the sting of jealousy when she's betrayed by her lover. Wow! Laura Harring and Justin Theroux are also great and I was thrilled to see James Karen in a scene. The music by Angelo Badalamenti is haunting and gorgeous, as is the Del Rio song in Silencio. The photography and editing are also excellent.Don't miss it if you like Lynch or are sick of the brainless crap that dominates Hollywood cinema.Score: 9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Mulholland Dr.,"This film is one of the most striking, interesting and complex films which I have ever seen in my life. Firstly, at the beginning of the film, I have some difficulties in understanding it totally and combining parts of it. Especially, one of the most appealing things about this film is that the events are all dreams. Actually, the film helps the watchers to know about marvellous Hollywood life. And I realised that the stars of Hollywood world are criticized ironically.For example, Diana pretens herself as if she was Cemillia.So,she hopes that Cemillia will be unsuccessful in every subject.The most important thing is dying of Cemillia.However, unfortunately,she can't realise it would be the end of herself.When she starts to see some bad hallucinations about Cemillia, she understands that she can't fed up with this situation and she has to commit suicide.

I have a collection of favorite moments from this masterpiece, but the one that sticks, that plays in my head over and over again, is the heartbreaking Club Silencio scene.

A life-changing story that will immortalize Lynch's name like no other,"Warning - Contains SpoilersMulholland drive is a story that had to be told and is one that most of us will identify with if we have ever experienced 'unrequited love' of any description. Although the movie is about much more than that. The basic storyline is simple enough - a plucky ingénue (Naomi Watts)makes her way to Hollywood to be a glamorous actress, with all the innocence and optimism of youth. Naomi's acting is no less than Oscar worthy in every sense and her over-exaggerated naive optimism at the beginning starkly and beguilingly contrasts with later scenes which uncover the reality of what her life becomes.This movie is surreal but perfectly constructed and developed with a true sense of meaning with no hint of ambiguity in what the director is wanting to achieve. Basically Naomi's character Betty is having a convoluted and symbolic dream (as dreams are)of what she would like her life to be, compared to her reality of unrequited love and her subsequent immoral and desperate actions which follow. The director does a brilliant job of displaying the inherent vulnerabilities in us all, inspiring feeling pity and care for a murderer, and showing the hopelessness of the human condition at it's lowest point. The human psyche is explored in a depth rarely attempted by even the most competent of directors ; Anyone who has ever felt the 'human condition' and all of the implications that follow will surely marvel at the greatness of this Oscar worthy and inspired film. One of the most moving and emotionally complex movies ever made - has to be seen to be believed.10 out of 10 ; and then some",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What is he driving us at?,"I thought of myself as a great Lynch fan, I've seen many of his movies and even in the worst scenarios I said I loved his movies. I'm not sure anymore, and I don't think I know exactly why.When Mulholland Dr. ended I just felt a void, which I suppose was induced by the movie. By previous reviews I thought I would find myself trying to solve a provocative puzzle, but it wasn't like that, it made me take a book and recover the lost time. I know there is a lot of symbolism, several layers to unlock, but I found no reason to do that, it was like trying to uncover a fake ridiculous circus, boring.I don´t know how Lynch develops his ideas, but I no longer care. It didn't only ruin the newest film, but make me reconsider the rest. The only two surviving film are now A Straight Story and Elephant Man. The rest can be buried in the 90s as a testimony of what's complex and symbolically absurd. For when I look back at surrealism, only the concept survives.",,Anonymous,Mystery
This... is all an illusion....,"Going into a David Lynch project you know you are in for a bit of an assault on your senses and sanity, and to that end Mulholland Drive certainly does not disappoint. Following a woman suffering from amnesia after a car wreck, she meets Betty - an aspiring and impossibly optimistic actress. Together they go on a journey to discover who the woman is, why she has thousands of dollars and a strange blue key in her purse.I want to like this film, I really do. It's well shot, the performances are great and the whole concept of the film is intriguing. The film has a non-linear narrative and constantly challenges the audience to ask questions of it's frankly bizarre scenes. Is this real? Is it a dream? Is it a fantasy? Why are diffferent characters being played by the same people? Why do some characters have different personalities in different parts of the film? Who is the face behind the diner? Whats in the blue box? The films expects the audience to ask many questions... but doesn't really feel like answering any of them. It's almost like it's obtuse and disjointed on purpose so than no possible fan theory can 100% work. There are still websites out there now discussing the film and trying to understand its convoluted plot, and this whole 'teasing' aura the film has I find somewhat annoying. Its a good film, and perfect for a film school to tear apart and analyse, but for a cusual watcher far too much effort is required on behalf of the viewer to recommend to everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I'm fairly new to Lynch, and i was incredibly pleased with this effort","When i heard about this film i wasn't sure i would enjoy. I thought it would be pretentious and weird, and although it may be both of these things it still had me hooked.Lynch is clearly a very talented director. Mulholland Dr. is an incredibly atmospheric, tense film and at times extremely moving. I've heard the film being describes as esoteric, which is true to a certain extent, but it was only the second Lynch film i saw (the first being Dune) and i adored it.The ambiguity of the film may be a bit too much for some viewers, but i certainly enjoyed trying to figure it all out (and only getting parts of it).To me the inconsistencies thoughout the film reflect the mixed up views people have about life in Hollywood. This theme also seems to be shown in betty's attitude when she first arrives in L.A.Mulholland Dr. is certainly an experience. Lynch excells in creating a moody, atmospheric movie that seems to stay with you for a long time after the initial viewing.

"Inventive, enjoyable and challenging","Mulholland Drive is an American film made in 2001 by director David Lynch. It uses deception, dream sequences and time jumps to deliver a difficult to decipher (but not impossible) story of the ugly side of Hollywood life.Your enjoyment of this film might just depend on whether you enjoy movies that have an obvious linear narrative or that are a challenge to follow; Mulholland Drive certainly falls into the latter category.The bulk of the film follows two characters - 'Rita', an established actress suffering from memory loss after surviving a car accident, and 'Betty', a young would-be actress who arrives in LA in the hope of becoming a Hollywood star. The two meet in a borrowed apartment and form a close friendship as they try to piece together Rita's missing life.All is not what it seems however, and the final half an hour of the film will at the very least make you question everything you thought you knew about the pair and the story you have been following.I enjoyed Mulholland Drive, especially the slightly dreamlike camera work as, at times, it almost seemed to float through various scenes. The many exaggerated characters introduced throughout the film were quirky and interesting, and I could never predict where the film was leading.On first viewing the film left me with many more questions than answers, so I researched others' interpretation of the film for a clearer understanding before watching again (when it of course made more sense).If you don't mind spoilers, you could do the same ahead of watching to make the film more accessible. Alternatively just take the plunge, watch without prior knowledge as the director intended and enjoy the journey.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lost Velvet Peaks Boulevard,"While watching Mulholland Dr., I had my own Lynch-ian moment of inner horror: a sinister and disturbing sensation that I had never really left the theatre back in 1986 after seeing `Blue Velvet,' but that the kindly woman at the concession stand who looked like an older, grossly made-up Florence Henderson had drugged my popcorn, so that I passed out during the credits and was taken down into a dark basement room below the cinema, which was run by a mysterious dwarf in a glass-encased room with wall-to-wall red velvet carpeting.  There was a slow-speaking (so I knew he was serious), folksy character who mysteriously called himself The Director, and he asked me if I could distinguish between reality and cinema, and then he proceeded to show me the same film over and over again for 18 years.  The phone rang.  The voice on the other end of the line, a Mafioso who spoke through an electronic device in his throat, asked me how I liked my pancakes. `Everyone likes pancakes.  How do you like your pancakes?'  A clown was singing Roy Orbison's  `Only the Lonely' very, very slowly (so I knew he was very, very sad) in French.  The now whorish-looking Florence Henderson came into the room and spoke to me in French as well, offering me a silver platter with strange-looking meat on it.  A pale young blonde girl, about six years old, who was obviously dead, and who wore a first communion dress and whose head was covered in Saran Wrap, whispered to me: `Don't eat it. It's Billy Wilder's heart.'  An old, grey-haired man suddenly coughed out, `I have to fix my lawnmower.  They won't let me fix my lawn-mower.'  He then handed me a magic 8-ball and said, ""You have to help her.'  I shook the black plastic globe of secrets and the message read: `Strawberry pancakes.' I shook it again and it read: `Cinema is the new reality.'  Then I suddenly woke up  or had I been awake all that time and now was falling asleep?  and Mulholland Dr. was coming to an end.Or as the Cowboy Angel said, `Oh no, no, I've seen this movie before.'I used to be a David Lynch fan, but somewhere along the way, what used to seem cool and mysterious began to seem silly and pretentious.  Take the scene at the Silencio club... please.  (Or at least shorten it.)Lynch is obviously a master in many areas of filmmaking.  He's especially adept at creating moments of psychological terror  the opening sequence of Lost Highway being one of the most frightening things I've ever seen (forget the rest of the picture.)  But I've had the feeling over the last few movies that he's too easy on himself and too pleased with his talent.  I suppose one could say that Mulholland Dr. was the culmination of his vision over the last 20 years, putting everything together in one film, but it seems to me more of a rehashing of the same old thing, a kind of greatest hits of Lynch's mysterious, pseudo-intellectual film moments, great for those obsessive fans who try to solve his cinematic crossword puzzles, as if maybe THIS time there really would be something down there in the murky unknown.In and of itself, Mulholland Dr. is a decent film.  The acting by Watts is top-notch, and Laura Harring is pleasing to watch.  The camera work is good throughout, especially lurking around those corners.  If you can get through the silliness of some of the scenes, this is an interesting look at Hollywood, playing off of Sunset Blvd. but updating it for the new century. If you're new to Lynch's work, stick with `Blue Velvet,' when he was able to exert a little more control over his tiring self-indulgence.Better still, taking a slow drive down Sunset Blvd. with William Holden, Gloria Swanson, and Billy Wilder.  A similar theme but much better filmmaking.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There's only one David Lynch!,"For 25 years David Lynch has been carving out a niche for himself as a true surrealist. His films are unique in their vision, aesthetic and atmosphere. His latest, Mulholland Drive, is right out of the top draw. To give anything away would be a crime other than to say that this started as a TV pilot so we get a bit of explanation of the main characters, or do we? Along the way we are treated to a dwarf mastermind, the mob, lots of phones ringing, a mysterious box, a diner which acts as a vortex to some other reality, a cool movie director, a mysterious corpse, a man having bad dreams, a monster in an alleyway, a grungy hit-man, a fat woman getting shot in the ass, keys, Billy Ray Cyrus, an impossibly happy old couple, unrequited love, jealousy, sex, a mysterious nightclub, Roy Orbison in Spanish, an oracle like cowboy Hollywood archetypes. They're all here and all connected but Lynch doesn't tell us how or why, That's for us to work out. God bless him! This film is definitely a cryptic jigsaw puzzle which will give you a headache trying to figure it out.

"Signature Lynch, but what if instead the two leads were MALE?","First and foremost: Mulholland Drive is indeed a beautiful film, despite what may seem like me bitching somewhat within the next several paragraphs. Just read on...I'm glad I saw Mulholland Drive and yes, I enjoyed it. To an extent. David Lynch is a master of the surreal, and it seems to me that by bowing to the current ""hot lesbian fantasy"" trend, he messed up. If Lynch wanted to be more bold and make the bizarre story of Mulholland Drive more mysterious and intriguing, he could have tried putting two males as the lead characters. Ah, you say that's box office poison, well I say Mulholland Drive wasn't expected to be a blockbuster to begin with (the same goes for his other films). Lynch needs to keep on his toes to be more original with each film, and by doing what so many OTHER films are doing and trying to make ANOTHER film with lipstick lesbians is getting tired very fast.It's funny that some people are gushing about how beautiful the two love scenes are in the film. I think these are people like Roger Ebert, who automatically gives a thumbs up to any film with a lesbian element. I actually laughed throughout one of the two scenes, as Laura Elena Harring's gravity-defying breasts were just too much of a distraction. Looked like any soft core scene you can catch late night on Cinemax. In that second scene where she lay there saying ""You drive me wild,"" while her breasts are pointing straight up... it's impossible to keep a straight face after that. It would just have made more sense to have these characters as men, as it is SET in Hollywood and the gay male sensibility would be more appropriate. Apparently though it's only those that seek comfort in Howard Stern and The Man Show that would have been uncomfortable watching those two ""love"" scenes the way I feel they should have been.Still, Mulholland Drive is one of those fun Lynch puzzle pieces that keeps you thinking and forces you to go back and view a few more times to figure things out. Which is why too that his philosophy that DVDs should not have chapter stops is a big mistake -- for a 2 1/2 hour film, a DVD without chapter stops is a frustrating thing. You can't go back to certain scenes to reassess clues. And the fact that Universal wants (at its first retail release) $32.99 for it (though I'm sure many of you like me paid about $22.99), no chapter stops and basically no extras is not a smart thing to do to fans of Lynch. At least the Blue Velvet DVD thru MGM had a nifty easter egg on it.Since the film was originally made as a pilot for the ABC network, it's almost obvious where the film goes off on a wilder tangent for the theatrical production. Still, the cinematography is flawless, Angelo Badalementi's score is once again unique, and even if you're left scratching your head it's worth the experience. How in the HECK did Lynch get Ann Miller to be in this film! (How did he get Hope Lange for Blue Velvet?) I was glad that Lynch offered 10 clues on the DVD packaging to help you with the story, but I'm still figuring some of them out. Just as in Twin Peaks, I believe sometimes things that are ""clues"" aren't really that at all, but just weirdness that exists within the film and not having actual relevance to solving it.You can say I have a love/hate thing going on with Mulholland Drive. I know for sure though, if Lynch continues to make more films that get closer and closer to Spice Channel productions, then I'll be jumping OFF the Lynch bandwagon for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Enthralling film, I think","This film makes you a slave to it's beauty and mystery.  Rather than make conventional, explainable ""They could have existed"" characters as in ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Lost Highway"", Lynch just does away with reality here.  I wish that he would have done so a long time ago (not that Blue Velvet or Lost Highway weren't enjoyable).  The plot makes no sense yet you follow it.  And then maybe it does make sense when you're all through.  It feels like a strange dream that you've got to tell your friend about after you wake up.  You can't help but be drawn to the intense love of Diane and Betty for Rita and Camilla.  It's erotic and will make you flinch with joy and smile with sadness.  It's so well made anyway.  Lynch deserved the Best Director Award.... too bad that he lost. In the end - how did they NOT pick this up to be a TV series?  I'm still happy with the way it turned out as a film.  Happy enough to say 10/10.  No more explaining from me, GO SEE IT!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Mulholland Drive,"Mulholland Dr. offers us surrealistic elements and it tells a life of young woman who wants to be famous.Its meaning generally depends on the viewer's comment.The film tells events which are experienced by Betty Elms and Rita who suffers loss of memory after the car accident.Actually the events which are seen in the film are thought irrelevant with each other.But surrealistic elements make it necessary. The film tells a mysterious event and director wants the viewers to complete the film on their own.Film director is David Lynch and he aims to be different and successful by using ambiguity.Special effects which are used in the film help the viewers to understand mystery.And you need to have background information about David Lynch's other films to understand Mulholland Dr.I think that the name of the film reflects the topic of the film.The film is complete dead end and most of the people who watch it firstly don't understand what the topic is.In addition,I think David Lynch wants to make it different from the other films by using ambiguity factor.But,in my opinion,the film doesn't be interesting by using ambiguity.It must be clear and this film's ending is unclear.Blue box and key which are seen in some parts are striking elements.Most of the film is just a dream.Diane sees herself as a famous actress in her dream;but actually Camilla is more famous than her.Because Diane doesn't endure this situation,she tells another person to kill Camilla.Murderer says to Diane that she will find a blue key after Camilla's death.And the film's ending is questionable like the other parts of the film.I think that using a lot of ambiguous elements in the film is dangerous.Because this method may cause a lot of people to quit watching the film.So I think that if you want to watch this film,you should do a search on the internet firstly and then watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"About the rot, trashed out, fallen and brilliant light of hope","I viewed the film at a special premiere in Dallas on Oct 1, 2001. Afterwards, Laura Harring, one of the female leads, spoke and participated in Q & A. Harring is unbelievable looking in person as well as reassuredly in tune with the craft of David Lynch.Anyhow, the film.  Wow!  This is the culmination of the Lynch themes into a film that surpasses his previous best work,  Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. The themes:  the duality of man, dreams vs reality, comic violence vs. devastating sex (the movie has one of the best lovemaking scenes between two women that I have ever seen), paintings of red, blue and black.  Gorgeous actors, esp Harring and Watts.   .Anyhow, the film.  I was captivated right off the bat by the fabulous movie poster.  The film is as strange as anything he has done.  It has very strong thematic ties to Lost Highway but is a much more coherant film in the end. The film is about LA, about the rot in it, about the trashed out and fallen. Its also about hope and the ""ideal"" Hollywood.  Darkness and Light.  See this film, it is his best work.  And this comes from a long time fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Would Give It a Better Review if I Had not Already Seen""Celine and Julie Go Boating""","Technically exquisite movie, like everything that Lynch does.

Now, when you redo a creative masterpiece, you are expected to one up the creative masterpiece---by adding some twist that the original did not contain, for instance. Pointing up a flaw in the original and fixing it. Maybe playing on the viewers expectations.This one did not quite do that. A really good film makes you want to go back and watch it again right away. This film makes me want to watch ""Celine and Julie"" again.

A true masterpiece... entertainment for the brain,"I must admit it: I didn't understand a single thing after the 1st viewing. Yet, I'm not the kind of guy who comes and b*tch about a movie after one viewing only just cuz he didn't take some time to analyze it properly.So I started thinking about it, replaying some key scenes in my head, then came here and read a few more about this movie... then I could figure it out, in a way. I don't pretend I fully understand it and get every single detail Lynch placed here and there... Still I can pretend this movie is a work of art, in all its form. From lighting, music, mood, colors, camera work... to the remarkable performances of the actors. Everything is delightful!Yet I was disappointed by the incredible amount of viewers who hated this movie. Most of them just thrashed it cuz of the plot, not even noticing the brilliant visual work of Lynch (which, that alone, deserves an award). I have something to say to these ""undoubtedly-Michael-Bay-flicks lovers"": Mulholland Dr IS NOT a popcorn movie! It is not meant for entertainment, if not the fact that it entertains your mind the same way a puzzle or a rubick cube does when you are messing with it. It stimulates your judgment, your logic, your ability to memorize a bunch of stuff given to you. Besides, the story, even if pulled that way looks more like an IQ test than a script for a film, remains human. Stay close to the human emotions and reactions... And this dream/reality connection goes, in my opinion, far beyond everyone is let to believe.So if you don't get it after one viewing, watch it again. And again. And again if necessary... but if you still don't get it, just give it up. You probably don't have the brain capacity required. But cuz you just can't understand it, doesn't mean it sucks. Seriously, you think the movie would have been nominated in so many film festivals if it wasn't that great?So quit b*tching on David Lynch's directing skills. Love him or hate him, that won't change the fact that this guy is a genius and that his name is as great as Hitchcock or Kubrick.P.S: To all those who mentioned: worst movie ever, I got some news for you: there are far far worse movies out there.

"A visually stunning, but convolulted, mess","""Mulholland Drive"" was one of the most controversial movies of 2001. The film, about two young actresses and their doings in Hollywood, is dark, ominous, and has dark styles and imagery.  Unfortunately, it is also convoluted, containing a plot that goes nowhere and scenes that seem to have no impact whatsoever on the rest of the film. The reviews of this film have labeled it as a mystery or film-noir and it does indeed have elements of both; but those two genres (and basically all others) require some sort of cohesive plot.  The movie ultimately is style over substance, emotions over direction.  Praising ""Mulholland Drive"" for its visuals yet ignoring its distracting plot is similar to recommending ""Armaggedon"" for its special effects and forgetting all of its other dreck.**1/2",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Dali, Picasso and David Lynch","It is right that these three names should be mentioned together? I think so. Indeed, I think it is not quite praise enough for Lynch, who could very well be the greatest Surrealist artist ever. Dali understood dreams, but Lynch MAKES them. ""Eraserhead"" was a nightmare projected into reality; ""Wild at Heart"" was the fitful dream of a bad hangover. ""Mulholland Dr."" is the most accomplished and precise of Lynch's creations, fusing his dark Surrealism with a kind of cinemtic Cubism. Like Picasso's bull, he shatters his film into jagged pieces and then reassembles them; forcing us to examine his narriative from all angles simultaneously.We see Naomi Watts first as young naive Betty, overplaying the chirpy blonde to the point of absurdity, (All characters in Lynch's films overplay their roles to the point of absurdity, just as characters in dreams do) who finds an amnesiac in her apartment, played by the almost unbearably sexy Laura Harring. The amnesiac, who takes the name Rita from a Rita Hayworth poster, had been about to be murdered when joyriders crashed into her car on Muholland Drive, and now Betty is caught in the web of those who want her dead. So far, so Hitchcock.We learn that ""Rita"" once had a roommate, called Diane Selwyn, and when they break into her house, they find a dead body (hers?) there. The two amateur detectives bond, and eventually fall in love, engaging in one of the sexiest love scenes to hit the screen in decades. It is after this that Lynch takes the hammer to his mirror. A mysterious blue box is found, to which Rita apparently has the key. The key is turned...Suddenly, Betty isn't Betty anymore; she's Diane Selwyn, and events are spiralling towards the tragic conclusion that may (or may not) open this film.What does it all mean? By the actors switching roles, is Lynch demonstrating the love that both Diane and Betty feel for ""Rita""? Or are these two characters actually one and the same, and one is dreaming the other? Who can tell?There is much, much more to this film; a film director who gets caught up in a cult-like organisation that runs his movie, a dwarf in a wheelchair, a premonition of doom in a diner.

But other times, MD is moody like an independent film, and sometimes it's weird with long wide lens shots and a floating camera like a David Lynch film: so is MD telling one story from the several different POVs?  Is it showing us how Hollywood might butcher something but how an independent filmmaker might shoot a story and how Lynch sees it, all running together in a linear plotline???  Like Rashomon, but without the obvious separation of storytellers---And it's a story about Hollywood and the business of filmmaking. Sometimes Hollywood looks like the Mob, and sometimes it's just business; Sometimes Betty is in our story, and sometimes she's in one of the other director's stories....and what about the key?

Of course not, but Lynch didn't allow chapter stops in the DVD, so I'm stopping intentionally and giving my opinion before I even know what the whole story is....Mulholland Drive (to me) is a story given to us as if by three different directors: independent, Hollywood Big Budget, and Lynch, and it includes backstory commentary on how Hollywood bullies filmmakers......but again, I'm only at the 1:00:00 mark..........",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Over a year later, Director David Lynch picks up the pieces (literally), shoots new scenes and then produces not only his finest film to date but one of the all - time greats of modern cinema.Detailed analysis, and a fine double disc DVD set with abundant interviews, can be found elsewhere.But for the uninitiated, the story opens with a beautiful woman who staggers away from a car wreck with memory loss and the tale of how her subsequent fortunes intertwine with those of the young woman whose temporary home she stumbles across.Twin female leads,Naomi Watts and Laura Harring offer tour de force performances as beautiful, mysterious, sexy and dangerous women seemingly skitting between reality and a strange, ethereal world which we cannot quite place.Nothing is quite what it seems, clues and false trails abound, ad the viewer is kept guessing till the end, and beyond.A majestic music score,and stunning, lush, beautiful cinematography combines with a literate script and obtuse plot to create atmosphere, excitement and uncertainty.The girl's make-up and dress is invariably immaculate strenghtening the ambiguity of the story line.The irony that a film so removed from Hollywood convention should be set in Hollywood is sweet indeed.A masterpiece which will be appreciated by film students and aficionados for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Movie Stays With You....,"I find it peculiar that some people claim that this is a ""stupid"" movie, or ""a waste of 2.5 hours of their lives.""  Mr. Lynch has created a fascinating puzzle-box of a film.  The beauty of it is, it actually takes some thought to get to the resolution of the issues (and, yes, there is a resolution- at least to the largest of the loose ends).  Perhaps it is not for everyone- afterr all, that is why ""Crossroads"" sold tickets.The film style is appropriately dark, and the music perfectly matches the noir- meets- Kafka feel of the film.  The saddest part is that, had Mr. Lynch been given the chance, Mulholland Drive could have been the perfect antidote for the ""Friends"" clones which were plaguing television at the time of the filming of the original pilot.  If there is any justice, Naomi Watts' career should take off after her spectacular performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"...and you thought ""Wild at Heart"" was weird!","David Lynch once again takes us to places we've never seen before, and places most people don't want to know about.I have watched a few of David Lynch's movies, and I try to be open-minded, but come on people this movie is just to ""out there"" for most people to appreciate. Just because a director creates an edgy, dark, dream-like picture,without any plot, it doesn't automatically qualify it as art! I will say this though...it has something for everyone.It has a creepy feel throughout the entire movie, it's a bit like ""Lost Highway"". Some of the acting is top-notch, but the movie lacked substance and direction, then again, most of his movies do. I am perplexed as to how this movie was ever nominated for best picture.

Riveting story of a girl who forgets her past... and the characters involved were even better.  Justin Theroux is an excellent actor.  It was great seeing had Everett again, James Karen, Angelo Badalamenti, and Ann Miller!  Lynch has always been great at putting together a good crew.  There are no character flaws, just the lesbian scenes were overdone.  Once they went into Silencio, things got weird, and weirder.  The box was a very, very good concept.

Simply Lynch,"One of the few films that actually starts with the formula- Lights! Camera! Action! But what do we see? Dark bright mysterious shades of purple, red and yellow. A dreamed up Mulholland Drive. What do we hear? a tragic mysterious exiting score, old jazzed up Hollywood tunes and disturbing sounds. What do we experience? Hollywood, ""this dream place"" or this nightmare? Lynch has created a visual masterpiece that is disturbingly simple, just follow the clues.The film is about Bette (Watts), the ultimate image of a failed Hollywood actress, who mysteriously meets a beautiful stranger, Rita (Herring) and ends up in a dangerous pursuit to find Rita's true identity. That's reminiscent of the old Hollywood film noir genre and feels like a mixture of the films Psycho, Pulp Fiction, Chinatown, Sunset Boulevard and LA Confidential. Under the subtext of the mystery we discover a Hollywood we never knew existed, a world where films are controlled by unknown creepy underground figures that no one has ever heard of.Lynch's directing can only be described as ""Lynchian"". He knows what each camera shot, word, sound and color represents in every scene. It feels as though you're dreaming while you watch the film. You see things that are not there, yet you know they are there. You hear a band, but you see no band.Etc.Naomi and Laura both give brave unique performances. On the one side of the spectrum their performances feel artificially mocking and stereotypical and on the other side you realize they are stuck in Hollywood, the land of the cliché.The set design, film score, soundtrack and all of the other cinematic elements magically fit into one puzzle and Mulholland Drive creates a dream, the most beautiful place, that turns into a living hell of a reality. The one moment you feel as though you want to be there, the next moment you disappear into this disgusting place that you never ever in your life want to experience again. A harrowing place that is so sad that you close your eyes and try to forget it. And then you open your eyes and realize it's the world you live in.Watch it twice, to understand it the first time and read up on the clues before the second viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Like when the cowboy told the director that he would see him once if he did good and twice if he did bad and we see the cowboy 2 more times. This movie is a rambling of a dream or nightmare laid out like a jigsaw puzzle except each person may see a different picture when they're done.

No one understands his films - because there IS nothing to understand - therefore all they can say is, ""Wow, what a genius!""

A Modern Masterpiece,"I had heard about this film when it appeared in theaters, but sadly I missed out on watching it on the big screen. True, many people would not be able to appreciate the finer elements that appear so extravagantly in this film. It takes a certain kind of person to watch and soak in this film...afterall, this is not mainstream Hollywood people! This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. I would even be so bold as to put it right up there with Citizen Kane.  Fine acting, superb cinematography, hauntingly surreal sound...it's all there. About the movie itself, here goes: The first 2 hours of the movie is Diane's ""dream"" or nightmare if you prefer. The last half hour, is reality. People have a tough time figuring out what's in the ""box"" that camilla opens. This box, (In Diane's dream), represents the desire to return to reality. Think about it, the box gets opened, then we cut to the scene to Diane being woken up by here neighbor knocking on the door. The box itself is pure symbolism...the symbol to return to the real world.

"Surreal, scary, heartbreaking, thrilling, funny and most of all, Lynchian","After seeing Mulholland Drive, I found myself going through the reviews on IMDb, hoping (as many of you will) to find not a theory to latch onto but stimulating discussion of the movie. What I instead found, for the most part, were tons of hate-filled reviews which said nothing much other than that all those who liked the movie and did indeed find it intellectually enjoyable and found that it did not underestimate its audience were lying to ""save face"", as one reviewer kindly put it, or ""seem smart"" as another did more brashly.Right now, I can assure you that this is not the case. Mulholland Drive is a powerful piece of cinema, boiled down to (much like Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO) the very simplest form. Both movies were made with a smaller, TV crew (in Mulholland's case that is not surprising) and both are regarded as hallmarks of film today.Mulholland Drive boasts a very good lead performance by Naomi Watts. As with much in this movie, to reveal any details regarding the use her talent is put to would be spoiling it. Unlike most movies, which aim to create a world that one feels is real and inhabited by real people, Mulholland Drive goes the opposite way. The majority of the movie happens within an apartment, and it feels as if Watts' character and those who she stumbles across are the only people in the world.The remainder of the movie (up until the unexpected and quite devastating finale) is punctuated with glimpses of the great beast of Hollywood. We follow director Adam (Justin Theroux) as he stumbles into strange and darkly comic situations. The tone of Adam's scenes -foreign and funny- contrasts very strongly with those of Betty's -heavy and emotional. Despite the strong-sounding adjectives used to describe Betty's scenes, they are strangely lacking in deep emotion in comparison to Adam, who feels very real.The movie shifts wildly in tone, but manages to keep the audience involved and guessing right up to and long past its final note. It makes the audience a character in the film, witnessing the tragedy and illusion that plays out before us like the works of Club Silencio. Having finished this movie, I sat for am hour past the end credits, both trying to shuffle my own interpretations on it into order and attempting to communicate to my body that I was Jo longer watching the illusion. It really is a dream: First a happy one, then an erotic one and finally, a nightmare that leaves us crying in our beds, unable to tell real and Lynch apart. Maybe they aren't.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This ""film"" no longer exists in my memory due to it being sucked into it's own black hole that it created.","Okay, for all of you LynchLovers I will say for the record that this movie did confuse me heap big-time, and enough so that I don't care to watch it again to figure out ""my own meaning"" for it. I just have other things I'd rather do with my time.  Now I like David Lynch in certain aspects of his creativity, but not so much as a whole.  Lynch to me seems like he's so deranged that he feels he must make his films in a way to try to bring us inside his poor warped and twisted mind.  Like that girl Nell, (from the movie Nell? ya'know?) trying to get some of us to be like him or at least understand him so he won't feel like he is the only one in his own insane dementia.  Or he may be a slightly evil man with a plan to make films and tv series that deliberately make no sense but sells them as a kind of """"art"""". Then when he's surfing the superinformationhighway in his penthouse, reading the praises and rants from critiques and fans, he sits and chuckles to himself.  Oorrr he most likely is just another misunderstood artist with many odd fans who share a kind of understanding with him, cut off from the rest of us.  And I'm peeking through the window thinking to myself if I really want to be one you LynchLover groupies.

Brilliant art from a master,"The movie it most makes me think of is ""3 Women"" by that other cinematic master, ( dearly departed ) Robert Altman.One occurs throughout old Hollywood, in the shop-worn jewel- toned culturally recycled 'old' downtown and in the hills of the more established privileged, elite Los Angeles; the other in the hinterlands of the suburban/rural California desert. Both hail from a culturally complex southwest, specific to or influenced by a uniquely L.A./Southern California/southwest USA ethos. These movies couldn't have happened anywhere else or they would be different films entirely.This is the kind of movie that cannot simply be spoonfed to one like 99.9% of movies and other commercial media. It has to be experienced on many levels simultaneously, interwoven with mystical spiritualism, magical realism and ever-changing mythologies -- and yet to experience it means that it goes far beyond those limiting attempts to describe this masterpiece.Mulholland Drive is mystical and magical, spiritual and physical, intellectual, emotional, soulful, visual ... meta-sensory, extra-sensory and ultra-sensory -- it simply cannot be categorized or dissected nor completely understood.All I can do is thank David Lynch and his ensemble of creative souls for something that should continue to be seen, studied, experienced forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Brilliant Puzzle Worth Trying to Solve,"Many have compared the underlying story of Mulholland Drive to a puzzle, and I must agree. However, unlike a traditional puzzle, this one arguably has only partial solutions that each depend upon personal interpretation. For much of the film, identities are blurred, events appear unrelated or pointless, and even the acting and character motivations come across as unnatural and bizarre. The atmosphere created by David Lynch's dreamlike style (through both cinematography and music) is wholly surreal as well, as anyone familiar with him would expect. But unlike other stories that explore the surreal by descending into the frustrating realm of purely subjective interpretation, Mulholland Drive is anchored by several critical, objective events and relationships in the central character's life. As the end of the film nears, the details surrounding these critical events are revealed, quickly bringing clarity to much of the bizarre amalgamation of prior events, but the vast periphery remains mysterious. When all is said and done, the viewer is left with many questions and even more answers waiting to be uncovered.In short, Mulholland Drive is an incredibly complex film, and one which can also be very engrossing and satisfying. It will inevitably confuse and disinterest some viewers, particularly those not interested in working to decode such a puzzling narrative. Yet unlike many films which lose much of their appeal once the twist or mystery has been revealed, this film only gets more interesting the more you piece together. Perhaps others will have a different experience, but for me it was as if the answers to the peripheral mysteries of Mulholland Drive were all there, right in front of me, but just out of reach; just out of focus; just needing one more connection to be made. And the more you piece together, the more you realize that the number of meaningful connections between various events is absolutely staggering. It never ceases to fascinate me with its depth and for this reason, I regard it as a truly brilliant film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loved it-second time around,"I didn't love this film at first viewing. I thought it was plodding, affected, and completely artificial. I don't know why I gave it a second chance recently. Maybe nothing on. This time, I found it completely engrossing, dreamy, and ethereal. Naomi Watts was beyond brilliant in one particular scene. I loved the comedy elements woven into the threatening atmosphere, the colour palate reminded me of Twin Peaks, and I cannot wait to see the new Twin Peaks program. If you like David Lynch, and I do, and you tried to watch Mulholland, and it didn't work for you the first time, you might try again and have a different experience.

A Misery worthwhile to watch (and listen!),"Now, what did I rate? A '10' for the music, no doubt. A clear '9' for the dark scenery. (Though I was tempted to brighten it up with the video controls.)
Some citations: Hitchcock's Birds, of course. With Sala's music, and his ability to frighten the audience just by images that have nothing frightful in them.Lynch is likewise able to do that. Actually, no problem at all for him, otherwise this movie could have been a tad shorter (and thereby a tad better).Okay, for the first summary: If you wanted to see some of Lynch's quality, this is a good movie, because it has good music and a real bunch of scary scenes.Funny enough, I immediately was reminded of that Zeta-Jones/George Clooney movie from about the same time (a tad earlier, I think), starting with a director coming home unexpectedly and finding his wife in bed with the pool man.From here on, alas, the rest moves distinctly into the direction of meritocracy. Not being the sharpest at understanding of hidden meanings and confusing content, here the last 10 minutes or so cleared up everything to me. And, yes, two-and-half-hours could have been strengthened by taking out a lot of the 'just threatening' stuff without any difference in the plot as such? And to those, who couldn't grasp this plot, the last scene wouldn't help, but render it just more pathetic.Some parts are well viewable, up to funny. Like the 'cowboy'. Others dull and irrelevant, like that chap in the beginning who talks about a dream of his, and his scare of that man on the yard of the fast food joint.Fittingly, the more than perfect audition of the love scene between daughter and friend of her father. The clairvoyant lady also added a nice pinch of spice to the whole lot.In order to name a few reasons, why Lynch actually does belong to the top, well, maybe 100. For higher-up placement, however, he ought to have been able to develop a better sense of density instead of seemingly endlessly playing out his ability to scare audiences.Oh yeah, and in case anybody reads this, and feels inclined and most of all competent, please, indicate to the me the answer to the only question that I have not been able to evaluate positively yet: What is this story about swapping houses between no. 12 and no. 17?

Maddeningly brilliant,"I loved Mulholland Drive. Simultaneously, I kind of hated it if that makes any sense at all, which it probably doesn't. Like this movie. MD is made up of loads of random and seemingly irrelevant scenes with one rug pull after another, but the core storyline involves an aspiring actress trying to help an amnesiac find the answers behind the car crash that gave her amnesia. An art-house, surrealist movie, this only becomes more and more confusing as it goes along and trying to work out what on earth it's about is like trying to do an advanced physics exam while riding a roller-coaster while listening to heavy metal. Yet it's fantastic. It truly is. It's one of the best movies of the 2000s. The performances are superb, the direction is excellent, the screenplay is ingeniously constructed and best of all, it's not all meaningless, flat surrealism. There is a compelling narrative and emotional centre here. On a thematic level, this movie is fascinating and only becomes more intriguing- and thus more maddening- as it goes along. This is the first film by David Lynch I've watched, but with only one film he's proved that he has unnatural ability to bring avant-garde surrealism into the mainstream and make it less an exercise in unique style and more as a fascinating way of exploring powerful story lines and themes, and blurring the line between dreams and reality. I now want to see the rest of his filmography. This will annoy a lot of people and it certainly annoyed me, but it's a fantastically done movie and left me reflecting on it for days. Therefore, I have no choice but to give it my highest ranking.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The 'cineastes' LOVE it (and you might enjoy it, too)","If you choose to watch all kinds of films - that is if you don't limit yourself to this month's popcorn blockbuster / gross-out comedy / legal thriller / rom-com bollocks or any other Hollywood / Bollywood stable - you will surely have seen other David Lynch work. If you haven't, you might already know him by reputation. So the chances are you will know what to expect when you sat down to watch Mulholland Drive.So if more mainstream common or garden Tinseltown fare is more your bag, the chances are you didn't much enjoy Lynch's film: 'What's it all about man, it was confusing. What does it all mean?'Ah 'meaning', the bane of many a filmmaker, jazz musician, painter and writer.'It was OK, but, you know, I didn't quite understand it.' Well that's odd, you want understanding? If you have just eaten an expensive meal out, something you have not tried before and you liked it, would it really make any sense at all then to say: 'Well, I really did like that - but what does it mean?'And, of course, it meant nothing: the chef isn't in the business of purveying 'meaning' - he cooks and prepares interesting food, and I suspect - I must be careful here because I'm not chef - he would be quite happy if you simply enjoyed what he had made for you to eat.How often have you heard someone or other comment 'well, I quite like some jazz, but I just don't understand it. What's it supposed to mean?' Come again? Isn't music, whether Beethoven, Miles Davis, Guy Clark, Bach, Taylor Swift, Afrobeat, Django Reinhardt, Steve Reich or anything your care to name in the first instant essentially made to be listened to (and danced to)?Isn't it simply sound and what the composer and players are doing with it, manipulating it to which is core to their artistry?Yes, pretentious cooks and jazzers might then come on with 'there is an intellectual dimension to what I compose / play, matey!' Well OK, if you say so, who am I to argue? But being more of an uncouth philistine, I would then probably politely and as unobtrusively as possible leave to drink in another bar and in different company.Meaning? When folk bring up 'meaning' when talking of films, I am reminded of Sam Goldwyn's response to a writer complaining - and there are many different versions - that Goldwyn's edit had 'ruined the message': 'You want to send a message,' Goldwyn told him, 'ring Western Union'.The good Lord and Lynch will know what he intended when he made Mulholland Drive, and being of a liberal persuasion, I happily concede hat and wish good luck to Lynch. Me, I'm not too bothered to 'know' what the film 'means'.I'm far more content to enjoy - perhaps experience would be a better word - a film which I found interesting, engaging, intriguing and above all entertaining, and which held my attention from beginning to end.This review will sit side-by-side with many that breathlessly give the film 10/10 and declare it is 'a masterpiece' and 'brilliant'. They proclaim it is one of the 'top twenty best films of all time' (a list which will, of course, include all the films made many centuries ago in Ancient Greece and when the Arab Islamic culture was producing all the top philosophers, mathematicians, surgeons and scientists while Western Europe was jousting and enslaving 97pc of its populations).Let's calm down a little. As in jazz when a 'wrong note' is rarely detected because the canny player wisely chooses to repeat that 'wrong note' several times to persuade the more gullible 'that it's jazz, that's what we do', any 'inconsistencies' in Lynch's film, any 'non-sequiturs', any puzzling 'plot holes' or any flaws get a pass: Lynch meant them, you will assure me.And I will assure YOU that I don't care - overall the film does it for me, I loved every minute of it, even those minutes where I had not a clue what might be going on. But let's stay sane. From me this gets a solid 6/10. Oh, all right 7/10 just to keep happy the cineastes and 'film buffs' who know the star sign of every significant director and what they usually ate for breakfast.Keep 'em coming David. Oh, and don't bother with 'meaning', you really don't have to. This punter still likes your films.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Best Film of 2001...,"In my opinion 2001 was a great year for movies, with the likes ofMemento, Waking Life, Ghost World, and a handful of other brilliantfilms gracing theatres.

Lynch's last film, Lost Highway, totallyblew me away, and with the release of Twin Peaks on DVD Iwanted as much Lynch as I could possibly get.

I can't believe theyoverlooked her.Lynch's direction is, as usual, brilliant, and I am so glad he gotnominated for Best Director...Hopefully he'll take it home this time.Every shot in the film is beautiful, meaningful, and interesting. Atno point while watching the film did I ever feel that I was doing justthat; ""watching."" It drew me in the way few films this year havedone.

More unwatchable waste from Lynch,"Someone lost a bet or owed a lot of money to be in this film or finance it. I can't imagine the dosage required to enjoy any part of it. The acting is forced and the lines poorly written by director Lynch. It appears to be a mocking of Quentin Tarantino's phenomenal Pulp Fiction as though an adolescent boy was asked to produce a derivative work. The best part of the movie is Ann Miller doing a great imitation of Ruth Gordon. This movie may generate endless discussions of what it all means, but the answer is 'your money in someone's pocket'. Another highlight is 15 seconds of coffee pouring by Missy Crider whose familiarity no doubt is a result of a couple of appearances on CSI.

Lynch's Definite Film.,"Mulholland Dr. (2001)Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, Justin Theroux, Ann Miller, Dan Hedaya, Mark Pellegrino, Monty Montgomery, Robert Forster. Directed by David Lynch.Spoilers herein.Thrillers, for the most part, have been part of a successful genre in Hollywood. Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", and ""Rear Window"" are key classics from the genre. And finally we have a film that can be compared to them. Mulholland Dr. has just about everything I look for in a film. Great acting, incredible directing, strange script, beautiful cinematography, and most of all, it's weird and fun to figure out. In other words, this is one of the greatest and most brilliant films I have ever seen, and this is Lynch's definite film.Betty Elms is a woman who comes to Los Angeles prepared to become a famous actress. As she stays in her aunt's house, she is surprised to see a woman with amnesia hiding there. She doesn't remember her name or how she got there, but the last thing she does remember is a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Meanwhile, director Adam Kesher is threatened by ruthless assassins for a woman to star in his film, but if he rejects it, he is in for major consequences.There are many short stories in ""Mulholland Dr."" that won't always make much sense, but in the end they will all come together. Knowing that many of Lynch's films usually don't give an explanation (""Lost Highway"" being one), he lets the audience come up with a solution on their own. All involved do an outstanding job  mainly Lynch, Watts and Harring, for taking such risks in the production.For the many people who are looking for a typical thriller, this is not one. It is one to create perfect atmosphere and clues throughout for the plot twist. On top of that, there is a structured dramatic storyline. There are many words to describe ""Mulholland Dr."", and some in which I haven't even figured out for myself. 5 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not just images, landscape and logic buggery here","It begins with a jitterbug, ends with a suicide, and seems to spike through everything both hopeful and hopeless about L.A.'s film industry in between. David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. may very well be his single best achievement in noiresque narrative mixed with his trademark skips and jumps in logic. Brilliantly acted, shot, edited, mixed and scored, Mulholland Dr. may or may not make sense to what no doubt will be a bewildered viewer, but the images conveyed in the interim prove unforgettable.Read about the plot in the ""Plot Outline"" link or in the external reviews by Roger Ebert, David Edelstein or Kenneth Turan. I want to present something else here: the notion that what you're seeing does, in fact, exhibit a logic and brilliantly plays on so many emotional levels that, taken as a whole, Mulholland Dr. can unsettle not just those who don't get it but, worse still, those who do.So many reviewers use the term ""dream"" to describe this film, and Lynch himself cleverly quips the tagline ""A love story in the city of dreams."" I won't go into every detail in order to completely spoil someone else's first-time enjoyment of the film, but let me go far enough to ask that you consider that what's shown is a dream through most of the movie and that the rest is a mix of imagination, delusion, memory, guilt, and sheer disgust, all made to counter the illusions just shown to you.Consider that much of what you're seeing isn't just coming from the mind of Lynch as filmmaker but from the dreamer as the one sometimes incorrectly interpreting L.A.'s lifestyle. Even Betty, the movie's heroine, refers to where she is as a ""dream place.""Consider that the Club Silencio is where the dreamer reaches the closest point to realizing the truth without being told it, where the environment of the dream is revealed, where the song elucidates more than just a point about the dimensions of sight and sound when they're not real: it uncovers a true feeling underscoring the entire dream. The song is sung in Spanish, one more way to show that it's not completely real or understandable while, at the same time, it teems with a very real, underlying feeling that brought the dreamer to her dream and, later, to her unflinching, gruesome reality. It's as if the Spanish singer is speaking the emotion but in a way that keeps the dreamer from fully realizing it.Consider that Betty and Rita, as the critics put it, are archetypes of the dream but that Laura Elena Harring's and Naomi Watts' characters in the end, after a jarring switch in identities, are also archetypes but, unfortunately, pale-faced reflections of what we know and what is true not just about Hollywood but about life in general. The movie isn't just about image or illusion. It embodies the always contradictory but yet congregational experiences of lust, greed, hatred, ambition, luck, vengeance, guilt, manipulation, storytelling, love, and silence. It shows us how one person's fortune can become another person's aching, how one person's jealousy can be another's nourishment. It also forces us to consider how you can be jealous of the one you love.And, just as important, Mulholland Dr. should not merely be looked at as a puzzle whose pieces one can connect if one reads David Lynch's primer on the rear of the insert in the DVD package. Voluptuous images should be taken in and felt without deconstruction. The emotions being played out are very real whether or not the viewer truly understands the plot.In all, David Lynch has created not just a memorable motion picture but a truly emotional experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely awesome trip,"The first time I watched this movie I was 18 years old. The film had just been released and it was my first contact with the universe of Lynch. Couldn't have started better. I went to the cinema with my friends. We all got trapped by the story. Though I really enjoyed the projection, I couldn't state to be satisfied with the result when I left the room. For me, it had been a non-sense plot. My friends and I spent more than an hour trying to construct a solid theory about the movie. It didn't work. However, something curious happened to me the following days. The more I thought of Mulholland Dr. the more I felt it was a masterpiece. Once I watched the movie one more time, all my doubts were wiped away. Several theories have been developed since this film was released. I'm not going to discuss here what the argument is about or the conclusions. My advice: watch it and let yourself go. Lynch will take you to a fantastic trip and if you really want to enjoy it, stop wondering what is going on. This film is about senses and for the senses, images trap the viewer and take him/her through the world of dreams, fears, nightmares and illusions. The scene at the Silencio Club is basically pure visual poetry that escapes from the screen and makes you feel pity, hurt, uncomfortable and humbled. In conclusion, don't insist on trying to understand 100% the movie. There will be time to think once you recover from the ride. Simply, one of the best movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It is only a recording...,"This movie is more of experimental cinema than your normal American movie.The movie plays like suspense or mystery but 2 hours into the movie when a box is opened the females change characters and the movie continues as if nothing happened at all.There is also a cowboy wandering through the scenes changing the flow of action and a blackened bum who harkens death and Hollywood gangsters.It's like an abstract painting. It has no other meaning then what you give to it yourself.Strange but entertaining...OkIf you cannot stand a world without order, and cannot sleep unless the movie has reason, then just believe that the whole movie is one half real and half delusion of Naomi Watts character Diane who cannot deal with her life. It may not explain everything but it's my best thoughts on the movie. Remember as the man said on the stage....it's only a recording...",,Anonymous,Mystery
Totally bizarre .... but good,"A David Lynch film is kinda like taking acid.  There are moments of ecstasy, moments of unease, and moments when you're not sure what's real and what isn't.  You kinda have an intuitive feel of what's going on but you can't explain it in words.  You just have to go with the flow.The concept of movies within movies has been done before.  Maurizio Nichetti made a very humorous film, ""The Icicle Thief"" (1989), by warping reality with this technique and reminding us how silly modern life is.  Here, David Lynch presents us with a darker vision of modern Hollywood by blending different lives with one another.I can't say for sure what it all means, but it's an interesting trip.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of my favorite films,"To me, MULHOLLAND DRIVE is one of the best films ever made. A no way back trip till the end of the night, the story of two girls lost in the Hollywood night. At the end of the road, one will get lost into darkness, and the other one will find the light. The actors are great(outstanding Naomi Watts), the music is wonderful.As the same time a Hollywood classic(we think about VERTIGO, SUNSET BOULEVARD, or KISS ME DEADLY), a TV series, and a post-modern thriller, MULHOLLAND DRIVE is the first masterpiece of the decade. My favorite film with 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY and VERTIGO.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good discussion movie,"While I was watching Mulholland Drive I wasn't sure what to make of it - the film seemed to delight in trying to confuse the viewer, but maybe that was the intention. I went to see it with about 4 other people and spent over an hour arguing and chatting about the film - Can't see me doing that with your average film. The more we discussed it the more it seemed to make at least semi-sense. My advice definitely go with a group.The acting was reasonbly good and there were some very funny comedy moments - especially Justin Theroux as the movie director. I felt for him in his confusion. Although the hitman was amusing as well.I don't think it would have taken a great deal of alteration to make this movie appeal to a more mainstream audience - but then he wouldn't be David Lynch.Camera focus seemed to drift in and out occasionally and this may have been many things - the projectionist - bad camera work - or intentional to confuse the watcher, I haven't made up my mind which one yet.Summary If you do go and see this - don't judge it straight away, give it a chance to become clearer in your mind. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lynch's best?,"(NO Spoilers/plot discussion)This movie still gets to me 10yrs later...its imagery still haunts me even now, like the strange sad dream it is.I think this is possibly Lynch's greatest film (I say possibly because its a hard call to make, given the greatness of some of his other works). I also think Lynch is one of the greatest directors of our time, so if you haven't seen it then I recommend you see one of the best films ever made.Complex, dark, sensual, sad....vivid mindfuckery at its best. The acting is top notch, the cinematography and direction perfect...I don't think its possible to capture the essence of a dream (or nightmare perhaps in this case) better...Lynch is a master of the subconscious, and though it might take you a while to work out exactly what happened in this film (unless of course you read the plot spoilers here on IMDb) its well worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Reassessing ""Mulholland Dr."" after almost 20 years","""Mulholland Drive"" 2001 release; 147 min.) brings the story of Rita and Betty. As the movie opens, Betty is in the back of a limo. Just when the limo's driver unexpectedly stops and pulls a gun on her, the limo is hit head-in by another speeding car. Betty survives the crash and leaves the scene, walking around on Mulholland Drive. When she see an elder lady clearly leaving her house on a long trip (lots of luggage), Betty sneaks inside. In a parallel story, Betty, a young woman from Canada, arrives at LAX, with starry eyes, hoping to launch her movie career. Betty's aunt has given her the use of her house as she is away on a long trio. Yup, when Betty arrives at the house, she finds Rita there. Turns out Rita has lost all memory as to who she is (she takes the Rita name from a RIta Hayworth poster). At this time we are 10-15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: written and directed by David Lynch, this came on the heels of Lynch's rather straightforward ""The Straight Story"", a marked departure in the Lynch catalog. Lynch came up with another twisted story and film instead: ""Mulholland Dr"", very much in line thematically with ""Lost Highway"" before and ""Inland Empire"" later. The last time I had seen ""Mulholland Dr."" was when it was released in 2001. Frankly I didn't even recall much of the story line or other details when I saw it again in the theater recently. While certainly a good movie, it doesn't feel to me like the masterpiece that many have called it. I'm not saying that it is or isn't a masterpiece, but I didn't experience it like one. This was of course Australian actress Naomi Watts' breakthrough role in the US. I had forgotten that there is a fair amount of nudity in the film. And then there is the surreal story itself where it's best not to try and take everything at face value or to try and explain everything logically.. The movie's score is of course done by Lynch's house composer Angelo Badalamenti. It blows the mind that this movie is approaching its 20th anniversary, AND that Lynch made only one more feature length after this, namely 2006's ""Inland Empire"".""Mulholland Dr. was playing at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend and on a whim (and also resulting from a lack of new movies coming to theaters), I went to see it. The Saturday early evening screening was attended okay (about 10 people--in comparison, the day before I saw the new Chris Nolan ""Tenet"" and there were exactly 4 people in a large theater for that). I certainly enjoyed seeing ""Mulholland Dr."" again, but I wasn't overwhelmed like I expected to. Of course if you haven't seen this, or it's been a long time, I'd readily suggest you check this out (again) and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It was like a visit to a mental asylum,This movie is to David Lynch as Eyes Wide Shut was to Stanley Kubrick. Pure nonsense. It is done in such a way to make its viewers believe that something great and artistic is unfolding before them. But it was boring as hell. I got a pain in my neck watching it. The promise of Naomi Watts nudity was what Lynch relied on to avoid people from storming out of theaters. Lynch is a good director but this movie leaves you with nothing. It was like a visit to a mental asylum. At least Kubrick stated that Eyes wide shut was a piece of S. Here Lynch forces Watts into doing a total nude scene and thinks he's created a masterpiece. I read elsewhere that Lynch made this particular movie almost out of spite because when he wanted to make this movie some years ago he could not come up with an ending and so the producers had the original sets and props burned down.Maybe that is why Lynch tries to show how Hollywood is run by mafia in this flick. My advise: Never watch this junk. Worst Lynch movie. i cannot believe you made Elephant man.,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Lynch on point,"Speaking of Mulholland drive, I think it's not the best of his films, but that doesn't mean that it is bad. Alot of the critics in this forum, are very vocal about how bad ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Dune"" is, I don't agree. I think the message is very clear in Mulholland, but how you interpret it, is very dubious. Because how do you interpret a dream! this is important in allmost all of the films David Lynch has made, except ""Dune"" and ""Straight Story"" Mulholland Drive is alot like Lost Highway, suddenly the story twist when Rita opens the box, like when Bill Pullman, awakes as a boy in prison. this is apart of the Dream/reality, Dream/Dream or just reality. but it has something to do with the duality of mankind. for eksample O.J. Simpson the, moviestar, football player, the killer and so on. Samething with people wh o abuse their kids, they are quite often normal people with jobs, house, dogs, cats, good neighbours and care about the environment. But along with the good, is a parallel evil and absurdity. This theme is often used i Lynch films. a good example is Twin Peaks. this little town of nice people, with alot of dirty thoughts and secrets. ""The owls are not what the seem"" Not even Dale Cooper is uncorrupted, because for Lynch it is alot about the Body and Mind. Dale Cooper is not what he seems. Bob says ""Leland has been a good vehicle and I enjoyed the ride. But now he's weak."" ""Leland is a babe in the woodswith a large hole where his conscience used to be."" and Bob later says to Cooper ""I have this thing for knives. It's like what happened to you at Pittsburgh that time."" So Cooper's conscience is not clean, it has a crack, and in the end Bob uses the crack to invade and corrupt Cooper.But about Mulholland Drive I don't quite know how to interpret it yet. but like Dale Cooper says.""Gentlemen, when two seperate events occur simultaneously pertaining to the same objekt of enquiry, you must always pay strict attention.""So watch Mulholland drive and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Appreciation  through intellect,"This comment is in response to previous comments which have offended one's intellect by assuming that appreciation for this film can only be given by perverts or idiots. This is an entirely unfair assessment that I truly resent. Creativity is not defined by our understanding of it. Would you challenge a haiku because it is not written as a limerick? A short story because it is not a novel? As the cliché goes, you are comparing apples and oranges; both are fruit but beyond that they have little in common. Mulholland Dr. is not supposed to have a specific meaning and that is what makes it art and/or poetry. The author/director may have initially had a meaning in mind but it is always up to the viewer/reader to apply their own interpretation. Lynch never claimed that his work had a simple meaning or that it had any central meaning at all. It is supposed to be stimulating and provoking. It is truly irrelevant whether you loved it or hated it but how you felt while watching it. That is, if you could step back from your judgemental thoughts for a minute to just absorb. Lastly, even if you hated the movie, I cannot imagine what would inspire one to insult those who enjoyed it. I tried to understand where these cynics were coming from by looking at their previous ratings of other films and would often find myself agreeing with their choices with the exception of this film. With that said, I am no more a pervert or idiot then those who have categorized me to be, and I must say, I adored this movie. Keep them coming Mr. Lynch.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But color coding was best done by Kieslowski (""Three colors"" trilogy).I prefer Malick, any day, to Lynch.

But reality is another matter entirely. So she makes her own. But with that made up reality, unforgiving consequences always come to haunt the one that tries to escape their own and sad and relentless reality.The movie comes off as incoherent and difficult to interpret for most newcomers who want to invest themselves into the world of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. Even the title of the film is ambiguous. No matter how one interprets it, each one is left to their own devices, their own conclusions about it. But even if one didn't understand a thing, this movie will certainly haunt them till they solve the puzzle of understanding this movie, either by watching it themselves, again and again, or by watching videos that break down the sole essence and mystery of the movie.The 2000's vibe, with still the last late 1990's vibes is still present and welcome in this movie. The soundtrack haunts not only Betty/Diane but also us as well. It's instrumental and emotionally haunting parts fill one's heart with a sadness and uncertainty. Not really knowing what will happen, you just let the soundtrack and the fear of the unknown carry you, from point A to B.The cinematography is gorgeous and the LA setting is wonderful to see, especially from the start of the new millenium. Famous landmarks, such as the movie's name, Mulholland drive, are of course seen in some parts of the movie. The colors are subtle, yet vibrant and happy but also dark and chilling, depending on the scene and its meaning.A relic of maybe better times, Mulholland drive can be enjoyed, even for the 100th time, as the very first time.

As the movie ages as time progresses, it will truly stand the test of time, as it's an intriguing and very different film, that isn't afraid to tell its depressing tale.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sad but true interpretation of this movie by me,"Sad but true meaning of this movie: No matter how many times I see the movie Mulholland Drive; I am more amazed every time. My wife and I had to drive many miles to see the movie when it first came out in a theater. It had limited theaters that the film was showing in the Dallas Morning News. I guess I was a huge David Lynch fan since Lost Highway https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Highway_(film). When we arrived at the theater that was showing the movie Mulholland Drive; I was amazed at how nice it was. The sound quality was very good; I remember the bass and loudness shook the room it was playing in. When we got done watching the long enthralling move; I could barely see straight. I remember having a hard time finding my way out of the theater. We actually went around the whole theater trying to find the door out. I felt dizzy, even high; after seeing the movie and making my way back to the car. When I searched the internet around that time and to the present; I could barely find any info on the subject. Now there is allot of interpretations on the movie's meaning. The Wikipedia page has grown enormous since then. If you are ever in a waiting room or something, and you need to kill some time on you phone; look it up on Wikipedia; it is a good long interesting read. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)I think it is about two ghosts the haunt Hollywood. The ghosts relive their lives and how they first met. It is funny how Ghost Box recordings always work best with celebrity's. www.prrsociety.org/ghostbox.html Maybe the celebrity's possess this new found way of speaking through the afterlife.I think the movie is about a lesbian couple who's love is so strong it will not die. I think lesbians possess the most power to love each other transcending all other love. I think when two women love each other it becomes something different than normal explainable love. Women love like no other species on earth. Women possess the power to love far better than men. The two main stars in Mulholland Drive represent that love to me. Two women who's love for each other would not die; even after death. Of course since such love is normally despised and shunned; it almost explains why such a love would resonate past death upon the plain that is our pitiful existence.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's a very sad movie.,"I first watched Mulholland Drive about ten years ago, and I remember being completely baffled after finishing it. At the time, I had no idea what had just happened, but the film's atmosphere-crafted so masterfully by David Lynch-left me deeply intrigued. It wasn't until I rewatched it and began to piece together its meaning that I became truly captivated. Since then, I've revisited the film multiple times, and each viewing has left me with a different interpretation.The opening scene is undoubtedly one of my favorites. There's something mesmerizing about it, especially when contrasted with the ending. Lynch's decision to juxtapose these two moments is nothing short of brilliant. The emotional impact of the ending is devastating, heightened by the stark contrast between dreams and reality. It's as if you, the viewer, are jolted awake from a beautiful dream, forced to confront reality. Dreams may offer an escape, but waking from them can feel like a cruel betrayal.There are many great films out there, but Mulholland Drive has always remained in my top three favorites. No matter how many movies I watch, it never loses its place. It's a film that lingers in your mind, demanding repeated viewings and deeper reflection.On top of everything else, Naomi Watts delivers what I consider one of the greatest performances of all time.R.

A haunting Lynch film with a deep meaning,"David Lynch is a filmmaker known for the absurdity of his films. However, he is also really good at inserting highly complex story lines into his movies. Every time I re-watch one of his films, I feel like I understand them a little more. More complex events which didn't make any sense to me or meant nothing to me on my first viewing feel creative once I come up with a good explanation to them. This, in turn, made Lynch a really great filmmaker. It gave his films more staying power.After a car crash renders a woman named Rita amnesiac, she partners up with a woman named Betty hoping to become a Hollywood actress as they search for answers across L.A., encountering several bizarre events in the process.There is a widely accepted broad explanation of the film. However, even after you look it up, the film still has a lot of staying power. There are several other scenes from the film which appear to go deeper, and this gives it more staying power. However, no matter how much you look up, it still always seems like there is more to learn from the film, and it still keeps you coming back. The film is constructed so that it will always be open to interpretation. Every time you first watch the movie, your initial explanation always seems off, and it's hard to feel comfortable with it without watching it more times. This movie finds a great balance between reality and fantasy. It sounds very cryptic at first. However, after you pay attention to a few clues in the film, you start to form a basic idea of what's happening, and you should be able to go off from that and expand your interpretation of the film.Like most Lynch films, this is very complicated. Lynch finds many ways of giving hints to its meaning in many possible ways. He has brilliant cinematography which includes a red and pink color scheme (this is important symbolism). He also has weird set pieces which seem out of place. One of them is when they investigate an apartment where someone named ""Diane Selwyn"" supposedly lives. They find a disturbing scene there which gives a frightening clue to what the film means. Also, there is a blue box and a key which seems very odd and out of place. It makes the viewer wonder what its purpose of being in the film is. Lynch made it so that every single event from the film which seemed out of place to the storyline gave somewhat of a hint to what the film meant. I liked how Lynch did this as I thought that it was a clever method. He left subtle hints that were easily noticeable, but they weren't too obvious that they gave the films' meaning away.This film also has many scary scenes. The diner scene is perhaps the most famous one. It was very suspenseful. The viewer knew that something bad might happen. However, they also had a slight feeling of confidence that they would be fine. As tension got higher, the viewer knew that anything could go wrong, and that sense of confidence kept on dwindling. However, it was still hanging on in the back of their minds. The payoff of that scene worked very well since the buildup was really good. Also, the ending scene was very terrifying as well. The lighting and camera-work made it very unnerving, and the viewer was probably horrified. Lynch made no attempts to show suspense or to build up the tension here. He just put the payoff right at the beginning of the scene to show the viewer what they had to be terrified of. The result was a terrifying sight. Also, I found that there were some scenes which seemed scarier on repeat viewings as I got to expand my interpretation of the film. Overall, this film provided a great amount of terror.The soundtrack to this film was really good. It was very ominous. Also, it contributed really well to the sense of mystery that the film had. The intro when it shows Rita's car moving down the highway feels like a haunting way to start off the film. Not only is the soundtrack dark and ominous, but it also can be emotional at times, especially with the ""Love Theme"". Songs from it carry several different emotions. It fits in perfectly with the movie.In conclusion, this movie is amazing. I'm not sure if it's my idea of a masterpiece (although, I feel like my rating for it could rise on future viewings), but it's still very good. It has very good ambiguity and it leaves a few clues big enough to make the viewer enjoy it a lot more on future viewings. It also has many scary scenes which can make it haunting at times, especially after you learn a bit more about its plot. It expertly represents Lynch's talent at making complicated and weird films. When ""Sight & Sound"" published their 2012 edition of the top 250 best movies ever made, this film ranked at #28. I still like Eraserhead a little more, but I can understand the praise for this film. It accomplishes a lot, and it may grow on me over time as well (that was what Eraserhead did after all).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretentious BS,Everyone raving about this movie just wants everyone reading their review to think how brilliant they are for loving this movie. 2 stars for Naomi Watts-she's captivating as hell. Anything else I call Bullshit on.,2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sheer brilliance from one of the world's last true filmmakers,"David Lynch is, as far as I am concerned, one of the last true filmmakers left on Earth.  His works have the capability of making me laugh hysterically and nervously one moment and quickly switching it over and terrifying me to the point of near tears.  He, paired with Angelo Badalamenti, has succeeded in creating one of the most disturbingly beautiful films it has ever been my pleasure to witness.Lynch has slipped back into the incredible mindframe from which Eraserhead and Wild At Heart emerged with Mulholland Drive.  At points in my viewings of this film, my stomach has just been wrenching with confusion at the wild barrage of emotions sparked by the seemingly random images on the screen. Scenes that come specifically to mind are the ghostly Club Silencio scene and the freakishly bizarre meeting with The Cowboy. Lynch left Mulholland Drive so abstract for a reason, and that is is that he wants the viewer to make it his own by applying his or her own interpretation to it.  People who do not like to think for themselves will not enjoy this movie.  Anyone who enjoys the latest action flick or the latest crappy Disney movie will not enjoy this movie.  Those of us who believe that film is an art form and a medium for self-expression will most definitely enjoy it.  It is an incredible piece of cinema and hopefully will be soon forgotten by everyone in America except those of us who are truly capable of appreciating it.(By the way, Lynch got hosed at the Oscars.  Even someone who knows nothing about film would admit that Mulholland Drive is far more visually interesting than whatever it was that won.)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Understanding is the reward for solving this excelent mystery,"It may confuse you the first time around, especially towards the end, but if you pay enough atention you will probably solve the mystery within a couple more viewings. Of course many things are left unexplained and there must be interpreted by the viewer, but at least there is a coherent thread to follow. The realization of the plot is the most rewarding experience I've had with a film in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mulholland Drive is a surreal thriller experience.,"Mulholland Drive takes us deep into the depths of psychological depression and madness. It is actually creepy at times, using supernatural and distorted elements as symbolism to some things these characters are doing. It is a type that doesn't follow the general, simple plot and personally requires more than one viewing in order to understand what the director truly wanted to convey and portray in this film.What I love about David Lynch's directing is the ambiguity and mysteriousness that comes along with it. As I mentioned earlier, this is a mind bending experience and you really have to think about it. If you think that the story is only about Harring's character having amnesia and meeting with Watts and them figuring out who Harring's real identity is, then I think we watched two different films. I have 10+ interpretations/theories on what's actually going on beneath the surface of this film, and I love how Lynch doesn't spoon feed us with all the facts and leaves us to think; it's all very thought provoking.In the first viewing, things may actually be quite confusing. There are a lot of characters introduced with different roles and even more in the second half of the film. So it will be quite hard to adjust at first with the multiple story lines but as you watch more of it things will start falling into the correct puzzle pieces and that will make you internally scream at your head.Overall, Mulholland Drive is a surreal experience. It enjoys playing with the unknown and the viewers might have a fun time trying to guess out what's really happening. The Silencio club scene with Del Rio singing might be one of the most haunting and depressing song sequences I've seen in movies. A great thriller, bordering on creepy sometimes; I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

In case you're a David Lynch fan and wondering, Mulholland Drive is the polar opposite of Lost Highway:  It's entertaining, the characters are interesting, casting was excellent, and on and on.

Question about a scene,"I've only seen the movie once and I found it very good, albeit somewhat confusing. After consulting the other threads for the movie, any blanks I had were filled - except one: the scene in which two men share a laugh about an accident (probably the one in which Rita was in). After that, one of the men kills the other and takes a black book from his table. His attempts to conceal the murder and try to make it look like a suicide were very funny (he also kills a woman who lived next door and the cleaner)! My question is this: what was the bloody point of this scene??? The black book isn't referred to in previous or following scenes. Was this supposed to be a comic relief of some sort?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"There is no band, It's all on tape, it's just a movie in which we can participate and escape. It's a movie as an expressive substation between the real world and the dream.","I highly agree with this comment and it helped me interpreting the movie much more better. But I really liked to expend the comment by sharing my ideas in a more constructive base. Since I have been watching the films of David lynch, I've become interested in the construction of narratives. Like in Lost Highway (which has been criticized to be to disturbed and chaotic) the director wants to make a film where we can forget the Conservative Hollywood-story lines. To really enjoy a film as an aesthetic expressing we need to watch these movies with a more abstract perspective (why do a lot of Picasso's paintings become so famous?; most books write about the participative in the discussions of ""what is the real?"" and ""How does art react on it?"")As David lynch has been arguing: we need to see his film in a way we can watch a Picasso painting, were perspectives and context change. Also his films are constructed with a collection of paintings (24 or more per second) and in between there are abstract connections. When we let part of the importance of narrative go, and watch his movies more on a artistic way, we could understand his participation in the film art-discussion. There is no band, It's all on tape, it's just a movie, a dream in which we can participate and escape. It's a movie as an expressive substation between the real world and the dream. It is the link between the concrete things and objects with their arbitrary meanings, and the possibility of complete abstract feelings and psychological ideas.When we dream, we mix all the persons we know. These person do other thing. We see them from other perspectives and other contexts.Where a lot of criticism on Vertov's film ""the man with the movie camera"" is based on the discussion of the myth of photographic reality, and the function of film. We like to ignore the idea that this film could also be an expression on the October revolution during the upcoming communism, where women been asked to ""stand up"" and participate in the social- and working practices. It the reversed way of looking at Lynch's movies and hold on to the demand for comprehensible normal structured narrative and ignore the contribution to the discussion on film art in the wide world artistic forum of movie makers and criticism.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Mystery Movie I've Seen in a Long Time!,"I never knew that such a suspenseful plot that had both horror and romantic elements made me feel different spiritually, after watching. This movie has more questions than answers, folks, so it's not for everyone. There are too many ways to interpret the story. Just pay attention, figure out the differences between perceptions that transitions between reality & dreams, enjoy the performances, and you'll have a darkly wonderful night!Recently, I read a review that Roger Ebert (R.I.P.) posted about the film saying, ""There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery"" and he was sure as heck right about that!There was so much inspirational passion behind Mr. Lynch's mind, he's eccentric in his craft and determined in his vision. Although the movie is nearly flawless, you're more than welcome to fast forward the certain redundant/uncomfortable parts (such as Rita saying ""Silencio"" a million times or Betty's audition where she makes out with an old fart), but besides that, this was an experimental project that amazed me. Focus closely on the blue key, anything related to murder, and the all the elements that slowly come together.It gets a 10/10 in my book and if only David Lynch won that Oscar.

David Lynch is some kind of genius to have been able to tell this story the way he does.  Read a couple of the other reviewers' longer comments if you want some sort of explanation for much of the movie, but the truth is there are some parts that you probably won't find any explanation for regardless of where you look.  No matter what anyone says against the movie there is an underlying theme and it does make sense, some people just don't see it.

"This is (for a Lynch film) very straight forward, and one of the best of the year","For a David Lynch film (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Eraserhead, Twin Peaks TV Series) this is a pretty simple story.  Most people are getting caught up in the 'what the?, and the huh?' factor when in reality it is pretty straight forward.  I will not give the story away due to spoiling the film, only saying that half of the film is a dream sequence [mocking a cliched hollywood story], the rest afterwards takes place kind of in flashbacks explaining everything (an NO it is not difficult to figure out).  The only other thing I can say is that it also portrays the idea of the dark side of Hollywood in the way actors are abused and repeatedly humiliated in the 'business'.  This is without question one of the best films of the year.I can only say that this film had me glued to my seat.  The lead actresses were so perfect and accompanied by a great soundtrack which set the perfect tone.  Lynch goes for a very complete film noir with dark rooms, shadows, even some 40's hairstyles and even the shots outside in the daylight seem mysterious and eerie.  Complemented by Lynch's dark humour, this film also has many funny moments, and some of the most memorable bizarre characters (following up on the Twin Peaks like-ness) I've ever seen on screen.This is definatly the year for film noir since 2 of the best films this year are this one and Memento.  For those who are not 'getting it' it's kind of unfortunate and they are probably reading too much into it particularly the first half.  If you REALLY want to be confused go see Eraserhead (which this movie borrows alot from in style).Great scenes, Great mood, Great look, Great feel, Great casting, Great concept.  I had a blast with this film but others may not due to Lynch's qwerkyness.  Some like it, some don't I myself have never been a huge fan of Lynch, but when I think back to how much I liked Eraserhead, Wild At Heart, The Straight Story, and now this film, I think I will seek him out more often (with the exception of Dune).  One of the best films of the year.Rating 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Vibrantly Beautiful Drive,"To my mind there is hardly a film in existence that evokes the very essence of the art so vividly and unforgettably as 'Mulholland Drive'. Every frame, every image, every second acts alone; driving the whole disarranged plot to it's revealing conclusion with an oddly sensible illogicality while still retaining the power to speak directly to the emotions. Despite being void of any clear logic on their own, these images displayed in the film live long in the mind: some repulse, some enlighten, some merely dazzle, but each and every one is a piece of lynch's vision; free from convention and description and explanation to attack the senses and truly captivate the viewer in a world that doesn't let go. Lynch's film begs to be seen, not funneled into words. Film truly is his medium, his tool for entering the mind, and this fact is as present as ever in MD, establishing it as one of his outstanding pieces and a true great for film fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awful movie.,"The first 30 minutes of this movie moved along quite well.  The next 2 hours just kept getting worse and worse.  All of the characters kept changing to other characters throughout the movie.The gangsters just seemed to stand around looking scary - they mostly didn't talk and seemed to have no purpose.  The highlight for me was when one of the gangsters punched out the Director's wife and her boyfriend (about 15 seconds of the movie).  We never knew why, and never saw that gangster again.  If the main gangster talked, I couldn't make out what he was saying.The movie had a promising beginning, but no middle and NO END!  Nobody really seemed to know each other.  This was probably because they were never the same person for more than a few minutes.

Adventures of a Jitterbug!,"I love this movie!  From some of the reviews I'd read beforehand I expected it to be a difficult movie (despite being a fan of Lynch) but I really enjoyed it on first viewing and watching it again reveals new things easily missed before.  It's right up there with David Lynch at his finest. The two beautiful female leads both do a wonderful job of separating their dual identities in the movie.  Naomi Watts as Betty is amusingly all ""Gosh, gee!  This is superfun!"" through much of the film but gets to show her acting chops in the scene where Betty is auditioning for an acting role and later in the film when she becomes Diane, a tragic victim of unrequited love and guilt in the Boulevard Of Broken Dreams.  Laura Elena Harring is frightened and helpless as Rita but as Carmilla, she becomes more confident and hard edged.  Justin Theroux kind of reminds me of Bruce Campbell in his role as a director and it's great to see ""Twin Peaks"" star Michael J Anderson appear in the movie.There's lots of great scenes in the movie including the aforementioned audition, Theroux's meeting with ""The Cowboy"" (note the use of electricity in this scene, a familiar motif from David Lynch's other work), the hitman's first scene which reminds me of both Quentin Tarantino and the Coen brothers, the erotic love scene between Betty and Rita which is tender and is there to do more than titillate we male viewersand the surreal and touching scene in the Silencio club.It's great that David Lynch was able to turn his passed over tv pilot into a masterpiece of cinema with his familiar elements. Even by the time we get to the Pandora's Box cliffhanging ending of the pilot, we've been on quite a journey with the two girls, but the second part of the movie is just as interesting in it's way in showing an even darker side of trying to live in the Hollywood illusion.  A great exploration of dreams vs reality and the consequences of guilt.  Often amusing, mysterious, erotic, touching and heartwrenching in it's final revelations.

Pretentious Piece of Crap,"There is nothing to 'get' about this film, trust me, unless it involves the phrase 'how can I get my money back?'Maybe the fact that there were only four other people in the theater should've tipped me off. 'Mulholland Drive' is an insult to people who enjoy excellent story telling. I've familiar with film noir so don't tell me it's so good that I just don't understand it. Make no mistake: I was not confused, I was bored out of my mind. You are not intellectually superior for liking this movie, you are a moron. Lynch cannot pull the wool over my eyes; there is nothing to experience here. He just wanted to make a movie with two inevitable lesbian sex scenes and even they were boring. This movie is not clever, it is not even interesting and trying to pass it off as 'art' is laughable. A few attractive images do not make a movie. The characters are not convincing and apparently have no direction. Whoever thinks Naomi Watts deserves an Oscar needs to realize that she should go to acting school first.The first half hour was so slow moving that I lost all interest in the characters and only stayed because after hearing all this garbage about what a great film it was I felt I needed to see the ending. I figured there had to be some sort of resolution. WRONG! The last hour of the movie derails completely and I wish I just would've followed the other patrons and walked out. Watching bad movies is a hobby of mine, but usually those movies are low budget horror flicks and they are supposed to be bad  perhaps that's why they are more entertaining than this disaster of a film. Thankfully I was able to convince the theater manager to give me a refund.""Mulholland Drive"" is nothing more than Lynch's half-baked notions about the dark side of Hollywood and after watching several of his films I am convinced the man cannot tell a story to save his life.

Naomi Watts makes Mulholland Dr. quite enjoyable,"Sometimes an actor or actress makes a movie so much better than the sum of its parts. Mulholland Dr. is an example of this as Naomi Watts (Betty) is absolutely wonderful in every one of her scenes. She demonstrates true acting range as she portrays murderous rage, heart- broken sorrow and pure joy in captivating moments during this film. It was a pleasure to see her demonstrate her acting skills in two particular scenes.In one scene she is practicing her lines for a movie with her roommate. It's about a husband and wife splitting up. She delivers her lines with passion and emotion and it seems like Betty could become a movie star despite her roommate's wooden responses. Then a few scenes later, Betty is in an audition with the actor playing the husband (Robert Forster); who insists that she stand very close to him as they rehearse the same lines as before. She performs the scene with such intense, raw emotions as she kisses her husband while saying her lines in a heavy whisper. It's very believable performance. I can't imagine Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman or Julia Roberts pulling off that kind of pure acting.Oh by the way, enjoy the rest of Mulholland Dr. as Betty helps her new roommate (of sorts) Rita (Laura Harring) discover her true identity. Laura does a great job of moving Rita's emotional state from confusion, to fear to blissful happiness in a matter of a few scenes. I'm surprised her career didn't take off as much as Naomi's. She does an excellent job in this movie.Don't worry about trying to discover too many hidden meanings as some reviewers will try over-analyzing every scene especially since it's directed by David Lynch. Just enjoy the ride with Betty and Rita as they go on a wild adventure of self-discovery and character development. It's a long, strange trip, but it's worth taking.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Wonderful Must-See Film!,"Finally, the long-awaited Mulholland Drive has arrived on the big screen, and it's every bit worth the wait! Although I will admit right up front that if you're not a fan of David Lynch's films, you probably won't enjoy this film as much as some. Still, it is intriguing and draws the audience completely into the world of Mulholland Drive.The film begins with an accident...a bad accident on Mulholland Drive, under the cover of night. A lovely, dark-haired woman is the lone survivor of the crash and she wanders off in a daze, heading for the only thing she can see, the lights of the city below. It is in that city that she meets Betty, who helps the mysterious woman (known only as ""Rita"", the name she took from a Rita Hayworth poster) in her quest to learn her identity. Intertwined in this story is also the saga of a hot-at-the-moment film director named Adam Kesher, who is being strong-armed into hiring a specific actress for his newest film. Adam's story involves the mafia, a pool cleaning man who sleeps with Adam's wife, and a mysterious stranger called ""Cowboy"" who brings him an important message.All in all, a wonderful film. I'm not even sure that anything I could say right now would do it justice. I recommend doing whatever you can to see the film.

Of course, you should not read about it BEFORE you go to view it, but you will want to read and discuss it a lot after you have seen. As in 2001, there is a ""litteral"" interpretation, but the best is to succumb to the part of poetry, mystery, etc... embedded in the movie. Some items (the blue box) are better if kept mysterious (like the music box in Belle de joiur) because it is also a film on phantasms, etc; even if you think at first it starts and is a thriller. I spent 2 hours and a half being driven...  many places by this movie soon to be a classic and a cult eagerly waiting for VHs or DVD .... highly recommended , but not if you want to see something as simple as harry potter . but you will not regret it, and think,of it long after !",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stunningly original - a masterpiece of modern cinema,"It is amazing to see a man like David Lynch bring back flair and a shadow of mystery back to filmmaking, an art which today seems consumed by rank commercialism. Mulholland Drive has immediately shot up into my personal Top 5 favorite films of all time, and if the AFI ever makes another Top 100 list, it would be a sin not to include this film.

This is without a doubt a Modern Masterpiece of Film Noir,"I am a big fan of David Lynch movies, ""BLUE VELVET"" etc. But the movie called ""Mulholland Drive"" is now my favourite of this particular genre. It is a very complex piece which ¾ the way through suddenly changes direction from being fairly straight forward and the first time I saw it I was a little confused.

"Ahhh, this movie!!!","One of the only movies I've ever given a 10.  So simple the plot, just gotta remember that you're looking at it a different way.  Lynch is so superbly manipulative that I love the guy.  Take one detail, turn it around and people get all confused.  I didn't even like this movie until I woke up two days after seeing it and went ""Oh, my god, I get it"".  And it's such a true story and when you do get it, you wonder how you didn't see it before - like, I think of myself as stupid that I didn't realize the whole thing when Naomi Watts' character Betty said near the beginning, ""I'm gonna fix a sandwich"".  Who says that?  And in such a cheery way?  Come on.  And how many people agree with me - top three scenes:(1)  The Audition (2)  Club Silencio (3)  The Dinner Table Scene At the EndNice casting (refreshing to finally see Naomi Watts again after what I think was her great role as Jet Girl in Tank Girl).  Nice visuals, especially the exterior stuff - Primo lighting and saturation in the colors!Great plot.Great Dialogue.I don't even care that it was supposed to be a pilot.

Dreamfull!,"In this era where movies with profound context are really hard to find, we begin the 21st century with a movie that represents it's genre for good. Mulholland Dr. is not a movie to get just relaxed and watch it. It gets you on your toes from the very beginning to the end of the movie.
It's one of those double-watch movies, which you have to watch twice or even more to get a general understanding of lies beneath the whole scenes. 
No matter how you watch it, It WILL make sense from each aspect you look through the movie. It could get you as a love story, a confound surreal movie, aesthetic thriller or else. 
What really got me the first time I watched it was the color use in scenes. The three famous Red, White and Blue shades and the color Black. Certainly the colors are correlated to the Story. An enthusiastic young girls who chases her dreams and comes to Hollywood to get them, Which reminds us of all ""American Dream"" where your dreams become true and the red white and blue colors used in the scenes are representations of the American flag i.e America itself. But what is more interesting is the use of the Black color. The black usually reminds us of darkness and impurity and the bad things. It is highly possible that what the Director wanted to say- or at least one of the things he wanted to say!- is that beneath all the shiny enormous industry of Hollywood there's lies, There's darkness, And there's resented things that only you realize when you deal with them yourself.
And of course there's other messages in the movies but they're out of our time to be explained now. So we leave it to here and let YOU find the all that is going on in the plot to say to us. Or even don't bother and forget all the hidden things and just enjoy the movie itself. It's a surreal movie after all, It doesn't have to make sense to enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lynch at his best,"David Lynch is a master of dark, surreal films and this is no exception. It is his best work for ages and a good film to get into Lynch.After a bizarre car crash, a young woman is left with amnesia, she befriends an aspiring actress coming to LA to work and together try and solve the mystery surrounding just who she is. Meanwhile, a famous movie director's new film is seemingly taken over by a bunch of macabre producers, with a mysterious way of working. Also we see the story of a hit man and a young man and his psychiatrist in a diner.But what do these stories have in common? Well if you head isn't doing cartwheels in the first 20 minutes then you're watching the wrong film. Just when you think the solution is about to emerge, Lynch destroys any notions you had of what you may have thought had happened by more or less turning the story upside down into something much more...realistic, let's say.It's unlikely you'll understand this the first time round, especially if you're not used to Lynch's bizarre symbolism tricks. There is an answer, but most people prefer to admire it for it's beauty, the directing is wonderful, and the two female leads are brilliant, so there's a lot to show for.Mulholland Drive is a dark, confusing yet beautiful film. I highly recommend it to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Giant, steaming waste of time & money","How does David Lynch do it? Unlike the legions of thick-black-framed-glasses-wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise his name, I just don't see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such tripe. How can Lynch sloppily cobble together leftover footage from a failed TV pilot into a nonsensical, poorly-acted mess & have critics rave about it & actually include it on Year's Best lists?I'm baffled. If you're looking for a good film noir, rent ""Bound"" instead. If you're looking for a good ""puzzle"" movie try ""Memento.""

But it truly makes sense, it's just kind of hard to understand. Some say it's stupid to make a movie so hard to get. But i don't think this movie is just a hard stupid puzzle. The plot is awesome, besides the puzzle it is, and the acting is the best. The cinematography is groundbreaking, and the movie REALLY has a nightmarish feeling. The style is unique. It has noir and horror movie elements in the first half, then it turns into a whole horror sequence in the second half.So if you are looking for a very sentimental piece of art, that is also a hard puzzle, this movie is for you.

A broken Hollywood dream.,"Many reviewers say the movie starts as a normal story, but gets unexplainable at the end, with character shifts etc. But the actual character shifts are made in the first part of the movie (in Diane's dreams). In the last part (when Diane is awake) Lynch gives us the ""real"" or ""actual"" situation. We get to know where Diane got all the names, places and objects from her nightmarish dream.Lynch didn't make a total unexplainable movie. He even made one of the most intelligent scripts of the last few years. There are many details that do make sence, but just not enough to make you say, you fully understand it (which I like).But it's not only about the plot.-There's the typical lynch humour (the espresso scene).-The supurb soundtrack. -The atmospherec photography. -The references to his other movies (Twin Peaks, Lost Highway,...)-The references to the Hollywood's Film Noire period (the poster of Gilda, the music, the close-up of the Sunset Boulevard streetname etc.)It's even a mix of all different movie genres: film noire, thriller, horror, comedy (even slapstick humor), romance, cheap erotic movies,action, even western (the cowboy)...they're all there (and not by accident).Above all this movie is a big f*ck you towards Hollywood. How everything is ruled by one or two mighty persons. How an actress can get to the top by not only using her acting skills. How a young, unexperienced actress with high hopes, can fall so low or in other words how the so called Hollywood ""dream"" can be broken.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Lynch is a crazed genius!!!,"My impressions going into this film were not that high due to the fact the critics praised this film so wildly....This for me isn't a good sign because i thought Gosford Park and Moulin Rouge were very overated and yet praised to the high heavens!Thankfully it wasn't the same for this film due to the vivid imagination of one Mr Lynch.  The films strongpoints is allowing the viewer to use there own imagination to fill in the plot holes, aiding this was some brilliant acting from the two lead women in the film Naomi Watts (Betty/Diane) and Laura Hanning (Rita/Camilla).  Both these actresses played there parts to utter perfection and completely dominated the screen with there presence.The Eerie score adds to the overall effect and wierdness to the film allowing each scene to move on flowingly and eventually leading to a mind boggling finale.How on earth David Lynch came out of the Oscars without the best director award is beyond me.

Lynch and his Pure Cinema Art,"David Lynch is no ordinary director. His surrealist and unique style, along with his typical filming way and nonsensical dialogues gave him a mixed reputation. What some might call a wacky, stupid and disconnected movie is regarded by fans and followers of the director as a visionary and revolutionary film. And the meaning of revolutionary is also revisited in Mulholland Dr. The plot is a little complicated. It transmits to the watcher a sensation that something is going on, some mystery is in the air. From the moment the film begins, following a young actress arriving at L.A. filled with dreams, to the bare end, this big feeling of mystery, of some meaning on every scene to be understood and solved, follows the mind of spectators, who are subliminally told to make their own theories about the movie. One of the most characteristic traces on Lynch's way of making his movies is the 'cult' atmosphere. This atmosphere is reinforced by the professional acting, the uncommon scenes and the insertion of some apparently disconnected situations in the movie. Here on Mulholland Dr., these traces are strong and remarkable. The elements and the feeling of watching a thriller are reinforced by the Lynch elements. The expressivity of the nonsense here is a proof that a movie is not always a way of telling a story. The pure cinema art of David Lynch is the art of touching the spectator, of expressing feelings and ideas even with no coherent story. And this creates the atmosphere I'm talking' about. That's an allegory to the real plot of the thriller, those metaphors, those apparent useless bullsh*t to uninitiated people. The coolest thing about this surrealism here in Brazil is the fact that some stupid translator changed the title of the film to 'Cidade dos Sonhos' (City of Dreams), which is somehow allusive to the dream-like sequences that appear sometimes. The last piece on Lynch's masterpiece is all the mystery around the plot. We are introduced to new things, to new elements and new characters by the end of the movie, which are there to help on fulfilling our need to explanations in part. Because Mulholland Dr.'s ending isn't conclusive at all. Lynch opens the door so we can enter and finish the story with our own theories and versions. For people who like solving problems, the director left ten clues to solve the thriller and find his own version of the story. But that's not really necessary to like Mulholland Dr. or any other Lynch movie. You don't necessarily have to understand one of his movies to like them. You have to watch and immerse yourself into the film, I guess. And that's why Mulholland Drive is really a fantastic thriller, which's worthy of watching many times so you can make your own version and get clues that reinforce it. All the pieces of a multiple combination puzzle are there on a brilliant plot. Along with great acting, shooting and arranging of sounds (another trademark of Lynch's movies, the experimentalism of sounds to make a scene), this is what makes watching Mulholland Drive a remarkable experience of the senses, and elects this film to a status of pure expressive art.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A sophisticated depiction of what we see in our dreams without the SFX!,"It's a pity when quite negative comments are made about a film by a viewer who does not understand the movie. This film is not a pop corn movie, it presents a sophisticated insight into a conceptual analysis of dreams and hallucination elements. It is not depicted in an obvious manner but it's this that makes this film unique.I recognised this films' beauty in hind sight. It did come a little difficult to watch towards the end but this was because I missed the point of the film. The second viewing made it much easier and I enjoyed this more now understanding the concept.There are some fantastic scenes in this film that are second to none. The 'surreal' dream concept was played beautifully and to capture this idea without the use of special effects is a work of genius.Watch the film carefully, enjoy it, don't blink, talk, pause the movie or make a cup of tea. It's in depth and not an easy watch but it is a work of art.I can only think that Magnolia has some similarities in terms of the time changing, and that is a fantastic film. It's not the same of course and is not a messed up film that a naive watcher could decide. It is easy to deny it continuity, on the contrary.Enjoy and I will give it a full 10/10 because its concept and the simple fact of subtle surrealness that played throughout that kept me on edge. It's simply a very good film and needs attentive watching!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thank You Slide Bar,"Why are they making this movie suspenseful when it's anything but? Confusing, yes. Suspenseful, no. This movie was classified as a thriller. The music, the pacing, the facial expressions--it did nothing but cause awkwardness because I was thinking, ""What's so suspenseful about this?"" This movie was a spasmodic wannabe ""Pulp Fiction"" string of scenes that I failed to connect with. I was waiting for that connection moment, that ""Aaah it's all making sense now"" moment. It never came. Instead I thought I was watching one of The Twilight Zone's rejects.

David Lynch Triumphs Again!,"I saw ""Mulholland Drive"" for the first time last night, and I loved it. The only thing I didn't like about it was that once it ended, I wanted more! I really like the characters, shots, and music. This another example of David Lynch's beautiful filmwork. Betty & Rita work well together. As my wife said this morning, if you like David Lynch, you'll love this movie - if you don't like his previous work, don't see this. I'm a big fan of all things Lynch, and she isn't really. I'm going to see the film again on Friday. Starting Friday, it's running here for a week. I'm going to try to see it as many times as I can while it's here! This is definitely another Lynch film that's not spelled out for you. I don't believe you can fully understand everything that happened in one viewing, or the connections between all characters. Everyone was wonderful in this film, and I applaud David Lynch. I'd like to see more of this material on the eventual DVD. Since it was originally shot as a pilot, I hope that leaves room for more new footage to eventually see the light of day in a DVD or sequel film release.

The best of the best,"It feels like everything that can be said about ""Mulholland Drive"" has already been said. If you're reading this, you've either already seen the film and love it, or maybe you've watched the movie and are unsure how to feel. This review won't be an explanation of the film, but instead will simply be a somewhat rambling compilation of my thoughts about the film - and to start off, I need to say that ""Mulholland Drive"" is undoubtably one of my favorite films, if not my favorite.Arguably Lynch's best film, ""Mulholland Drive"" is a sprawling adventure filled with intrigue, conspiracy, and romance, all set in La La Land - Los Angeles, California. Most know that the Hollywood machine chews people up and spits them out, but few movies show the seedy underbelly of L. A. as convincingly as ""Mulholland Drive"" does. The plot follows Laura Harring as Rita, a woman who finds herself suffering with amnesia after a car accident. Sneaking into a random apartment to sleep and get some rest, the next day Rita wakes up and finds herself face to face with Betty, played by Naomi Watts. Together, they embark on a twisting venture beyond dreams and reality (thanks to IMDb for this apt description) where they attempt to unearth Rita's true identity.Admittedly, the plot for ""Mulholland Drive"" sounds generic. And if it also sounds generic to you, then I can only assume you haven't seen this movie yet. The beauty of this film is in the way its story is told; Lynch decides to tell a mostly straightforward tale in a very unique and unpredictable way, utilizing surreal imagery and dreamlike scenarios. There are many, and varied, scenes that, while seemingly random, all make sense and piece together by the end. And unlike ""Lost Highway"" that can be somewhat obtuse to decipher, with ""Mulholland Drive,"" Lynch does telegraph and spell out what happened - all it takes is a little attention from the viewer.There's so much that's good about this movie that I literally don't even know what to say. Lynch really directed this movie with masterful precision, to the point where he's almost tricking the viewer at times. For example, at first glance, you may find yourself taken aback by the stilted, wooden, borderline bad, performances - I definitely was at my first viewing. However, as the film goes on, you'll realize that this was a purposeful directorial decision that was specifically intended to blindside viewers; what is at first perplexing is by the end purposeful.With marvelous performances from Naomi and Laura, ""Mulholland Drive"" is truly a special film, and one that I've watched more times that I can count, and enjoy each and every time. Filled with scenes that I think about on a weekly basis, scenes that I have ever forgotten since first watching this movie back in high school, ""Mulholland Drive"" is the first movie I watched that showed me film is more than just entertainment, but also art. Undeniably one of the best movies of all time, this is a film that I encourage everyone to watch at least once. You may love it, or you may hate it, but by the end you won't be able to deny that you watched something unlike anything you've ever seen before.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Very good.,"If David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is going to do anything, it will confuse the hell out you.  In all likelihood, most who exit the cinema will wonder, was that a very weird film, or was it an incredibly bizarre dream?Originally intended as a television series, Mulholland Drive was cancelled shortly after the pilot was made.  Not wanting to let his dream die, Lynch added some new scenes converting it into a feature length movie.  Because it began as a television series, a number of affairs remain unresolved.  But after seeing what Lynch has managed to create with what little he had, this is forgivable.The film reeks of Lynch's earlier work.  In fact, this one acts almost as a show reel of its predecessors.  Some fantastic camera pans and lush music make appearances here, which are now Lynch staples.  To boot we have the usual dark settings and bizarre characters.  We're also treated to a narrative that decides upon changing directions somewhat.  In fact, after a time it basically allows another story with new characters - or are they? - to take the helm.The film depicts the move to Hollywood of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms, played by Naomi Watts.  She is the starry-eyed small town girl who, upon arrival meets Rita (Laura Harring).  Rita had been a woman by the name of Camilla Rhodes, but suffered amnesia after being involved in a car accident before she could be murdered.  Betty decides to help Rita find her identity and, to put it mildly, the two become close friends.Sound complicated? There is more.  The film also plays host to a number of characters, all seemingly unrelated but connected in some way or another.The key theme here appears to be dreams, or some sort of notion of them. Not only does the film play out like a dream, but they are referenced frequently by characters.  A seemingly unimportant character at the beginning mentions that he would never want his recurring nightmare real. Betty on the other hand decides to make her ambition of movie stardom come true, following the cliché of the small town girl making good in Hollywood. However, this is a David Lynch film and dreams can quickly turn into nightmares.  Guess what? They do.The nightmares appear to be concocted by seemingly unrelated forces, in the form of bigwig movie producers and a very scary hobo.  These people, not only manipulate the casting of a film but the lives of those around them in an almost supernatural manner.For those unacquainted with David Lynch, Mulholland Drive would a good movie to start off on.   For those who have seen them all, well, there is not much new here.  Although there is some genuine comedy courtesy of a hapless assassin, and it is extremely well made.  If that is still not enough, at least Billy Ray Cyrus makes an appearance.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Unconventional, but all the better for it","David Lynch is no conventional director. Having only previously seen the brilliant yet relatively normal ""Elephant Man"", I had not personally experienced this, but knew it only too well, and was thoroughly expecting ""Mulholland Drive"" to be a shameless romp within the realms of surrealism, obscurity and plain weirdness. In fact, that was predominantly why I was going to see it.It seems impossible to review ""Mulholland Drive"" without using the words ""strange"" or ""obscure"", perhaps because, although apparently not David Lynch's least accessible effort, this is far from a conventional thriller. Indeed, Lynch's completely unique style of direction makes even the word ""thriller"" seem inadequate, which can be seen in the way moments of extreme terror are interspersed with absurdist humour. One of the primary strengths of ""Mulholland Drive"" is its effortless ability to go against all film stereotypes - highly appropriate in a film which is at least in part a criticism of the commercialist destruction of art within the ranks of Tinseltown. Naomi Watts' portrayal of the overawed and naive Betty arriving in Hollywood emphasises this every bit as much as the disillusionment of Theroux's Adam and the destructive wheeling-and-dealing that appears on the screen. Yet Lynch's heartbreaking deconstruction of humanity cannot be grasped even slightly until the film's conclusion, and even then its intricate patchwork of betrayal, seduction and misery leaves more food for thought than answers to the thousands of questions it poses.Naomi Watts' performance is a breathtaking experience, with Lynch's alienating yet rewarding direction allowing for a perfect showcase of the Australian actress's stunning versatility. ""Mulholland Drive"" is not an experience for the faint-hearted. It requires thought. It probably even requires multiple viewings. Yet it will take you places you may never go again, yet will be all the wiser and more fulfilled for being taken to by such a unique and undoubted auteur. A thoroughly deserved perfect score goes to ""Mulholland Drive"".",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Blue is for imagination.,"""A man's attitude determines, to a large extent, how his life will be.""I consider this as Lynch's Masterpiece for many reasons, first of all it has an exceptional score and sound design, an impressive work of cinematography that enhanced the story and gave the film its distinctive mood and look, and finally David Lynch's unique artistic vision. In Mulholland Drive, Lynch put together a tragic and twisted story set in a typical Hollywood atmosphere in which he explores in a non-straightforward narrative the themes of darkness, horror, fame, love and tragedy. And by using many distorted and hypnotizing sequences to shift between dreams and reality, Lynch sublimely crafted one of his most unique and outstanding storylines.Mulholland Dr. Will always be an astonishing and extraordinary piece of work.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"As everyone tries to figure it out, David Lynch smiles.","After a plethora of surrealistic neo-noirs that went next to nowhere and the great (albeit defanged) story of Alvin Straight, David Lynch has made the film that one gets the feeling he has tried for a decade and a half to get down pat.  ""Mulholland Drive"" takes the flashy imagery of ""Lost Highway"", the feel of noirs like ""Touch of Evil"", and the products of his own nightmares and exudes an unruly brilliance.This film takes place inside a dream, (There is no disputing that since the second shot in the film is a POV shot of someone going to bed) where things such as reflections, reversals, recurring images, childhood fears of the boogeyman, self-idealizations, and images of one's parents are the norm. ""Mulholland Drive"" is like a textbook of the florae and faunae that reside on the oneiric plain and doesn't resort to psychoanalytical claptrap.  For this alone it should be praised.The performances are wonderful, (Especially Naomi Watts who inhabits both sides Hollywood female ideal) the technical credits are great, and the script, which most would spit upon, does a great job of becoming more and more abstract the more you try to make sense of it.

Blasting ""Mulholland Drive for a lack of cohesion would be like blasting a Charlie Chaplin movie for a lack of dialogue.What I personally find most entertaining about ""Mulholland Drive"" is nowhere to be found on the screen, but rather in the reactions of those who don't get it.

Like a painting...,"Well, much have been said about this film, others love it, others hate it! I believe there is some good film making in there. One can think of ""vanilla sky"" (one of my favourites) or/and ""memento"", in terms of plot upside-downs.

A movie that you need to watch multiple times to uncover its secrets,"""Mulholland Drive"" was my first David Lynch film, and it certainly won't be my last.This movie is a captivating enigma-one that invites you to rewatch it multiple times to uncover new layers and hidden clues. Every viewing feels like unlocking another piece of its intricate puzzle.I loved how Lynch masterfully blurs the lines between dream and reality. The characters introduced in Diane's dream during the first part of the film reappear in the second part, in reality, but as different personas (like Coco and Adam). This clever storytelling keeps you constantly guessing.In conclusion, ""Mulholland Drive"" is a true masterpiece. It leaves you ambiguous but that's exactly what makes it so fascinating.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best films of the new millennium,"This is one of the top 3 best films of 2001.  It's one of the most weirdest and funniest movies I've ever seen.  The acting is incredible.

"A unique masterpiece, but it requires commitment to fully unfold","Per aspera ad astra - that's especially true for ""Mulholland Drive"", David Lynch's ingenious masterpiece, which is admittedly quite confusing and overwhelming at first, incomprehensible even. While the requirement of a thorough, analytical way of watching the movie (several times even, at least in my case) and the necessity of a great deal of attention to grasp its full scope and magic provides the singularity of the movie, it is coincidently the reason for any sceptical or even negative review ""Mulholland Drive"" may have received.David Lynch yet again succeeds admirably in creating a dense and enthralling atmosphere, nightmarish, captivating, beautiful. The developments around the relationship of a mysterious beauty, distraught and amnesic after she barely survived a nocturnal car crash, and a young and naive prospective starlet, enthusiastic about the ostensible glamour of Hollywood are promiscuously interwoven with a number of additional story lines such as a stubborn director getting into a major conspiracy by powerful figures of the motion picture industry or the troubles of a somewhat clumsy hit man. There's a strong touch of film noir with dark rooms, mist, the tough guy, the jealous husband and the femme fatale, there are brilliantly staged bizarre characters and partially hilarious situations, all leading to a major twist, fundamentally messing with the heads of the audience...The acting is exquisite and especially lead-actress Naomi Watts provides a stunning performance. Angelo Badalamenti's mystic and mesmerizing score creates the perfect ambiance. And most importantly: contrary to the first impression (and the final judgement of far too many fans of ""Triple X"" and the like) IT ALL MAKES PERFECT SENSE, while still leaving room for individual interpretation here and there.What I love most about ""Mulholland Drive"" and the reason why I admire this movie more than any other (even legendary epics like ""The Godfather"") is the fact, that beyond its marvelously elaborate construction and the artfully utilized symbols and signs, it is still incredibly entertaining and a unique and rewarding experience even for a viewer lacking the most basic understanding of the afore-mentioned coherence.

amazing.,"There's something brewing just beneath the surface of every scene in Mulholland Drive, and it isn't the usual Lynch weirdness. Sure, that's there in spades; we are treated to scenes of bizarre inexplicable characters doing bizarre inexplicable things again and again. There's the powerful movie mogul who doesn't like his espresso, and so spits it into a napkin, complete with wretching sounds. There's the crazy next-door neighbor, who appears to have an insight that no one else has, calling up remembrances of The Log Lady from Twin Peaks. There's a cowboy who shows up to give a cryptic instruction that never quite pays off, then leaves the film. And there are symbols - a blue box, a key, a phone, a dead body.Those are touches that make this a recognizably Lynchian film, but they are not what make it great. Unlike the flawed stylistic masterpieces Wild at Heart and Blue Velvet, or the impenetrable and infuriating Lost Highway, Lynch has quite a bit more up his sleeve this time. Mulholland Drive, you see, almost makes perfect sense.Well, almost. Everything is in doubt, open to interpretation, and sure to fuel more than a few heated conversations. But something actually happens in Mulholland Drive, something that drives the movie from a to b, even though it doesn't happen in that order.It would be unfair to say what that is, and the movie requires a second viewing to piece it together in any way that (almost) makes sense. But the craft exhibited here, the moral center that the movie has, the carefully thought-out dream logic, easily make this Lynch's best film, and the best film of 2001. For once, we can clearly see Lynch making a movie he loves and wants to say something with, instead of some dismissible piece of trashy modern art. He has finally gone from being a filmmaker who invites comparisons to Bunuel and Godard to being one who earns them.Laura Harring plays the film's voluptuous, nameless heroine. We see an attempt on her life turn suddenly into a car accident, leaving her would-be murderers dead, and her without a memory. She stumbles down a famous hill overlooking Los Angeles, and finds refuge in what she thinks is an abandoned apartment.Young, wide-eyed, and droolingly idealistic Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) steps off of a plane from nowheresville into LAX, and on to her aunt's apartment, where she finds a woman in the shower. The woman says her name is Rita, but in truth, she has gotten the name off of a movie poster for Gilda. Betty sympathizes with Rita's predicament, and sets out, in a manner that more than a little suggests Nancy Drew, to find out who she is.Meanwhile, a hip young director (Justin Theroux) broods over a long conference table, angry that two strange and powerful men have just told him in a non-negotiable way who to cast in his next film. He goes outside and smashes the men's car. Then he drives home, only to find his wife in bed with the pool man (Billy Ray Cyrus, in a hilariously understated performance). He does what any man would do. He gets his wife's jewelry box, and fills it with paint.But back to Rita and Betty. Rita, it seems, has a great deal of cash in her purse, along with a strange blue metal box for which there is no key. She finds a phone number, and calls what might be her own home. Someone named Diane Selwyn answers. Or is that just a name she got off of a waitress's nametag?If all this sounds like bad, hokey noir, it is and it isn't. One of the film's pleasures is the way it plays with familiar film devices (the amnesia, the cash, the `mystery') and eventually turns them into something far more nightmarish.To tell more would be to spoil the movie's surprises, but without giving away too much, two-thirds in, the film and its whole logic are turned on its head. Betty becomes someone else, Rita becomes someone with a name, the director turns out to know them both, and it's all somehow tied together by a `cowboy' with a truly silly getup and a menacing look about him. Lynch even finds time for the fleshiest sex seen ever to see the inside of a multiplex.The movie's theme is Hollywood itself. Lynch has, in effect, made his version of The Player, thumbing his nose at the very establishment that releases his work. It's not The Player, though, not by a long shot. Lynch would never dare to make a movie that is anything less than completely weird.In the end, we are left comparing the Betty we saw step off the plane at the beginning of the film, full of wonder and hope, and the `Betty' we see at the end of the film, completely broken. In between is Hollywood, Lynch is saying, that comic mish-mash of broken dreams and over-realized ones, poverty and affluence, bad actors and good ones.For Lynch to take on the town that has for so long ignored and hated him, in his own style, with his own perfect movie, is the kind of `auteur director makes good' story that the Independent Film Channel loves to trump-up. It may not be exactly true in Lynch's case, because he has made some pretty bad movies, worthy of derision. But he has never made an inept or stupid movie, and to see Mulholland Drive is to realize why this is. Trashy, he may be, but he's sure as hell an artist.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Definitive David Lynch!,"For anyone getting started on the films of David Lynch, this is one to watch. 'Mulholland Dr.' is one of the most original mind twisters ever made, destined to be a classic. I'm a huge fan of Lynch ever since I began watching his show ""Twin Peaks"" when I was 10. I then progressed to the films, 'Elephant Man', 'Dune' (Not So Good), and finally I saw 'Blue Velvet'. That did it for me, and I was a fan for life. I've subsequently seen all his films of terrific twisted vision and 'Mulholland Dr.' just drives home the power of this film-maker's genius. Scenes at first, don't make sense, some might not at all, but in the end Lynch covers all his bases and brings everything back in a numbingly brilliant finale of images and sounds to put this puzzle together. This movie has to be, I repeat, HAS TO BE WATCHED MORE THAN ONCE to not only absorb the story but also to appreciate it's brilliance. In summary, 'Mulholland Dr.' is one of David Lynch's best films, and was my pick as the best movie of 2001. It's a different film, for sure, but if you want something original, brilliant and downright twisted, have I got the movie for you!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lynch's most mature work,"MD can be interpreted in several different ways and is great in terms of acting, plot, atmosphere, and pace (although, like most other Lynch movies, the pace is leisurely). Many great moments and unforgettable characters.For a ""thinking"" movie, I think that it works because interpretations are possible given all information within the movie rather than having to draw upon outside literary references.It also works within Lynch's body of work. In many ways, he tells the same type of story in several of his movies. I would compare MD with Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, and Erasehead. As a more mature work, the story is told with more confidence, and with more daring (such as liberal use of time sequencing).",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Full of magic,"I started watching this film completely unprepared and it blew me away. The magic of everything about this movie, from the twists of the plot to acting to camera work is simply amazing... I watched it all over that same night and then two more times the next day and still loved it. Only later did I learn about David Lynch and his other work so now I can see where all this came from.I did feel there was something fishy about the acting in the first part of the movie but after the plot took that unexpected twist, everything fell in place... Well, almost everything... Well, no, not really. Lynch leaves much to viewers to make sense of. If you prefer the type of movies where at the end you get all the answers, then stay away from this one. It left me searching for clues and interpretations which I am leaving out to avoid spoilers. The tag line for this movie may have well been ""Nothing is what it seems to be""... or wait, did I steal it from somewhere? It did remind me a lot of ""Memento"", one of my all-time favorites, although I am pretty sure they were conceived independently.One more thing. (I should start with that, really.) Naomi Watts' talent is unbelievable! The way she transforms several (I counted six or seven) times in this movie, transforms literally beyond recognition, is absolutely amazing. The way she looks at Camilla as they walk uphill towards the party... and then her face at the party... and almost immediately at the diner... And her audition earlier in the movie?! Oh. My. God.

some comments,"Reality is not linear.  Our reality is just a sum of hopelessly unreliable recollections of our perceived past, our hopes and fears of the future  all colored through the kaleidoscope of our subjective point of view  and all mixed together in a timeless and dimensionless sphere of our mind. Fragments of our experiences (already subjective as such) appear throughout this reality, but they shift and change with time.David Lynch attempts to capture this reality on film.Linearity is un-reality.  It is an attempt of our logical mind to take and order fragments of our thoughts and memories into a sequence that satisfies its own needs for simplicity, order and sense.  It picks and chooses, forms and transforms, censors, embellishes, exagerates these as it sees fit.Traditional american movies attempt to capture this un-reality on film. They are meant to make us escape reality, to satisfy our logical mind, our craving for simplicity and order.It is the process of dreaming that lets the mind untie these previously formed linear constructs, and re-order them, re-shuffle them, try different combinations, try fitting pieces together in different ways to make them fit our ""current"" reality more closely.  This can be driven by hopes or by fears, both making prominent appearances in Lynch's movies.In movies like Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway, Lynch tries to break down the linearity of our mind by showing us how the same pieces can be put together to form very different but still self-sustained logical linear worlds - which is very close to the process taking place during a dream.  I think this is why many people explain these as being dreams.----In many respects, Mulholland Drive is a big-budget version of Eraserhead (one of my favorite movies of all time)  Many of the same themes are repeated, as well as visual and plot elements.----I also think, that in some forms of art, one has to learn the language of the artist to be able to experience it (or at least more of it).  This is obviously true in literature (poetry for example) - and also to great extent in music (there are different musical ""languages"" - rules of forming rhythms and melodies, that at first might sound strange and alien, but once we get familiar with them, we often discover the real genius in the piece.)I think this is true for movies as well - seeing a David Lynch movie for the first time for someone used to conventional american cinema is like hearing jazz for the first time for someone trained in classical music, or hearing the alien beats and soundscapes of Richard James for the first time.Many of the elements that repeat in Lynch's movies are just elements of his artistic language.  While these in themselves are pleasing to look at (much like a foreign language poem might be pleasing for its rhythm and flow), it is what is being expressed using them that really completes the picture. It is not about getting the plot  it's about learning the language, to hear what is being said.  And this is also not so much a question of intellect, but more of effort and open mind.People who complain about the movie having no plot and not being interested in the characters are like people who see a movie in French and complain that the dialogues made no sense.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I don't know how to do this thing justice.,"Mulholland Drive is far and away the weirdest thing I've ever seen. Until today, U-turn was one of the oddest film spectacles I'd seen, this movie made U-turn look like the Care Bears movie. The plot is almost beyond explanation. The main characters are either the same person, in love, or only exist in a complex dream sequence. The subplots and supporting characters are dark, eerie, and never resolve. In fact, the whole movie never resolves. But, that isn't the point and you realize this very early. This movie is extremely sensual. It completely envelopes you while never fully revealing the direction of the film. You hang on every detail hoping to deduce the plot, but it is that attention to detail and the non-existance of reality/logic that makes the rich textures of the film almost orgasmic. The acting from Naomi Wells and Laura Harring (both of which are extremely, extremely, extremely hot -- especially during the remarkably tasteful and poignant lesbian sex scene -- yes you heard right) is phenomenal and their ability to transition in and out of characters seamlessly keeps the audience wonderfully bewildered. I don't know how to do this thing justice. Quite frankly, you don't understand the imagery, metaphor, or the overall themes of the movie fully, or at all for that matter, but at the same time -- you don't care. This is the first movie I've ever seen where I walked away completely unable to describe what I just saw, but completely in love with it. A truly religious experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lynch Rocks!,"Mulholland Dr. This is one of David Lynch's best movies! It's so dreamlike and compelling, and the two actresses are gorgeous and do a very good job, especially Naomi Watts, who should have gotten an Oscar nomination. I highly recommend it if you are a Lynch fan, or if you like anything that is surreal. The film is also very frightening, which surprised me because I did not expect it. The atmosphere is great, the tone is spot on, and the screenplay is excellent. I can't say that I completely understand this film (although many of the interpretations that people talk about could be right). I definitely think that Inland Empire left a lot to be desired, but if you like OLD David Lynch, than Mulholland Dr. is likely to be a treat. The guy is absolutely amazing.

I agree films should make you ask questions, but this is ridiculous.After watching the film I noticed that in the DVD case it gave you a list of ten clues to help you understand the film. Well what's the point in that? Surely you wouldn't expect to have to read a summary of a book to help you understand it, it should be self contained.Furthermore, when watching the actor interviews they hardly mentioned the film, all they could talk about was David Lynch, David Lynch, David Lynch, as though the fact he made a film was such an amazing thing. The film offers no insight into life, but a whole heap of insight into the mind of David Lynch and it seems to me that he is very egotistical. When you watch a film be Spielberg or Stone you don't sit through it thinking ""What is the director saying?"", with Mulholland Drive you are constantly thinking ""This is a David Lynch film, and it is typically insane.""It seems he was trying to make a more insightful Magnolia right down to using an LA Road name for the title and having interweaving plots and characters, but Magnolia said everything it needed to and Mulholland Drive said nothing.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dazzling Imperfection,"A very haunting and tragic film.  Yes, I have to agree that it seems a little cobbled together (TV pilot turned into a feature) but I don't think the ending is as confusing as some reviewers make it out to be.  Once the mysterious union between the two women is symbolically consummated by the Blue Box and Key, the movie jumps forward perhaps several years.  At this point, the names of the lead characters are interchanged with those of some of the incidental characters.  Could the point be that most Hollywood hopefulls end up in one of several roles: waitress, prostitute, or jealous ""nobody"" forever envious of the people who ""made it""?  Does the Man in the Alley represent the dark truths about glamour and vanity?   Do the crazed old people at the end represent Betty's memories of the simple life she left behind coming back to haunt her?  One thing is clear: the innocent and naive Betty is taken advantage of, and has her dreams shattered in a very brutal and bizarre way.  When she falls in love with ""Rita"" she doesn't know who she's falling in love with.  In fact, nothing is what it seems.  Lynch has called it a ""love story in a city of dreams.""

"Dizzying, scintillating, confusing but compulsive.","Ever had a movie you didn't entirely get, but couldn't break away from, no matter how hard you tried? And you found yourself watching it over and over again, trying to fully understand it but always landing just that tiniest bit short of seeing the entire picture? If you have, there's a good chance it's Mulholland Drive, and your perspective on whether that's a good thing or not really depends on what qualities you appreciate in your movies.For me, it's definitely a good thing, even if it frustrates from time to time. David Lynch, who is reknowned for creating dizzyingly complex, seductive pieces of film, doesn't disappoint here, as aspiring actresses (Naomi Watts as the sweet, rather naive Betty Elms), quirky relatives (Maya Bond as Aunt Ruth), curious directors, mysterious neighbours and one captivating, seductive amnesiac (Laura Elena Harring as Rita) are swept together in a complex, rich tapestry that paints a very dark picture of the film industry.Lynch does love to play with the mind, too. Every single time things seem to be coming together and making sense, an unforseen twist leaves the viewer scratching their head again. Not a bad scratching, mind you, but part of why I'm not saying more of what the film was about is because I still don't fully grasp it. I know I'm getting closer, but for me, as for many of you who have seen this filmic enigma, Mulholland Drive will always remain a mystery.

Greek Mythology?,"I'm a film student and in our studygroup this film has been analysed already for over 7 weeks and very, very interesting things came out. First of all, the film is really stuffed with Greek Mythology. For instance, the blue box is a straight reference to pandoras box. Second, the names Diane and Camilla are very important in one Greek mythology (i can't remember which one, I'll ask). Third, there is the myth of 'Olympus rock','where all the heroes live'. Hollywood Hills is where all the stars live, under the Hills lays LA. And guess what road leads from LA to the Hills? Yes, Mulholland Drive, exactly were the accident happens which sort of symbolizes that reaching stardom is all an illusion. There's a lot of more Greek stuff in it, like Medusa, but you should really read a book about it to figure it out. The concept of '(Hollywood) it's all an illusion' is definitely a big theme; think of the Silenziotheatre, the failed love between Adam and his girl and of course Camilla and Diane. Actually the whole point of the film is that it's all an illusion, cause you can't quite figure out what is dreamed and what is 'real'. You could also say that the sequence after the opening of Pandoras box is a reconstruction of Rita's/ Camilla's memory, but probably a misleading one; the myth says that when Pandora's Box is opened all the bad things come out. This might be an explanation that we get to see the reconstruction trough DIANE's eyes, who's clearly sort of insane and bad because she hires a guy to kill Camilla. About the opening sequence; we see that 'Camilla' is supposed to get shot by highly professional do-ers; certainly not the one Diane hooked up with. That sort of stuff makes we wonder again if it's all just a dream or psychosis of Diane to try to forget the fact that she murdered Camilla. Anyway, I'm definitely not out of this thing yet, actually I have to write my first assignment now about MH Drive, so I'll stop for now. Still one thing left to say; I think the whole name thing with Camilla, Diane, Betty,etc. is one of Lynche's way to confront the fact that the name of the actor, like Tom Cruise, makes the movies nowadays, it guarantees success for the studio's. This is all disregarded of the persons they are..they're totally replaceable;the same point is made in 'Simone'. This sort off stuff establishes the fact that MH Drive is totally postmodern, like there's no real truth, and if there were then it's definitely not to be found in Hollywood.

While my right brain was riding the waves, I guess my subconscious was busy examining the hull, so when the ""Betty"" nametag appeared, the Aha was confirmed. An explicit revelation of the plot is found in the IMDB review by idyllbay. My take is slightly different, but only slightly and does require invoking Eastern philosophies of death. (By the way, you don't have to understand this film to enjoy it, as most devoted Lynch fans will tell you.) I will only add that I have found few puzzle movies so sweetly satisfying since Vertigo.  (Guess I have to re-see Lost Highway)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What do you expect to see?,"Wow! Mulholland Drive is so weird. I can even say that this is the weirdest movie I've ever seen. It's totally a dream. Probably a nightmare. But a fascinating one.I didn't want the movie to finish at all. There's no sign of logic in this film. Of course, MD in comparison to Lost highway is more colorful and believable. Sometimes you try to figure out something, but before you get the point, something strange happens and tears all your realization apart.In my opinion, this movie doesn't have only one point, but so many. At one point, I suppose, the movie tries to show the darkest part of the human soul. An innocence, which turns to madness. Naomi watts who plays as ambitious Diane, came to Hollywood to become a movie star. A sex symbol Just like Rita Heyworth. But, everything appears to be different. Hollywood is not a place she happen to know. And somehow, she become desperate. I think that she were fallen in love with the director, But someone else(Rita played by Laura Harring), wins his heart. So, Diane neither succeeds in becoming a star nor winning the director's heart(and so many other things). Well, all her complexes appears as a dream. Maybe Rita is Diane's other self. Her second character. She envies Rita and undeliberately makes her, her other character just to revenge her. In another way, she's revenging herself. At this time, Diane's envy to Rita leads Rita to have sexual relationship with her. As a matter of fact, it's Diane who's making love to herself. With this undeliberate act, Diane avoids Rita to fall in love with the director and on the other hand, she satisfies her complexes.Of course, these were what I got from parts of the movie. There are many characters in this film which remain unknown to us.MD is full of vague things. Even if you understand most of the events and make sense out of them, there's many other things left to understand.As a conclusion, we're confronting with human psyche. Mulholland Dr. is a deep social and psychological movie. David Lynch presents one of the most colorful, mysterious, surrealistic and artistic film in cinema history. Despite its weirdness and unlogical atmosphere, you can not stop watching it.The sex scene of the film is one of the greatest sex scenes I've ever seen. This scene is so emotional. Just look at the way the kiss each other. As the last word, It's an impressive movie, don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
To me the only great movies break new ground.,"This film handles a formulaic Hollywood story; small town girl goes to Hollywood and either succeeds or fails. However, in this case she does both. The way Lynch approaches this story in his inimitable Twin Peaks style, complete with the haunting Badalamenti score, makes this movie a revolutionary one.This last two years we have seen movies like Memento, Vanilla Sky, Traffic, Moulin Rouge, and Mulholland Drive. These are movies that take chances, show new slants on old stories, but more than anything else, these movies assume the audience is intelligent.Nothing is given away, some things are hidden, and others have clues to the truth.Not since the sixties with the wave of Trussaut, Fellini, Resnais, and even Polanski have we seen better thinking man's movies.I would say this about Mulholland Drive; If you liked Swordfish, you will HATE Mulholland Drive. And you are the poorer for it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A special film from a special director,"This is the first time that I spend so much time truly enjoying myself thinking and trying to decipher a movie and its meaning. I gotta admit that it didn't grab in the first 45 minutes, as I think didn't happen for a lot of people (that's the genius). But then... I started to feel all kinds of emotions. Seems useless to talk about the genius plot and its structure that I was so surprised and excited to understand. I feel very close to the themes this film deals with, together with the dualism between reality and dreams and all those progressive plot twists that just gradually increase the level of attention and entertainment. David Lynch definitely made me appreciate and love these genres even more. I feel a mental affinity with him since I'm writing a script that deals with the same themes (and I didn't know!).

"Brilliant, but you have to be a Lynch fan to enjoy it","Despite it's confusion, I enjoyed this movie and it is my second Lynch favorite behind Blue Velvet.

In the way that the stories in dreams are muddled and out of sequence, so be it with this film. Naomi Watts was absolutely incredible, and her name had better be on the Oscar nominee list in February.

Why it deserves movie of the year.,"What is Mulholland Drive about?  Well, having seen it 4 times in the theatre, I can safely say that I know the answer to this question.  Making such a statement is dangerous.  If I tell the answer, then it might take away something from the movie for those who have not seen it.  On the other hand, not saying it might give people the impression that I don't really know, but I'm trying to come off as smart.  Let me just say this then. It's about dreams, expectations, ideals and ultimately, failure.There is nothing like Mulholland Drive.  The acting is flawless, as is the immaculate direction and writing.  David Lynch is a true genius, and he operates in a realm that is not accessible to the average person, or for that matter, most people.  Mulholland Drive is the freshest, most exciting movie of the year.  It's rewarding, when you figure it out, and it's moving. It contains every known genre, and it possibly even forges a new one that is as of yet unnamed.If this movie does not win then it will be a great tragedy.  A movie like this comes along once every fifty years.  It's an immediate classic, and I can't see how anything can possibly surpass it, unless it's something that David Lynch can find in his pond of ideas.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The meaning,"Please note that this is my personal interpretation of the movie.The first half of the movie - before Rita/Camilla (RC) is sucked into the blue box - is how Betty/Diane (BD) wanted her life to go. She came to Hollywood, got a role in a movie, got to knew the everlovely girl RC, which she had a healthy lesbian relationship with. Everything went the way she wanted it to go.The other half of the movie, is how it really went. BD came to Hollywood - the city of dreams, wealthy successful lives - but got her dreams crushed. She just gets s****y roles in random movies, and RC ditches her, to the advantage of Adam Kesher. She sees no other way but hiring a hitman to kill her. When the job is done, she finds the blue key on her table, and she is driven to death by the old (f***ing scary!) couple. Sort of because she had done one/several of the seven deathsins.The movie's message is how dreams are broken in Hollywood. On the screen we see happy people, all healthy and successful, but in the reality, most people are tuned down, and end their lives in anger and despite for broken dreams.The only way to fix it all, is to flush it all away. See you down in Arizona bay.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece,"A truly exceptional film with a narrative that surpasses any film I have ever seen. I defy anyone to come up with a definitive explanation to the series of bizarre events and twists surrounding an aspiring actress's climb and downfall in Hollywood. Even after multiple viewings, there is always a different slant an angle - was it a dream? Is there a supernatural conspiracy??? - and there is still no satisfactory answer. A fastidious film which deserves attention to every detail in every scene which are pieces in a never unravelling puzzle.

A poem in the form of movie,"I think this movie is a masterpiece creation. Apart from wonderful cinematic treatment and wonderful use of music and sound, Lynch able to create a strong grip over the audience thru a very smart narrative presentation. The plot is very surrealistic but presenting surrealism in the form of a gripping cinema is something what very few people can do successfully. Have you guys ever read Sukumar Ray's poems(famous film maker Satyajit Ray's father)? His poems are very rhythmic and seems quite nonsense when you read first, but having a strong understatement(!)...I should not say statement...it has strong directional notion when you see how easily poet is marrying some social problem with your desire and then again jumping back to reality. It is roller-coaster ride questioning your ethics, thinking, moral values, conscience but still not very rude and real. In contrary to most of the movies - the final statement is kept open for it's audience, not something exerted by director. It is a process of awaking your inner-self and leave a question for you to answer it in your own way. Thanks Lynch for such nice poem - I can feel same rhythm here!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The most terrifying movie ever made,"David Lynch's films are like abstract paintings. They may look simple on the surface, but the more you look, the more they seem to have eerie meanings behind them, told in alien tongues and perhaps wholly unsolvable. Mulholland drives begins with two women, an actress played by Naomi Watts, and a woman who loses her memory in a car crash and winds up needing the other's help, played by Laura Harring. Together they try to piece together who she is, and things start to get stranger as the characters try to unravel a mystery beyond comprehension. Justin Theroux shows up as a young director whose life begins to fall apart after he makes a casting decision against the wills of some very strange men who drink expensive coffee. His sections of the film give some comic relief, even though he is trapped in the same inexplicable nightmare as the women. The plot itself isn't really important to follow, and since it is quite confusing and fragmented, you can simply let the experience of the film wash over you without worrying about understanding it as you would a normal story.Despite it's surreal overtones and disjointed structure, this movie has some great insights into the (un)realities of Hollywood. It is both a homage to film noir and a cautionary tale of fame and jealousy. Betty (Watts) is a young up and coming actress who seems to have her whole life ahead of her, and a golden glow around her head. Lynch uses an interesting technique when she is first introduced, by dubbing all the lines in ADR. This has the effect of making the acting seem horrible, but there's a purpose. The scene is unreal in it's bright happiness, and the two people she is with continue to smile unnaturally when they leave. Without giving too much away, Betty's persona evolves over the course of the film, and really lets Naomi Watts show a great range of emotions, from purposefully naive to broken and haggard. When Betty goes to an audition, and acts brilliantly, the difference between her acting and her real persona is staggering, and shows you how good of a performance it really is by Watts. The audition scene also shows how fantasy becomes her reality, and this has parallels across the entire film. Nothing is truly what it seems, and the seemingly innocent relationship between the two women starts to drift into darker territory as reality steadily seeps through. When the truth is finally revealed, you will realize that Mulholland Drive has taken you from naive bliss straight to the horrors of Hell.Lynch is a master of subtle film-making. Instead of using music in some scenes, he uses low-pitched background noises. He used these in Eraserhead as well, and they are a great way of making an atmosphere of anxious tension. However the musical score by Angelo Badalamenti is spellbinding. The cinematography is brilliant as well, using blur effects, first-person perspectives and strange close-ups to draw you right into the movie. One scene in particular draws the viewer's attention because at first it seems to be completely removed from the main storyline, and it is. But since Lynch does nothing by accident, this means it is the most important scene in the movie. (In an interview he refers to this type of scene as the ""duck's eye"".) A man tells his friend that he had a dream about this restaurant, and that there's a man waiting behind it, a creature of sheer horror. So they go outside to see if the man is there. Just like there may be a man behind the diner, there is a presence, an ineffable malevolent force lurking behind every frame, word and scene of this movie. I know of no other film able to create such a profound uneasiness, as if some otherworldly revelation were near at hand.The film is also visually stunning, with the colour blue mysteriously permeating many scenes, and the set designs and dialogue containing little clues throughout the film. The mystery is as compelling as it is chilling. Even though there may be no answer to what's really going on in the movie, you will want to watch it more than once to figure out all the different layers, and they are mostly cohesive if you look at it right. Some say it is just a dream and reality juxtaposed, but it's so much more than that. There is another whole layer of inexplicable, subconscious terror permeating the film, and just when you think you have it all figured out, the last scene explodes like a final question in an impossible riddle.Mulholland Drive is a fully realized world of harrowing suspense and dreamlike unreality. There are moments in this film that are so psychologically affecting that they will never leave your mind, and it's final images will leave you shellshocked. Overall it is a roller-coaster of emotions and an endlessly intriguing puzzle. Lynch's storied career may well have hit it's peak with this, an absolute masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

At times Lynch is purposefully vague so that you will walk out of the movie scratching your head trying to put the pieces together.  The great part about the movie is that the pieces do fit together.  Everything in this movie has meaning and represents either something tangible or intangible.

a strange but fascinating movie,"""Mulholland Drive"" is a type of nail-biting film.It is a movie that will make you feel exciting and captivate you with its astonishing plot.It takes you so deep into its world and keeps you on the edge of your seat, laughing in morbid delight at one moment, then recoiling in fear.Every frame of this film has importance and links to other parts.

Brilliant mind-teaser which leaves you spellbound,"Well, where do I begin? It's hard to describe my view on David Lynch's latest works without revealing too much of what's going on in it. A lot of people have already written out their theories and analysis of ""Mulholland Dr."" - so I won't bother with something like that. Just one thing: Some folks claim that the film doesn't make sense. They're wrong! When you try hard enough connecting all those seemingly chaotic strings, images, fragments, then almost everything makes sense - although there may still be a couple of ""red herrings"" leftFor me, there are three main reasons why no one who likes films like ""The Usual Suspects"" or the French movie ""Viva la vie!"" by Claude Lelouch should miss Lynch's masterpiece:a) The tension: There are only a few movies which make me clutch the upholstery of the seat. But a couple of scenes in ""Mulholland Dr."" do - although the ideas behind them are rather simple: Sneaking into a dark flat or around the corner of a fast-food restaurantb) The mind-teasing: Sometimes it isn't too bad when you already know some essential things about it before you go and see a movie. In case of, e.g., ""Memento"" - and ""Mulholland Dr."", too, you should know that everything you see might be important to fully understand the film. With the consequence that you'll definitely keep your attention for more than two hours - sort of spellboundc) The acting: It was a wise decision of Lynch not to cast any blockbuster stars for his movie but entirely rather unknown faces. Otherwise, we couldn't see those brilliant performances by Laura Elena Harring and especially Naomi Watts (who is gorgeous in every which way and would well deserve an award for her role).To come to a conclusion: Even if you finally don't get what it's all about, this movie might fascinate you. Or, as a friend of mine said when we left the cinema: ""I didn't understand anything of what was going on - but let's go and watch it again"".  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Experience Dream in Movie !,"Masterfully done ! This is truly an extra-ordinary experience you'll find in no other movie but Lynch's.The movie itself divides into two parts,the first part is quite a followable storyline with some sub-scenes in it that first cross to your mind might be scenes that will be connected as the story flow ahead,which you'll be proved wrong as the second part turns in and begin to roll into a surreal,unrealistic,weird and dream-alike storyline,and unlike other mystery thriller movies as Vanilla Sky,Memento,The Others,etc that offer an explanation in the end ,this time you'll be left with head scratching by the end. And That is what Lynch challenged us all.Regrettably some just walked out after the movie and began bursting bad references about how the story's so confusing,no exact point movie,even some claim it a trash movie,I'd like to say those are all who miss the whole point of the movie. The point is to figure out what really happens in the movie and that keeps the movie in mind at least for several days ahead. And I must admit it really ain't easy after all,even the best explanation might have holes in it, I don't think that anyone will ever come to a final conclusion about the exact story, not even Lynch himself, and I dare whoever claim to understand the movie from the very first viewing.Absolutely a must see film, a classic already, and believe me you'll never experienced the same if not with Lynch's.

The first time, I dozed off twice, but went back to see what I missed (in fairness to the flick)It was fairly interesting, but I was kinda bored. The ending annoyed me. But yet, this film ""stayed with me"" for a week. I went here to Imdb to read others' opinions, and found that maybe I was shortchanging this film (like I did at first with Memento) and didnt WANT to like it, cause it was CHALLENGING me to THINK. (I know, another cliche phrase) I rented it again and sat thru it with somewhat of an idea of what was going on. By the time the scene where the diva is singing ""Crying"" in Spanish, I was enraptured by this movie. By the ending, I was BLOWN AWAY. The third time I seen it, I was STILL noticing nuances in Namoi Watts' ""Becky""/Diane charactor. The fact that this girl didnt get nominated for an Academy Award is a TRAVESTY of the HIGHEST ORDER. I think I witnessed one of the single greatest peformances of an actress in the last decade! Generally, I am not into ANYTHING ""surreal""...but what David Lynch has accomplished here is downright ERRIE! He has captured the way we/I DREAM on film!

This film is a bittersweet, tragic and sad tale of broken dreams, broken hearts...and broken minds. Symbolic without being pretentious....CHOKE ON THAT INGMAR BERGMAN!

A brilliant piece of Art,"From the off kilter jitter bug precredits sequence to the haunting and cryptic final third Mullholland Dr. is a film that you will never forget.

The acting is wonderful.  At times you may think that it seems out of place, however this could not be further from the truth.  Everything in this film happens for a reason, and although at times it may seem like something was inserted as a mistake, rest assured, its not. Mulholland ranks with Lynch's best, even topping Blue Velvet and Lost Highway (my two personal favorites.)  If you are a Lynch fan, I don't think I have to tell you to see this film immediately, but even if you are a casual viewer, check it out anyways.

Yet more self-indulgent dribble.,"Here you have yet another dose of wasted celluloid from probably the single most over-rated director working.  His level of self-indulgence and weirdness for weirdness' sake knows no peer.  ""Mulholland Dr."" is easily the most vapid, dull, and slow film that didn't get a ""direct to video"" release; Lynch once again proves himself to be an anti-storyteller.  While this might be mildly entertaining on the most simplistic and banal level, it doesn't bear close scrutiny, and time will surely show it for the lack of substance it is.  Why, then, does it get ranked so highly on IMDb?  Viewers wanting to think of themselves as fans of avant-garde and edgy filmmaking convince themselves (and each other) there must be more here than it appears.  Sadly, there isn't.

Lynch makes excellent use of texture and lighting in MD and the haunting soundtrack, a trademark of his movies, just helps you along.

Who knows? But ultimately,even though you know the narrative is so corny, the film really draws you in and then hits you in the stomach when you discover what really is happening to Betty/Diane in the real world.A much needed breath of fresh air.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best movie I have seen in last 5 years,"I saw this movie twice when it was in theaters but have not seen it since. I still think about it fairly often.  This movie, like Blue Velvet, sticks with you long after you leave the theater.  I read a review before I saw that movie that theorized that the first two thirds was a dream and the last third was the cold reality. Viewed in that context, I thought it was possible to come up with a reasonable interpretation of all that happened.Naomi Watts is a star now and largely because of her amazing performance in this movie.  Can anyone think of a role that required more of a range of emotions than this?  She is perky, depressed, seductive, hot, cold, crazy, fearless, consumed by fear, you name it.Some people are turned off by the symbolism and cryptic approach, but if one takes the time to pick it all apart it is extremely rewarding.I can't wait for the next David Lynch movie.10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I had no fun whatsoever watching this!,"What the heck did I just watch!!? Is this film slow for the sake of being slow with dreary characters for the sake of being dreary? An hour into the film I was annoyed with all the characters and bored as hell. At times I actually thought the film was playing in slow motion. And what weird dialogue!There were moments I thought the film was intended to be a comedy, although a very bad comedy at that. Not only was the film slow moving, but even the characters uttered their dialogue very, very slowly. Yawn... The film just didn't grab me at all. There were just so many moments that should have been on the editing floor instead. And then the film turned out to be nothing more than a lesbian affair gone wrong!!! What the hell!I couldn't wait for this utterly dreary film to end. Yup, there's a huge twist, but by that time I really couldn't care anymore. True, everything would make better sense with a second viewing, but there's no way I'm sitting through this again just for the twist ending...This is not what I expected and I had no joy watching this.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Best Film of 2001,"David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is poignant, haunting, and far and away the best film of 2001. From a technical standpoint, Mulholland Drive is stunning, as David Lynch's films usually are, and it is also superbly acted, especially by Naomi Watts. David Lynch's direction is par excellence and he definitely should be nominated for the Academy Award, given his stellar work. His biggest task throughout the film is weaving in and out of a scattered yet brilliant screenplay, which Lynch wrote himself. At one point, the average viewer might not know exactly what to make of Mulholland Drive, and many who have seen the movie still dont have a clue. Most of the film's detractors despise the film primarily because they cannot understand it; those who praise it just dont care. Last but not least of which is David Lynch, who has made a career of going against the grain. He has finally found a way to top Blue Velvet(1986), his previous best, for which he was nominated for best director. This film is truly his magnum opus. This film is infinitely superior to The Lord Of the Rings and every other film this year. Mulholland Drive is an absolute classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, ONE OF LYNCH'S BEST","This was one of the best films that I've seen in a long, long time.  As a fan of David Lynch, I have seen almost all of his films, such as Elephant Man, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, Lost Highway, and Blue Velvet.  I have to say, this was my favorite film of his.  First of all, the cinematography was just great.  Lynch really put some effort into this one.  Secondly, the acting was incredible.  In some parts, mostly in the beginning of the film, you say to yourself, ""wow, this is some bad acting.""  But by the end of the film, if you aren't blown away, check your pulse.  I'm sure the audition scene will become a great scene in cinema history--see the movie and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.  The plot was actually normal for the first 75% of the film (very rare for Lynch), but for the final 45 minutes things get very twisted, reversed, and flipped.  By the end of the film, I simply wanted to start it from the beginning.  WHAT A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE! Comedy, drama, action, and thriller elements all went into this one.  When the ending credits were going up, no one in the theater had the same reaction.  Some people were laughing, some were crying, some probably hated it, and others, like myself, were speechless.  That's what I love about Lynch.  His films are completely, 100% interpretive.  You either love his work or hate his work.  There is no in between, and Mulholland Drive is no exception.  I highly encourage people to see this movie--there is no other way to talk about without spoiling it for people.  SEE IT PLEASE!  Great cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This is so much more than no comprehendo,"I've decided that this is my favorite Lynch film, but it is an aquired taste nonetheless. I saw this film several times when it was in theaters and a couple more since it was released on DVD. I really don't care about the whole thing about the blurring of Laura Herring's private area (David Lynch even admitted he did that on purpose to prevent perverts from exploiting it) or the whole one chapter DVD thing. Mr. Lynch is demanding you to watch the film in its entirety. What's so bad about that? I was actually ANGRY when Lynch got Oscar nominated. Only then would an ununderstanding mainstream actually watch this film, only to gripe about they didn't ""get it."" I would insist that the serious film-watcher not listen to anything those people have to say. I was also very disappointed when I heard that this wasn't going to be a television show since I had loved ""Twin Peaks"" so much, but Lynch is a cinema person. Network television just doesn't deserve his talents. I still hoped he would release the pilot in some fashion. Then I heard he won Best Director at Cannes. I wondered what the lovely was going on. As it turned out, the project turned out to be a surrealist gem! I think most of it makes sense. I've tried explaining what I think the ""meaning"" is, but not many people will listen b/c I guess more people want to pay attention to b.s. like ""Zoolander"" or ""Panic Room."" I've heard every theory from the film is just a masturbation meditation on how modern Hollywood is the destruction of Zen to the whole thing is actually taking place in the 1950's and is the realization of the film that the director is casting. Whatever the ""real"" meaning, I think the whole thing is perfect! The music and cinematography is GORGEOUS and deserves EVERY AWARD in the the book! It is definitely Lynch's sexiest with beautiful locations, occasional Spanish language and lovely female physiques on display everywhere. It certainly surpasses the boredom that ""Lost Highway,"" ""Eraserhead,"" and ""Dune"" conveyed and the love theme is stronger than the ones in ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wild At Heart."" I'm not quite sure if this is better than ""Elephant Man,"" and ""Straight Story,"" but they don't count since those were TRUE stories. ""Mulholland Dr."" seems to be total surrealism with realistic moral messages involving obsession, unrealistic dreams and mortality. There is a lingering grim sadness floating throughout the narrative, particularly in the second part (probably b/c of how ABC treated Lynch after he delivered the pilot). I'm really not quite sure what to make of that stupid blue key or whatever it is supposed to ""open up,"" and the ending IS just a tad too hokey with the loss-of-innocence and embracing-of-the-abyss metaphors for my tastes. But what the film did for me was open up the possibilities of cinema (independent or mainstream) and suggested that imagination does actually exist and is necessary for survival even in this day and age. Naomi and Laura were really great too, especially in bed (tee hee)! You go Lynch!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I must admit that this movie has more than first believed,"After trashing this movie big time I still could not stop thinking about it and I started to regret that I did not pay more attention while watching it. My first impression was that this movie is absolute pointless crap, but after reflecting a bit further and reading Martin Andersons thoughts I must admit that there probably are a story or plot or whatever to call it. Realizing this made the movie a bit more interesting. I do now understand that people are facinated by this movie and even call it the best movie ever made. I still personally think this is a crappy movie by all means. Why conceal a story underneath such a thick LSD cloud? Why deliberately make it so complicated? Why must all the important signs be so tiny? I do not like to do that amount of detective work to get the point of a movie. Besides, even after seeing the ""point"" of the movie I figure it is still not very interesting as a story and I still consider this movie way too long, dull, and surreal in many ways. Even with the ""point revealed"" I still see around 70% of it as pure nonsense. This movie could have been excellent if it was not made so deliberately overcomplicated and to be honest, psyco. And there are way to much symbolism for anybody to chew. An interesting idea destroyed by its lack of sharpness and clarity. I still hate this movie despite the fact that I am tempted to see it one more time now as I think I might know what is going on. That is scary!!! I guess the reason some people love this movie so much is caused by the releif they excperience when they break the riddle. I guess that people solving the riddle totally by themselfes might feel the same satisfaction as others have solving other kind of puzzles. A great puzzle for the fans of those things, but not a great movie. Certainly not what I call quality entertainment. Breaking into the core of this movie is too hard work. The fans even admit that you should see it 3 times. No way, I rather play a computer game. Oh well. Now I can finally forget about this movie",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Master & Margarita meets Vertigo - bold, brilliant stuff!","Don't call it a comeback, he's been here for years - and hopefully for many more years to come - David Lynch is truly the only remaining American director from that great 70's generation who is still capable of enthralling his audience. He knows well that they have seen everything, every imaginable plot twist, and yet he manages to surpass any and all expectations, to disregard all convention and lovingly proceed with a vision uniquely his - the trademark dreamscape with layers of sinister perversion underneath. We are pulled in, and emerge some 2+ hours later from a sensual experience more enjoyable and powerful than any intoxicant. At first, a scorching, hellish version of Los Angeles is presented, where strange, supernatural, possibly infernal characters interfere with the status quo of comically drawn Hollywood types - much like the opening chapters of the famous Bulgakov novel where the devil and his companions come to Moscow and wreak havoc in the literary circles. The local powers that be are ridiculed in a very similar fashion. But before one has time to get comfortable with the narrative's course, a torrid relationship bursts on the scene and suddenly we are in a very different place, physically and emotionally. After a hypnotic climax (Llorando will indeed make you weep), comes the equally bizzare denouement which purposefully leaves more questions than answers.Still, the end result is enormously satisfying - various parts of the film linger for days, weeks... Exquisite style and color, old-fashioned Hitchcockian camerawork, effective use of seemingly innocent 50's pop (Sixteen Reasons never sounded creepier) as counterpoint to Lynch's dark brushstrokes all work to near-perfection. This is a shot in the arm for those who are giving up on cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Weird, Disturbing, Disjointed, Brilliant","David Lynch has confirmed himself the master of modern cinema in this weird, disturbing, disjointed, brilliant Film Noir. A film that takes such outmoded conventions as linear narrative and hurls them violently out the Window, Mulholland Drive is an exploration of conscious and subconscious that will leave you troubled and confused, but ultimately fulfilled as you piece together this pasticcio of one girl's memory (or justification for murder?). A veritable treatise on modern film, Lynch runs concurrent stories with overlapping characters that may or may not be related, fascination cultural cross-sections, seemingly meaningless asides, creepy porn-theater opera and the world's only Film Noir cowboy, and molds them in to a piece of cinema that critics will love or loathe, but that cinema buffs are required to see 4.5/5 Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's fun to have your brain melted,"I have to say, at the end of this film, I was utterly confounded, mystified, disturbed, fascinated, and it felt as if someone had driven a truck through my brain.  However, I truly enjoyed the feeling.  I saw ""Mulholland Drive"", and I was completely involved from beginning to end.  Do I understand it? Nah.  Is that okay?  Yup.This is definitely Lynch's best film since ""Blue Velvet"".  Many people will be comparing MD to that truly brilliant film, Lynch's magnum opus, and others will doubtless be comparing it to what I believe to be his weakest effort, ""Lost Highway"".  But the fact is, where ""LH"" was abrasive, murky, unpleasant, and often ridiculous, ""MD"" is lyrical, subtle, creepy, poignant, terrifying, and quite wonderfully loopy.We get all of the trademark Lynch stuff:  the droning, vibratingly dramatic score, which is remarkably effective and creepy; we also get the syrupy, overdone, deliberately cheesy dramatic scenes (as when a young blonde actress beatifically describes Los Angeles as ""Some sort of wonderful dream-land!!!"") and the aggro-bizarre moments that seem utterly separate from reality...or at least a reality we might be familiar with.But what I really loved about this movie was the brilliant way in which Lynch joyfully screws with the collective mind of the audience.  He sets up the first 90 minutes of the movie as a straight-ahead, linear Noir-mystery, with two beautiful young women (one an amnesiac car accident victim, the other a naive aspiring actress) trying to figure out the amnesiac's identity.  He also introduces several seemingly unrelated subplots--one involving a frustrated young criminal who undergoes a truly hilarious and brilliantly-staged series of mishaps during an otherwise typical murder-heist.  Another involving a hip young movie director who is coerced by a pair of Italian gangsters to hire an unknown starlet for the leading role in his next film.And then there's the ingeniously creepy opening scene where a disturbed young man tells his (shrink?) about the nightmare that has been plaguing him whilst dining at a Denny's like restaurant, only to have the dream begin to come true...It's best not to reveal anything else.  But suffice to say, there are more twists, turns, surprises, fantastic red herrings, McGuffins, and delicious samples of twisted erotica to satisfy any Lynch fan.  The film, as I said before, confounded me utterly--but I loved every minute of it.  I will always remember certain random images:  dribbling espresso, a shiny blue box, a series of blue keys, an ashtray in the shape of a piano, hallucinogenic jitterbugging, Ann Miller's mottled claw reaching into a bowl of walnuts, and a Lynchian blue-haired woman uttering the word ""silencio"".Gorgeous, trippy, scary, and fantastically strange...""Mulholland Drive"" is 2001's best film thus far.

Creativity does not have to make sense...,"This film is unique! It is creative! It is the most overrated piece of crap I've ever watched! This movie is cruel; only in the sense that it draws you in by being very interesting only to disappoint in the end. Like a great film, Mulholland Dr. feels like it is gradually building up to some grand finale where everything becomes crystal clear and you wonder why you didn't figure it out sooner. Unfortunately, the end result is no grand finale! In fact, within a matter of minutes you suddenly feel as though you're watching a completely different film that just happens to have the same characters. It is as if the writer/director had two completely different ideas for this film, couldn't pick one and just decided to combine the two. As the film climaxed/became unwatchable, I couldn't help but think that I somehow missed something along the way and maybe this was just my fault. Luckily, as I watched it for a second time(a couple MORE hours I'll never get back) I realized that it was not me that missed some key detail or moment in the film. It was the film itself that was flawed. Seriously, I have no idea why this movie was even made. Maybe the studio just wanted to watch Naomi Watts get naughty with another woman.

Marvellous!,"David Lynch is my favourite director. He makes movies just like I've always wanted them to be! Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best...right up there with my other Lynch favourites, Lost Highway and Eraserhead.However, like all his other works, this will appeal only to a few people who are ready to accept such movies. People looking for conventional, fast paced entertainers, will be disappointed.Saying anything about the plot would mean giving most of the story away, but I shall roughly state that it is about a girl called Betty (Naomi Watts) who arrives in Hollywood to star in the movies. She meets Laura Harring who has lost her memory because of a car accident.Mulholland Drive is a work of art. The cinematography is excellent. The plot is complex, but it all falls into place towards the end, provided you pay attention to the finer details. It can be completely understood; if not during the first viewing, definitely in the second or the third! There are countless memorable moments, some of which haunt you and stay in your head long after the movie ends; special mention of the terrific score (composed by Angelo Badalamenti who also appears in a brief role) that complements these scenes beautifully.Naomi Watts delivers a stunning performance, which should've at least received an Oscar nomination. The gorgeous Laura Elena Harring is also very convincing in her role.David Lynch was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director during the 2001 Academy Awards for this movie. Ron Howard won for ""A Beautiful Mind"" at that time....!

A Brilliant Postmodern Tour-de-Force,"A riveting and innovative meta-cinematic masterpiece! In true postmodern fashion, this film brilliantly explores the narcissistic and schizophrenic nature of Hollywood and the human individual. A complex and labyrinth of love, naivete, heartache, broken dreams (literal and metaphoric), unfixed identities and plot twists, Mulholland Drive encourages multiple viewings as it is itself comprised of multiple meanings.Equally multiple are the paralleled layers of identity and reality in this film. Drive mirrors the film industry which reflects our own dream worlds, our reconstructions of ourselves and our realities. The film seduces the members of its audience, changing them into riddle-solvers like Oedipa Maas in Thomas Pynchon's novel The Crying of Lot 49, and like Betty (Watts) and Rita (Harring) themselves. The audience, once its identity has been shifted into that of detective, tries to piece together and make sense out of Drive's ostensibly inexplicable connections and ever-shifting identities and occurrences. As the film eludes resolution, it leaves its audience wondering: is there such a thing as an authentic or fixed identity? Do demons and nightmares emerge, as they do for Diane, when we lose ourselves in our dream worlds (be they in the movies or in our own imaginations)? Or are fluid and multiple identities and realities perhaps more authentic and ""real"" than what we perceive as real? Moreover, does not having a fixed self or fixed reality offer the human individual a wealth of potential and possibilities? The surreal may not be all that bad after all, which may be what Lynch is hinting at in Drive. The two moments in the film that best encapsulate the value and dignity of the complex human individual are the love scene between Betty and Rita, rendered with utmost tenderness, and Del Toro's beautiful rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying,"" which compels the audience to cry along with Betty and Rita and to cry at the simultaneous beauty and ugliness of human existence that Drive mirrors so well. The film's end seduces the audience one last time with a reminder, ""Silencio...,"" but Mulholland Drive seduces us to be anything but silent about its noir world. Once it becomes your parallel universe, you will find yourself continuously driving through its labyrinth of multiple meanings and possible interpretations, reconstructing your reality again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Getting Lost in Confusion is Beautiful,"Mulholland Drive is a conundrum that is just as curvy and convoluted as the road for which the film is named. Set in the mysterious and menacing `dream world' of Los Angeles, the film circles around a trance-like landscape where the actual amalgamates with the fantastic, defying logic. Lynch's surrealist techniques--unnatural juxtapositions, irrational ""realities"" of dreams, circular narrative, and shifting identities--combine to form a beautiful composition, like a painting by Dali. Although Mulholland Drive does not adhere to any logical structure, each mirage of sight and sound evokes several emotional responses within the viewer. Usually, any piece of art will speak to us on an emotional level. And we usually cannot explain why; it just does. Likewise, I cannot explain all of the reasons Mulholland Drive speaks to me; it just does.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Suddenly the story has no meaning at all, it contradicts itself and introduces the same actors as different people in the movie.

Like Lynch's Blue Velvet, the film has a promising start but three-quarters of the way through, it takes a bizarre turn and we are taken onto David Lynch's too-often-travelled-road.

There are many twists of the plots and a continuous addition of new characters and thoughts. The movie is written and directed by David Lynch and runs for about two and a half hours. Be sure to put aside plenty of time to see this fantastic movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece by Lynch!,"Muholland Dr. Is definitely a masterpiece of art by David Lynch, and still a film to this day that can't be replicated. Definitely one of a kind, and definitely one of his best. Probably up there with Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, and Eraserhead. Then again, there isn't a single thing from David lynch I don't like anyways.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Comments for Lynchophiles....,"If you have eyes and ears for Lynch's films, if you have the subtlety for his unique art, you should find this film to be his most completely realized to date.If you have none of these, you might find this film to be just plain confusing. (But don't let that get you down: for you guys (or gals) this film has all kinds of eye candy.)MULHOLLAND DRIVE admits of no just analysis within a window of 1,000 words, so I'll say only this: this film reaches peaks of sublimity to which Lynch has never before had the maturity to ascend.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I'll have one of whatever Mr Lynch is Having,Wow....what an amazing work.  I've watched this movie 4 times now and I still don't get everything and I really don't think I ever will but  that doesn't matter....maybe if I could think like  David Lynch for a day I could grasp more.  Loved this flick and there are very few movies that I watch more than twice and NEVER 4 times.,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pandora's box,"Only hope survives in this multi-faceted tale of dashed dreams and nightmares. Much has been written about this expose of Hollywood. And this is a film you will keep coming back to. Acting, action and atmosphere are on point. The stupidity of the hitman is iconic. But so is everything about this provocative story. A must see, must own DVD. Silencio...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Murder, love, jealousy, fame and the grit of reality.","Mulholland Drive is one of the most elegant and sophisticated films this century has yet seen. In brief it is about two young women in Los Angeles caught up in a murder mystery and how they try uncover what really went on. However, in the end it is not what really happened that matters, but what the people are like inside, how they relate to each other and what they aspire to be. This is where the true mastery of the film making lies - built on the brilliant directing of Lynch and the fantastic acting of Watts and Harman.Just to pick up on a couple of points which people seem not to have mentioned before. This film is about how people relate to each other and especially so in a relationship. At the beginning Betty is strong and sure of herself and helps the vulnerable Rita solve her problems. But by the end the roles have swapped over - but the reasons for it are quite unexpected. Both Watts and Harman create this complicated character and relationship change in a most convincing way. They receive my highest commendation for their work in this film.As many people have already mentioned, Mulholland Drive has some plot twists that leave people very confused since they are not spelt out. However, even if you accept the standard twist and can get some meaning out of the film, there is much more to be enjoyed. In Mulholland Drive the film grips you because it communicates non-verbally and on a subconcious level. It does not matter if there are twists in this film or if there are none. What we have here is elegant story telling that goes beyond words and simple plots, it works somewhere deep in our feelings, combining beautiful shots with illogical day-to-day routines. Submitting your attention to this film is like taking a journey into a beautiful and terrifying dream. It is this essence of the film that can make you watch it again and again without ever getting bored. Go along with the ride, don't resist the incomprehensible logic, and I guarantee you won't be dissapointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Lynch's best film, and Film of the Year","Lynch's best movie to date - a brilliant ode to insanity, and what Lost Highway should have been (and I loved that movie).  Naomi Watts is amazing as Betty as there is much more to her than her backwoods Canada persona. Mulholland Dr. is full of electric scenes (including the most haunting lip-sync I've ever seen) and plot twists and characters that will have you talking about this film for weeks.  Certainly better than Memento, but I don't know why it draws comparison as they are completely different in tone and subject.  This gets my vote for best film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best I've seen for quite some time.,"There are lots of truly Lynchian moments in the film, mood-wise very much like Lost Highway. What really surprised me though, was that there is an uncharacteristically strong message (The evils of Hollywood- not that its is in any way unique)in the movie, contrary to some of his former films. Also, many aspects fall into places quite well in the last half an hour. I cannot agree with those who claim the film lacks structure or is scattered.( And - wow- who looks for things like ""identification or compassion with a character"" in a David Lynch movie???)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dreamscape in dreamy L.A.,"Yeah,the steamy underbelly that simmers beneath tinseltown has been explored to death...but not ever like this. It's provocative , tense , dark , dangerous and beautiful....just like Hollywood . David Lynch treats this story like a Rubik's cube , and expects us to put it together...which we might , although you find yourself admiring the beauty of the cube itself , relegating the plot to curiosity status. The close ups , the actresses , the subtle simplicity makes for pure film fire . Witness Naomi Watt's chameleon switch , and sink into the eroticsm of two unprepared lovers...it all takes hold of you hard . In fact , that's about the best description of this film. Gripping . You hear that word a lot in relation to movies , but this one really does it. Mjc",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Is the One,"(I'm re-sending this because the first time, my computer crashed.)Rapturously beautiful, hilariously funny, thematically multi-layered (among other things, it's about Hollywood: once upon a time & right now, for better & for worse, ridiculous & sublime), Mulholland Drive is like the eponymous road it begins and ends on. It lifts you, drops you, blesses you with its vistas & fills you with apprehension. Despite the many things that could be said about David Lynch's excursion into a new region of Dreamland, one I hope to re-visit often, you keep hearing the tired kvetch: ""It was terrific, but the last 20 minutes were too weird."" Even if that were true, and I don't think it is, what a pathetic response to one of the few early 21st century movies that loves and respects its audience, assuming it wants to be astonished and provoked, rather that jerked off by cheap thrills and re-assured by boring platitudes.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Was that necessary..?,"I saw it just yesterday and I have to say that it was quite a disappointment from an expert like Lynch. Let's see; we have a few different stories that have some links between them, but just like a dream (or The Lost Highway), these links are not quite clear. Back and forth in time, a nice lesbian act (the only good part of the movie I dare say, or not?), immediate responses and mystery characters... wasn't The Lost Highway enough for the audience to understand this Lynch's aspect?! If anyone makes something (I mean something, NOT anything!) out of this, please let me know. I really don't mean to be sarcastic, but if there was something to be observed in that film and worths seeing it again,... I will.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"great lynch movie, not that much innovative though...","This movie is definitely worth having a look at, Lynch is definitely the master director this year's Cannes film festival has awarded. The cast and the two heroins of this hollywoodian oniric thriller is fantastic; however I get somewhat a bit used to the classical Lynch's directing tricks, which are sometimes predictable I think... Mulholland has the same weird atomsphere of Lost Highway or Blue Velvet, and the case evolves in the same challenging and irrational way of Twin Peaks. Making it somewhat not that much innovative, right in the continuity of other movies from this great american director. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Slow parts, an uncontrolled ending - still an experience","A memorable film.  The lead actresses are riveting, as is the lead male in the role of a film director.Are there slow plodding moments as critics mention? Yes, actually a couple.Are the ending frames more governed by filming-style then by plot-line? Yes, but one can unlock that logic.But the characters are engaging and the suspense is tangible. So really - a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's a loop,"I was bowled over by Mulholland.    I had read nothing about the movie before I went to see it, just going on the merits of Lynch as a director. I have always loved his style of directing and vision.  There is always a good-natured naiveté about his work. Something very pure and honest (this is why he goes on about the quality of coffee in his movies, I think).  I am sure that most will not agree but that is the underlying feeling I get from it.  He loves filmmaking and it shows.  It is uncompromising and pure.  It is brave and very rare in Hollywood.Mulholland Dr follows into that vein but there is an underlying tone of evil from the beginning that is fed by the goody goody nature of Betty (just too good to be true..too wide eyed and innocent) and the leering old couple when they leave Betty on the pavement of LA airport.  But you just don't know where Lynch is taking you with this.  I just let it wash over me and it was astonishing.  Creepy, funny and devastating the story is a loop but you only find that out, of course, at the end of the movie.  Ending where it began. So I do not understand the notion that it is incoherent.  It certainly isn't incoherent. It is a Loop.  It doesn't deal with normal time notions but it gives you clues as to what state of reality Betty/Diane is in.Just look for the ashtray in the shape of the Piano.  The lampshade and the robe and the hairstyle...  If you keep your eye on that you will know what is real and what isn't.But then the question is.. What does it all mean?  The Blue Box? The key? Silencio? The old Couple? The Thugs, No one can answer that (perhaps not even David Lynch) but one can only guess... and that is just part of the fun of this movie. There is no wrong answer but the symbolism is logical to a degree. (Think Pandora's box, the key is the key to Diane's release of her obsession, Silencio the calm before death, or death itself, The old couple her innocence lost..coming back to haunt her, The thugs are validating her belief that the director was bullied into choosing Camilla and had nothing to do with Diane's lack of talent or star quality) It stays with you long after you have left the cinema.  Like some vivid dreams they can baffle you as to their meaning but make you richer for having them... I was bowled over by Mulholland.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
