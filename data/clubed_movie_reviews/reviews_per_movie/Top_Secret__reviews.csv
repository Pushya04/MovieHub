Val Kilmer Steals the Movie,"In East Germany, the American rock and roll singer Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) meets Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) in a fancy restaurant. Hillary is a member from the resistance and her hope is to rescue her father, the scientist Dr. Paul Flammond (Michael Gough), who is imprisoned by the Germans to develop a powerful weapon. Nick is arrested and sent to prison for helping Hillary and he meets Dr. Flammond in his laboratory. Hillary helps him to escape during a show and when he tells that he has met Dr. Flammond in the prison to Hillary, they decide to seek out the resistance leader. When they meet him, they discover that Nigel (Christopher Villiers) was Hillary's first lover. Further, they learn that there is a traitor in the resistance. Who might be the traitor?""Top Secret"" is a very funny comedy by Jim Abrahams and David Zucker. The plot is a parody to World Was II movies with the French resistance and it is impossible not laughing along the adventures of Nick Rivers in the East Germany. Val Kilmer steals the movie wit ha magnificent performance and singing most of the songs. In the end, time is cruel to everyone. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Top Secret – Super Confidencial"" (""Top Secret – Super Confidential"")Note: On 24 Sep 2017, I saw this film again.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The best spoofs...,"are usually the ones with plots of their own.  This one is such a spoof and it is very funny.  You don't have to see any movies to find this funny either.  You just have to have seen parts of an Elvis movie over the years or saw a scene or two from an old espionage flick.  You don't have to watch an entire movie to get the jokes.  Val Kilmer is very funny here as is all the cast.  The jokes are great even with some of them being a bit dated. The resistance group is great, the escape, everything in here is really funny.  After ""Airplane"" this one ranks right up there with the best spoof movies made.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It doesn't get much sillier than this - and they even say so in song!,"An American rock and roll idol goes behind the iron curtain (while there was one!) for a culture fest but instead becomes involved in the resistance movement.Forget about the film itself, the very idea of an Elvis Presley movie being mixed with a French resistance film and produced by the Airplane! crew is enough for laugh number one. Not only is this a bizarre world but seems to be playing games with time and history, the communist East Germany being portrayed as a kind of war time Nazi set-up!Kilmer does well with an impossible role to the point where you wonder if he didn't miss his vocation. He can sing and dance better than many real singers and he proved in The Doors that he is really a major musical  force. Strangely it is rumoured that he didn't realise this was a satire!The stupidity of many Elvis movies and those Saturday morning children's reels (scientist and beautiful daughter) are taken to the cleaners and you have fantastic sight gags. The ""falling guard"" gag is one of the best sight gags in the history of movies - I challenge anyone not to laugh at it.I enjoy a stupid movie every now and then and admit I enjoyed this one. Clearly the authors know little about German history or  European culture and the little they do know seems cribbed from watching bad B movies on the subject, but what the hell. This is too stupid for anyone to get seriously uptight about. ""How silly can you get?"" sings Kilmer at one point in the film: Maybe a little, but not that much!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
an overlooked gem,"Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for ""Airplane"", ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"", and the ""Naked Gun"" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody!I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the ""Hotel Gay Schluffen"", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If ""Top Secret!"" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means ""She whose bosoms defy gravity""?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, ""Top Secret!"" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""What funny duck poop?""","Top Secret is one of the funniest, most off-the-wall movies ever filmed. Featuring a young Val Kilmer, I think Top Secret is the best of all spoof films (Spaceballs is a close second).  This thing spoofs everything, Beach Boy's songs, spy pictures, war movies, westerns, and even Elvis is not safe. It's ridiculous, outrageous, hilarious, and all in the name of good fun. The spit gag has to be my favorite bit.  You've seen it in countless movies: the hero is being verbally accosted by the villain and he spits in his face. This time, however, the hero is on the other side of the room.  Other memorable jokes include the skeet songs, the anal intruder, the ""cow"" scenes, and the backwards bit with Peter Cushing.  There are countless little things like that which make Top Secret a definite cult classic and a certifiable must-see.""Wish they all could be double barrel, wish they all could be double barrel guuuuuuuns.""",,Anonymous,Music
Comparable to great comedies like Airplane! and The Naked Gun.,"This movie truly is another great work from David Zucker and Jim Abrahams team. In some scenes you will laugh so hard that you have to pause the movie, laugh for five minutes then play it again. Also, Val Kilmer does a great acting for his first movie!This movie may not be the best comedy ever made but it still is among the top of its genre and a great movie to watch even and specially if you're not in a good mood.If you found ""Airplane!"" funny then watching this one is highly recommended. It has the same stupid and totally funny jokes and same sense of humor. It also is the best parody of WW2 spy movies. Rent or buy the DVD and enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the funniest movies of the 1980's,This is absolutely freaking hilarious. Val Kilmer does a bang up job as Nick Rivers in this one. I almost wish they would do a sequel now in 2022 after watching it again and I'm certain that Val Kilmer wouldn't mind.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
Batman meets Alfred!,"In his first leading role, Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an Elvis like pop star sent to Germany on a good will tour as a fill in for Leonard Bernstein. Once there he gets caught up in all sorts of misadventures that lead to him being a part of the French under ground resistance. Lucy Gutteridge is his German lover.An often overlooked - maybe even misunderstood - film from the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker team (who gave us ""Airplane!"") the film takes pot shots at ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", pintos, rock 'n roll, Nazis, and other various spy movies with more gags than you can shake a stick at. A hilarious romp of madness.Val himself is pretty funny here, managing to both wink and not wink at the camera as he is placed in a number of absurd situations. Also interesting of note is that this one features Michael Gough, who would later play Alfred in the Batman series, and Val himself would later play Batman.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
almost as good as Airplane!,"Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) is a big star of the gun-happy surfer culture with his smash hit Skeet Surfing. He goes to East Germany to play at a festival. He comes to help resistance member Hillary Flammond on the run. He is imprisoned and beaten. He manages to escape to a secret lab with Hillary's father Dr. Paul Flammond who is forced to develop a secret weapon against submarines.The team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker follow their highly successful Airplane! with this spoof of a Presley and spy movie. It has the same sense of irreverent fun. Val Kilmer is pretty good but there is nobody equivalent to Leslie Nielsen in this movie. Also going back to Elvis Presley from the 60s is not as immediate as the disaster movies that were still in the conversation of the day. Overall, it's a fun little film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Spoof movie done right.,"There was a time when spoof movies were funny. They relied on visual gags. They relied on jokes. They relied on ridiculous situations, funny characters and subverting expectations. In short, they relied on comedy to sell the product. Then filmmakers got lazy. Really lazy. Instead of carefully crafting a joke or scene they went for pop culture references that immediately date the movie and make it unwatchable a few years later. But during the 80's we had a series of gems of the genre and this is possibly one of the funniest.The story, if you can call it such, deals with a young man played by Val Kilmer who's the biggest rock star of his time. His big hit, ""Skeet Surfing"" where people take to the waves on their surfboards and try to hit their targets while wielding shotguns. Silly? Of course. That's what this movie is all about.His adventures take him to Europe where he fights against the East Germans, falls in love and Pac Man shows up in one scene for no readily explained reason. The jokes and sight gags come at you very fast sometimes in the foreground, often times in the background and everywhere else. One example is he goes to a fancy restaurant for dinner but they won't let him in without a jacket. So instead of pulling some musty old jacket out of the closet, they bring in a tailor to make him a tuxedo which is ready in five minutes so he can have dinner. Some of the jokes land, some don't but they're all played straight and no attention it called to them. It's as if nothing is out of the ordinary which makes it much funnier.This movie is in the style of classics such as Airplane, not whatever Selzter and Friedberg monstrosity has come out this year. It's funny. You should give it a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Lesser-Known Follow-Up to Airplane,"Parody of WWII spy movies in which an American rock and roll singer (Val Kilmer) becomes involved in a Resistance plot to rescue a scientist (Michael Gough) imprisoned in East Germany.The film features a very young, very skinny Val Kilmer (look at those tiny legs). And apparently he not only does his own singing, but was dating Cher at the time... what the heck? She is 13 years older than him... weird.The German jokes are great, knowing they are not real German. Sadly, I do not know Yiddish so I do not fully get the humor and had to read the translations online. I suspect for those who speak it the humor is more instant and the film is better.

A generally mediocre spoof with occasional flashes of brilliance.,"Jim Abrahams and David Zucker, the creators of Airplane!, bring more madcap humour to the big screen with Top Secret!, which stars Val Kilmer as rock and roll singer Nick Rivers, who becomes involved in a resistance plot to rescue a scientist being held captive in East Germany.Kilmer, in his debut, is surprisingly good, handling acting, comedy and singing duties with aplomb, proving without a doubt that he is a major star in the making; Kilmer is joined by a wonderful supporting cast which includes more established faces such as Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, Ian McNiece and Michael Gough.Unfortunately, as talented as the cast are, the scattershot humour is far too random and wildly inconsistent to be a total success: for every laugh-out-loud moment (my favourites: a very silly dance routine, the novelty dog poop gag, the brilliantly executed Swedish book store scene, and the singing horse), there are dozens of others that will fail to tickle the funny bone.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
very underrated,"The Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team, master of the rapid-fire humor and insane spoofs, strike again! This time with ""Top Secret!"", which is a very underrated movie that, in my humble opinion, is just as good as ""Airplane!"" (which of course is considered their best work).I don't understand it - what makes this film inferior to ""Airplane!""? There are just as many jokes, the jokes are just as good, the timing is as always perfect. Am I missing something? Is it just that ""Airplane!"" was bold in breaking barriers for spoof movies, setting a precedent that ""Top Secret!"" was just there to follow?That's not to diminish the quality of ""Airplane!"", which is one of my favorites. But what's wrong with ""Top Secret!""? Why only a 6.6 rating? It must be from those purists who don't understand movies like this, and don't like this movie because the plot is not as well-developed as the plot of ""Airplane!"" Don't get me wrong - ordinarily a more developed plot only makes a movie funnier, but in the case of a spoof like this, the plot isn't important (it has often been said that the plot is just a ""clothesline"" for the jokes in such movies). Those purists completely miss the point of this movie.Watch this movie unless you're one of those blasted aforementioned purists. If that is the case, go watch ""The Philadelphia Story"" for the thousandth time.",,Anonymous,Music
more than good,"One of the best comedy movies I have ever seen. Almost every scene contain joke or preparing for joke. Unexpected jokes suddenly appear.

Keep rockin' and rollin' as long as actors can get elected president!,"Knowing that ""Top Secret!"" comes from the guys who gave us ""Airplane!"" and the ""Naked Gun"" movies, I shouldn't have to really explain it. The plot has rock 'n' roll star Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) getting sent to East Germany to rescue a scientist (Michael Gough). Of course in reality, the movie's an excuse for a gag every minute. Making fun of both the American and Soviet spheres of influence, this flick pulls no punches. I suspect that you'll really like the scene where Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) and Nick explain their names to each other, and then where they introduce the resistance fighters. All in all, a wonderfully goofy romp. As a side note, Val Kilmer and Michael Gough later co-starred in ""Batman Forever"", although Jim Carrey stole the show in that one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
ZAZ Blitzkrieg-humor,"In between their most successful films  Airplane, Naked Gun and Hot Shots  the ZAZ team modestly spoofed the espionage and conspiracy theory thrillers in Top Secret! The film involves American teen idol Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer in his first big screen role) attending a culture festival in Nazified East Germany. The festival merely is a cover-up for the sinister and evil practices of the Nazis who kidnapped an eminent scientist. Nick quickly interferes in all this and ends up as member of a resistance-party, existing of French dudes with funny-sounding names and weird comical habits (like drinking gasoline) . Remaining loyal to the ZAZ trademarks, 'Top Secret!' is one giant running gag and a spitfire of chuckles in which absolutely NOTHING has to be taken seriously. The European-minded character of this film provided the writers with the occasion to make fun of the typical French, German and Swedish stereotypes and that forms a perfect contrast with the American surf-generation. As usual in this type of films, the widely elaborated jokes miss their target (sometimes they even are painfully unfunny) but the smaller background slapstick is hilarious and almost causes you a stomach pain from laughing. The open assaults to immensely successful cinema classics like 'the Great Escape', 'Wizard of Oz' or 'The Blue Lagoon' is something you either love or hate, but it perfectly reflects the type of over-the-top humor these writers want to bring. Val Kilmer does well in his first major role and his youthful charm helps increasing his teen-popstar credibility. Furthermore, there are a few delightful small roles for authentic cinema veterans such as Omar Shariff, Michael Gough and my personal favorite Peter Cushing. Top Secret isn't Abraham's and the Zucker brother's best work, but it's still great entertainment and the quality balances somewhere between 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' and 'Airplane'.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

How silly can you get?,"""Top Secret!"" is a comedy that parodies spy films from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team that created ""Airplane!"" (1980) and later the ""Naked Gun"" films. The story follows the exploits of Nick Rivers, played by Val Kilmer, as he gets tangled in a plot in East Germany. Strangely and amusingly enough, though, East Germany's officials deliberately resemble Nazis.Val Kilmer does well with the humor and musical numbers in the lead. Lucy Gutteridge is also appropriate as Nick's love interest. The resistance members and East German/Nazi officers were all well-cast as well. There are some brief but nice appearances from Omar Sharif and Peter Cushing.The film has a number of funny moments, such as the singing of the East German anthem or Nick's air duct escape. I also enjoyed the musical numbers, particularly ""How silly can you get?"" However, I didn't find this film to be as consistently funny as ""Airplane!"" or the ""Naked Gun"". ""Top Secret!"" effectively mocks spy films, but isn't as amusing as other films from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious From A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker ...,"Following the popular success of ""Airplane!"" and its less acclaimed sequel, the ZAZ trio was back to what I believe to be the funniest comedy ever: ""Top Secret!"" a hilarious parody of the WWII spy films and the 50-60's rock-themed movies. Speaking of rock'n'roll, one of the most defining songs of the film performed by Val Kilmer aka Nick Rivers is titled ""How Silly Can you Get?"" which sounds like a self-reflexive motto.""Top Secret!"" probably features the highest laughs-out-loud-per-minute ratio from any movie, as there is not one single moment where the action isn't punctuated by a gag, and that this very gag doesn't work. Everything in ""Top Secret!"" is both hilarious on an anarchic and cathartic level in the way it plunges you into a never-ending positive mindset. You may say that this is the very principle of a comedy, what's more a spoof movie, but it seems like ""Top Secret!"" has been specially concocted for pure and genuine amusement, and while the much more respected ""Airplane!"" has its slower moments, especially during the flash-back parts, ""Top Secret!"" was hilarious from A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker brothers.There are two kinds of gags in ""Top Secret!"", the direct and the indirect one. The direct is immediate, mostly visual and slapstick, like a ""find him and kill him"" stamp or a sunbathing girl leaving boob-holes in the sand. The best gags are extended and feature a lot of dancing like the ball scene, the outrageous ballet sequence or a feet-view panic scene. Anyway, whether it's an offensive national anthem, a singing horse, a little German, an over-hilarious moment when Nick is about to be executed and an old lady slowly approaches to pick up the phone, any attempt to list the audio-visual gags of the film is as ludicrous as trying to define which is the funniest. The indirect gag is the elaborated one, already funny by itself but leading to a much more delightful punch-line.The first one involves a weird shot illustrating the road taken by Nick Rivers and his manager, the map looks more and more familiar until Pac-Man makes his appearance, the very gag that sets the tone of the film. When Omar Sharif as Agent Cedric meets a colleague disguised as a party tricks vendor, the whole interaction is funny enough but the icing on the cake comes with the ""You dropped your phony dog pooh"", an item which obviously is not sold. The gag works even more because we expect it, like when Nick is introduced to the French Resistance, what would you expect from a man named ""Déjà Vu"" apart from ""Have we not met before?"" It could have concluded here yet the French sounding names punch-line was with the black guy named 'Chocolate Mousse"", which says a lot about an era where anything was acceptable in the name of pure comedy.I don't mean to be too analytical, but my regard for ""Top Secret!"" is due to one of the two funniest and creative gags from any film, starting with the Swedish bookstore sequence, a cinematic achievement that would have made Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin proud. During that part, there is a gradual suspicion that we're not watching a normal scene, even for a spoof movie, there is something weird in the walking and the talking that gets funnier as it is more noticeable, the scene becomes hilarious when we get the point and yet it goes on and on, a book getting in the right place immediately, dust from ear to mouth, and finally Nick and Hillary 'sliding up' a pole. The sequence goes from funny to not funny anymore until it becomes funny again with the throw away gag of the puppy going backwards leaving the Swedish bookstore owner in a priceless doubted expression.The other and maybe more memorable one, as it made it in the poster involves a clever cow disguise that looks like a real cow from our point of view, it's simple but someone should have thought about that. Now, it became a comedic landmark used in many comedies when a guy disguise as an animal, inopportunely choosing the female one, and invites a male on heat to come on him, but back then it was new that even pushed the outrageousness by involving a little veal thirsty for milk, the villain's reaction (in the disguise) is a laugh-riot. That's the secret of ""Top Secret!"", a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously except for its genuine desire to make us laugh. The rest of the gags are as good as it gets, and features many fourth-wall breaking, like when Nick and Hillary feels that the romance ""makes it's like a bad movie"" and then they look at us, and many film references are made, notably one hilarious climax in a sub-aquatic Western bar, and a clever farewell a la ""Wizard of Oz"".""Top Secret!"" is made in such a way, that we either enjoy a gag or wait for one to come, so there's no time break. The only little pauses are provided by these moments when we can enjoy Val Kilmer's musical performances but the humor is never away. But my enjoyment of the film is proportional to my sadness to see it so often overlooked by the peers and movie viewers, playing on anagrams, I want to say that ""TOP SECRET!"" is a comedy ""TO RESPECT!"". Indeed, when I checked the list of AFI's Top 100 Laughs, I was surprised not to see ""Top Secret!"" listed while ""Fargo"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" and less 'lol'ling comedies were, I'm even surprised that the film is hardly mentioned among the greatest parodies or that it didn't have any nominations for the Golden Globes.Seriously, I can't see, regarding ""Top Secret!"", how funnier can a movie get.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Delightfully Silly...,"If you try and ignore this ""Spy"" offering from the Airplane team, you won't last long. When it's on your TV screen there'll soon be something so outrageously daft that you have to at least stare in dismay and amazement.Yes, it's a pity it hasn't got Leslie Nielsen at the helm but the young Elvis-sort of looking Val Kilmer is good, but not brilliant. It's just not in the class of the best Abrahams and Zucker's, especially the fore- mentioned Airplane, hence my four stars.Sent off to cold-war East Germany and playing rock'n'roll to an audience not yet immersed in such, at a concert that aims to unite west and east Berlin, Nick Rivers (Kilmer) encounters an array of mishaps, from the outset. Naturally, the opposite sort of happens and I'd like to say that plot details are fairly useless here and they're pointless in a script where gag after gag is out for laughs, most of them hitting some spot, or another. There's Omar Sharif as you've never seen, or ever thought you'd see him and a turn from Peter Cushing, too.Venturing into a parody of WWII films, including The Great Escape, it ends up with a herd of cows wearing wellington boots...What happens between is fast and funny and whilst Top Secret isn't the funniest thing you'll see, it's good and worthy of including in the 'ones to see'.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Sheet Shootin' is a catchy tune,"The opening song which combines Beach Boys music with the subject of Skeet Shooting is worth the price of the movie and prepares you for the joyful insanity that will follow.  Kilmer is at his second best, after The Doors, with an Elvis Presley and Spy-Movie spoof.  This range of subject matter may account for the relatively low box office.

Cold war comedy that shows what satire begs to be written about the New World Order,"This brand of comedy isn't for everybody - my wife who grew up after the Cold War and the heyday of ZAZ movies thinks it's stupid - but watching it again after 25 years, I was still laughing the whole way through.Now imagine if that same over-the-top silliness directed then at East Germany in this film was directed today at China, the Middle East and their hard-and-fast Big Oil and Silicon Valley business partners here in the West; back then leading up to WWII, you had Thomas Watson's IBM furnishing the Fuhrer with the punch card technology used to efficiently process the prisoners through the death camps and Alfred P. Sloan's General Motors furnishing the Fuhrer with the Blitz trucks used in the Blitzkrieg, as Edwin Black has written about. Today, you have Google and other American tech giants helping China perfect its Social Credit Score and facial recognition systems to make its surveillance state all the more oppressive, while meanwhile, American retirement fund money is finding its way into investments in the same Chinese companies manufacturing the ICBM's that China is pointing at American cities. (Go read the October 2019 issue of Hillsdale College's Imprimis entitled ""Why and How the U.S. Should Stop Financing China's Bad Actors"".) Why not take the same kind of jabs at Silicon Valley tech giants the same way ZAZ did with Ford with the exploding Pinto gag in the film?Meanwhile, in the Middle East, you have reports coming out about how the government misled the American public about the failed 18-year Afghanistan War campaign on the same scope and level they did with Vietnam while Big Oil grew richer and richer by the day. (Go read ""The Afghanistan papers: a secret history of the war"" published by the Washington Post.) that commenced, of course, after 9/11 (which 3,000 professionals over at Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth have staked their professional reputations on asserting that the WTC collapse was a controlled demolition using remotely-activated explosive charges planted inside the buildings) which was ostensibly masterminded in a cave in Afghanistan by fromer CIA director and president George H.W. Bush's old 1970's ""Arbusto Energy"" business partner, Salem bin Laden's half-brother, Osama bin Laden.... Uh-huh.Can you imagine if Abrahams and the Zucker brothers weren't hamstrung by political correctness and the fear of offending the Chinese and the Saudis (not to mention Silicon Valley and Wall Street) and felt as free to take the same jabs at those entities as they were with the East Germans?As author Dorothy Sayers who translated ""The Inferno"" has pointed out, back in his day, Dante took a lot of heat (pun intended) for populating the various levels of hell with real-life celebrity characters in Italian public life and politics whose foibles and misdeeds were well-known in his day and, in the process, created a piece of satire that has stood the test of time for 7 centuries.The foibles and misdeeds of the 21st-century New World Order similarly beg to satirized as unforgivingly by the Zucker bros. or somebody - perhaps with the same over-the-top absurdity - in as worthy a work of satire as East Germany was in this film. If you can't change the existing order of things, at least you can take a good jab at it. Humanity needs that - as both Dante and the Zucker bros. enduring satire has proven.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Zany fun,"A film that tickled me from one of its opening gags, an officer rubber stamping an order to ""Find him and kill him,"" all the way to its end. There are lots of clever little things going on in the background of scenes and in the script's wordplay, which make it a fun watch. The film goes for outrageous humor, ala the Anal Intruder, as well as sophisticated filmmaking in the scene in the Swedish bookstore, shot backwards. Val Kilmer (age 25, looks 17) is great in his musical performances which channel Elvis, showing off a lot of style while keeping it funny. The humor comes in a steady stream and it's fun to pick up on - you may also notice additional things on a re-watch. It pushes boundaries at times and it also weirdly conflates East Germany with Nazi Germany, something that I wondered how Germans might feel about. All in all, an entertaining, zany film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Marvelous film.,"This movie is the mother of movie parodies. It is not the first but it is the one that establishes the guidelines by which all the great comedies have been made in the last forty years. This requires a superlative cast (Val Kilmer splendid and a series of exquisite supporting roles such as Omar Shariff, Peter Cushing and others), a story that serves to present the highest possible concentration of jokes per second and the revolutionary desire of its directors and producers to make history. To become a legend does not require a huge production but to have a novel story and the ability to present it in an unusual way. This movie is a delight and can be watched over and over again as a lesson in filmmaking. It is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Kilmer in top form but not as funny as Airplane!,"Nick - Val Kilmer - is an American rock n roll star like Elvis. He is invited to perform in East Germany in the early 80s when Leonard Bernstein can't make it. But, unknown is that the multistar concert is a diversion from a planned attack by the Easties with a new weapon elsewhere. When Nick arrives, he saves a girl at a restaurant from thugs. She is the daughter of a kidnapped scientist who was forced to build the weapon. Soon, Nick is dragged into an underground plot to rescue the scientist and stop the weapon. FCan it be done? Kilmer, in his film debut, is a doll and very funny. His twisted Elvis and Beach boys songs are hilarious. However, the film is only mildly successful and not as amusing or cohesive as the Zuckers/Abrahams Airplane or Naked Gun. Even so, it's hard to see someone not laughing at any viewing. So, find it and giggle it up.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

It all sounds like some bad movie. And it is.,"Spoof movies, which parody some existing film or genre, have a long history (several of the British ""Carry On"" series fall into this category), but they were particularly popular in the seventies and eighties, the period which saw some of Mel Brooks' finest work such as ""Blazing Saddles"" (which parodies the Western) and ""High Anxiety"" (the films of Alfred Hitchcock) as well as the likes of ""Naked Gun"" (cop thrillers), ""Airplane!"" (disaster movies) and ""The Big Bus"" (ditto).""Top Secret!"" is another film of this type. It tells the story of Nick Rivers, an American rock star who travels to East Germany to perform at a cultural festival but while there becomes involved in espionage and in a plot by the East German regime to sink the entire NATO fleet. He meets the beautiful Hillary Flammond and helps her to rescue her father, a brilliant scientist being held by the regime and forced against his will to build the deadly mine which will be used in the attack. We are informed that the name Hillary is German for ""She Whose Bosoms Defy Gravity"", a piece of information of dubious veracity but one that seems appropriate to the striking Lucy Gutteridge. (Less so, perhaps, to America's current Secretary of State).In their efforts Nick and Hillary have the assistance of the French Resistance. (You can tell they are French because of their accents and because they all have names like ""Déjà Vu"", ""Escargot"" and ""Chocolate Mousse""). Now anyone with even a token knowledge of history might ask what the French Resistance are doing in 1980s East Germany (a country apparently still ruled by the Nazis), but this is one of those films which are made both by and for those whose knowledge of European history, geography, culture and politics is somewhat less than token. (In other words for about 90% of the US market). I could fill my entire review with a list of goofs (about the only thing they get right is the distinctly unfeminine looks of the East German women's athletics squad), but there would be little point as the film-makers are clearly not aiming for an accurate portrayal of life in the German Democratic Republic, any more than Mel Brooks intended ""Blazing Saddles"" to be a true-to-life picture of the Old West. Spoof movies are not generally the place to go if you are looking for factual accuracy.Spoof movies are, however, normally regarded as one of the places to go to if you are looking for laughs, and this is unfortunately a department in which ""Top Secret"" is sadly lacking. It is a parody that never knows what it is supposed to be parodying. It starts off as an obvious parody of spy films, both of the James Bond type as well as of more serious offerings such as ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", but with the introduction of the Resistance it turns into a spoof of war films, especially those set in Nazi-occupied Europe. (There are obvious references to ""Casablanca"" and the motorcycle scene from ""The Great Escape""). The fact that Nick is a rock star also allows the film-makers to aim at Elvis films and sixties beach movies (surely a rather outdated target by 1984). Bizarrely, at one point it even turns into a satire on the Brooke Shields version of ""The Blue Lagoon"", a film so bad as to be beyond parody, and ends with a blatant reference to ""The Wizard of Oz"".One of the faults of ""The Big Bus"" was its scattergun approach, aiming at too many targets and missing most of them, but ""Top Secret"" is even worse; it aims at even more targets and misses all of them. There are some occasionally funny visual gags, but most of the jokes are either feeble, corny or tasteless. (Man being raped by a bull, Nick's manager and his ""anal intruder""). To describe the plot as ""nonsense"" would be to credit it with more coherence than it actually possesses.There is one memorable line. At one point, after recounting her highly improbable life history to Nick, Hillary says, ""It all sounds like some bad movie"". You said it, girl, you said it. I couldn't have put it better myself. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Wacky and surrealist comedy with uncountable gags and well starred by Val Kilmer as Elvis-like rock star,"A classic of the genre, it is a likably silly comedy from the writing-directing team that brought other big hits , and still one of the funniest movies ever made . This is a wonderful timeless spoof that will appeal to wild and unruly humor fans . Stars Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) , he's the main role , he's a rock'n' roll star who visits East Germany and becomes embroiled in espionage world with Nazis as bad guys . There he falls in love with a French resistance fighter , Hilary (Lucy Gutteridge) , and becomes involved with peculiar allies (Christopher Villiers , Jim Carter, Eddie Tagoe..) in the plot to free her scientist dad (Michael Gough) . Movie? What movie?. Shhh! Don't tell anyone. From the makers of the original ""Airplane!"" (not the Wright brothers)Nutty and absurd comedy with numberless gags by the makers of Airplane ! . This picture makes up for its flimsy plot with one gag after another . Written/directed by Jim Abrahams , Jerry Zucker and his brother David Zucker (ZAZ) , they are American satirists and writers with successful works along and long time collaborators among them , they made their own comedy troupe , ¨Kentucky Fried theatre¨. ¨Top Secret¨ remains commercially as their exceptional hit smash with the exception for ¨Airport!¨ and ¨Jerry Zucker's Ghost¨ . Stars val Kilmer who gives a smpathetic acting as Nick Rivers , the young American rock star who goes to Europe on goodwill tour and becomes involved with Nazis, the French Resistance , an American refugee and more . The musical score features lots of lively and old Beach Boys and Elvis Presley tunes . Rated ¨Parents Guide¨ for some profanity and sexually oriented sketches . In the film appears the habitual quirky and lunatic roles usually played by notorious secondaries , such as : Jeremy Kemp , Warren Clarke , Billy Mitchell , Christopher Villiers , Peter Cushing , Jim Carter , Michael Gough , Ian McNeice, among others . And Omar Sharif makes a cameo as an abused spy .The film was realized by the Kentucky group , the ironic humor is originated in the American surrealist comedy since ¨Hellzapoppin¨ (by H. C. Potter) , Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields , and being based on the absurd , the lunatic and wacky comedy , and , of course , the extreme parody or spoof movie . The picture is naughty at times , but it's also intelligent and audacious . There's one comic gag each ten seconds . An unsothisphicated but very amusing film that will appeal to absurd lovers and including several cinematic references . Rating : 6.5/10. Well worth watching .",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The secret is out,"Top Secret! is a very funny movie that mixes Elvis style singing with a Nazi backdrop and some spoofs of famous films of the past. Blue Lagoon and Cloak and Dagger and The Dirty Dozen to name a few. 
Val looks young and great in this 1984 film.His dancing and sing are excellent. The jokes never stop coming at you with a brilliant cast and top notch directing. This is on a par with Airplane!, Naked Gun and Hot Shots! It would be a good choice for movie night for almost any age group.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Hilariously stupid, stupidly hilarious","I'd seen parts of this movie years ago and decided to rewatch it. It's great. Probably one of my favourite comedies now.This movie is a reminder of the dynamic between stupid and genius - that fine line we learn about in This Is Spinal Tap. In comedy, stupid and genius often overlap heavily. Good comedy tends to be weird, crazy, stupidly obvious, but also clever, creative and unexpected.The gag might be simple, but choosing to do something so stupid and committing to it is another story. Top Secret! Has some of the most gloriously dumb but also laugh-out-loud hilarious sequences I've ever scene. My stomach was hurting and I was still bursting out laughing more.I think it works for several key reasons. One is that the actors are all taking it very seriously. If this is a wacky, immature comedy, nobody seems to realise it. Nobodies playing for laughs, they think this is a real Bond or Elvis movie and that makes every joke so much more effective. Seeing moronic events but with complete sincerity.Along the same lines is the commitment the filmmakers show to every joke, no matter how stupid. Even if it makes no sense, even if it feels too obvious, too silly, they go for it. Even if that then requires building large props or underwater sets or other expensive processes, they commit to each joke. It makes it funnier to me how much effort went into such juvenile ideas.In a sense, they're wasting our time, but that's part of what I find hilarious about it. Like, ""yes, this is obviously so fake that even a 5-year-old would realise, but we're gonna do it anyway and pretend that it makes sense"".Val Kilmer is likeable in the main role as are most of the supporting cast. The only major weakness is the anticlimactic ending. Ironically, I was more drawn into Top Secret! Than most straight, serious movies.I think I realised something about movies - it's not how ""real"" they are, it's how well-crafted they are, how much time and effort went into them and how much respect for the audience. That's what determines how much you care.You can tell that a lot of effort went into Top Secret!. The directors clearly like their jokes. They're proud of them. They put a lot in. They've seen a lot of movies and know how to play with our expectations. They're not afraid of obvious jokes as long as they fit and are well executed. For example, the guy called Deja Vu who seems... vaguely familiar.So by the end, I really wanted them to blow up the bad guys, I wanted a big finale. But alas, it kind of abruptly stops. Yes, it's hilarious, but too sudden and underwhelming. I wanted some big explosions, crazy death scenes, an over-the-top happy ending, etc. Then it would have been a 10.But as it is, this is one of the best spoof movies ever made. No, it's not ""intelligent"" in the conventional sense. But it does show a lot of insight and creativity. Consider the scene filmed in reverse - most of the time it's hard to tell. That's not easy to pull off and it creates some great visual effects, reminding me of Tenet.It's this casual mixing of genius and stupid which endears Top Secret! And similar movies like the Naked Gun series to me. They embrace dumb ideas as if they're brilliant. Almost every joke landed for me and hence, I can forgive the weaknesses - I'm too busy laughing at the last joke to care. And there's enough normal plot to enjoy this as a normal movie, albeit a silly one. There's a bit of action and romance in between the laughs, but mostly just a tonne of laughs.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Torn Curtain on steroids,"I just saw this movie for the first time in the original English version, and it's silly, but VERY entertaining fun.Indeed, from ""There's Sauerkraut in my Lederhosen"" to the moving train station to Dèja Vu (""Haven't we met before?"") to Rivers placing his head into a gas oven (an overt parody of the murder scene in ""Torn Curtain"", I think) to the Blue Lagoon spoof, this has to be counted as a classic.It may not reach the heights of some French film comedies (like ""Oscar"" or ""The Great Blonde""), but it's a very well done parody in its own right.Some personal remarks: My appreciation for Val Kilmer has grown immensely after watching this film; this fellow is a gifted dancer and an achieved singer. --- Jeremy Kemp playing Major Streck has such a sweet German accent I couldn't believe he's an Englishman. --- Has anyone noticed that the heroine lodges in hotel room # 409 - hardly a surprise after the Beach Boys-parody intro? --- I may be wrong, but one of the East German Olympic team's women in the honorary ceremony at the beginning of the film looks suspiciously like Sylvester Stallone --- I was pleasantly surprised by the liberal use of Yiddish in the English original. That was phased out in the German dubbing; apparently this was still a no-no twenty years ago. Thank God this has changed in the meantime. Still, it made me angry and sad that the crazy Nazi barbarians succeeded in eradicating this rich culture from our midst.The latter notwithstanding, this film gave me a very good time, indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

No 'Airplane!' but still fun,"'Top Secret' is one of the comedies from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker. During the years they have brought the wonderful 'Airplane!', the very funny 'Naked Gun'-series, two 'Hot Shots!'-movies, 'Jane Austen's Mafia!' and 'Rat Race'. This movie belongs in that list of very funny movies. It is not as good as 'Airplane!' or the first 'Naked Gun' but it comes close.Val Kilmer is Nick Rivers, an American rock n' roll singer, who comes to East-Germany. To tell you the truth I can't remember really why he did that, but of course that doesn't matter very much. In East-Germany he meets Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge). Her father is imprisoned by the East-German regime and Nick wants to help Hillary to find him back. The movie is not really about the plot but to tell more would reveal some very funny surprises.A lot of movie references will pas during the movie, the most obvious are probably from 'The Blue Lagoon' and all the Elvis Presley musicals. It is a little hard to explain the movie but consider a scene where Nick and Lucy want to hide. They pass a closet that says ""Janitor"", you see them in almost every building. They open the closet and behind the door we see the actual janitor in a very small space. They close the door and enter a room that says ""props"". In the room we see actual props. There are many of those scene and most of them work. I had a good time watching this.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the very best,"All I can say to those who didn't like this movie is ""are you sure you have a sense of humour""? This is a send up second to none, the gags come thick and fast and even though I am a very ardent Elvis fan even I found the parody of Are You Lonesome Tonight absolute brilliance. I saw it when it had it's cinema release way back in the 80s and the whole place was rocking, the songs are first class and the fact that Val actually sings them is ace (I never knew he could sing). There are loads of visual jokes as well as slapstick and ridiculous flights of fancy. My favourite comedy to dig out of my DVD collection on a miserable rainy day , it's guaranteed to bring a smile even after the dozens of times I've already seen itTo Sum up BLOODY GOOD FUN !",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A parody of espionage films from the '40s, it's Val Kilmer's first movie...","There are lots of laughs in this film from the Zuckers who know how to create visual gags that are even funnier if you know what film is being spoofed. The main plot (if there is one) seems to be based on a certain Hedy Lamarr film called THE CONSPIRATORS with she and Paul Henried trying to escape the Nazis during WWII's Lisbon.Homage to a lot of other Hollywood films are scattered throughout. Fast-moving and fun loose, it's one of those films where you're waiting to see what the next gag will be.Everyone plays their roles with a straight poker face, particularly VAL KILMER in the lead as Nick Rivers, a rip-off of Elvis Presley. He doesn't show any particular flair for comedy except when he goes into his Elvis act. Then the wooden expression vanishes and he's limber enough to give the impression that he can sing and dance with the best of them.JEREMY KEMP does his best to look sinister as a Nazi officer and LUCY GUTTERIDGE is the pretty wide-eyed miss who gets Kilmer involved in a messy espionage situation. All of it is played for laughs and there are plenty of those, but I suspect this will appeal more to anyone who has experienced all the movies being parodied--even, for one fleeting moment, ""The Wizard of Oz."" Summing up: Some uneven moments but generally an enjoyable romp. Kilmer went on to better, more serious roles for the rest of his career.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not Funny,"First off, I'm a big fan of ZAZ movies: Airplane, Kentucky Fried Movie - bring it on.However,this just doesn't work. For a parody to work it has to be attempting to be serious; the humour comes from the dead pan looks and the total lack by the actors of realising that there is anything funny going on.In this movie the characters appear to be saying 'Look how silly and funny we are' It kills the humour for me.I'm off to watch the Naked Gun films for the hundredth time and get some real laughs.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
No Airplane or Naked Gun,"The first movie for Val Kilmer, and the first Top something movie with Val Kilmer, who is one of the few good things, if best thing about this. We know what to expect from Zucker films- truckloads of laughs delivered in constant. Sadly this one fails continuously, with gags just falling flat on their face, some including 'over my head' dialogue. I will actually say VK is the best thing about this, a spoof on Nazi Germany, where VK plays a music heartthrob named Nick Rivers (cool name) He's part of an oblivious distraction, involving scary, ugly sneering bad Nazi guys, Kilmer doesn't like much, and they like him a lot less. Unwittingly, he becomes involved with a the hot German daughter of a kidnapped father (the great Michael 'Horror Hospital' Gough) who being used for Nazi experiments. Kilmer is great and can bloody sing too. He's sadly not given much to work with here. On the good side Top Secret does have some great gags, and provides other titters, but they're far successful and few successful in between, and the movie really tries damned hard. I've never got the song 'How Silly Can You Get', out of my head since I first saw this in 85', and Kilmer makes a grand show off it, in a movie, that sadly isn't one. The big two boob hole shapes in the sand, is something else I'll always remember, and the cow scene is priceless.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I love it!,"One of the funniest movies of all time. Although it's so silly (""How silly can you get"") it's beyond silly, that is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It doesn't take long to get that this movie is all about the gags. Either you accept it and laugh your head off, or you turn it off.Val Kilmer is perfect for the role that is not a role or a character at all - he's just hanging on for the ride of the Zuckers and is oblivious to it all. And that's what makes the movie (beyond the fantastic gags), because all the characters find the things that happens very real. Forget about Scary Movie or whatever stupid movie there is out there. This is THE silly movie of all time. It's better than Airplane!, the Hot Shots movies and the Naked Gund-movies. This is the movie that frees itself from every rule and setting and just play all the jokes it can master.Yes, it's a parody of both Elvis-movies, war movies and spy movies, but at its core there's just true comedy with only one rule: There is no rules.

Years later, I finally watched this one in English. Yeah, much of fun is still there and cameo by Omar Shariff is excellent, but still, some of the older magic is gone. Some gags ran stale, some jokes look vapid, some routine seems banal and not good even for a parody spoof film. The ZAZ team did a fine job. Yeah, some films lose charm, some stay the test of time.

"Dumb, ridiculous, unfunny","I am probably suspicious to say anything about this film, since that i really dislike the parody genre, but frankly that one is awful even for that genre. Jesus. It's so dull and repetitive that almost walked out. I mean, obviously there was a gag or two that inevitably made me laugh, specifically the cows scene, but apart of that scene, the rest is garbage. The story is totally disjointed and confuse, even for a spoof film. Some of the references are not funny at all, and i am familiar with the WW2 'spy' sub-genre. Val Kilmer's debut couldn't be any worse. He tries to be funny, but his acting limitations were evident here. Being funny is not something easy, anyways. Omar Sharif was, despite his relatively short screen-time, in the most dumbest and ridiculous gags in the film. I didn't want to believe that the guy who played the protagonist so masterfully in Dr. Zhivago was in that dumb film.

Well the Zaz guys were never big on plot, if you've seen the type of film they are spoofing you should be well aware of the conventions, which is maybe why this film is as little remembered as it's peers, it's attempting to spoof multiple ""genres"" at once.I've never really seen any of the old Elvis musicals, so a lot of the humor in the musical moments falls flat, and confuses, when your waiting for more spy and espionage gags.Not quite as good as their other more well known films, but good viewing for those interested in the mile a minute, absurdist visual gags and slapstick and vernacular jokes that only these guys could do, after Woody Allen and Mel Brooks the comic torch for the 80's passed through the hands of the trio Zaz, where it continued on past Kevin Smith and the Wayans to Judd Apatow and co, and beyond.Oh and it was funny too.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

There was so many stupid jokes, there was just no seriousness in this film, so just when I get used to it, it was really funny. I think that they used 500 jokes in this movie, or maybe more.

Hilarious big-screen follow-up to Airplane!,"During this period, Zucker-Zucker-Abrahams were on a creative roll, even if not always financially successful. Airplane! Was a huge hit, but they followed it with Police Squad!, which was arguably even stronger than Airplane! As a whole, but cancelled after just 6 episodes for what is probably the stupidest reason ever given by a broadcasting company for canceling something. They then followed Police Squad! With their most ambitious offering, Top Secret!The humor isn't quite as sharp, consistent and relentless as Airplane! Or Police Squad!, but it's pretty darn close. The ZZA team were still in a creative ""zone"" here, and you have some truly inspired gags, such as an underwater fight scene that spoofs western brawls, a subplot which works partly as a farcical sequel to the cult classic Blue Lagoon, and a Frenchman who speaks English in a ridiculously over-the-top accent. As usual for ZZA, there are plenty of visual jokes to catch in the background and non-sequiturs in the dialogue, so the viewer needs to pay attention.Using a hefty budget compared to their previous work, ZZA doubled down on the ambition and scope too. Instead of just a police procedural or intentionally cheap airplane effects, Top Secret! Takes us to the large battleground of occupied France and is filled with exaggerated action sequences and musical numbers. Clearly this was a much more elaborate production than Airplane! And Police Squad! Val Kilmer stars as a walking, singing, dancing parody of early rock'n'roll icons such as Elvis and the Beach Boys, as he becomes unwittingly embroiled in a war adventure featuring the French Resistance in Germany and other secret agents. Don't ask why a '60s-era rock star is fighting in World War 2 Europe. Nothing is really supposed to make sense, so just go along for the ride. Lucy Gutteridge (who is pretty much unknown now after retiring from acting in 1993; this will remain her biggest legacy) plays the romantic interest, a Resistance member torn between her former lover who now leads the fight against Germany, and Nick Rivers (Kilmer), in a parody of Casablanca's love triangle.Kilmer is not known as a funny man, and is sort of like Leslie Nielsen before him. He is tasked with basically being the straight man in the middle of all the chaos. He is such an over-the-top Elvis parody that Kilmer does show off an impressive knack for comedy, but mainly he's suave and charming and somewhat ""normal,"" while the characters around him, and the situations he gets himself into, are the main sources of humor throughout.The legendary Omar Sharif (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago) has an amusing and memorable role here as a secret agent who becomes comically disfigured, but after a few short scenes, he disappears from the movie. Why?? Wish he would've returned, at least towards the end. More Sharif is never a bad thing.If you're a fan of Airplane!, Police Squad!, Naked Gun and Hot Shots, then definitely don't skip this.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Silly... and hilarious!,"Silly... and hilarious! Campy, nonsense and dark humor comedy at once, this movie is a cold war spoof, but a very anachronistic on. It mocks all clichés and portrays a caricature of both Germany (it also merges East Germany and Nazi Germany as if they were the same, and the French resistance opposes it!) and rock n' roll movies.

It's no secret: there are more than a few laughs to be had.,"Of course, there are some problematic moments in 'Top Secret! (1984)'. This is almost, but not quite, inevitable when when looking back on a comedy from the 1980s. Here, the odd joke doesn't just fall flat, it gives off slightly uncomfortable vibes. Yet, this isn't an issue as persistent or as pertinent as you might expect and the picture is, on the whole, a generally good-humoured and frequently funny spoof of both the WWII spy genre and the Elvis movie. What's so sorely missed in 'parodies' of today is a plot because, no matter how basic it may be (whether this, in and of itself, is part of the satire or otherwise), a narrative means that the movie can be watched independently of the thing it mocks, rising to become a comedy picture in its own right that's essentially just as funny for those unaware of the thing it takes aim at (though it is, of course, all the more successful for those who are). It's just this that allows this piece to be a silly, somewhat low-rent but undeniably humorous satire that feels as though laughs are its top priority but a story is its second. Look, I'm not claiming it's a masterpiece, but I chuckled more than a few times and was always entertained. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Airplane on Acid,"Nonstop humor with a real plot is called funny... without a plot, silly... and the creators of the extremely funny AIRPLANE deliberately set out to make a fast-paced, extremely silly satire covering a bagful of genres...Particularly WW2 spy thrillers with Elvis Musicals thrown in... in the form of Val Kilmer's Nick Rivers, a somehow contemporary Rock N' Roller booked to play a Nazi German concert that sort of comes and goes...Meanwhile the actual attempt at a primary plot involves ingenue Lucy Gutteridge's scientist father needing rescue by the help of a goofy band of French Resistance fighters, only around to finish off a busy, somewhat exhausting story that the jokes leading up served a consistent bulwark for...They're mostly action-based visual gags since this IS an action/adventure, albeit more like Mel Brooks (parodying movie-making itself) than Abrahams, Zucker & Zucker's previous (POLICE SQUAD) and future work (the NAKED GUN franchise, in which Omar Sharif foreshadows OJ Simpson's accident-prone Wile E. Coyote type)...Perhaps the writing/directing trio worked too hard to accomplish a multi-satire that's gained a pretty decent cult following despite (and/or because of) the disappointing opening-weekend... And there are those who tire of the AIRPLANE! Accolades while pushing the dark-horse notion that this one's a lot better, funnier...Overall TOP SECRET is yet another ""underrated failure because it wasn't treated fairly"" that DOES deserve more appreciation... including Val Kilmer's naturally appealing comic timing sustained in REAL GENIUS... but perhaps more for the entertainingly energetic ambition than end result.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Solid screwball comedy,"It's not quite Airplane!, but pretty much nothing could be. Still, there's a lot of high-effort creative gags. Most people might know about the absolutely bonkers underwater fight, but shoutouts to the brief cameo from Peter Cushing in an entire scene filmed and performed backwards.As you might expect, not all the jokes have aged super well, but at least for my personal taste, nothing ever really crossed a line. You get some guys in drag (as German cheerleaders), and a lot of foreign characters are named after awful puns (Latrine for a French man, etc.), but none of it ever seems too mean spirited, just the fun kind of dumb. Your mileage may vary.It's good enough that I'd almost consider this an under-the-radar classic nowadays. And maybe that's fitting, considering the subject matter.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Train,"TOP SECRETDirectorsJim AbrahamsDavid and Jerry Zucker Cast IncVal KilmerPeter Cushing I was booked for a couple of days to play a straight faced German and a very good actor (Warren Clarke) was to be my boss. The directors of this film had already shown their comedy worth with all the Airplane films in the USA.. So it was gag after gag in this film too. I don't know if this was Val Kilmer's first leading role but he certainly went to the top in his later films..The scene I'm in goes something like this. Warren is checking Val's papers on a train and this is set during WW2. After the dialogue scenes between them Warren and I get off the train and wait for the train to pull out.. We stand on the platform. The train doesn't pull out, the directors think it's funnier if the platform pulls out instead. (British Rail should make note of this as it saves on crowded trains.)

Only If You Can Stomach This One!,"When one gets ready to watch a film made by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker & Jerry Zucker....the viewer should take a look at their work. Their work is Baffonery, Crazy, Nutty & Horrifyingly Stupid. Not everyone can like their work. I do, I loved 'Airplane' and I continue to hail it as the finest slap-stick comedy ever.Coming to, 'Top Secret!', This flick is amongst the stupidest films of its time, that manages a set of good laughs in the meantime. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker & Jerry Zucker eat Humor and digest slap-stick comedy. They can do anything!

While there, he becomes involved in a resistance movement and helps his lady-love, rescue her father, who is being held by the Germans and forced to build the deadly Polaris naval mine.Val Kilmer is awesome, as told before. Also, he dances with great energy and the songs he sings, have the funniest of lyrics. The Late Michael Gough is exceptional, as always.

it just doesn't stop - amusing us,"This is a genuinely amusing film from start to finish, and I think will ultimately be remembered as one of the best comedies of its era.There's no doubt that some material could be tighter; that much of the humor is topical and now somewhat outdated; that the film lacks an inner cohesion, and thus comes across as a series of skits in many respects.But lovers of comedy can forgive many of these faults - much of Fields is now outdated, Laurel and Hardy never showed concern for tight construction, the Three Stooges are frequently lacking in inner cohesion; yet they all made screamingly funny movies! All right, perhaps this isn't 'screamingly funny' - but it's dam'ed amusing, start to finish, and just feels good for being that.

Not so secret spy in wacky spy adventure,"In a way both suspense/spy thrillers and comedies can sometimes be the same thing as most of their stories are always about just the ordinary person/s thrust into extraordinary circumstances while reacting and doing their best under them to survive. This can be humorous due to the amount of disbelief we all have to exercise but also just how contrived or even absurd at times the whole thing can be. This film is another of my favorite films in the parody subgenre, I got into this film around my senior year in high school as was exploring the parody subgenre a lot more, let alone the fact that I love spy thrillers and action adventures, the fact we had a parody on it from to me one of the directing kings of parody ""The Zucker Bros"" to me was just perfect and since this was after their last film ""Airplane"" lighting you can say struck twice.What was truly unique about his parody for me was it was one that didn't just solely parody a particular genre, but that it parodied on many other things and blended them together. Where you pretty much mix a espionage thrillers of old along with Elvis movies and musicals and like any well-made smoothe it's a tasty combination; because this film does it well and right because it manages to be a good cohesive story. This was in a way revolutionary for its time and sort of predates shows like ""The Aquabats Super Show"" and ""Danger 5"" both under the radar gems and stories for another time.There is a spy plotline which has some intrigue in its slow but sure development. But it's not all important like in all parodies and even espionage films, it's really what the characters do under the circumstances is mainly why we watch. I really like the writing and comedy in this film which I think is clever as it parodies on some of the cleches you would sometimes see in the suspense/spy thrillers and even the musicals, what makes them funny is how true they are those things do happen in those films. Sidenote even like that the film has some cameos by a lot of recognizable faces of yesteryear, if you've seen enough films then you'll probably catch them, but they do a good job as they show up at the right times and places.There are a lot of memorable visual and verbal humor as both are just spot on in the film.I don't want to give too much away as part of what makes parodies funny is in discovering most of what happens yourself, so I'll just say a few scenes from the very beginning which is kind of a music video as it's the song Skeet Surfin, it's just hilarious as it's this absurd combination of two sports, it looks all so fun but oh so dangerous. You can't help but laugh at how joyful everyone is acting and its atmosphere despite a lot of rather dangerous misses than on target shots while surfing. I especially like this because one moment during that scene, I won't say what it is only wish I know who that girl was. Anyway, moving on, what's also funny is during that scene we discover how popular Nick Rivers is, which is both amazing and ridiculous as he's more popular that other famous people we know, though that can happen in the waves of fame sometimes.Another is this prison escape scene which is a visual joke where Nick is just escaping though different air ducts but always ending up in the wrong place and direction again and again. I just found that funny because in a way it parodies on some of the 80's video arcade games like ""Joust"" where you sometimes go one direction off screen and just wind up in another place on the game which I always found a crazy kind of physics, just like what happens in that scene.An underwater fight sequence which is an honorable mention in favorite one on one battles. It was fun because of how different it was, and you can say sort of predates the ""Aquaman"" film. But also, just funny how absurd and ridiculous it gets from the sudden cliche setting that combines with the uncommon setting they're in and seeing Nick having to put on his best moves in the fight.Last of course is Nick meeting with the scientist architype character played well by Michael Gough, their back and forth is fun and funny along with the absurdity they deal with. But that scene is even funnier now due to how ironic it is as both Val and Michael were in ""Batman Forever"" several years later.Nick Rivers is played well by Val Kilmer. Personally, I am not a fan of the actor but I do like his work, and this is one of my favorite roles from him. I really like his character Nick Rivers who is basically an Elvis-like singer made into a would be secret though not so secret agent. I like how his character is both larger than life but at the same time just a good-natured ordinary joe, which makes him even more human and likeable. Ironically you can say this can be said about most of the protagonists in the suspense spy thrillers that start out as ordinary guy/girls but then become more than the sum of their parts due to extraordinary circumstances that come their way. His character is cool and smooth but at the same time not; we see how he really blends in with the crazy parody world he lives in and does some of the darndest things or something we don't see coming to survive. But what makes him endearing is that he is simply a person that just wants to have a good time and bring positivity.And this film is also a musical, this film has some memorable songs tracks two of the ones I like are of course the very beginning which is ""Skeet Surfin"". This track almost sounds and feels like it could have been another song from ""Weird Al Yankavic"", ironic I say that as he's a fan of this film. Anyway, the song is catch fun and hilarious as it's clearly a parody on a famous Beach Boys song; the strangest thing is that personally I like this song a lot better.""Cutting a Rug"" is another fun and funny song. What really makes this is the musical sequence seeing Nick singing the song in the pizza joint but then seeing him put on all the moves and getting on all the rugs that are conveniently in the pizza joint. Why there would be lots of rugs at a pizza joint is anyone's guess but can't complain about without them we wouldn't have the song and musical sequence.The only weak points of the film are not ever joke lands and there may 'be a few references that could now fly over current viewers heads, either because some of the references are dated or just the viewer is unfamiliar with it. Though this is just a minor hindrance, and this happens in most comedies and parodies sometimes, you always have your hits and misses but it's always the hits that count the most and thankfully this film has a lot of them in my book anyway.""Top Secret"" is the best kept secret for any fan of parodies and comedies to discover.Rating: 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Not as great as The Airplane,"Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker are a great team of comedy writers/directors and two parts of ""Airplane!"" are one of the best examples of parody movies ever. Their ""Police Squad!"" was highly underappreciated TV series at the time and got infamously cancelled too soon but they made up later with ""The Naked Gun"" trilogy. Then there were ""Hot Shots!"" both of which were as influential in the parody genre as ""Airplane!"" and right until the very day I consider this Charlie Sheen driven movies masterpieces. And only after going through all these movies multiple times I discovered ""Top secret!"" and if I had watched it back in childhood I would have loved it as much as any movie mentioned above. From my today's point of view it is a solid entry in their filmography, jokes are funny and hilarious that I laughed so hard out loud at times (especially the underwater sequence - that was unexpected, creative and witty), great songs and wonderfully nostalgic soundtrack performed by the lead actor Val Kilmer himself in the rock 'n' roll style - you can even find yourself singing along with the songs. But Val was also one of the reasons I didn't like this movie the way I liked the other ZAZ creations; Val lacks charisma of Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen or Robert Hays - he was great at impersonating Elvis and his moves, at singing but his acting just couldn't get through to me. I know it sounds a bit silly but I also didn't quite like the script: there should always be a good enough story but the plotline of ""Top secret!"" is messy, non-structured and abrupt; by the end of the movie I didn't have the feeling like I watched a movie, only a couple of sketches sewed together.

"From the guys who brought us 'Airplane' and 'The Kentucky Fried Movie', comes","Nick Rivers an American 50's Rock star is invited to perform at a festival in East Germany. Throughout his stay he falls for a charming young lady, Hillary, who's involved with the French Resistance because of her scientist father being captured by the Nazis. Nick then suddenly finds himself caught in this conflict and goes out of the way to help Hillary and the French Resistance free her father.Well, I simply adore this broad and terribly ridiculous skit-riddled spoof by the comedy team Jerry & David Zucker and Jim Abraham. Nothing is safe (especially stereotypes), where the 50's Rock n Roll era (Elvis flicks); Espionage films and Hollywood Movies (such as Blue Lagoon and Wizard of Oz) hit mocksville. But while rock 'n' rolling with the Nazis, it also manages to poke fun at itself along the way, because really it's just one big joke with the little ones feeding off it. The lively premise is simply unhinged with a wild range of rapid-fire gags (the under-water saloon brawl being my favourite) and crazy musical segments, which are loosely tied to the thin central story. It doesn't wallow on about things, as there's always one joke after another, which mostly comes off and if not, it's quickly forgotten. Plus you got little diverting actions going on in the background behind the main dig, which can raise smirk. Amongst the many droll wisecracks in the script, are some smart jibs.A very young looking Val Kilmer makes his big screen debut and passes with flying colours. His appealing persona is more then credible, as the rock heartthrob Nick Rivers (which clearly is a parody of Elvis Presley). Sharing the screen with him is the very lovely Lucy Gutteridge and a risible turn by Christopher Villiers. In enjoyably short roles are Michael Gough, Omar Shariff and the unforgettable Peter Cushing as a Swedish bookstore owner.When watching it, I mightn't have been always laughing out loud, but at least this rollicking spoof manages to provoke a wry smile on my face.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Awful,"Well, I got enough of guessing if the humor in this movie is voluntary, or involuntary.

"Ah, I Don't Care Anymore. It's Just Hilarious, So Watch It.","Here's a movie so abjectly campy and poorly made that enjoying it is like watching a performance while someone next to you obnoxiously chews gum the whole time. It is so obviously shot on studio sets. Actors are so obviously wearing make up. During the hilarious German magic salesman bit, whatever the German sprays in the spy's face makes the spy's make-up smear more and more. I can't quite figure out if Val Kilmer is just all-around wooden or if the Zuckers just don't tend to use his better takes. The musical sequences are truly boring, except for the rug sequence which is pretty cool. What it ends up boiling down to is an unending stream of puns and coarse visual gags one must wade through hopeless production values to take pleasure in.Regardless, if one can, there is one sequence that's such a unique example of expressly cinematic humor that I'm surprised to find it here rather than an early Woody Allen comedy. The hero visits a Swedish bookshop. The scene relies not on why, but on English played in reverse, which sounds Scandinavian. The entire scene does this, with English subtitles. This is funny enough at the outset, before we even get it, but it becomes exceptional at the end of the scene, when it finally gives itself away. This is a level of filmic wit so far beyond comparison the surrounding movie that it's almost a contradiction splattered in the middle of it.Nevertheless, like a Mel Brooks film, this movie will readily go for a laugh wherever one is even distantly liable to be found. It has political jokes and boob jokes, dog poop gags, and ballet jokes. It teases two utterly divergent Hollywood genres: the spy thriller and the Elvis Presley musical. It concerns an expatriate who escaped America by balloon during the Carter administration, an associate of the French underground named Escargot, and Omar Sharif contained in a flattened automobile.Unlike Airplane!, which devoted itself to sending up one, very easily identifiable kind of popular film and which was performed by a large cast of recognizables whose careers were secured by such films, Top Secret! is based on no directly familiar forebear. It's by and large a lampoon of East-West espionage movies, as they might have been fashioned to go with a star like Elvis Presley or Frankie Avalon, something that no East-West espionage film ever remotely came close to doing. But now that I think about a lot of the shameless WWII propaganda using A-list dramatic talent, why not go all the way and put Paul Anka and Fabian on the frontlines with the dirty Japs and crouts? The foreseeably threadbare story in Top Secret! has something to do with an East German plot to bring Germany back together, ostensibly by containing the United States fleet just inside the Strait of Gibraltar. There's also something about a secret weapon and, more important, a huge cultural festival in East Germany designed to distract the attention of the Western powers from events in the Mediterranean.

Sets a standard for funny movies,"This is simply Marx brothers in the 80's. So many remarkably intelligent gags that are simply so laughable to think of days after the movie is unique. Where other funny movies rely on one-liners to carry the movie, this stays funny also in the 2nd and 3rd view. More, the movie builds itself up to become more and more funny and crazy, and never loses pace. What is wrong with you guys. This deserves a much better ranking than a mere 6.8. See it over a few beers with some good friends and you will have a most enjoyable evening. Omar Sharif in the crushed car, and the unlikely detailed model of the castle followed by the funniest prisoner freeing scenes of all times simply makes you laugh to tears.

Bad...,"I could not disagree more with Roger Ebert this time. He claims that his friend (who according to him, apparently has no sense of humor) only laughed five times during this movie.

This one is a meaningless assembly of gags, most of which aren't even good. If you are looking for a good parody of WWII movies, then go and watch the TV series 'Allo, Allo' which was also filmed in the 80-ies.

Cult Classic...This is a great flick!,"I think you're being a bit rash, Agent 10. The fact that you think the funniest bit of the movie is a 'pooping pigeon' says a bit, I suppose. To forewarn readers, before you get too far into this, I have a very warped sense of humor. I'm one of 10 people on the entire planet that think 'The Jerk' (Steve Martin) is one of THE funniest movies (for it's sort) of all time. 'Top Secret' falls into the category of THAT type of movie. There are movies that are supposed to be the height of dumb, yet still manage to keep you giggling, if not laughing outright, throughout the entire presentation. Please do keep in mind, however dated, however overused some of the taglines might seem on the surface(Airplane gives a classic example of this 'Don't call me Shirley') the Zucker/Abrahams team were the FIRST TO USE these lines. They were the original idea men for this ilk of humor; authors of phrases, so overused that they have become a part of the American vernacular. Movies of this ilk are mindless entertainment, but unlike so much drivel released by Hollywood they hold a unique position...they are SUPPOSED to be mindless entertainment! 'Top Secret' is not an artsy film. It won't make you cry. It won't make you examine the cosmos or the meaning of life. It WILL, if you have a sense of humor, and an appreciation for the slightly surreal (Example: Nick and Hillary are looking out of an upper-story window down at the busy street bellow and everything's so far away and tiny. Suddenly, a normal sized white mouse runs through the street, over the tiny cars etc.) make you laugh, and forget the world outside for a couple of hours of giddy fun.",,Anonymous,Music

watchable but overrated,"This Zucker/Abrams/Zucker film that parodies WW2 and Elvis films, has Val Kilmer as Nick Rivers, a rock and roll singer who founds himself drawn into the French Resistance while performing a concert in East Germany. Chaulk this up to yet another watchable but overrated Kilmer film akin to ""the Doors"", ""Real Genius"", or ""Pollock"" as opposed to the handful of REAL good movies he's done. The problem is while the jokes are as rapid-fire and humorous as any other ZAZ spoof, the characters don't have the likabilty that they show in ""Airplane"" or the first Naked Gun film.

Top Secret!,"As spoofs go, this is an adequate vehicle for the handsome and charismatic Val Kilmer to squeeze into his 501s and take on the mantle of American rock star ""Nick Rivers"". He is invited to take part in a cultural exchange concert in the still militaristic East Germany and so, under the watchful eye of ""Gen. Streck"" (a super-hammy Jeremy Kemp) he has to stay out of trouble until his gig. Easier said than done though when he meets and falls for the feisty ""Hillary"" (Lucy Gutteridge) and is soon embroiled is a plot to rescue her scientist father (Michael Gough) from the scheming communists before he is forced to create a weapon to end all weapons. The joke looks pretty squarely aimed at Elvis this, and Kilmer makes a decent fist of the gyrating and hair-spraying. Indeed, had we a bit more of these scenes and less of the rather obvious and clumsy espionage malarkey, it might have been a better film. As it is, though, it plays the parody hand just a bit too heavily for me and after a while the cultural clashes appeared to be as much between the star and his largely British supporting cast as much as having anything to do with scheming generals. It's not a film that needs your concentration, it has a reasonably toe-tapping soundtrack and if you aim low, you ought not to be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Nearly every inch of the set and the frame is used to full comedic effect - the details, like what books the characters are reading and the decor in the rooms are what makes this truly a 10/10 movie!

Misfire,"It took me a while to figure out why this movie is so painfully boring, while very similar films such as AIRPLANE! and NAKED GUN are hilarious.The whole point of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker brand of zany, off-the-wall humor is to confound audience expectations. This was easiest, of course, in AIRPLANE!, when most people went into the theater unfamiliar with Z-A-Z. However, even in the later NAKED GUN (and the POLICE SQUAD! TV series), when everyone knew what to expect, Z-A-Z set up certain expectations by making it a parody of cop shows and effectively establishing the ""cop show"" feel. The jokes naturally arise from the very familiar cop-show situations and turn those situations on their heads. In TOP SECRET!, by contrast, the idea seems to be to give the audience *precisely* what they are expecting--wacky jokes.As a parody, the film fails utterly. Trying to ""do"" three different genres completely prevents them from establishing a specific genre feel which then leads naturally to the jokes. Instead, Z-A-Z just throw a bunch of jokes up on screen, because they know that's what the audience wants. And it simply doesn't work, because the jokes aren't *about* anything. It certainly doesn't help that they're also mostly unfunny and uninspired.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

It is very rare that I laugh more than 5 or 6 times at a movie, but this one managed to surpass that by at least threefold. Top Secret! kept the jokes rolling, the puns flying, and the slapstick humor and visual gags coming. While overall there were no big names, except for Val Kilmer in the leading role, all of the cast members pulled through in a big way, making this movie shine. The lack of plot didn't detract from the humor in the least; in fact, it merely strengthened its ability to be that funny.

"""In women's tennis, I always root against the heterosexual.""","I thought this film had more seriousness than Airplane!, the Naked Gun trilogy, and Hot Shots! Even though there was less of a story than in the latter two. There didn't seem to be as many gags as in those films. Or at least most of them didn't seem as outrageous. Because of that, I enjoyed this film the most; it wasn't overwhelmed with gags, and the placement was better.At the same time, it was somewhat average. I don't think that impacted my outlook toward it; as I said, I enjoyed it. But it's hard not to notice that this film is average. The other films were, more or less, the same, where the gags held them up. But with the others, they did too much. With this one, there was more of a balance, which I liked. And I'm sure this film's WWII/spy setting/narrative helped a lot; that's more interesting.Val Kilmer was, by and large, the life of the (film) party. His performance was arguably the best part, rather than the gags/comedy. I liked all the songs/musical numbers, and my favorite song was 'Straighten The Rug.' He embodied the spoof portrayal of Elvis, of whom I've only seen snippets. I haven't watched the Elvis film with Austin Butler, who seemed to nail it based on what I've seen, but 1984 Val Kilmer would've done the same.I don't think this film was necessarily hilarious, or rather, I didn't think it was hilarious, although some instances did do the trick. And while some people may attribute that to the lesser usage of gags compared to the other films, I thought that was preferable; I don't think an overwhelmingness of them is necessary for hilarity. This film does seem somewhat overrated with how an alarming number of people think it was hysterical. The main thing is that I enjoyed it, especially compared to those other films. It seemed to flow better; easier to get in sync.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The ZAZ team made better comedies.,"It certainly wasn't up there with Airplane. There were a few laughs here and there, but the fatal problem is, the spoofs are of Elvis mixed with WW2. For those that aren't big on both, they won't get the jokes. When I saw the movie at 10 years old, I didn't get most of the jokes either, but have loved Airplane and enjoyed the Naked Gun and Hot Shots movies.

Very amusing but dated humor,"For people that grew up after the ""Berlin Wall"", this film may need some explaining.American rock and roll singer, Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) has a gig in the now-extinct East Berlin.

And finds out her father is a scientist held against his will.The film swiftly becomes a mock-WWII spy, miss-identity movie.

But it was well put together and has some nice songs.This is the film where I learned a little German (Marcus Powell ...Little German). And Val Kilmer is in top form. When they make the soundtrack hopefully there will be Little Richard's tune ""Tutti Fruitti."" I was surprised to find out who the traitor was. So I would not say that the film was predictive.

A Real Funny Movie,"I first saw this movie on VHS in 1984 and thought, ""Wow"", ""This movie is what comedy and slap-stick movies are all about."" I rate it one of the best along with ""Shot in the Dark"". It was also the first time I took notice of Val Kilmer for the first time, then and wondered why he never continue to star in more comedies as he has the knack for that kind of venue. Instead, he accepts bete noire roles. He came close to near comedy in ""Comanche Moon"" which belies his talent for comedy.The funniest scene from this movie I thought was when he was tortured by the GDR guards in prison until he became unconscious into the dream world of a nightmare depicting him missing his final exams at high school. When he awakens from that nightmare, he is smiling while he is still being whipped by the guards, saying to the effect, "" thank god that was only a dream"". I think all of us at one time or another had similar nightmares about our high school or college experiences.A must see movie just for the hell of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
It's good.,"The one line summary says it all, really. There are funnier movies out there, such as the later Naked Gun and Airplane movies, but Top Secret is still good. If you don't like Airplane or Naked Gun or Hot Shots, then odds are you won't like Top Secret either.Like the movies to which it is often compared, Top Secret is filled with a dozen jokes, gags and/or puns in nearly every frame. Even if you don't see them initially, I assure you that they are there, especially if you speak either German or Yiddish or if you've seen more spy movies, film noir, Elvis musicals, war movies or westerns than is healthy.Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an American singer on his way to East Germany to perform at the government's request. This actually is the one flaw with the movie... Since he's a singer, that means... Val Kilmer sings... Argh. But, thanks to the wonders of DVD, I can now skip through that with barely a wince. From there he becomes involved in an East German plot to ressurect the third reich, and what would a movie with Nazis in it be without the resistance movement? Of course all the resistance fighters are French for some reason... But that's just the type of warped movie you're looking for. For a serious movie person, all the logical leaps and bounds will cause their heads to explode, but if you're that serious, you wouldn't watch this anyhow.So I give this movie two ratings. On the one hand, there's the rating for the casual viewer who is just looking to laugh a bit-- There it's an 8/10, one point knocked off for each song break (except the first, which is actually good). But if you're looking for a serious movie with social commentary... 1/10. Frankly, though, if you're looking for that, why are you in the slapstick section of your video store?",,Anonymous,Music
a terribly unfunny film,"How could the creators of Airplane and Airplane II follow up these great films with this dud?!? This is a mostly unfunny film. Shortly after I started watching the video, I was inclined to turn it off out of sheer boredom. However, I KNEW it must get better, so I waited, and waited, and waited. It never provided an eventual payoff and I realized I had wasted all this time for nothing.Even for an Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker film, the plot was hard to follow and confusing. This was good in Airplane but in this case the movie just looked like the script had never been completed. And the jokes looked like they had never been tested out to see if they were actually funny (such as skits involving sex with cows and the use of an ""anal intruder""--both very crude but just not funny in any way). My advice? See the Airplane films again or the Hot Shots movies--they provide more laughs in the first 5 minutes than Top Secret had in the entire movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
This is not Mel Torme.,"This is one of the funniest movies of all time. In the tradition of Airplane and Naked Gun, there is not a single moment when something funny isn't happening... either in the foreground or the background or both. The plot is bizarre and almost not relevant because the slapstick humor supercedes any plot devices. The soundtrack is equally hilarious with parodies of Beach Boys and Elvis classics. ""Are you lonesome tonight, is your kitchen asight"" etc. I was able to see Jerry Zucker at a UW Madison graduation ceremony and he is as hilarious in real life as his movies suggest.I also highly recommend Real Genius for another humorous Val Kilmer role.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Possibly the last great spoof,"Although it can be argued that they are still being made, the 'spoof' movie really died a death in the 1990's. Recently, there have been tragedies such as Epic Movie (2007) and its various imitations, all of which were the cinematic equivalent of sticking your cock in a blender. They used to be the forte of comedic giants and legends such as Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and the Monty Python crew. David Zucker, Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams made perhaps the last great spoof in Top Secret!, a relentless parody of spy thrillers that seems unfairly forgotten in the wake of ZAZ's (Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker) more popular Airplane! (1980) and The Naked Gun (1988).With East Gemany planning an attack during a cultural festival, they invite American rock 'n' roll singer Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) to perform as a distraction for the audiences. Rivers, a sort of Beach Boys meets Elvis Presley, soon gets embroiled in the French resistance movement when he meets the beautiful Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) who is searching for her missing father Dr. Paul (Michael Gough). Along with a group of misfit revolutionaries with various French pun's for names, and Hillary's lost-love Nigel (Christopher Villiers), they must break into the high-security prison where Dr. Paul is being held.Top Secret! is a film of such effortless hilarity, it's a wonder how and why the three directors behind it parted ways and made such drivel as Jane Austen's Mafia! (1998), Rat Race (2001) and Scary Movie 3 (2003), highlighting just how much they needed each other. It offers near to non-stop sight-gags that vary from the inspired (a train station pulling away from the train) to the downright ridiculous (a character gets crushed in a car then is seen later with his arms and legs sticking out of it, still alive), nearly all of which hit the mark. But there's also clever word play, and that lost art - embracing the stereotype. Would a film nowadays get away with calling it's only black character Chocolate Mousse?There are literally too many funny scenes to mention, but the one that had me in stitches is the scene in which Nigel and Du Quois (Harry Diston) dress up as the rear and front of a cow, when a real cow comes to suck on its udders, much to the pleasure of Nigel. They stop, with Du Quois insisting they make haste, and Nigel replies ""you're always in such a bloody hurry!"". It's marvellously old-school, headed by a wonderful performance from Kilmer, who as well as getting plenty of belly laughs himself, also proves himself to be a bloody good dancer in the few performance scenes he has. But it is also a sad reminder of just how good this sub-genre used to be.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Underrated Comedy Classic,"Top Secret seems to have little place in the Zuckers/Abraham/Zuckers team's career. It does not seem to be as successful as other films of theirs. In fact, it seems wedged right in between the extremely well respected Airplane! and its sequel and the Naked Gun series. Everyone has seen all five of those films, but only those who have caught it on Comedy Central seem to have seen Top Secret. I don't know why it occupies such a low tier. I believe that it is at least as funny as the classics Airplane! and The Naked Gun, if not a bit above them. There is one hilarious sequence after another with a few misses, but what are you going to do? All of these types of films hit and miss with their jokes, and Top Secret hits with about 90% of its jokes. Who could forget the Skeet Surfing song at the beginning? Who could forget the bull sequence? Or how about the ballet sequence? The underwater cowboy fight sequence? Oh, and, probably its most well remembered sequence, the backwards-Swedish sequence, a marvel in film history. I give Top Secret a 9/10, the same that I gave both Airplane! and The Naked Gun.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
ZAZ's greatest movie and Kilmer is actually fun to watch,"Germans have always been a target for either parody or down right ridicule and there are not much prejudiced German behavior that isn't given the full once over here. Still, when you see this movie you will find yourself laughing at the most stupid, almost racist remark and you will kick yourself afterward to find out why the hell it was so funny.Let me say that I had absolutely no idea who Val Kilmer was when I first saw this back in the mid-80's but without stretching much of the truth, I have to say that I have never enjoyed watching him more than in this movie. Since then he has mostly disgusted me with the rather ugly characters he has played like Iceman in Top Gun and the worst, Jim Morrison. He had some appeal in Heat but that was a great movie for a whole other reason.There are virtually no other famous actors in this movie and the leading lady, Lucy Gutteridge has never filmed a well known movie to this date as far as I can recollect. The most well known after Kilmer is of course, Michael Gough. It's funny that many years later they would play master and servant in the third Batman film totally by accident.This movie can only be described as pure gold from start to finish and there are so many funny scenes that my eyes were in tears midway through the whole event.

This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for ""Airplane"", ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"", and the ""Naked Gun"" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody!I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the ""Hotel Gay Schluffen"", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him finally!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If ""Top Secret!"" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means ""She whose bosoms defy gravity""?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Completely Entertaining Film,"I thought this film to be completely hilarious..the humor was so incredibly random.  It would be one joke after the other, you blink, you miss the other jokes in the background.  Val Kilmer is amazing in it..he should definitely do comedy more often, what's not to love for him actually singing all of the songs? I highly recommend it...but just don't look for a stunning plot, and don't watch if you want to take it seriously",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Very Smart and Clever....Hilarious Gags,"FIrst of all you have to be a fan of the Zucker/Abraham style of humor to enjoy this. In their world nothing makes sense and everything can become a gag. If you enjoyed the Naked GUn movies you should really like this! Coming off the success of Airplane!, this movie seems like it is undervalued. This is a shame because it is very entertaining and manages to keep moving. (And not become just a group of pointless gags) WIth movies like these, I like to mention the level of crudeness that appears.

ZAZ At Their Best,"Now, ""Airplane!"" started it all, and the ""Naked Gun"" movies had their moments, but the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team really hit their stride with ""Top Secret!""  It rivals the great ""Duck Soup"" as one of the funniest, most off-the-wall comedies of all time.""Top Secret!"" takes no prisoners.  Where else can you see a dead-on satire on World War II spy thrillers, Elvis rock musicals, ""The Blue Lagoon,"" ""The Great Escape"" and ""The Wizard of Oz?""  Val Kilmer even does a very credible young Elvis impression -- it's obvious he's having fun, and so we have fun, too.This is one of those movies that you need to watch a couple of times to get all the jokes.  I bet you'll never find a movie as consistently hilarious and clever as ""Top Secret!""",,Anonymous,Music
A hilarious spoof - how many other films can you spot,"If you enjoy Airplane and the like, then you'll love this.Look out for the background gags - the duty free carrier when parachuting into Occupied France, Peter Cushing and the terrific 2 minute long scene - filmed backwards, the musical parody of ""lonesome tonight"", noughts and crosses with machine guns and pistols, the worlds biggest escape tunnel ... and lots lots more. This film provided many clips for the trailers for ""night time TV"" in the UK (the rest were mainly provided by Battlestar Galactica). I still want to know how many folk provided arms and legs for the desert island scene.The soundtrack is classic rock 'n' roll and very singalongable - I just wish I knew where too buy it!Although Val Kilmer is not my most favourite actor, I cannot fault his performance in this film - after all - ""it's just some bad B movie"". ;-)Get some beers in, loads of chips and enjoy a light hearted, nothing to think about film. No sex/drugs/mindless violence. It would be a perfect film for the whole family if you didn't need to concentrate to find all the best gags. 10/10P.S.At the end of the film - don't forget to read the credits to find out ... who the cow was ... and to find some other gags. For the record, I can spot over 40 films which have the mickey taken at some point.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

very underrated spoof,"I think that this is the best of the Abrahams/Zucker Airplane!-genre spoofs, probably because I prefer the genre of films being spoofed here, which are spy thrillers and Elvis movies. Some of the jokes are a little inside, but I think that it makes them funnier (although less accessible). For instance, the scene in the diner where Val Kilmer sings is even funnier if you recall the analogous scene in ""Loving You"", which is a wonderful Elvis turkey (and I say this in the most affectionate way). And to me, nothing in Airplane! equals the hilarity of the interaction between Nick Rivers and the border guards or the fun of the opening music video...",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"haha, very funny","""Top Secret"" makes a goofy parody on the popular spy movies of the 1940's combining with some of the humor of the 1980's, and it's so dated that can only cause one or two haha's in the audience. Won't even bother detailing the messy plot. Really. Not funny. Maybe two or three jokes. That's it.Charismatic as usual, Val Kilmer delivers some fun while his leading lady has some appeal but we never heard from her again, so who cares; Michael Gough is the coolest guy of the film playing a scientist while Peter Cushing, in one of his final roles, is outrageously reduced to a part that consists of speaking in another language pretending to be German and you don't have a clue of what's he saying (at least in the version I've watched, I don't know if there's something understandable about his character).One of the main reasons I didn't enjoyed this is probably my current dislike in brainless movies that makes parodies on another movies. There's so much of them now, like Aaron Seltzer's flicks (I don't even bother in watch them, but every time I'm bombarded with more and more trailers of their upcoming projects), they're not funny anymore, and this one was quite sleepy, tedious, with few good parts (only the sexual jokes work). The ZAZ trio (Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker) at one time was the greatest team to make such movies and they were very good, being ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" their biggest comical efforts. ""Top Secret"" is a big disappointment that consists of giving objects random purposes, characters falling to pieces like a jar crashing on the floor and ruthless scenes that don't cause any kind of amuse on us.And please, answer me this: in what year the story takes place? Everything looks so 1940's, Nazi German, but then there's this rock idol (Kilmer) who sings surf rock from the 1960's and there's devices and cultural references of the 1980's. It's so bloody confusing. Why bother, anyway? Endure for one hour and a half into a pile of wasted things is something to be treasured here and I don't suggest you to look for this. Comedies must accomplish more than a dozen of cheap laughters. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Music
One gag after the other!,"This is a comedy-spoof from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, featuring Val Kilmer in his film debut. It is an outrageously funny parody of World War II spy movies in which American rock singer Nick Rivers (Kilmer) visits East Germany to perform, but ended up getting caught in the middle of a communist German plot aimed at forcing scientist Dr. Paul Flammond (Michael Gough) in making ultimate super-weapon, the Polaris Mine. Rivers and Flammond's daughter Hillary (Lucy Gutteridge) join the French Resistance, whose members have the most clever and hilarious sounding names you've ever heard, to rescue the doctor and foil the plot.At only 90 minutes long, this movie is stuffed with non-stop laughs and outrageous gags one after the other, from the Resistance members doing the tap dance right in the middle of a gun fight, to the underwater fight in a saloon between Nick and the main villain. From start to finish, this spoof that will send tears to your eyes and have you horse laughing from all the surprise gags, film and cultural parodies and funny dialog.With all the jokes and comedy in abundance, you wouldn't want to treat this movie seriously. The characters, however, seem to treat their ""mission"" seriously, giving this movie a fast-paced plot, no unnecessary fillers, and a fun story nonetheless. Kilmer did a great job in his first motion picture acting performance, as well as the host of other actors, providing us a thoroughly entertaining movie with comedy that just flows naturally, for a spoof, rather than force, slapstick nonsensical stuff.Overall, it's some of Abraham and the Zuckers' best work. It'll lift your spirits and keep you laughing all day.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Funny and original, should be in top250","This is one of the earlier successful comedy movies by Zucker and Abrahams that later included the Naked Guns, Airplane! Hot Shots and the more recent Mafia. Surprisingly, it went by unnoticed and very few movie fans know about it today even though by many it is considered to be the funniest movie Zucker and Abrahams ever made. With Val Kilmer in the leading role in his first feature length movie and a set of stars that never made it big, Top Secret is sure to bring a lot of laughter to viewers of all ages. Not only it is sure to give you a great time laughing, but it is worth watching just because of those amazingly made scenes such as the underwater fighting or the one shot totally backwards. The creativity of the producer sees no end in Top Secret. Great movie, totally worth your time!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A goofy, sublimely stupid masterpiece(Minor Spoiler Alert)...","Here's a movie cheerfully dumb enough to have this exchange of dialogue: Nick Rivers: I'm sorry, I don't speak German.Hillary Flammond: That's all right, I know a little German. He's sitting right over there.(cut to shot of midget waving to camera).It's also smart enough to have an entire scene based on the premise that English, when played backward, sounds like Swedish(don't even ask).It somehow manages to spoof Frankie and Annette, Elvis movies, ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Dirty Dozen,"" Westerns, ""Casablanca,"" spy movies,""The Blue Lagoon,"" and even ""The Wizard of Oz."" I have no idea how this movie was conceived, or what studio executive greenlighted this, but God bless everyone involved with this movie, because it is a sublime idiocy, and one of my all-time favorite comedies.

Best parody of them all.,"An encyclopedia of sight gags; blink and you've missed three.  Absolute virtuosity by Val Kilmer in his first role, it was obvious he's up there with Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis, Harrison Ford and Kevin Costner as a major talent.   By the way, it is not a WW2 spy flick, it's obviously East Germany what with the Olympic team, the pinto, etc.  The joke was that life in East Germany was as bad as under the Nazis.

"The comedy team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker.","Top Secret! (1984) was a funny parody of spy movies and World War II movies. The movie takes place in Eastern Europe. A lot of the humor in this movie is dated but it's still funny. Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an American Pop Star who's caught in a web of intrigue. Can Nick save his neck and the free world? Is this movie really that funny? Watch it and find out for yourself! Peter Cushing makes a cameo appearance speaking ""Swedish"" as well as film great Omar Shariff.

"""NEEK!""","Top Secret is undoubtedly one of THE funniest films ever made.  It is chock full of one-liners and sight gags that come fast and furious.  So much so, that I'm sure some viewers will miss things the first time around.Val Kilmer is indeed underrated: the guy can act, sing, and dance!  You don't see many actors these days that are that well trained in the film industry.  How many of you were smart enough to buy the five-track vinyl EP of Val singing the songs from Top Secret all those years ago?  It's one of my most prized possessions.  When listening to Nick Rivers sing you too will scream ""NEEK!""The spoofs of Elvis and spy movies are the main focus, but you'll be treated to plenty more references from The Wizard Of Oz to The Blue Lagoon, and everything is interwoven with brilliance. After all, in what universe or time did this East Germany exist? This concept for Top Secret is so bizarre and I think it just can't be topped. The cheesy pizzas at Der Pizza Haus had me laughing so hard I was crying.  Undoubtedly it would receive a PG-13 if released today, this film had a lot of great adult humor in it for a PG.  I was gasping and laughing so hard at the introduction of the Anal Intruder product -- as with that scene, everything was played so sincerely that you just couldn't believe what you were seeing.  Of course, the Swedish bookshop has to be considered one of the funniest, most clever, and complicated sequences in film history.  Frankly, I enjoy this film a lot more than Airplane (a classic too of course), as it touches on things that I relate to more.  Yes, I GOT the Pinto joke....our family owned one of those cars. Speaking of cars, seeing Omar Sharif crunched up in a car cube was astonishing!  There's so much attention to detail in EVERY frame of this film, down to even the choice of backing singers for Nick Rivers when he performs.  Simply amazing.There's no need for me to go on and on about this film, as I'm sure many have read all there is to know about the plot and what people consider the funniest moments.  I primarily wanted to get my two cents worth in and say that Top Secret is a true classic, deserves a lot more respect, and maybe Paramount will some day put out a MORE special edition of the DVD than the one that's available now -- this is the one movie I have been waiting for on DVD more than any other besides the release of Eraserhead in 2002.Top Secret is a real treat and will have you singing ""Skeet Surfin'"" for days!

The last great movie of its kind,"""Top Secret!"" was the last of the ZAZ/Mel Brooks ""spoof"" movies to really be worth much of anything, or more importantly, to be remotely funny.  And it is truly funny, and earns a place not quite at but near the level of ""Young Frankenstein,"" ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Airplane"" (the undisputed classics of this odd mini-genre).I get mild chuckles from the first ""Naked Gun"" movie.  And ""Spaceballs"" has one classic line that makes me laugh every time I hear it - but that's the only time I laugh at the whole movie.  ""Hot Shots"" does nothing for me.  And Mel Brooks has just been churning out endless, boring dreck like ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" and ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" for many years - thank God he's apparently focused on getting ""The Producers"" going on Broadway so as to spare us any more awful films from a once-great writer/director.So anyhow, ""Top Secret!"" sorta marks a dividing line - the last time one of these silly spoof movies was actually truly funny.",,Anonymous,Music

Underrated doesn't even begin to spell it out!,"There are two movies that as a kid I watched endlessly (kid = 8-12 years old) but no one had ever heard of.

When I was about 15 or 16 I decided to have my friends watch them both thinking that I was going to love them and they'd hate them. Well they loved both, but over the years Top Secret! has grown to be one of the funniest, if not THE funniest spoof film ever made.

Yes, it makes fun of Airport '77, but that is not enough to warrant the term ""parody"".Top Secret parodies many specific scenes from many different WWII movies but what I believe makes it the equal of 'Galaxy Quest' is that it parodies the 2nd unit shots, the cliches.  There is a shot of a german waving his arms telling a convoy to move forward, the shot zooms out and they are going in circles. the guy crawling on his stomach runs into a pair of boots and looks up to see..a pair of boots.

Simply the funniest movie that has ever been,"There can be no doubt this is the stupidest movie ever made. It has plot holes all over the shop and the characters just don't make any sense, but if you're after a character-driven comedy that speaks to you on multiple levels, then you wouldn't be watching this in the first place.This film is about one thing only, making you laugh! And it does it better than any other film in 20 years since its inception. There can be no argument that this is Val Kilmer's finest moment, because despite the high-profile roles he has starred in since, he has rarely revisited his comic roots. Only in the 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang does he once again display his talent for brilliant dry delivery, and spot-on comic timing.Obviously, the plot is irrelevant, but it centres around an American singer caught up in a Plot from the Germans to, once again, take over the world. That really is all you need to know, because it's not important. The first time I watched this, I'd gotten home rather worse for wear, and flicked on the TV and some un-godly hour of the morning. Within 5 minutes I'd shouted at my mate to come and watch this crazy film, and the rest is history. None of my friends have still seen this film, but the two of us still fondly remember some of the fantastic gems that are contained within; the pacman scene upon arrival in Germany just blew our minds, the man chasing the tree still gets us every time, and as for Chocolate Mousse (Gasoline Ha Ha Ha!), well, if you haven't seen it, then it cannot be explained.Suffice to say, I love this film. I love it for what it is, because it doesn't try and pretend that it's a great film, it knows that it's a stupid comedy,and is extremely proud of it. This film has more hilarious moments in the first 10 minutes than almost all modern-day comedies can boast in their entire repertoire!To summarise, I'd say that everyone needs to see this film. Many will not find it funny, as it does appeal to a certain type of humour, but for those that get the first slapstick gag that they see, they are in for a treat! There are too many comic gems to list in this film, but I think I could pick out any 5 minutes of the feature and there would be something ingenious contained within.

Spread the word!,"Why are movies like this left forgotten?  ""Top Secret!"" should be anything but.Created in that dark period of time between ""Airplane!"" and the ""Naked Gun"" movies, ""Top Secret!"" is a gem of a flick given to us by the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker).These guys have obviously watched a lot of spy films, Elvis films and at least one or two Swedish films.  Every convention, cliche' and possible double entendre is mercilessly dissected and delved into head first.  If you love any of the aforementioned genres, this is definitely one to seek out: you'll bust a gut!Kilmer is dead-on as Nick Rivers (his dad thought of the name while he was shaving), a crooning teen sensation the Germans think would be great to invite to their country to entertain while they plan the downfall of the rest of the world.  Of course, they don't count on Nick Rivers falling in love with Hillary Flammond (Gutteridge), daughter of a famous scientist (Gough) being held by the Germans.  They also don't figure on him becoming a member of the French Underground, singing such classics as ""Share this Night with Me"", ""Straighten the Rug"" and ""Skeet Surfin'"" or trying to pass himself off as Mel Torme'.How can anyone not like this movie?  The sight gags are inexhaustable, and so is the script, dispensing one-liners and quips at a blinding rate.

One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"I have rarely laughed as much and as loud as I did watching this.  I actually woke my wife up several times with my laughter, so she was ""forced"" to enjoy this with me.  I usually don't like spoof movies (e.g. Mel Brooks), but this one had me in stitches.  One joke after another -- there was barely time to catch my breath.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
the wittiest movie made...,"all i have to say about this work is it's clever and keen from start to finish.  it seems every little shot is filled with some nonsense that leaves you aching for more.  do not worry if you miss some parts due to uncontrollable laughing, thats why we have a rewind button.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I know a little German, he's sitting right over there!""","A side-splitting spy film that takes no prisoners. Such a treat to watch each time. For those that appreciate literal cheeseball humor, this is one for the video library. I hope Val Kylmer appreciates his phenomenal success and recognizes the Skeet Shootin' jolt that Top Secret had on his career.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Spectacular send-up of God knows how many movies ....,"Like almost everybody else, I caught this only by accident, years after it was first made, on late-night cable. From ""Skeet Surfin'"" on, I was hooked, and really impressed with Kilmer, whom I would have had trouble picturing as either an Elvis clone or a comic before I saw this movie. When my wife and I were watching the credits, mostly to look for the usual Zucker silly touches, we almost fell out of our chairs when we saw that Kilmer hadn't lip-synched each song, as we expected, but sang every one of them! And did all the dance moves, too -- and damned well at that.I heard somewhere that Kilmer went to Julliard, and he obviously paid serious attention to his music. The guy is GOOD.I suppose it is possible to have such an absence of a sense of humor as to not like this movie, but it's hard to imagine. I watch it every time it's on (maybe 6-7 times now) and enjoy it more each time. Of course, like Deja Vu, the Resistance fighter, I have a vague sense that I've seen this all before somewhere ....",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Movie Filled With Hard Laughs,"I first found out about this movie reading Roger Ebert's book of movie reviews.  He gave it ***1/2/4, and I could see why.  This movie is full of hard laughs, and the best thing about them is you have to look yourself to find them.  MY favorite is when someone is standing at an open window and they see a bunch of cars going down the streets and mice appear out of nowhere and go through the miniature cars.  Another great one involves Publisher Clearing House, but I won't ruin it.  All in all, this movie is worthwhile and deserves more recognition.  It's not as good as The Naked Gun,  but you should see it anyway.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"If you don't find this funny, I can't help you...","Those who know only know Val Kilmer from his ""Top Gun"" and ""Batman Forever"" roles may be surprised to learn that he helmed this intelligent, yet goofy comedy about a rock star who becomes involved with a group of French rebels while performing in Germany.  Kilmer sings his own songs and dances wildly as the Elvis-like Nick Rivers while ""Blue Lagoon"", ""Bonanza"", ""The Great Escape"", and others are cleverly spoofed (as opposed to the sometimes shameless spoofing of other films in the genre such as ""Spy Hard"").This was the Zucker, Zucker and Abrahams follow-up to their previous hit ""Airplane"", so if you liked that film, the Naked Gun series, or any of their others, you will most definitely appreciate this!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great movie, that's all there is to say!","I loved the backwards scene and the underwater bar fight scene.  No other movie could pull that off like this one!  I loved the names too, Chocolate Mousse and Deja Vu, ""I'll never forget you!""  The entire movie was full of these off the wall antics that never ended!  I have to buy this movie and watch it religiously!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Makers of AIRPLANE! Do It Again!,"Val Kilmer stars in the wacky, hilarious slap stick comedy, that is a must see for all comedy lovers.

Keep the joke a Top Secret!,"Pound for pound, no comedy has made me laugh more than ""Top Secret!"". It's a satire by the Zucker Brothers (Airplane!) of both WWII flicks ( like the Great Escape) and Elvis Presley musicals. Think about the chronology for a minute.Satire for the most part isn't done very well these days (see the awful 'Not Another Teen Movie' if you don't believe me). The trap that many satires today fall into is that they simply recreate a scene but they do not let you onto what it as about the scene or movie that it deserves to be zinged.The Zucker Brothers know this. There's a satire early on of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" which starts with the familiar scene as we know it from Raiders but it soon goes into other areas before revealing itself as one of the more creative jokes in the movies. 	That's really a theme to this movie. The scene start familiar as we know them, but get stranger as they play on before revealing themselves at the end. This is evident with the fist fight in the truck, or the famous ""Swedish book store"" scene. The Zucker brothers seem to take scenes that one step further than what everybody else would (something the Farelly brothers have picked up on). They also fill the whole screen with jokesTo comment on the acting is a exercise in futility (nobody goes to see Top Secret! for the acting) but here it goes:The actors play this perfectly for a satire. Throughout the movie they are deadpan serious (even when a long lost love is 'measuring you up'). The actor can't be in on the jokes (another thing you see in newer satires). The casting is dead on as well. Similar to Airplane!, character actors play the key roles. You have Omar Sharif as a much abused spy (""This isn't the Howard Johnsons""), Michael Gough as a kidnapped scientist (""But what about my tunnel""), and Peter Cushing as the aforementioned Swedish bookstore owner. All of them seem to have fun poking fun at their more serious imagesTop Secret is a satire up there with the 50's Warner Brothers, 70's Mel Brooks classics, and recent Farelly Brother romp- and don't let anybody tell you the joke before you watch",10.0,Anonymous,Music

A guaranteed laugh-a-thon for all viewers.,"This spoof masterpiece will surely have you creased up from start to finish. Packed with gags covering a wide range of subjects, this film manages to have a dig at practically every film genre, from Spy (obviously!) to Romance and War.

Hilarious comedy!,"When I saw this movie on DVD, I hadn't laughed like this for any movie in a long time. If you love slapstick comedy, you've got to see this funny film. It goes on my list of the top comedies I've ever seen. The best part of the movie is when there crawling through the fence and see a pair of boots with standing before them, but let out a sigh of relief when the camera backs away to show the boots are empty. That's a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Remorselessly daft,"This has got to be in the running for the most gag-packed film of all time, there seems to be something going on pretty much constantly, with no opportunity for a quick laugh overlooked. Though of course they can't all be classics, there's a pretty good strike rate and many of them are inspired, moments of sheer comic genius cropping up every four or five minutes. All this and a story and characters too - an awesome film that deserves far more fame and recognition.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Surely a rotten film, And don't call me Shirley...","Of all the spoof films the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams have made, This one sticks out as the sore thumb. With the success of 1980's ""Airplane"", They tried to recapture the magic in ""Top Secret"" to no avail. I watched the opening sequence with Shotgun toting surfers riding the waves to the tune of ""Skeet Surfin"" sure the rest of the film would be just as good. I was wrong. The film just wasn't funny. Granted, There were some silly moments but the writing just didn't measure up, The timing was off and the direction lacking. Maybe it was the premise of mixing a 1950's rock and roll star in a cold war setting that was the mistake as their later films such as ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"" proved the genre can be successful if done properly.",,Anonymous,Music
"Funny, after all this time?","I would have seen this movie, back when I was about 12-13. I can still remember some of the jokes from it. I saw it again recently and can happily say that after all this time it was worth checking out again. If you need something to laugh at, well, giggle at least, then this is worthwhile to check out.",,Anonymous,Music
Forgotten gem.,"This forgotten classic is probably as funny as ""Airplane!"" (if not as well-known)  The gags come rapid-fire, the amorphous ""plot"" changes every couple of minutes, and Val Kilmer is surprisingly funny as the dumb old-country boy rock singer ""Neek.""  There's simply too much funny stuff in this movie to describe, but it one-ups ""Airplane!"" in one respect: The songs.  The songs (some sung by Kilmer himself) are hilarious and well-done. From ""Skeet Surfing"" to ""How Silly Could You Get?"" (My Favorite, and it's title pretty much sums up the movie) to a warped advertisement version of ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" this  movie's soundtrack deserves to be re-issued.",,Anonymous,Music
"Not 'Airplane!', but very close","'Top Secret' is amiable for a spoof, but is not in the league of ""Airplane!"" or the ""Naked Gun"" movies. The problem I had was with the leading role. Val Kilmer was terrible in this movie and ""Real Genius"", and he's mediocre at best today. I found a lot of the gags funny. I felt bad laughing at the ""Nazis getting blown up by the Pinto"" scene, for that's what happened to 3 Hoosier teenage girls when their wagon tapped the bumper of a Pinto. The explosion resulted in their deaths. (I don't believe the parents would be watching this movie more than once.) Still, a good time waster if your into ZAZ and spoofs in general.",,Anonymous,Music
Loving it.,"More intelligent than most of today's low-brow humor, this 1984 'cult classic' is as original as a spoof can be.  Top Secret is a great comedy mostly because it doesn't take its jokes too seriously.  This movie makes the most out of making fun of stereotypical war-time romance films.",,Anonymous,Music
Val Kilmers best,"Still some of the funniest s*** I ever saw.. and it produced the stupidest comment I ever read on imbd (some israelian a couple of rows down) suggesting this wasnt for the non-US viewer. Well, english is my third language. If youve seen a couple of movies from the last millenia you´ll get it (if u have an iq over 60, able to tie your own shoelaces etc). Val Kilmers best movie.. Wish he´d done more comedies I´ll give it 8/10, but while youre watching it, it feels like ten.once again to the reviewer below: if u were being ironic, it was very subtle. If that is the case then I guess I am the stupid nutcase. I love u anyway fellow human!",,Anonymous,Music
why do some people say this movie is underrated?,"top secret! is not one bit underrated. it's mostly a silly spoof. some laughs,but most of this movie is silly gags more than funny gags, but there are some funny moments. my favorite is where val kilmer is looking out the window of the train or bus i can't remember,and he sees a tree moving,and a guy chasing after it. that's just too funny. i wish this movie had more moments like that one. i give this movie **1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,Music
An all-time Best!,"I rate this movie as the funniest I've seen, all-time.  It is filled to the brim with shots at virtually everything.

Absolutely brainless humour. Not funny at all.,"When I was a kid, I was very amused by this film. Therefore, when it was on the television the other night, I could not wait to sit and watch it. Obviously, my tastes have grown since in the last 18 years since I last saw this film. Total rubbish!Val Kilmer plays a teen rock idol who visits East Germany for a concert. During his stay there, he gets involved with a resistance to overthrow the German government.From the same people that brought us Airplane! (another idiotic film), this movie is full of sight gags and cheap parodies of other films. What gets me is that films of this nature are so popular. This type of comedy is not funny at all, and is usually very tasteless humour.If you like the type of comedy in the Airplane movies or the Hot Shot series, then this film is definately for you. Otherwise, I would definately avoid this film.",,Anonymous,Music
Classic,A forgotten movie in the early years of spoof comedy.  Top Secret is simply about an American rock star goes to Germany and some way or another ends up with the French Underground and has to rescue a German Scientist.  This is just such a good movie.  It's okay to watch with the whole family because every time they start to make out the camera pans over to a fire place even when there parachuting off a plane.,,Anonymous,Music
Quick Rehearsal !,"This round, (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker) and (David Zucker) made nothing but a bunch of jokes on the war movies, which didn't hold together as a whole movie. I wished that the parody's most famous team would present something more solid and effective than these desultory weak sketches. True that there was an ambitious intention, but the final outcome was purely deficient.The plot line is thinner than a thread. Most of the gags are juvenile. There are some comic moments that manipulate the cinematic medium for just the manipulation (the bar fight under the water, the library scene played backwards), without at least real laughs along the way. Choosing (Val Kilmer) was a big hole to a ship with already many holes. He had such a stiff face, which didn't fit comedy (or in fact anything!). The supposedly comic lines were delivered miserably by him.Speaking of which, if you noticed well, you would discover that the-stiff-face choice was kind of a habit of the (Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker) team. From (Val Kilmer) in (Top Secret! - 1984), to (Charlie Sheen) in (Hot Shots! - 1991) and (Hot Shots! Part Deux - 1993), ending with (Jay Mohr) in (Jane Austen's Mafia! - 1998). Maybe the studio used to demand a young handsome guy as a lead, whether had a talent for comedy or not! Sure (Leslie Nielson), a regular - and better - face in that team's movies, wasn't always satisfying for the producers as only handsome guy (young age beats talent is an old Hollywood story!).2 things live from this movie: its actively ironic spirit out of the movies' exposed tricks, along with few marginal jokes. It's not a perfect movie in the first place; just a quick rehearsal for (Hot Shots 2) later. After parodying the 1940s and 1950s war movies in (Top..), they would parody the 1970s and 1980s war movies in (Hot..). Btw, character actor (Miguel Ferrer) was in the 2 movies, playing nearly the same role. The only difference was that the last one was funnier and more like a movie as well.",,Anonymous,Music
Hysterical!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great spoof movie.  If you liked Airplane! The Naked Gun and Hot Shots! you will love Top Secret!  It's making fun of spy movies.  It takes place in Germany where Germans capture a scientist.  Val Kilmer plays a singer (making fun of Elvis) who is trying to help save the scientist.It is funny like all spoof movies and made by the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker crew.  It is hard to find.  I could not locate it at a local movie store but they just released it on DVD.  Try to catch it on T.V. its on a lot.,,Anonymous,Music
Funny but not the best,"I saw this movie years and years ago-probably when it first came out, although I can't remember now-and just now saw it again. Let me say, this is a very funny movie most of the time, if you like stuff that's just plain ridiculous (""...and then we'll break away from the other cows..."" ;winning a gunfire version of tic-tac-toe),but still, it doesn't measure up to the definitive ZAZ flick, the original ""Airplane!"" Val Kilmer looks ridiculously young, with typical '80s hair, and shows a real comedic flair here-he probably should have stuck with comedy. He then wouldn't have gone in the tank with that colossal ""Island of Dr Moreau"" disaster (or maybe that was a comedy?) Anyway, if you liked the Naked Gun and Airplane series, you'll like this one, too.",,Anonymous,Music
Old skool fave,"Liked this film more as a kid than i do now but still pretty funny.
