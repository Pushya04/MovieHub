Like the film? Read the book.,"I've seen the film many times, have always enjoyed it. But I've been reading the book for the first time. It's a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It's a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It's the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn't be introduced in the movie without extending the film's length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Even after years of being made.. it is good!,"I wish people made more movies like this nowadays..Yes! The movie is LONG, but the development of the main character has you swinging from liking her to hating her, to agreeing with her, to.. all sort of emotions!! It is well worth anyone's time.
These characters feel SO real! It's like a perfect summarized soap opera. Anyone studying movie-writing should check this adaptation of the book. Would recommend to anyone.And make yourself a favor and don't watch the sequel.. the movie ends the way it does for a reason.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Margaret Mitchell won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel on May 3rd, 1937","The year 1939 was a busy year for the Hollywood industry. Large-scale, majestic epics were front and center that year. You should look up the list of films released in 1939. It was a very, busy year, with huge titles from the golden age. Lots and lots of entertainment for a pre-WW2 audience. The Wizard of Oz (1939), Stagecoach (1939), Son of Frankenstein (1939), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and this little film, are just some of the titles on that list. Everyone was competing for perfection in the film industry. The first two hurtles, being sound and color film, had been implemented into the technical side of the filmmaking process, to this point in film history. Technicolor had been utilized for, about, five years to this point and it was perfectly utilized in this film too. Technicolor always was a good film stock, rich with colors, that pop on the screen. Head cinematographer, Ernest Haller's camera, captures images, not seen before on film and blazes colors across the screen, in Gone With the Wind (1939).I'm sure everyone knows the basic premise of the film. It boils down to a story about the life of woman, a daughter of a rich cotton plantation owner in 1860s, Georgia, who's life interweaves with the real life events of the American Civil War and the recovery and reconstruction years. It is a fictitious story utilizing events from the real world. Of course, most of us remember the picture on the movie posters of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), locked in that emotional, romantic embrace, plus it's on the cover of every DVD and Blu-Ray out there these days, but the film is really about Scarlett and all the other characters come into her circle. And, the film needs to be about Scarlett in order to be successful, because it is her spoiled, selfish, smug demeanor that energizes the whole film. Everyone who comes into her circle feels her wrath, even Rhett. Rhett isn't really a very likeable character either and watching these two unlikeable characters square off, through various parts of this film, is something to see. These are the reasons, that make this film so good. A plot involving two unlikeable characters, who eventually, reach a certain amount of maturity, that they earn some respect from the audience, doesn't deter from the overall quality of the film, because it is such a unique character study, while chaos is happening all around them.The film does contain many sub-plots, involving politically, socially, culturally and racially charged tones, which would be expected, considering the time this period piece takes place. Which, brings up another interesting point to this film. Even though this film is approaching 85 years old now in the 21st century, it is still considered a period piece. The interesting part is the filmmakers had a more recent memory of the events used in the film, being only 75 years before, as opposed to our view, which is roughly 150 years later. In fact, there probably were a couple of Civil War veterans still alive in 1939. Another amazing thing about this film is, they started shooting this thing in January, 1939 and released it just before Christmas that same year. That is impressive, considering the massive runtime of this film. It is the runtime of this film that really hurts it from being a perfect film.The images the filmmakers (I would list names, but you should see the Crew List on this film), are able to show us on the screen, is incredible. The color you will have stuck in your head, for a week after viewing this film, will be the color of orange, red fire, that is seen throughout the movie and obviously, mostly comes from the burning of Atlanta. A technical achievement, that hadn't been seen in the movies yet. The special effects, art direction, costuming and lighting is fantastic. You still don't notice, even today, that most of this movie was just filmed, out in the Los Angeles countryside and on sound stages. So much is going on in this film, you don't notice it. The performances by the cast is perfect. This is an epic journey about redemption and maturing. A maturity that helps the characters and a nation begin to grow. This film would roll through the Oscars in 1940, including winning the Best Picture Oscar.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Miracle in Film Making - Can't believe they did it in 1939!,"This movie was on my watch list since 1996 or 1997 when I read its review in a local newspaper.

The tragedy of Scarlet the wise 2020 review,"At first you would think, the main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background...
Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love... She has a target she want to achieve and she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy, while missing the point on the way to that target... Something that I realised on a 2nd viewing is that Scarlet is a pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour. She can easily manipulate men and sometimes women in order to achieve her goal. She can kill a person and not feel that bad about it,she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men. The goal is what pushes her forward and sometimes makes her do good things, but these deeds are never done out of big heart, they are usually done in self interest. You would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted, but she does not. Scarlet lives in a personal hell which partially she created herself and only when the last obstacle to her big love, the female friend that loves her is gone, she realises that all this time, she lived the illusion of love, she was hurting the people that loved her. Is scarlet a horrible person? Probably... Does she pay for her sins? She does more than anyone... Does she understand what true love is? Yes in the end she does... What makes this film so great, it's a tragedy like ""War And Peace"" with monumental character development ...Any scenes of war and racism fade compared to the tragedy of Scarlet which lives in personal hell...",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
About as good as it gets in 1930s Hollywood,"I've done so many reviews on IMDb and despite this, I can't believe I never reviewed this super-famous film. Well, much if this is because with so many reviews, I truly doubt if anyone will ever read this! I was surprised that when I perused the reviews, there were quite a few knuckleheads that gave the film a score of one!! While I do agree that the film is rather dated in the way it deals with minorities, it is truly insane to trash a film just because it offends your easily damaged sensibilities. One person even compared the film to PLAN 9! Come on, folks,...this is an amazing film. And what makes it even more amazing is that the film had several different directors because producer Selznick was so difficult to work with on this film! And, despite this, the film wins (among many other awards), the BEST DIRECTOR Oscar! While I do think that many Oscars should have been earned, giving it to just one man seemed pretty cheeky! Despite this, this is a magnificent sweeping spectacle about the South--but even more about a selfish beauty who ultimately creates chaos of her decent life. Magnificent, well-acted and memorable--this is one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Georgia on my mind,"This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.""Gone with the Wind"" brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An American magnum opus which must be watched and often, and by those who understand cinema","Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-à-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.Scarlet O'Hara, the well bred, haughty, tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga, is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent, courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety, brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole, but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself, who won not one but two Oscars while playing one: first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact, her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara, in which she perfectly blends panache, poignancy and peremptoriness, is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her on-stage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature, which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional: out-and-out bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley, who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him, represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self, which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars: a usurper, an egomaniac, a damsel, a nemesis, a menace, a guardian, a savior, a patriot, a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate, an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However, behind this facade, just like Scarlet, there is a human capable of love, and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland, who as Melanie is a paragon of love, humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.The movie's direction, cinematography, editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece, one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes, high on emotion and drama, which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land, deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for, is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child, and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet, ""You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how,"" also happens to be one of all time favorite.The movie, especially its anti-climatic ending, brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions, being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness, and its limitless potential. A must watch for everyone. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Astounding Film - GWTW is the Definition of a Classic!,"The setting is a Georgia plantation. The year is 1861, and sixteen-year-old Scarlett O'Hara is infatuated with the blond, drowsy-eyed Ashley Wilkes - the problem is, Ashley plans to marry another woman. Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent - she cares only for Ashley.Suddenly, the Civil War brakes out, changing the fates and fortunes of all. Scarlett, clever, manipulative, and charming, proves an adept survivor - but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley (in his forties, rather old to be playing a man half that age), every role was perfectly assigned. After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett, and Hattie McDaniel's strong, unforgettable performance as ""Mammy"" netted her an academy award (the first for an African-American actor).GWTW's backdrop is the gruesome Civil War, and in the end this film is the story a woman and a civilization (the Old South) going through a war that will not leave either of them unchanged.The cinematography is beautiful, memorable. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.The pragmatic may think Gone with the Wind overly dramatic; the restless may find it too long; the action-stimulated, too subtle. None of this, however, detracts from the fact that GWTW retains a lasting appeal as one of the crowning cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Those who see its ending as depressing - tragic, even - perhaps miss the point - which Scarlett O'Hara makes in her very last instant with us, tear-stained eyes uplifted in a sudden, curious burst of hope beneath all the turmoil; that .. .

"A classic of respectable scope, well ahead of its time","So, I've been calling myself a movie buff for ages, but it took me to get to the tender age of 23 to see one of the greatest classics in the history of cinema. I must say I was pretty impressed. The film has some outdated touches of the theatrical and romantic, but much less so than I expected. It's also interesting how the main character of Scarlett O'Hara- nicely portrayed by Leigh- is so very unsympathetic, almost an anti-hero. Still, Scarlet is a strong and interesting character who gains depth throughout the film. She goes from being a detestable manifestation of a privileged, unproductive lifestyle to an independent, even cruel persona full of determination and courage.This one was at its best when depicting the cruelty of the American civil war, when the focus of the story was less on relationships and more on the agelessly political.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
There's never going to be a movie like this,"It was way back on New Year's day of 2014 when I got myself a copy of this movie and watched it for the first time, in total awe; that one hadn't got an overture, intermission and exit music and ran at about 3,5 hours but I didn't feel the time at all. What's 4 hours of time when the story is timeless?What can I tell you about the movie that you don't already know? That it is the highest grossing movie of all times? That it got eight Oscars including the first ever given to an African-American, Hattie McDaniel (whose Mammy was an adorable character and I'm totally in love with her performance)? Or that I love this movie to the moon and back? Yes, that's what I'm going to say.This 1939's masterpiece is a perfection of a movie and frankly my dears I don't give a damn about what you have to say about it. Excellent performances (especially by Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel) and lovable characters, impressive war and hospital scenes, plot and storylines that leave you fidgeting on the edge of the seat until the end, beautiful music, astounding cinematography, colorful set pieces, splendid direction by Victor Fleming and the list goes on and on. It's easier to say bad things about the movie because there are none.Sometimes we all feel like Scarlett: that we are living a lie, believing the things that are untrue, making other people miserable and thinking there's no one out there who truly loves us the way we are but missing it all because of the blindfold on our eyes.

Vivien Leigh is so powerful, passionate, magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it 1000 times on that ground alone. She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish, spoilt Scarlett; the character is larger than life.Leaving Vivien's astounding performance aside, this remains a sweeping unrivalled epic.

"The Greatest Film of its Time, and All Time","I believe that when one views a film, one should consider the context in which it was made.Barely 10 years after talking pictures were first created; less than that after the first full-length color feature film was created; near the end of the greatest depression this country ever experienced, and in which pretty much the only entertainment available to most was radio or the movies; David O Selznik decided to turn the biggest pot-boiler blockbuster novel into a movie.And what a movie. Stunning color, the most popular mail actor of his time, perfect music score, incredible action scenes, story line only 70 years removed from when it happened, and on, and on. Can you imagine what a store-clerk or a farmer, or a teacher experienced in that world, seeing Gone With the Wind? What was there to compare with? 1939 was a watershed year for great movies, and this one was the greatest produced. Try watching this movie as if there were no TV, no DVD's, only a few radio stations, spending maybe the second to the last quarter you owned, never having seen such a movie before, and you get what I mean.

While the leading man and the supporting cast are outstanding, you walk away from this with only one person holding and controlling your thoughts, just like the character she plays, just as she does through the whole of the picture - the incredible and sublimely talented, the beautiful and vivacious, the tempestuous hurricane of a tornado that is Vivien Leigh.

The Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time,"The film claims in the opening credits to have a historian as a consultant, Wilbur G. Kurtz. And, at the time of its making, what he did sufficed as history.The Old South was claimed to be a ""pretty world,"" ""a dream remembered,"" and full of gallantry. There are innumerable problems with the film the greatest of which is racist sentiment.The portrayal of ""Mammy"" is particularly racist. Manny has no name and her entire life is invested in Scarlett's. She says the happiest day of her life is when Scarlett has her child. She is always worried about the family's reputation and lives vicariously through them. She becomes terribly upset and emotional when Rhett and Scarlett fight. Most outrageously, Mammy is seen pushing USCT soldiers aside to allow Scarlett through as if Mammy and other former slaves have no interest in their own freedom.If the portrayal of Mammy is bad, the portrayal of Prissy is even worse. Mammy is at least portrayed has having some sense whereas Prissy plays ""the simple-minded darkie"" with no courage at all. Her high pitched voice serves to emphasize her inanity.Mammy and Prissy's characters are part of a larger lie that the movie attempts to tell: the myth of the ""loyal darkies."" In the scene where Atlanta is under attack by Sherman, some black men say, ""Don't worry! We'll stop them Yankees!"" When one slave is given a watch he refuses to accept it and insists that Scarlett should keep it as if to say, ""Look! These white people were so great to us we want nothing from them!"" The film also advances the myth of benign slavery. Scarlett's father tells her to treat slaves gently, as if the only problem is a few bad masters who commit excesses. When Ashley complains of misgivings about white prison labor, he says that he kept all of his slaves well-fed and would have freed them when his father died if the war had not done so first.Finally, the film advances the myth of the evil carpetbagger. ""Carpetbaggers"" are shown to be terrible and vicious people who kick injured Confederates off the road and ride with nicely dressed black men sitting in a position of equality. One night, the white southerners ""clean out the woods to protect their women,"" which is just code for organizing the KKK and committing murder.The film is rife with faux sentiment, posturing, and social strategizing. Scarlett O'Hara is simply a terrible character. She is screaming, crying and whining. She's weak, flirtatious, boy-crazy, and hopelessly in love. She slaps Prissy and tells her she will sell her south. Scarlett is manipulative, lying, deceptive, lovesick, and obsessed with looks. And all her tribulations are emphasized by melodramatic music and foreboding weather.Even scenes which would otherwise be wonderful must be condemned because of the vicious intent behind them. The contrast of the tree, Scarlett, and her father against the setting sun is simply perfect. But, it intends to advance the myth of the idyllic Old South. After the attack on Atlanta, the camera shows the land covered with soldiers and pans back up to the Confederate flag. While expertly shot, the scene is used to evoke sympathy for the Lost Cause.This film competes with Birth of a Nation for the title of ""Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time."" Gone with the Wind is less racist, but much more celebrated than Birth of a Nation. Given the two criteria, it is difficult to say which is worse. Birth of a Nation has been kicked off AFI's Top 100 Films while Gone with the Wind still sits perched at #4. Whereas films like Christmas with the Kranks are unequivocally awful, Gone with the Wind is worse. The reason being that it is much worse to be shitty and pernicious than it is to be shitty and harmless.To paraphrase a quote from Scarlett, ""As God is my witness, I will never watch this film again!""",1.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
All-time classic,"I was put off watching this for a long time, mainly because I mistakenly believed it to be an old-fashioned romance. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, it's a story of how two maladjusted characters come together and the volatile relationship that progresses.That's the central thrust of the tale, but there's a whole lot more to GONE WITH THE WIND than that. It's an epic reconstruction of a by-gone era, a pre-Civil War American South in which man and slave lived side by side. It's a war story featuring some hugely impressive pyrotechnic effects which must have blown cinema-goers away on first release. And it's an exploration of the darkest reaches of the human condition.The actors are fantastic. Vivian Leigh really makes something of what must have been a difficult role to play. It's especially noticeable with Olivia de Havilland starring in the traditional role of the beautiful, warm-hearted heroine, and then seeing Leigh's haunted, bitter and vengeful character appearing opposite her in contrast. I especially liked Clark Gable, who exudes charisma from every pore.The production values are immaculate, the supporting cast don't put a foot wrong, and the ultra-lengthy running time flies past thanks to the viewer's involvement in the events that unfold.

"A sweeping epic film, that in my eyes is outstanding!","Gone With the Wind is a truly remarkable epic film. True, it is four hours long, but there are several redeeming qualities that make it an unforgettable movie experience. The cinematography is gorgeous, with a wonderful contrast of beauty (love) and ugliness (war), though the war scenes could have been a tad more developed, if that is a minor offering of a criticism. The costumes are lovely, especially Scarlett O'Hara's dresses, and the music score is phenomenal, with a sweeping unforgettable title theme, that possibly everyone in the world knows. The performances were astonishing. The beautiful Vivien Leigh gives a tour de force performance as Scarlett, a performance of vulnerability, sadness and beauty. Who can't forget her passionate outbursts ""Great Balls of Fire""? Butterfly McQueen is hilarious as Prissy, with lines such as ""I don't know nothing about birthing babies"". But topping them all, in a natural if somewhat unlikeable performance as Rhett Butler, is the wonderful underrated Clark Gable, with his iconic remarks (""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn""), hearty laugh and sneer. This film was ignored for a long time, and is now considered one of the most remarkable films ever made. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
One of the Greatest,"A perfect epic movie with a great story and a superb playing cast and one of the biggest productions imaginable. Like Ben Hur and War and Peace a classic for all eternity.A world is going down, a new world is rising out of the ashes of the gone - melancholy, fear, the sacrifice, and hope of a whole generation fighting and suffering in the Amercian Civil War.In our troubled times, where war and terror are present almost in every corner of our world and in times where the status quo seems to be a faster and faster-going constant stream and faster-going flow, where nobody can be sure or predict what the future ahead may bring to us, a movie more relevant than most people think.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Clark Gable was a great actor,"This movie is a bit too melodramatic for me. I don't usually watch romance movies.However, I have to admit the cinematography is pretty nice. There are some really good images. The high points for me were the civil war scenes and especially Clark Gable's acting. He is really good, I love his sarcasm. His character was really really charismatic. Imagine RDJ's Tony Stark, dialed up to eleven.
The main actress was also pretty good. There is some interesting character development.All in all, I think it deserves a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone With the Wind,"Scarlett (O'Hara) Hamilton: ""I could dance with Abe Lincoln himself!""Margaret (b Atlanta) found a porcelain pin among the post-war rubble, scrubbed it clean, set it on the mantel, began to dream, put that to words and called it Gone With the Wind.What do you write about a four hour epic showcasing maybe the most beguiling leading lady (Leigh), commanding lead man (Gable: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!""), charming characters (Melanie Mammy) in arguably the best film ever made? Whatever it is, you keep it under 3000 words.If you're of the PC persuasion, have feelings easily hurt or think the classics are just so much cinema snooze, don't bother watching. But if you've a warm heart, like its strings tugged on a bit, understand historical context, know the difference between a documentary and movie, you'll find the time needed to drink-in this sweeping, familial Civil War drama is very well spent. Others could've played Scarlett, no doubt to good reviews (Davis Oberon Goddard), but only Vivien could've been Mitchell's buoyant belle, clearly the central character, though, a mistake to've penned a sequel titled in her name alone (Ripley) (91) for the 2d half of GWTW is really Rhett's story. He's the grounding, Tara firma as it were, the love, unrequited it may be, and yet, it's the meaning of the Ashley character that makes it one of the most curious. Leslie Howard (d 43) balked at playing the hesitant Wilkes who may be Mitchell's nod to Lee, learned men clinging to a corrupt code who struggle with divided loyalties, choosing state (VA) over nation (USA), Wilkes engaging the additional battle of love (Melanie) vs passion (Scarlett).Those with a hidden agenda will have you believe in the absurd, that producer Selznick, he of Jewish heritage, sought to sentimentalize or make monument to the CSA and slavery. The plain truth, easy enough to see by those who watch film with an eye for entertainment and art, is that David O, along with directors Fleming, Cukor & Wood, elaborately portray the pain of life and circumstance, a treatment for which pharmacology holds no monopoly of patents but for which movies offer some relief.Political correctness the new Red Scare, Blue, as it were, a power grab no more progressive than the red variety was patriotic. It makes blacklists, kills classic art and business responds as it did in the 50s with fear, rather than education and dialogue. Non-conformity is still the crime, charged un-American then, racist in the new millennium. As corporations own the rights to most vintage movies and their target market, youth, typically have no interest in such art, expect holders in coming years to edit or remove from sale & display, classics broadly deemed unsuitable by the PC police, likely leading to creation of a 30s style (pre-Code), illicit film genre called pre-PC, for those that survive.If you've a boycott bee in your bonnet because of unpleasant characterizations (Prissy) & historical telling of events, consider, when Big Sam saves Scarlett at the bridge and Rhett does mix & mingle with Mammy over bourbons (it didn't win her the Oscar but surely won Hattie the esteem of her race, he, gratitude of visionaries), the film's makers are firing off an early round for Civil Rights. Does Gone With the Wind romanticize events? Of course it does (""Cavaliers""), and that's why it's called cinema (4/4).",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
No other movie makes me more divided..,"I watched GWTW for the first time in the late 90's. I have to admit that as teenager I was quite disappointed. This is considered one of THE movies of all time and I found it hard to enjoy for a number of reasons.The lead: Scarlett O'Hara is not a likable character. She is selfish and egocentric and just mostly annoying. Since then I have to a degree learned to enjoy a little bit her will power but the character will always remain a disappointment to me.""Edit 210810: Since writing this review I have realized that Victor Fleming wanted Scarlett to be depicted in a quite bad way since she was a Southerner. I never thought of that before and that makes sense.. It doesn't change my opinion about the movie but I understand why its lead is what she is. End edit""The acting: I know it was the melodramatic way in those days but it's just not natural. First few scenes I watched I could hardly believe it since they felt SO overplayed. Since then I have watched a lot more old movies and learned to accept it but still..Ashley: Leslie Howard was a great actor but miscast here and he felt so himself. According to several sources he was also completely indifferent. To this day I can't understand that David O'Selznick thought that was the best choice for the part.But there are of course also reasons why this probably is the most famous movie of all time.The photo/scenery: for 1939 nothing short of absolutely sensational. Hard to believe really and decades before it's time.The soundtrack: also, put into context, one of the greatest of all time.To a degree, the story: yes it is a ""civil war soap opera"" but the story is quite ok and some of the characters rather interesting.So.. since that first viewing I have actually come to enjoy it for what it is. It will never be a favorite but it fascinates me more than many other movies.Of course I have to finish talking a little bit about the racism issues because of BLM as well.I get it. I get what annoys people about this movie. Still.. I feel that the criticism is exaggerated and IS exaggerated because of the fame and praise for this movie.Because I don't feel blacks are badly portrayed or mistreated in an unacceptable way. Ok, I know they complain about stereotypical portrayal and ""happy slaves"" but I don't really agree actually.. loyal servants more than slaves, absolutely, but happy? Was that kind of relationship never the case in any household? Were slaves always treated badly by their owners and beaten etc.? In some cases, absolutely, but who wanted to watch that in 1939? Would it have been a better option to show the owners torturing their slaves than showing a decent relationship? To me, I doubt it.. And the movie is still set during the civil wat so there WERE slaves.. as tragic as that fact is.I know that Selznick put a lot of effort in trying not to affend anyone and I think he did a decent job no matter the criticism of today.By the way, you can also argue for the fact that Southerners were portrayed as naive and smug going into that war with such limited resources and also that the Yankees were bloodthirsty barbarians who just killed everyone in their way. About that there is not much talk..Finally.. to put things in perspective there is one other classic movie that I will never watch because of its obvious racism and that is ""Birth of a Nation"". From what I have learned it's unacceptable even by 1915 standards. GWTW has its flaws but it's not even close to that level and again, considering it was made 1939 I think it is a decent watch on all levels.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Gone With the Wind,"This is by far one of the best movies ever made in American film history. It is great in every way a film can be great. With me being a history major, particularly interested in the Civil War, this film really does it for me. The tough part of the film for many is how it starts. It starts out during a time period where slavery was legal and the plantations where plentiful in the south. People were pretty naive that were part of the privilege and the rich class. Historians have had a problem for years with the beginning half of the movie because to a extent it glorifies the life of the southern from the plantation owners to the slaves even being somewhat grateful and dependant on their owners. This film shows show this very much. But the film is more then that. It illustrates the horrors of the war. People fighting in the war and the effects it has on the families involved. So many people lose their loved ones and end up in property, forever changing the south. This is definitely a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

A Study in Scarlett,"GONE WITH THE WIND (Selznick International, in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Victor Fleming, is the screen adaptation to Margaret Mitchell's best selling 1936 novel. Subtitled ""The Story of the Old South,"" it stars Clark Gable in his iconic role of Rhett Butler, but it's Vivien Leigh, the British actress, who plays its central character, Scarlett O'Hara, whose practically in every scene from start to finish. As much as this could have been titled SCARLETT O'HARA, GONE WITH THE WIND became the chosen title, though one of its most famous lines, ""Tomorrow is Another Day"" might have been sufficient. With a cast of thousands, produced in Technicolor, it also includes one of the most memorable scores ever conducted by Max Steiner. For baby boomers of the 1960s to 1980s who have never seen GONE WITH THE WIND would recognize the scoring best as the introduction to ""The Million Dollar Movie"" on WOR, Channel 9 in New York City. This is where the score and the legend of Scarlett O'Hara all began.The plot, told in chapter form, begins in Tara where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), popular with many suitors as the Tarleton brothers (George Reeves and Fred Crane), but actually Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). Ashley loves his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland), whom he intends to marry. Scarlett, daughter of Irish proud plantation owner, Gerald (Thomas Mitchell) and wife, Ellen (Barbara O'Neil), has two other sisters, Coreen (Ann Rutherford) and Suellen (Evelyn Keyes). The O'Hara's also have their Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) who has not only served the family, but becomes an crucial part in Scarlett's life. Before Ashley goes off to serve in the Civil War, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother, Charles (Rand Brooks), who soon makes her a widow. Scarlett becomes the interest of Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a man with questionable reputation, having been expelled from West Point. After the war ends, Scarlett, being the sole factor of looking after Melanie and her newborn baby, tries keeping her plantation home from Jonas Wilkerson (Victor Jory) through his high taxing by marrying Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye), who dies, leaving Scarlett to take charge of his lumber business. Scarlett's marriage to Rhett Butler and daughter, Bonnie Blue (Cammie King) comes only as his hope for her to change her affections from Ashley to him. Co-starring Ona Munson (Belle Watling); Butterfly McQueen (Prissy); Harry Davenport (Doctor Meade); Jane Darwell, Laura Hope Crews, Isabel Jewell, Alicia Rhett, among many others.While this production could have been told through two separate movies, with its sequel titled TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY, GONE WITH THE WIND, along with opening and closing overture, has the distinction of being the longest movie (225 minutes) of the 1930s. Some may claim the first half to be better than its second, or visa versa. As much as the plot elements differ from the novel, the final results proved favorable to make this as one of the greatest movies ever made. Along with Academy Award wins, including Best Picture, (Best Actress) Vivien Leigh, (Best Supporting Actresses) Olivia De Havilland and winner Hattie McDaniel), etc., Gable, who was nominated, didn't win. Though nobody can play Rhett Butler best than Clark Gable, a role he was born to play, he being in and out of the story through long stretches may be one of the reasons of his loss. Filled with memorable scenes too numerous to mention, the ones that stand out most the burning of Atlanta; Scarlett becoming prettier through the passage of time; Scarlett's catch phrase of ""Fiddle Dee-Dee,"" but nothing comes off best as Gable's closing line.When GONE WITH THE WIND first played on commercial television in November 1976, it was a big event, having been reissued in theaters many times after its 1939 release. Distributed on home video in the 1980s and later DVD, it had played on various Ted Turner cable channels, notably Turner Classic Movies since its humble beginning in 1994. Currently restored, TCM is where the movie is going to stay. (****)",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
This is an all time great American cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see,"Gone with the Wind (1939) is a movie that was my grandmother's all time favorite film that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the struggles of a young lady with a lot of pride and moxie and love for money and fortune and the lifestyle that goes with it. She resides in the south as they are about to head into the civil war, during the civil war and as the south initially emerges from the war. She, like most of the south, experiences lots of tragedy because of the war but she does a lot of it to herself. This movie is directed by Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz) and stars Clark Gable (Mutiny on the Bounty), Vivien Leigh (A Streetcar Names Desire), Barbara O'Neil (Tower of London), George Reeves (The Adventures of Superman) and Fred Crane (A Gay Amigo). The storyline for this picture is absolutely incredible with the characters being so dynamic, unpredictable and stubborn. The backdrops and landscapes were beautiful and well shot. The cinematography for this age was impressive - every set, house details, dress and prop was magnificent. The troubling circumstances honestly made me laugh, like the characters were getting what they deserved based on their beliefs. The action scenes, various fights and gun shots were great. There were so many dramatic sequences in this that were mesmerizing and well executed and really keeps the audience glued to the movie despite its run time.

Gone With Vivien Leigh.,"When a group of women who called themselves The United Daughters Of The Confederacy heard that the role of Scarlett Ohara might be going to an Englishwoman they felt offended. Then when they heard that the role might go to Katherine Hepburn they changed their tune. ""Better an Englishwoman than a Yankee"", they said. Without a shadow of doubt, ""Gone With The Wind"" based on Margaret Mitchell's best seller remains one of the greatest movies ever made. Vivien Leigh was not only a great beauty she was also a great actress & gives a fantastic performance as Scarlet Ohara. Everyone who had read the book had said that the role of Rhett Butler just had to go to Clark Gable, even though Selznick International Pictures had to make heavy concessions to the MGM Studio for his services. Gable, himself, was somewhat reluctant to accept the role because he realised it was a ""woman's picture"" & he might not live up to expectations. He did, of course, & the rest is history. Despite endless rewrites of the script & a change of director from George Cukor to Victor Fleming it all worked out well in the end. When Victor Fleming took over he is reported as saying the script was ""no effing good"" & ordered another complete rewrite. Max Steiner wrote a really marvellous sweeping musical score for the movie, another of its strong points. Possibly the most memorably famous scene in all movie history takes place about halfway through the movie to Max Steiners music known as Tara's Theme. With the confederacy destroyed by war & Scarlet Ohara's home Tara also ruined she stares angrily up to the heavens & makes her ""As God Is My Witness"" speech. It is wonderful stuff & this a wonderful movie.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Golden age of Hollywood (even with the whitewashing),"I can't add much more to the reviews that handbooks on filmmaking haven't already. It epitomizes the golden age of Hollywood. It's grand. It's a technical marvel. It has the most iconic romance since Romeo and Juliet. Clark Gable, and Vivien Leigh has more quotable lines than anybody else. Is there a better line than Rhett Butler's ""No, I don't think I will kiss you, although you need kissing, badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.""? It is bigger than a simple movie.However, the more modern critiques have centered on the treatment of the slavery issue, and the general whitewashing of that 'civilization'. It's a fair criticism, but it misses the times and the subject matter. The movie isn't about slavery. It's a fable of its times. I won't be subtracting any points. I don't want to add retroactive morality to my review.Most of the black characters are noble subservients in the movie. It's understandable to object to the portrayal. However, Sam is one of the more heroic persona. Other than Priss and the carpetbagger, they weren't stupid or mean spirited. I think the best description is whitewashing. They covered up the brutality, and gave it a nice gleaming coat. For its times, I don't think we can expect more. Slavery in The Patriot (2000) was marginally more realistic than this. To me, that seems much more egregious.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
pro-Confederate travesty of history,"This move travesties the history of the war and especially of the Reconstruction, which was not at all the disaster that pro-Southern historians and their sympathizers would have us believe.

Such scenes as the one in which the director has an African-American character riding along in a carriage singing Marching Through Georgia are obviously meant to inspire bitterness and resentment in the viewer, and the Federal troops are uniformly portrayed as brutes. This is nothing but polite version of Birth of a Nation--at least so far as its politics go.",1.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

One of the all-time greats,"As a millennial, it is important for all fellow millennials to remember to not watch this film from a 21st century perspective. In order to appreciate Gone With The Wind, or any old classic film, one must watch it from the perspective of the period it was filmed as well as the period it describes. Certainly, the portrayal of the African-American characters is very dated, but that takes nothing away from how these roles were performed. Furthermore, while most today would disagree with the film's sympathetic disposition towards the south during the Civil War, everyone can agree that Gone With The Wind does an incredible job of highlighting the monumental costs of a war - the loss of lives, the strain put on those left behind afterwards, and the horribly wasteful drain of resources, money, and emotion that a war causes for everyone involved.Another thing Gone With The Wind did extremely well was to abandon the traditional roles of heroes and heels and instead blur those lines, showing the good and bad qualities of every character. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler spent his entire life as a slimy, womanizing sleazeball, yet demonstrated numerous times that he has a huge heart. Vivien Leigh as Scarlett was a very selfish, crass, and heartless person, yet showed the strength and resilience to persevere through any hard situation thrown her way. Olivia de Havilland portrayed Melly as an incredibly warm, caring, sweet individual who cared deeply for everyone around her, but suffered from naïvety and an inability to truly care about herself. Just to note for Olivia fans, this role is a must-see because it was the first role that removed her from the standard ""beautiful girl pursued by the lead man"" roles that Warner typically gave her, and it truly gave her an opportunity to show off her acting chops like never before. Leslie Howard's Ashley was the strong war hero yet was too weak to fight off Scarlett's continuous tempting advances. Last to mention but certainly not least was Hattie McDaniel as Mammy. She may have been portrayed as an uneducated house slave, yet several times was the smartest character in a scene.There are a couple characters who could've been done better, though. Victor Jory was a brilliant heel character actor, and Jonas Wilkinson was one of the few true heels in the film, yet he was confined to just a handful of scenes and was quite insignificant overall. Butterfly McQueen as Prissy was insufferable. It's not clear who told her to act like that or why they did, but her lines almost exclusively consist of screaming and extreme overacting, and her scenes are extremely painful to watch. She does have one worthwhile moment in the film though - to avoid a complete spoiler, just watch her lips.Perhaps the most impressive thing about Gone With The Wind is the cinematography. The color is gorgeous, and the HD copies of the film available today make it look like it was filmed just a few years ago. The use of thousands of extras in the outdoor hospital scene was very impactful. The fire scene was absolutely brilliant. Long-distance shots are used perfectly throughout the film. If someone wasn't told what year this film was made, it is highly doubtful that anyone would guess it dates all the way back to 1939. It could easily pass for the 90s. It looks THAT good.Overall, this is one of the all-time greats of classic film. Gone With The Wind is a must-watch for all classic film buffs!",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Winds of war,"The fact that as at my time of writing, ""Gone With The Wind"" stands only at number 152 in the best movie rankings of this site, I hope might be mainly attributable to the relative youth of the posters here. Here surely is Golden Age Hollywood's lasting monument to itself, which like another big-subject civil war movie from a previous generation (D W Griffiths' ""Birth Of A Nation"") while politically flawed in its treatment of black people, nevertheless stands as a significant and magnificent piece of movie-making.It's a film I'd dearly love to see on the big screen but all my viewings of it so far have been on TV which can't begin to do justice to the scale and colour of the achievement here. I know there's some contention about who directed which parts of it but I'm going to give my kudos to Victor Fleming who I believe did the lion's share of the work behind the camera. The sets are magnificent and the set-pieces even more so with several jaw-dropping scenes which are testament to artistic imagination and technical achievement in equal measure. Of course the two most celebrated of these I suppose are Rhett Butler's rescue of Melanie, Scarlett and Missy just ahead of the burning edifices of Atlanta and the rising dolly-shot of the wounded and dead of the Confederate Army as Scarlett seeks out Dr Meade.But let's not forget the acting too, especially the two leads who are both terrific, Gable, in his greatest role, is mean, moody and magnificent, while Vivien Leigh in her Hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as the wild, wilful and wonderful Scarlett O'Hara. While the characters of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes seem almost too good to be true (Ashley's guilty feelings for Scarlett aside), they are nonetheless beautifully played by Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland. Hattie McDaniel belies the racial stereotyping of her Mammy character to deliver an unforgettable, often scene-stealing performance.It is difficult today to witness some of the political incorrectness of the treatment given to the black characters, in the main shown as subservient, excitable and slow-witted, not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds in the film (Big Sam saves Scarlett from being raped, while Mammy effectively acts as the conscience of the film) and it is dreadful for modern ears to hear the ""d"" word spoken so casually if only sparingly.However I'm not going to criticise the movie for that when there's so much good to praise. It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one. It's been many times said and written that 1939 was probably the year that more great movies came out of Hollywood than any other, but this one outdoes them all. And most other films since, come to that...",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

A great American classic,"'Gone with the Wind' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, mainly because they are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and Scarlett become friends.The movie is set in the time of the Civil War. What happens exactly with Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland, Clark Gable is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do, but she makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest performances I have seen.Besides the story and the acting we have the music, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography and of course the direction. It is all great.

twenty twenty two,"Gone With the Wind is a title that has been stuck in the back of my mind for as long as I can remember, although I had never watched it until recently. I had preconceived notions of the film, I thought that it would be not only incredibly boring but ignorantly racist as well. And while I cannot deny the obvious romanticism of the Civil War era that was not historically accurate, a product of its time, this movie was anything but boring. For a film made in 1939, the visual and performance aspects of the movie are incredibly impressive. Vivian Leigh's performance as Scarlett radiated off the screen to depict the vivacious, determined and selfish southern belle, whose disillusionment of love and greed is what led her throughout the movie. This performance is just simply unparalleled even today. Gone With the Wind's ability to stay relevant and the highest grossing film in 2022 is extremely impressive.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Scarlett Dreams,"Producer David O Selznick offered Margaret Michell $50,000 for the rights to ""Gone With the Wind"". That was the highest amount paid for a first-time novel at the time. Selznick wanted Clark Gable in the lead role, but because the star was busy, Selznick was forced to postpone the film for two years. The producer used the waiting time to search for the right actress to play Gable's love interest.The movie is set in the American South against the backdrop of the Civil War. It tells the story of the strong-willed daughter of a plantation owner and her romance with a handsome, but roguish racketeer.Finding a suitable candidate for the female lead would prove more difficult than expected. More than 1,400 women were tested before Selznick decided on a young Vivien Leigh. The choice of director was also problematic. George Cukor started the film, but after a few weeks he was fired and replaced by Victor Flemming.In fact, everything about ""Gone With the Wind"" was big and complicated. For example the destruction of Atlanta. The film crew burned many old sets that needed to be cleared from the studio lot, including the great wall from ""King Kong"". The fire was so intense that Culver City residents jammed the telephone lines, thinking the whole MGM Studio was burning down.At the Academy Awards ""Gone With the Wind"" took home eight Oscars. Among them Hattie McDaniel became the first African-American to receive the accolade, beating out her co-star Olivia de Havilland. David O Selznick won an Oscar for best picture.Tragically, ""Gone With the Wind"" overshadowed the rest of Selznick's career. In an interview shortly before his death the producer said that he felt that he had wasted his life trying to outdo it.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Mother of all soap operas,"Unfortunately Gone with the Wind remains a most overrated film in history. It tells us a story of a spoiled, egoistic girl, incapable of loving anybody but herself, ready to do anything to have her stomach filled. What is her turning to Rhett for money to restore her Tara but a kind of walking the panel? If that's a heroine what are the nation's morals? Unfortunately it is Vivien Leigh that saved the film. If it were not for her nobody would have noticed this run-of-the -mill production. It has no cultural or intellectual worth. At least it has no story to tell the world. I am sure that American history could have furnished a film crew with a better plot or a more breathtaking love story. Only incurable pragmatics can learn something from this film and this is how to kill a human being in oneself to earn money. Scarlett is a failure and a disaster in everything, she couldn't even look properly after her own child. If she had had an eye open for her daughter nothing of the kind would have happened.

"If you ever (thought you) wanted something you couldn't have, you need to watch this film","Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex.Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not.The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done.This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally ""got"" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A Snapshot of History On Film,"Th the story of the South and the Stiff neck society is perfectly isolated in film forever. This film is NOT about race, but about a period of TIME, a portrayal of the lifestyle of the South at that time. Rhett is a Profiteer, Scarlet a hopeless spoiled romantic, the upper crust despising a ""slave auction"" of white women to raise $ for ""The Cause"". And Hattie McDonald... the portrayal of a Loving, caring, nurturing outspoken mammy. (Which is a Derivative if MOMMY). This movie need be watched as an example of a Moment in time. Of an impolite society doing its best to be ""polite"" under false pretense. It HAS HISTORICAL VALUE. The costumes, the settings, the burning of Atlanta.
Margaret Mitchell had it right, this is an Epic story with which each subsequent viewing enlightens one on the understandings of human nature and self-determination. Hattie Mc Daniel is the best, Butterfly McQueen May have portrayed a stereotype... however we MUST view this story as an epic almost mythological tale of the beginnings of Civil Rights.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Review,"One of the most noticeable things the audience noticed about the film is that it is about 4 hours long. I know I was intimidated before I watched the film that I might not like it or it might be boring. Let this review ease your suspicions or doubt and watch the film. I believe one must watch Gone With the Wind at least once in their lifetime to truly appreciate the history of film. Nowadays, I would compare this film to a four part series that was just combined into one. It feels like binge watching an entire TV show on Netflix.A brief summary about the film is that it centers around Scarlett, a country maiden in the south who goes through the challenges of the American Civil War. Along with the struggles of the war she manages to find a way to be taken out of poverty while being in a love triangle. Scarlett faces some tragedies towards the end but it all helps her character develop throughout the plot. The movie is not some documentary about the war but a story about a woman in love who goes through obstacles to understand herself. She is a flawed character in the beginning and I think it is fair to allow the audience decide whether they like Scarlett or not. It would not be interesting if everyone in the theaters were to think the same about a character. It becomes more fun if other people are able to form their own opinions and enjoy a conversation about it.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

From the expansive Southern landscapes to the opulent costumes and sets, the viewer is transported to a bygone era, brought to life by the masterful cinematography and impressive production design.In addition to its aesthetic brilliance, the film also deals with themes such as racism, class differences and the consequences of war, making it a captivating and profound work at the same time.

I find a subtlety that I believe is overlooked.,"Gone With the Wind (85th Anniversary Special)Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel, Gone With the Wind, was so popular when published, that it was quickly released as a 4 hour epic film in 1939, even after production delays. 85 years later, Fathom Events released it to theaters for a special engagement and I was fortunate enough to attend a screening. More time has passed since the movie came out, than the time between the end of the war and the movie (74 years).What makes this story horrible is what is not told. If you are going to tell a story of ""nostalgia"" for a different time, when prosperity and high society were the norm, then the cost of such fantasy must be laid bare. The few black characters in the story are either dimwitted, prone to hysterics, or the wise old Mammy that knows her place. Prosperity came from the horrible treatment of slaves justified as it was for their own protection due to their inferiority or childlike ignorance. None of this is shown in the film, and it is no wonder white people in 1939 declared the film a triumph.Regarding the main white-washed story, the themes are not what, I believe, the filmmakers intended. Selfishness, arrogance, ruthlessness, jealousy, rudeness, schadenfreude, and willful ignorance abound. Is this the Old South that people miss? Really?The horrors of war are not to be understated, and they are very much not. The war comes through Atlanta, burning its way to the sea, just as history tells it, leaving behind a horrible wake of wounded, death and grieving families. It is so hard to watch and imagine what it was like in that time period where there were simply no resources to help the people in need. The famous scene where the camera pans back to show the hundreds if not thousands of dead and wounded in the street makes me cry every time.However, we have our main character, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, the eldest daughter of a wealthy Irish immigrant, who is as selfish as they come. She strings along suitors only to pine after one, Ashley Wilkes, who is now unavailable as he is to be wed to Melanie Hamilton. There is a well shot scene where Scarlett wanders sullen through the crowd at a party, not noticing that war has been declared. There is no concern of men's lives, only her own petulance at being turned away. That evening she impulsively agrees to marry Melanie's brother Charles just to spite Ashley. What? When Charles dies in the war, all Scarlett cares about is a good time and dancing, which widows aren't to do. She doesn't give Charles a second though.Our second main character, Rhett Butler, is also introduced at the same party. He has the good sense to issue a warning to the men (boys) that their lifestyle of sloth, funded by the slaves beneath their notice, show an arrogance that will be their undoing. They are untrained and outgunned. But, Rhett is no saint himself, making money when it benefits only him, including blockade running. He sees something in Scarlett that mirrors his own unsavory character, and is intrigued.The real tragedy in the love story is poor Melanie. She, whether naively or intentionally, never knew about Scarlett's pursuit of Ashley. She is always by Scarlett's side, treating her like a sister, and always vouching for her character, never seeing the true Scarlett.A real hero comes in the form of a prostitute, Belle Watling. She donates to the cause, even though the source of the funds is looked down upon by continued arrogance. She hides people so they aren't hanged. Melanie tells her to her face how good of a person she is. She serves as a metaphor that the caste system is seriously flawed, and a person's purpose need not be defined by someone else.I feel that Scarlett was written as a metaphor for how the Old South truly was, while the daydreams of garden parties and dancing swirl around her. Selfishness, lack of empathy, blind to struggles except her own, lusting for something that could never be, blaming others for her problems and then disdain for those that brought defeat paint a more accurate picture. Are we supposed to cheer her on when she vows that she will continue her selfish pursuits because tomorrow is another day? After Ashley finally becomes available, and Rhett no longer is, that's the exact moment she realizes she never loved Ashley? She always wants something she can't have, even if she already has it.Why do I love this movie? Observing the historical accuracy as subtlety in the background, even when surrounded by gross inaccuracies and racial stereotypes in the foreground. Seeing the horrors of war without actually witnessing any battles. Watching each character stay stuck in the past, while the world changes in the background. The chapters of the past closing through the forms of Melanie and Rhett. And Mammy's side-eye. Boy do I love that.This is not a love story. This is a farewell, and frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn what you do next.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

"GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, it's terrific!","There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than ""Gone with the wind"". It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs, but, despite all this, it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece. Completely NOT overrated.I love this movie. I can't explain why exactly. There are sooo many reasons. I first saw it when I was a little kid and still can't forget it.It's so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than 100 times... And GWTW is this kind of a movie.In my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good. And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!I will start with the supporting players. Barbara O'Neil, though only 28 while filming, played mother of quite adult daughters. She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book: so stative, so smart, so lady. Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald O'Hara portroyal, and I think he did not just because he won for ""Stagecoach"" that year. Scarlett's sisters are really well cast. But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniel's. She is simply magnificent, moving and unforgettable as Mummy. Just amazing.Many people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley. They may be right in some sense, but let's think it over twice. Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him, but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new, cruel world. And Howard showed this quality as best as possible.Of course, Olivia de Havilland's performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniel's, but later on she was given what she deserved (Oscars for ""To each his own"" and ""The Heiress""). She plays Melanie with such a sensibility, but she manages to show her hidden strength, but not in a dominate way. Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life. I think that he was a great actor. He's so real as Rhett, and he has to play several dramatic scenes. And he does it perfectly-remember that playing those scenes, like those after Scarlett's miscarriage, needed acting talent. He's perfect. But, I won't hide my opinion that Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie. Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown. She managed to master the Southern accent as well. She did not play Scarlett. She WAS Scarlett. But only in this movie. She never acted any other character the same way. She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchell's Scarlett possesses. I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it, and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch, so they fought about it badly, but, finally, Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obvious.If you love good cinema, if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old, though almost 70!, do not miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"""Sir, you are no gentleman."" ""And you, Miss, are no lady.""","GONE WITH THE WIND is an epic melodrama which is very difficult to describe. Considering the thirties this movie is something most original in the history of cinema. Institution. The true magic of life. Of course, the term ""magic"" I think everything that lives in a certain time pass. I'm a little disappointed because I think it is in the final hour of an epic spectacle given the characteristics of the classic soap opera. This movie is full of freshness and strange irony. The irony of the film no one escaped, at least a ""gentleman"" in the American South. The horrors of war are quite credible. The arrogance and pomposity ""Southerners"" are completely the opposite of the characteristics of the main characters.Gone with the Wind is a love story at the time of the Civil War, in which each in its own way serves some human punishment.Although I am aware of racist moment that really exists in the film, I would not have acted rudely. Although the ""slaves"" happy and complex, their characterization is not at all realistic. This is best seen when they become part of the romance or love affairs of their ""masters"". The film is quite delicate and subtle. Some erotic themes are, to the extent permissible content, quite convincing.Set design, costume design, framing, story, theme and music are top notch. From the first sequence can be seen magic and suggest that this movie is very expensive.Gable (Rhett Butler) and Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara) are excellent.

"Amazing Film every generation needs to see it, Can't be remade","""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy and free the slaves as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. But we've known that for years; the tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 60th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well. For the story it wanted to tell, it was the right film at the right time. Scarlett O'Hara is not a creature of the 1860s but of the 1930s: a free-spirited, willful modern woman. The way was prepared for her by the flappers of Fitzgerald's jazz age, by the bold movie actresses of the period, and by the economic reality of the Depression, which for the first time put lots of women to work outside their homes. And there is a joyous flamboyance in the visual style that is appealing in these days when so many directors have trained on the blandness of television. Consider an early shot where Scarlett and her father look out over the land, and the camera pulls back, the two figures and a tree held in black silhouette with the landscape behind them. Or the way the flames of Atlanta are framed to backdrop Scarlett's flight in the carriage. Some of the individual shots in ""GWTW"" still have the power to leave us breathless, including the burning of Atlanta, the flight to Tara and the ""street of dying men"" shot, as Scarlett wanders into the street and the camera pulls back until the whole Confederacy seems to lie broken and bleeding as far as the eye can see.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

But not Selznick's terrific sense of drama and certainly not Vivien Leigh's performance. Which seems eternally fresh, surprising, rich and compelling. One of the best times I ever had watching this movie was several years back when it was given a wide re-release and playing at a neighborhood theater on New York's west side. It was a midweek afternoon and a number of African-American schoolgirls had elected to play hooky and see it. They were completely enthralled, and the reason why was Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara. They were impulsive teenagers, and so was she. In fact Scarlet might best be described as the most formidable impulsive teenager of all time. Can't really be sure how much of the rest of the film got through to these girls, but they cheered Leigh on for whatever it was she wanted to do. And who can blame them?",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Compelling story, iconic moments, and fantastic production value - but in a toxic context","A movie that's certainly worth watching, but it's hard not to be conflicted, and it's a tough one to rate.Positives:Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are outstanding in their roles of these two selfish people, who, while difficult to like, spiral around each other and deliver iconic Hollywood moments. He recognizes they're cut from the same cloth and loves her for it, she sees the same thing and hates him. A sexual current runs through their relationship from the first time he undresses her with his eyes, and she remarks ""He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy."" Later he'll tell her ""You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how,"" and it's clear without saying it when he helps her what he wants in return (after all, he's ""not a marrying man""). Gable's character is perceptive throughout the movie, and he's an interesting mix of rogue, gallant, bemused observer, and doting father.The filmmaking is extraordinary, particularly for 1939. There are exquisite scenes in glorious color, and the soundtrack is fantastic. War-time shots in the first half, like the horse and carriage escaping a massive fire, the one of all the wounded laid out, and the operation are memorable.Hattie McDaniel is a delight to watch in the role of Mammy, the tough-minded servant who tries to keep a proper sense of decorum and the willful Scarlett in line. While some criticized her for taking a stereotypical role (similar to the criticism Anna May Wong suffered), this was the part available, and it was a step forward for her to take it, own it, and win an Oscar. Special favors had to be called in just to allow her to get her in to the Cocoanut Grove nightclub for the Oscars, and even then she had to sit in the back at a small table. I recently visited her simple grave in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, where she was buried instead of Hollywood Cemetery because she wasn't allowed in to the latter. She was discriminated against even in death, and it's important to remember that racism and segregation weren't just occurring in the past, or only in the Jim Crow South.There is a feminist message in the strength of the two main female characters. Scarlett is manipulative and shallow, but she's also tough and a survivor. She makes it through bleak times, shoots a ravaging Union soldier in the face, and at one point while trying to run a business ""Great balls of fire! Don't bother me anymore, and don't call me sugar!"" Similarly, while Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) can be almost maddeningly pure, seeing the good in everyone despite their obvious evil, she acts as an almost Christ-like role model.Negatives:There is no point sugar-coating this: the movie, and the book it's based on, is racist. It perpetuates the horrifying myth of the loyal, docile, and simple slave. These smiling African-Americans have no interest in freedom, and in the few scenes they're in, they look simply like employees of Plantation, Inc. The character of Prissy is feeble-minded and helpless. The film tried to avoid controversy and be as neutral as possible, but what we see for the most part are essentially cartoons.From its opening credits, the movie perpetuates a myth about an entire way of life, that the South was noble and filled with honorable people, and now sadly all of that is gone. Historically this is inaccurate, and morally it's outrageous. And yet, 70+ years after the war, this was the narrative, with a message diametrically opposed to that of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'. The slaveholders are shown to be kind and thoughtful aristocrats, and it's instead the Yankee carpetbaggers who are portrayed as cruel and vicious. Deviations from the book are apparently rather modest, but one major one is Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) and another character no longer being members of the KKK; instead they go off to a 'political meeting'. Before the war, Ashley says that ""Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars, and when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about,"" as if this particular war fit that case - being fought over for some vague reason. After the war, he says without a hint of irony ""I will not make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others."" Even Scarlett points out the hypocrisy, but it's as if this male voice, this Major in the Confederate Army can't bring himself to mention slavery or race issues. This is consistent with the shameful Southern apologia that has never truly been dissipated, recent statue removal notwithstanding.In addition to my problems with his role, Leslie Howard does not fit here. He does not seem like a Southern gentleman from the period at all, and does not bring nearly the authenticity that Gable brings in his scenes of passion. In an otherwise fine cast, he is quite weak.The second half of the movie is far too melodramatic, and practically a soap opera. To some this is faithful to the book, entertaining, and helpful to create an epic feel to it all, but to me it's overdone, and artistically sloppy. It also leads to a bloated four hour run time, and I think it would have been more powerful condensed.Summary:
The film is insidious because the story, its characters, and its production value are all so compelling, and yet the background context is so toxic. Can we mentally set aside those gigantic elephants in the room, and forgive it? Is this like a romantic Southern version of 'War and Peace', where we note that in his epic, Tolstoy didn't write of the ownership and oppression to serfs? Can we see it as the viewpoint of a defeated secessionist country, and understand what de Havilland would say in an interview years later - that ""All countries have experienced war and defeat. And survival. They can identify with that film for, I think, that reason."" It's tough. Very tough. I can neither love not despise this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Golden Age Hollywood at its zenith,"What may be the most famous movie of all time is also one of the more purely entertaining epics ever made, although part of its astonishing longevity is because the film is much more than just another antebellum potboiler.

But in the end the film belongs to Scarlett, and her rocky path to maturity, from her old plantation home through the siege of Atlanta to rags and later riches after the Civil War, makes the mammoth four-hour long production pass all too quickly. It's easy to see what made Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel such a hot property at the time: Hollywood in the 1930s shared with the Old South similar ideals of wealth and privilege (and, in the studios, a similar plan of institutionalized slavery), and the film matches the grandeur of its subject by oozing pomp and prestige from every lavish Technicolor frame.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Directed by Victor Fleming and produced by David O. Selznick, this film has a screenplay by Sidney Howard, based on a novel by Margaret Mitchell. The cast is headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.The story of this film is well known, so its difficult to spoil it. Scarlett is a rich, spoiled and capricious girl who likes parties and flirtations but loves Ashley Wilkes, engaged to her cousin Melanie, which awakens in her enormous jealousy. The hardness of the American Civil War destroys the world in which they live and forces the two cousins ​​to help each other to survive, achieving that with the help of Rhett Butler, an industrial bachelor with very bad reputation that falls in love with Scarlett. Following are the efforts to rebuild everything that the winds of war destroyed.Vivien Leigh became, thanks to this, a film legend. Far from being a damsel in distress, her character solves the problems faced thanks to her tenacity and willpower. Its undoubtedly one of the strongest female characters of classical cinema, and makes a perfect match with the bluntness of truculent Captain Butler, played by Gable, one of the biggest heartthrobs that cinema known, famous for the many romances that he lived with most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. In fact, when this film was being shot, the most malicious voices wove several conjectures as to a probable passion between them, but the truth was more funny: the two actors didn't like each other and Leigh even criticized Gable because of his bad breath. And although Gable have hated this movie, the truth is that he has become immortal thanks to it. Olivia de Havilland, another great actress, shone in the role of sweet and kindhearted Melanie, and Leslie Howard did great success as Ashley.Try to analyze the technical aspects of this film is very impressive and shows us the artwork that it is. Hundreds of participants, thousands of horses, costumes designed to recreate the look of the historical clothing. The country scenes are fabulous and some of the war scenes are deeply moving, like the scenes where Scarlett help in the military hospital or the famous Scarlett's oath scene. One of the most famous sequences is the fire of the military barracks, where real fire was used, making the scene more realistic and truly anthological. Bright colors make the movie even more beautiful, from a visual point of view, and the soundtrack, of Max Steiner's authorship, is exceptional. The main theme is easily in the ear, having become one of the most famous songs of the cinema.For all these reasons, this movie immediately gained a huge popularity and is, today, one of the most profitable and popular films ever.

There would be no ""Star Wars,"" ""Ben Hur,"" ""Titanic,"" or ""Lord Of The Rings"" Trilogy if ""Gone With The Wind"" had not been such a grand achievement. Every frame of the film drips with sheer perfection. The sets are grand, the acting marvelous, and the direction impeccable. My favorite thing about ""Gone With The Wind"" would have to be the cast. Hattie MacDaniel was marvelous as Mammy, Olivia DeHaviland heavenly as Melanie, Leslie Howard great as Ashley, and Clark Gable is sheer perfection as Rhett Butler. Last but certainly not least, Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.Every time I watch this film,and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come.Footnote: I really enjoyed the sequel called ""Scarlett"" especially the climax. My sister encouraged me to watch but silly as it may seem I felt a sequel to this masterpiece was sacrilegious.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Great movie. Campy. 1939. Fiction. Not a documentary.,It's not a documentary. It's a campy great classic movie filmed in the 30's. It's fiction. No reason for all this.Terrible what the Academy Awards did to Hattie McDaniel.,10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
All Time Best Movie Heads South,"For decades this picture remained #1 on virtually all lists of the best picture ever made as well as the all time box office champion. Suddenly though, the film's reputation heads South. I won't elaborate on the excellence or entertainment value because whatever I say you already know. GWTW was bounced off the box office list primarily because movie prices are never adjusted to constant dollars, thus the newest pictures always win. When GWTW opened in 1939, the admission price of $1.15 was so severe that some theaters had picket lines of protest. In 1939 a good middle class annual income was $800, so $1.15 was indeed expensive. Compare that to today's $10.50 and you see who wins. As to the film's reputation for excellence, this has been trashed in recent years because (1) the film portrays slaves during the Civil War era --- and this is shocking to the political correctness crowd; (2) the slaves act like slaves rather than acting like Snoop Dogg, Ice T, or even Sidney Poitier; another outrage to liberal censorship. The wacky left American Film Institute has thus dropped America's All Time Great Movie from #1 to it's current standing in the trash heap. Thinking people, however, still appreciate and love this classic. For the record, this picture was intensely popular with Black people when released in 1939, again in 1941, in 1954, in 1961 et cetera.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"""A civilization gone with the wind...""","In my opinion this is a movie that has them all, a movie that will remain without an equal, even if a lot of time passed since its release.This happened because of the period when the movie was made and shown to the public, an era in which a conservative society was yet far from the atrocities of WW2 and all the new ideas that spread before its end.Is a movie with great pictures, great images, color-full, pictorial while portraying an almost Utopia world, yet an idyllic one, where all the things were settled, time was passing by so slowly and so calm with all the people living and breathing their lives in a breeze of peace.Is a story like no other about the Old South, a story about a certain vision about the world, a vision we may applaud or condemn but nevertheless we should see and understand and we must be glad that we can observe from a distance another vision about living, about society, about human relationships, about master, servants and what can become of them.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
I can't seem to understand the love surrounding this movie?,"OK, just watched this whole movie! One of the only things i can think about it is how extremely long it is! if this movie had been half the time it actually is it probably wouldve been an amazing movie in my opinion! but the length destroys the whole movie! This movie is really not that interesting, with the exception of a very few scenes through it's runtime. It is impressing for its time, that was about the only thing i thought was really strong with this movie. I think this movie is very overappreciated, and trust me, i have done my fair share to understand the love for this movie, but the only thing i can do is to respect the movie, but only because, as i said earlier, it was impressive for it's time. Clark Gable's performance was also something that made this movie a little better, but it was not really anything special with the performance.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Probably the most overrated film in history,"I gave this film 1/10; I would have scored it a perfect 0 if there was the option.  I'm probably doing the film a disservice given that much, much worse films have been made.  A true reflection of this film would probably be somewhere closer to 4, but I feel an obligation to counterbalance the thousands of perfect 10 scores from people who regard this as a ""timeless classic.""  Anyone who considers Gone With the Wind a timeless classic should ignore the fact the it's an old film highly rated by emperor's-new-clothes types and ask themselves what they would think of a modern equivalent: an extraordinarily overlong film with a meandering, muddled storyline punctuated with cheesy dialog and hammy acting and done on an ""epic"" scale because the budget allows it (It's starting to sound like Titanic! Another zero).",1.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A True Classic,"A movie should not be judged purely on its level of writing skill and overall deftness. For that, we have TV shows, which are more apt for this kind of judging alone based on their lower budgets and overall format. No, a movie should be to a large extent judged on its ability to take your breath away, to leave you as a different person than you were before and make you feel like you've gone on an epic adventure. That is why many of my favorite films of all time are epics.That is why The Wizard of Oz is not on my top 100 movies of all time list and this is. Strangely enough, those two movies form a dichotomy. TWoZ, with its color and fantasy plot, was a harbinger of things to come. This film, which is openly a wistful remembrance of the Antebellum South, was a send-off to the past.Yes, one could consider this film problematic for reasons, particularly racial ones, that I have absolutely no desire to discuss in the content of this review. I will just say that if you are going through movies that are artistic pinnacles yet troublesome when viewed with modern glasses, you could do a lot worse. Check out The Birth of a Nation if you want to see why. Still, say what you want against this movie in that regard.But do concede that viewed from an artistic viewpoint, the viewpoint that I always prefer to talk about a movie from, it is a triumph. A sweaty, bloody, four hour, epic triumph. When I watch this, I feel like I have been given wings and a time machine and told to just go.There is a reason this film has not inspired as much as did The Wizard of Oz. Actually, there are... quite a few reasons for that. But I'm talking about the scale. It's the same reason there are far more Potter wannabes than true LOTR wannabes. Whatever reasons you state, they do make a difference. The Wizard of Oz inspired many light fantasies to come. This didn't directly inspire very many notable films at all (with the notable exception of Barry Lyndon, but i'll talk about that movies creepy similarities to this one when I discuss the former).Combine that with the fact that three-hour-plus epics are as rare as dinosaurs nowadays, and you get a movie that is unique, different, and separated from the culture in which we know live. This fascinates me. Around the two-hour mark, when Scarlet rides off from a burning city, I felt emotions few movies have made me feel. Inspiration via the stunningly shot landscape, the best of many beautiful ones in this movie. A true sense of scale; the movie is only half over, but I get a feeling that I've been through so much already. Change; the winds of such were certainly in this scene. Romantic. Depressing. Hopeful. And wholly cinematic. It is the kind of scene that doesn't exist in film any more. The closest that you get is a television special. And if you can't find the beauty in that, ""Well frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.""The characters are timeless. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is suave and sophisticated yet fallible. I have seen many failed attempts to show a character like this, so it is refreshing to see it done right. It is like going to the mountains after driving through New Jersey. What so many movies get wrong about these kinds of characters is that they are not just striking and, for lack of a better term, cool. They are that way for a purpose. To use a common and only slightly disconnected example, people would not be such big Han Solo fans if Han was a construction man.Yes, that's more of an aesthetic analysis than a character one. But without aesthetic and presentation, there is nothing to wow our senses as our brain works through the plot of the film. And for this film, there is a lot of plot. What I love about these longer movies is that they don't end on the climax. Many moviegoers nowadays don't have the patience for this technique, but it's one of my favorites. If they made a four hour LOTR movie when it first came out, it would have had The Scouring of the Shire, one of my favorite chapters in it.But it is a good choice from a narrative standpoint as well. A story has five basic stages. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Many tales forget the fourth in favor of a snappy resolution. But it is my personal favorite step, one I like to call 'The Hero Goes Home' step. Rarely has it worked as well as it does in Gone With the Wind. You feel the entire plot arc of the main character.Who the main character is deserves special mention in my eyes. It is Scarlett O'Hara, a young Southern belle who has to adapt to a changing social climate. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a female is rare. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a villain or anti-hero is rare. Yet this film, released in 1939, not a year known for its liberated climate, had both. I don't know whether to applaud this film or tear down so- called modern film for this. Maybe I should do both. It certainly makes for a more interesting story narratively speaking. Scarlett is, in my opinion, the most interesting of a posse of complex characters.So ends this review. I sincerely hope it did not take you as long to read as it did to watch this movie. Now go forth back into your lives. Because tomorrow is another day.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
No doubt it deserves its status as one of the best of all time,"I've seen this movie twice already. It is very popular so there's really nothing new I can say.All I know is that it is one of the most powerful and gorgeous movies I have ever seen.From the very beginning this film moves you, the music and the visuals are stunning, and it begins with a text that has one of my favorite phrases of all time ''Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind''Just reading that, you know you are in for quite the journey. An 85-year-old film that it is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Seriously, the visuals and the costumes in this are unlike anything you've seen.Excellent performances from everyone. Vivien Leigh is unbelievable. The scene when she says ''I'LL NEVER BE HUNGRY AGAIN'' is simply masterful.It is very melodramatic and theatrical, that's not inherently a bad thing, but if you're looking for an extremely serious and realistic film, then this is not for you; there's no denying however that although its style and tone are very dramatic, this movie has tons of heart and soul. It is also 4 hours long, but the runtime is completely justified.

Magnificent,"""Gone With the Wind"" from 1939, is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Directed by Victor Fleming, this epic historical romance is an adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, and it showcases a remarkable blend of grand storytelling, stunning visuals, and unforgettable performances. The film boasts an outstanding cast, with Vivien Leigh delivering a career-defining performance as the indomitable Scarlett O'Hara, a role that became iconic and cemented her status as one of the greatest actresses of all time. Alongside her, Clark Gable shines as the charismatic and complex Rhett Butler, offering a perfect balance to Scarlett's fiery personality. The supporting cast, including Olivia de Havilland as the warm-hearted Melanie Hamilton, Leslie Howard as the conflicted Ashley Wilkes, and Hattie McDaniel, who made history as the first African-American to win an Oscar for her portrayal of Mammy All contribute significantly to the film's emotional depth and richness. The production is nothing short of magnificent, with the stunning cinematography by Ernest Haller and the lavish set designs creating a visually stunning portrayal of the antebellum South and the Civil War era. The sweeping landscapes and intricate details of the sets transport viewers into a world that feels both grand and intimate. Max Steiner's lush, unforgettable score enhances every moment, perfectly complementing the drama, tension, and romance that unfolds on screen. From the iconic opening title sequence to the emotional conclusion, and everything in between, this is a film that captivates at a deliberate pace with its bold ambition, emotional resonance, and a level of artistry that continues to inspire filmmakers and audiences alike. The film's meticulous attention to detail in every department, from costume design to its epic battle sequences, has made it a true landmark in the history of cinema, leaving an indelible mark on the industry and culture that endures to this day. This is exquisite and magnificent storytelling at its very best, and despite its length, holds one's attention throughout, amazingly some eighty-five years since its release. This basically swept the Oscars and each one was well-deserved. Unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Flawed, dated, but a classic nonetheless!","1 - I didn't see anyhting wrong with it. Politically correct has gone to the extreme. I have my ideals and convictions, but too much is just too much. This is a movie held as a classic, based on a classic of world literature, telling a fictional story that takes place in a specific era of US history. That's it.2 - The movie is dated. Acting, soundtrack, certain parts of the script; it all may have worked back in 1939. Not anymore.3 - I loved the cinematography and the complexity of the story and the characters. Clark Gable was amazing as the morally ambiguous Rhett Butler. Vivien Leigh was great, though I couldn't feel at times she went OTT, but I guess that's due to the (slightly unnatural) way of acting of the era. The first 90 minutes were a solid 5 stars. Then it started to drag a little bit. The final 30 minutes or so were amazing.Overall conclusion: It's not a perfect movie, dated, a product of its time, but it is a a great movie nonetheless. A classic everyone should watch at least once in the life.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone with the Wind was a bad movie!,"Wow. This was a bad movie. I can't believe this is one of the ""best"" movies of all time. I always had my reservations about David O. Selznick and now that I have seen his epic ""masterpiece,"" I can see his fingerprints all over Rebecca. I am a huge fan of Hitchcock and always wondered how much he was overruled in the making of that film. I will wonder no more. I can't imagine why anyone would like this melodrama. I laughed more than I have at some comedies. I could not keep a straight face as the movie Scarlett argued with Mammy to make her green velvet dress. I was taken back to Carol Burnett's fantastic portrayal of Scarlett walking down the stairs with a curtain rod stuck in her dress. I can't say much for the acting, Leigh and Gable left much to be desired. Hattie McDaniel was great, besides the other African Americans that made up the cast, that was it. The only good thing about this movie was that it gave African Americans speaking parts and was one of the only post code films in the late 30's the 40's and much of the 50's that was shown in the South that gave African Americans speaking parts and showed them in the movie. Many films of this time did not. I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE!",1.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone with the Wind,"Watching now ""Gone With the Wind"" again is captivating for the fearlessness with which Hollywood believe the sublime was possible. A towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well. The vision the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation is first place..!? The main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background... Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love which is captivating ..!? The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie. One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency..!? Admiration to the greatest nation in the world..

Unfortunately lost on today's dumbed-down pop/hiphop culture,"And that is truly a shame. Fans of revisionist history should stay away. You'll only be offended by the somewhat historically accurate and faithful adaptation of a time and culture you don't understand, and haven't been affected by. The only issue I have with this film is the portrayal of post war reconstruction with all the central figures of the story emerging after the war as prosperous businessmen-please! But then again that's not what Hollywood's all about,is it? Still a very powerful and relevant film. And while I'll admit that Miss Scarlet is a completely despicable character, no one can question her strength and spirit as she grows from spoiled a and sheltered socialite, to survivor, warrior, and cold hearted mercenary.

Selznick's Big Epic Resonates with 1930s Feminism,"The timing of the release of December 1939's ""Gone With The Wind"" was perfect for inspiring the battered British during the opening year of World War Two. Scarlett O'Hara's physical and mental persistence in the face of near total destruction of her hometown Atlanta and the rebuilding of Tara plantation in Georgia during and after the Civil War became emblematic of what the English faced daily from aerial bombardments in the German Blitz during the summer of 1940 as well as the mounting casualties of its soldiers overseas. The epic film opened in the United Kingdom four months after its premier, and was so popular a number of theaters continued playing the motion picture during the duration of the war.Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel, 'Gone With The Wind,' about a spoiled daughter of a wealthy southern planation owner, was more than just a simple Civil War story; it reflected on the maturation of a young woman going through harsh wartime conditions and exerting her independence in the process. Mitchell was describing the emerging 'new women' of the 1930s who were gaining increasing confidence in the working world compared to generations before. ""Scarlett O'Hara is not a creature of the 1860s but of the 1930s: a free-spirited, willful modern woman,"" notes film critic Roger Ebert. ""The way was prepared for her by the flappers of Fitzgerald's jazz age, by the bold movie actresses of the period, and by the economic reality of the Depression, which for the first time put lots of women to work outside their homes. She sought to control her economic destiny in the years after the South collapsed, first by planting cotton and later by running a successful lumber business. She was the symbol the nation needed as it headed into World War II; the spiritual sister of Rosie the Riveter.""""Gone With The Wind,"" considered by many as the greatest movie Hollywood has ever produced, is cinema's highest grossing movie (accounting for inflation). It had won more Oscars in the history of the Academy Awards during its release as well as in the next twenty years. The David O. Selznick-produced film continues to enthrall modern day viewers, unfolding stirring scenes of the annihilation of the ante-bellum Southern landscape by Union troops in the midst of a weepy triangular soap opera romance between Scarlett, Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes. The movie redefined how screen epics were produced.Mitchell's novel looked at the Southern experience before, during and after the Civil War, creating a buzz in Hollywood even before it was published. Independent producer Selznick paid a record $50,000 for a never before published writer for the book's movie rights. In the next three years, Selznick's pubic relations department spun stories about the progress of one of cinema's most highly-anticipated movie, highlighted by the search of the actress to play Scarlett O'Hara. Over 100 hired talent scouts scoured live theatre stages, drama schools and colleges to search for the 'perfect' lead actress. They interviewed over 1,400 mostly unknown professional and amateur actresses answering the casting call, and flew four hundred to Los Angeles to do a reading. Thirty-one were screen tested, and just two were filmed in Technicolor, Vivien Leigh and Paulette Goddard. The two-year search cost nearly $100,000. Writer Mitchell favored Miriam Hopkins, 37, but she was deemed too old for the role of Scarlett, aged in her early twenties.Selznick leaned towards Goddard, who nearly received the O'Hara role. But her relationship with Charlie Chaplin created some uneasiness, and her New York background went against Southern sentiments. That didn't stop the producer, who had the final say, from considering British Vivien Leigh,a client of his brother Myron, the owner of a talent agency in England. Selznick was impressed by her presence when she attended the filming with her boyfriend, Laurence Olivier, on the MGM Hollywood studio lot to watch a reenactment of the burning of Atlanta. A month later, after a series of screen tests, Selznick rationalized in selecting the British Leigh, stating, ""Scarlett O'Hara's parents were French and Irish. Identically, Miss Leigh's parents are French and Irish."" Once chosen, she along with other major cast members were given multiple voice lessons on how to speak with a Southern accent.The choices for the role of Rhett Butler was much easier. Gary Cooper and Clark Gable were a toss-up, but eventually Cooper admitted he wasn't the bit interested. Upon hearing Gable was Selznick's strong candidate, Cooper predicted the movie ""was going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I'm glad it'll be Gable who's falling flat on his nose, not me."" Gable himself wasn't all that excited about the part either, describing it as a ""woman's picture."" The actor was burned from his previous historical period film, 1937's ""Parnell,"" his biggest movie flop ever. However, the unusually high salary he was paid allowed him to divorce his second wife, Maria Langham, giving her a nice settlement which allowed his marriage to actress Carole Lombard to finally take place. The two wedded in March 1939 during a break in 'Wind's' filming. Later, when his career hit a trough, the re-release of ""Gone With The Wind"" rejuvenated his marquee popularity, with studio offers coming his way again.Actor Leslie Howard was also apathetic about his role as Ashley Wilkes, who marries his first cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland) even though Scarlett wants to ensnare him in her web of love. At 46, he felt he was way too old to play Scarlett's love interest, saying ""I'm not nearly beautiful or young enough for Ashley, and it makes me sick being fixed up to look attractive."" His character, at 21, required him to wear extra make-up and a light brown hairpiece. Selznick persuaded Howard to take the part by making him co-producer for 1939's ""Intermezzo: A Love Story,"" Ingrid Bergman's first Hollywood film. Howard never bothered to read Mitchell's book, describing the novel a ""terrible lot of nonsense.""
""Gone With The Wind"" had as many as eight directors handlng various film crews and scenes, with Victor Fleming pulled off directing MGM's 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz"" to replace George Cukor, the original lead director. Cukor wasn't happy with the constant revisions of Sidney Howard's script after spending nearly two years working on and off the movie. Selznick felt he was too slow filming his scenes after just three weeks and felt he was incapable of handling the sprawling epic scenes. Leigh and de Havilland, who enjoyed working with the nicknamed 'Hollywood's women director,' were devastated by the decision. Cukor continued to coach both actresses behind the scenes, but Fleming directed most of the movie until he relinquished the reins due to exhaustion to Sam Wood. A rejuvenated Fleming later returned to finish the primary filming. Set designer William Menzie was credited as a ""Production Designer"" for both his artistic settings as well as directing the second unit, including scenes of Scarlett returning to Tara during the war. Menzie earned an Honorary Award from the Academy for his use of color to increase the movie's pictorial mood, such as the sunsets highlighting the film's many emotional moments. Stuntman Yakima Canutt directed the sequence of Scarlett and Rhett's daughter little Bonnie falling off her horse and dying. Even Selznick had a hand at directing. The producer also hired more than one cinematographer for ""Gone With The Wind."" First was Lee Garmes, who was released after the first four weeks because his filming was ""too dark,"" according to Selznick. He shot the first third of the film right up to when Melanie has her baby. Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan then handled the bulky Technicolor cameras Selznick leased, all seven of them, at one time every color camera in Hollywood. The two handled the famous crane shot capturing the mass of Confederate soldiers, half of them prone dummies seen in the frame, who were injured in the rail yard while Scarlett is looking for her family doctor to help Melanie deliver her baby.Before Leigh and Gable were even hired, Selznick's film crew shot the Atlanta burning scene. Decaying old sets sitting on the MGM lot, including the massive wall in 1933's ""King Kong"" as well elaborate but faded sets from 1936's ""The Garden of Allah"" contributed to the mass burning. Los Angeles Fire Department's equipment and personnel were on standby while several stunt people filled in for Gable and Leigh. The forty acre fire blazed so high, towering over 500 feet, Culver City residents jammed telephone lines reporting MGM's studio was burning down. Three 5,000-gallon water tanks doused the flames after the scenes were filmed.""Gone With The Wind"" cost nearly $4 million to produce, the third most expensive film yet, trailing only 1925's ""Ben-Hur"" and Howard Hughes' 1930 ""Hell's Angels."" So taxing was her role, Leigh smoked four packs of cigarettes a day (Gable puffed on three packs daily himself.). Fortunately her first scenes scheduled to be shot were the opening ones where she appeared fresh, wearing a white dress to symbolize her virginity and innocence. Leigh was so visibly worn as the production progressed she needed a break to recuperate. To see how thin Leigh became, house servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) tightened her corset around her 18-inch waist. In 2001 ""Moulin Rouge!"" Nicole Kidman tried to replicate Leigh's feat on film, only to suffer cracked ribs and sustain internal injuries.At a preview of ""Gone With The Wind"" three months before the official December premier, Selznick decided to show a rough-cut in a Los Angeles theater which happened to be playing Gary Cooper's 1939 ""Beau Geste."" The surprised audience gasped when they saw the opening, and when finished its viewers gave the film a standing ovation. Selznick, in attendance, was described by his biograph.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Sold gold work - then, now and forever","The life and loves of a spoiled Southern rich girl living in fast changing timesHard to know where to start with a film of this sort and this magnitude, other than to say most of the things written about it are true. And given that whole books have been written about it - that is a hell of a lot of things.This David O Selznick produced movie not only became an event, but moved the whole art of cinema up to the level of great literature or painting. Even watching today you cannot help, but marvel at the casting, script or action. Despite what it has been boiled down to by its critics (an overheated civil war romance?), so much happens in this film that you could call it almost an action film.Great work is more about perspiration than inspiration. Here nothing has been left to chance, the leads (Gable and Leigh) are absolutely perfect for their roles - no one could have been better cast. Equally every smaller part has a major talent playing them. This maybe the best cast film of all time. Casting costs would make it impossible today.Yes - it is a woman's picture - and yes again - it has elements of soap opera about it. Watching three hours of anything can be hard work (some TV showings break it in to two parts), but it is well worth it.Despite not being in my own top ten of all time favourite movies (others simply appeal to me more), ignoring what this represents in terms of technical achievement and entertaining the masses/generations would be folly.

Gone with the Wind Review,"Gone with the Wind (1939), directed by Victor Fleming and based on Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, remains one of the most iconic and controversial films in American cinema history. Set during the American Civil War and its aftermath, the film follows the tumultuous life of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), a strong-willed Southern belle whose personal and romantic journey unfolds against the backdrop of the South's cultural and economic collapse. The film is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, loss, survival, and the legacy of slavery, with its stunning visuals, memorable performances, and tragic characters leaving a lasting mark on the film industry.At the heart of Gone with the Wind is Scarlett O'Hara, whose character is both compelling and divisive. Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett is nothing short of iconic-she captures both the character's fiery ambition and her vulnerability as a woman navigating a world in chaos. Scarlett's obsession with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man who is emotionally unavailable to her, contrasts with her eventual relationship with Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the charming and cynical outsider who loves her despite her flaws. Their volatile, passionate romance is the emotional backbone of the film, and Gable's portrayal of Rhett is equally unforgettable, bringing depth and complexity to a character who could have easily been reduced to a mere heartthrob.The film's production design, costumes, and cinematography are all extraordinary, contributing to its status as one of the most visually stunning films ever made. The vast landscapes, the opulent antebellum homes, and the dramatic battle sequences are all beautifully rendered, and the sweeping musical score by Max Steiner perfectly complements the grandeur of the story. The film's famous opening shot, with the image of Tara, Scarlett's family plantation, remains one of the most iconic visual moments in cinema history.However, Gone with the Wind is not without its criticisms, particularly regarding its portrayal of slavery and race. The film presents a romanticized and often problematic view of the antebellum South, where enslaved people are depicted in subservient, stereotypical roles, and their suffering is minimized in favor of a nostalgic, idealized view of the ""Old South."" The portrayal of Black characters, especially Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), is a point of contention, as their lives and struggles are largely sidelined in favor of Scarlett's personal drama. Although McDaniel won an Academy Award for her role as Mammy, the film's depiction of African Americans has been widely criticized for perpetuating racial stereotypes and glossing over the brutality of slavery.Despite these issues, Gone with the Wind remains a monumental film in the history of American cinema. Its cultural impact is undeniable-winning 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and becoming the highest-grossing film of its time. While modern viewers may find its treatment of race and slavery deeply troubling, it also serves as a reflection of the racial attitudes of its era, and its enduring popularity speaks to its power as a piece of historical storytelling.In the end, Gone with the Wind is both a masterful achievement in filmmaking and a deeply flawed product of its time. It remains a fascinating, if uncomfortable, exploration of the South's legacy, love, and survival. The performances, particularly by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, the film's grandeur, and its dramatic narrative continue to captivate audiences, even as modern perspectives challenge its portrayal of history. It is a film that demands both admiration for its artistic achievements and critical examination of its cultural impact.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The Best Motion Picture of the 20th Century,"Easily the best film ever made, even in today's standards it holds up, beautifully shot, acted to a T, it has the best performance coming from Ms. Vivien Leigh, a true triumph. Some of the most commonly used lines used today come from this film, and also some of the most memorable lines, I mean who doesn't know the line, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" very taboo for that time...

Beautiful but ignorant,"In terms of drama and romance this movie is sort of a masterpiece but from a historical standpoint and considering the ignorant tone regarding the well-known social issues of that time, it's kina tasteless. It glorifies the southern army and depicts only caricatures of black servants. IMHO a movie whitewashing such serious issues shouldn't be considered as one of the greatest movies of all time no matter how high the production quality. So in a sense similar to Scarlett, the movie is beautiful to watch but ignorant about some important matters.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Less Sting, but Still Windy","The facts speak for themselves: a (to date) 62-year-old film; one of the all-time best box office grossers; enjoyed five major theatrical releases, including wide-screen versions; VHS, laser disc, and now DVD transfers--and three major restorations.Folks are still talking about it: debating its value-- agreeing, disagreeing, agreeing in part but taking exceptions... It's quite a work that David O. Selznick and his superb production company fashioned.On the purely technical achievement side, there's almost unanimous consent that the film is a historical milestone. After that, opinions are beginning to vary.There's evidence that some folks today aren't quite as smitten by it as in the 40's through, say, the 60's.  They're beginning to take note of some of the sociological implications, as the narrative is told from the perspective of the land-owner/slave-owner/ruling/upper  class.  The narrative begs the audience to identify and empathize with this aristocratic echelon, and to see the beauty and grace of this society through the land owner's eyes.Well, some folks aren't completely buying that perspective any more. They're starting to think about the sweat, tears, and broken lives upon which this aristocracy has built its so-called genteel world.  They're also beginning to embrace characters and situations untold here -- while applauding such efforts as Alice Randall's 2001 spinoff/parody (""The Wind Done Gone"") to at least help set records straight.Of course, there are many tales told from the perspective of the ruling class, whose power has come from the enslavement and domination of others. So it really depends upon how the viewer tends to see things.  One has a feeling, though, that GWTW will continue to be viewed with an increasingly suspicious eye, as years pass.There's also a feeling that it will remain a ""classic,"" being a genuine marking point in cinematic history as to how films were made.

Enduring classic,"""Gone with the Wind"" stands as an enduring classic in cinematic history, and its timeless appeal is owed to its exceptional storytelling, compelling characters, and groundbreaking production.Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, the film unfolds with sweeping grandeur and meticulous attention to detail. Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara is nothing short of iconic. Her performance is a masterclass in acting, navigating Scarlett's complex character arc with grace and depth. Leigh's ability to convey resilience, vulnerability, and determination adds immeasurable richness to the film.Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is the perfect foil to Leigh's Scarlett, creating an on-screen chemistry that sizzles with tension and passion. Gable's charismatic performance contributes to the film's enduring romantic allure, making Rhett Butler one of cinema's most memorable characters.The film's production values, particularly its cinematography and set design, were groundbreaking for its time. The sweeping landscapes and grandiose scenes are visually stunning, contributing to the epic scale of the narrative. Max Steiner's iconic musical score further enhances the emotional impact, creating a timeless soundscape that resonates through the ages.""Gone with the Wind"" is not just a film; it's a cinematic epic that has left an indelible mark on popular culture. Its exploration of love, loss, and resilience, set against the backdrop of a nation in turmoil, continues to captivate audiences.

"Beautifully Shot, Utter Trash","Before I eviscerate this film, a word in its favor. This is, in many ways, a wonderfully shot movie. It is certainly a masterpiece of Technicolor, with lovely painted backdrops, etc. Much of the acting is, in my opinion, wonderful. Personally I think Scarlett as a character falls a bit flat, but beyond that I have few complaints. Except, perhaps, for the nearly 4 hour running time... but hey, people like an event, I won't knock them for it.That being said, here are a few problems I have with the film: note that some of these objections could easily be answered by turning to the censorship of the period, but I don't see that as much of a response.1. It ""whitewashes"" slavery. From the very beginning the film takes cheap-outs to avoid difficult and real subjects. In the beginning, the overseer's impregnation of the ""white-trash woman"" is clearly a poor substitute for what they're really getting at, the rape of black women. The slaves/servants are portrayed throughout as stupid and or slow, or liars (Prissy for example). Without coming right out and saying it, a later reminiscence on the ""glorious past"" casts slavery in a similar light as Joel Chandler Harris, essentially as ""the laughing times.""2. Misogyny. Scarlett (letter anybody?) seems to make the key mistake of sexual agency, and of not knowing her place. Again and again it is drummed into our heads how ""evil"" she is for conniving to steal other women's men. Again and again it is driven in that women should know their place (Belle for instance, while noble, is clearly a ""fallen woman"" or a ""low woman"" who realizes her position and respects it). Ultimately Scarlett ""must"" pay the price.Sexual violence is also simply passed-over. The build-up to the ""rape"" scene (I'll call it what is so clearly is, non-consensual sex, aka rape) alludes again-and-again to what will come... what with Rhett and his ""if I want to come in, no door will keep me out"" tirade and demonstration. Bam! Kicks down the door. And what is Scarlett's apparent reaction to the morning-after Rhett has drunkenly raped her? Happiness?Again, I laud the film for its technical achievements. However, if you were born post-lib or raised by a feminist in the post Women's Lib years, or perhaps are a History major and not someone simply nostalgically wishing for a past that never existed as portrayed, I would urge a critical eye. I am reminded of a quote from Vincent Canby of the NYT regarding Liliana Cavani's ""The Night Porter"" and I hope my direct reference of the source will suffice for copyright purposes. To butcher his comment somewhat, I have just reviewed ""a piece of junk.""",4.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone With The Wind: My First Time View,"Producer: David O. Selznick
Director: Victor Fleming
Writer: Sidney Howard
Stars: Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel
3h 58min Drama, History, Romance melodrama.Gone With the Wind. My new number 1 Greatest American Movie (followed by The Godfather, Ben-Hur , Casablanca, Taxi Driver, Star Wars , Citizen Kane , Rebecca).""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy; as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. The tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 81th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well.Vivien Leigh stars as Scarlett O'Hara. In Gone with the Wind, She is always after something. She is fiery, stubborn, beautiful, and selfish, and won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal. When Scarlett O'Hara raises her fist to the sky and vows never to be hungry again, not only do we believe her, we understand her. Vivien Leigh's Scarlett , is one of greatest , most moving and varied , performance I've ever seen on the screen. A touchstone of great melodramatic acting. Rhett Butler is played by Clark Gable, a mustached, cocky, manly actor. Although Scarlett is the center of the film, Gable's intensity matches Leigh's. His ego seems to be competing with hers, physically wrestling hers on the screen. Their energy and passion rise up to meet the gigantic film. The supporting characters are lovely, too, especially Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's Mammy. She steals every scene she's in with her explosive line readings, and her compassion.
five-time Oscar nominee Olivia de Havilland's performance as the moral fiber of society, was absolutely compelling and as beautiful as see is.Tremendously impressive cinematic experience. From the amazing performances to Fleming's incredible direction and awe-inspiring images and music. This is a film that deserves to be experienced. A time-tested favorite,""Gone With the Wind"" 10/10Trivia about Gone With the Wind:The four principal stars were billed in this order: Clark Gable, followed by Leslie Howard (as Scarlett's obsessive love, the glum Ashley Wilkes) and Olivia de Havilland (as sweet Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's cousin), and then Vivien Leigh last with ""...and presenting"" -- that is, until she won the Oscar and it was changed to ""starring.""The film (originally rough-cut at 6 hours in length) was challenging in its making, due to its controversial subject matter (including rape, drunkenness, moral dissipation and adultery) and its epic qualities, with more than 50 speaking roles and 2,400 extras.Adjusted for inflation, no movie can match the $3.7 billion haul that Gone with the Wind's $390 million box-office receipts since its 1939 release would be worth in today's dollars. The film currently remains the box-office (Champ). Yes More Than #2. 1. Avengers: Endgame (2019). Box office: $2.796 billion.A nationwide casting search for an actress to play the Southern belle Scarlett resulted in the hiring of young British actress Vivien Leigh, although over 30 other well-known actresses had been tested or considered including: Katharine Hepburn, Miriam Hopkins, Susan Hayward, Loretta Young, Carole Lombard, Paulette Goddard, Margaret Sullavan, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Lana Turner, Joan Bennett, Mae West, Tallulah Bankhead, Jean Arthur, and Lucille Ball. In all, 1,400 actresses were interviewed for the part of Scarlett O'Hara, and 400 performed audition-readings. Although MGM star Clark Gable was expected to play the role of the dashing Charlestonian war profiteer Rhett Butler, Errol Flynn, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper were also considered for the part.The landmark film received tremendous accolades, more than any previous films to date: thirteen nominations and eight (competitive) Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Victor Fleming - the only credited director), Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), a posthumous Best Screenplay (Sidney Howard, along with collaborative assistance from Edwin Justin Mayer, John Van Druten, Ben Hecht, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Jo Swerling) - the first post-humous winner of its kind, Best Color Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Film Editing, and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel - the first time an African-American had been nominated and honored) and two honorary plaques, one for production designer William Cameron Menzies for the ""use of color for the enhancement of dramatic mood,"" and the other a technical production award for Don Musgrave for ""pioneering in the use of coordinated equipment.""Many of the five nominations that lost were unexpected: Best Actor (Clark Gable who lost to Robert Donat for Goodbye, Mr. Chips), Best Supporting Actress (Olivia de Havilland who was competing against co-star Hattie McDaniel), Best Sound Recording, Best Original Score (Max Steiner), and Best Special Effects. Its record of a total of ten Academy Awards wins held firm until 1959, when Ben-Hur (1959) won eleven Oscars. It was phenomenal that Gone With the Wind did so well, given that 1939 boasted some of the greatest American films ever made, including Ninotchka, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and Stagecoach.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Timeless classic that never gets old!,"Gone with the Wind is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a classic story of romance and the struggle of loving and being loved. My mom, sister, and I have watched this countless times together and it never gets old. The movie wouldn't have been successful without its stars. The main characters, Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh, Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, make the movie. They fell into the roles as naturally as breathing. The chemistry between the two makes their love story real to the audience. The struggle in the love relationship between Scarlett and Rhett begins when Scarlett is spurned by Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, the man she set her sights on to marry. She finds out that he is to marry his cousin Melanie, played by Olivia de Havilland, and Scarlett does not respond well to his rejection. Scarlett is a spoiled belle used to getting her way and she doesn't realize that she and Ashley are not alone in the scene where he rejects her. Rhett is asleep on the couch and awakens when she throws a vase at the wall in anger. From here on, Rhett and Scarlett engage in a game of cat and mouse throughout the movie. There are not many other movies to compare this one to. The only one that I can say even compares would be North and South. It is set during the Civil War, just as Gone with the Wind is. North and South showcases a well-known actor, Patrick Swayze, who plays Orry Main, the main character in the movie. It is a love story that also shows the struggles in life and relationships that people faced during the Civil War, much like Gone with the Wind. I feel that Gone with the Wind is definitely the better movie. Although it came out in 1939, it was way ahead of its time. The way that Tara was portrayed as a mansion, with its expansive lands and cotton fields made me want to live there. The lighting that was used in scenes helped to convey the feeling of the characters. For example, when Scarlett and her sisters had to work the fields, the lighting was dark and dreary. It effectively conveyed the feeling of despair and helplessness that they were all feeling. Another thing I noticed was the camera angles. One particular scene which stuck in my mind was when Scarlett was in Atlanta. You can see the destruction across the city. There are bodies lined up in the streets. The camera pans out and in the corner you see the rebel flag flying. I think that seeing that the flag was still flying after such destruction and loss was amazing. Gone with the Wind is a timeless classic that reassures me that in the worst of times, people still find a way to fight for something they love.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A Film of War Produced During Anxious Times,"Since I initially wrote this review on July 8, 2016, there have been no less than 135 additional user reviews of this film in only three years and six months. Some of these reviews are good and some are terribly written with no actual explanation of the writer's rating or opinion. On the ""helpful"" list, this review appears as ""number 60"", at least at the moment, so I have no idea how any IMDb reader will ever find this addendum. At any rate, if you have any interest in this film, I highly recommend the documentary ""The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind"", directed by David Hinton in 1988. It offers a unique glimpse of how a movie is made, not just any movie but an exceptional movie.
I am now writing a separate review of that documentary, which mercifully only runs for about half of the running time of the movie itself. As I state below, my one criticism of the film is its unnecessarily long duration, especially the disappointing second half which fails to sustain the drama and spectacle of the first half.In my view, this movie is primarily about a catastrophic war, specifically the American Civil War, and it illustrates how this war so seriously impacted not only two extended families but an entire region, the American South. It is particularly significant to me that this movie, about the horrors of a major war, was made in 1939, a time when much of the world had already been thrust into another major war, World War II, and when many Americans must have been considering the consequences of our country's potential involvement in that war upon their own lives, upon their own personal situations. The world had become a very frightening place in 1939, and, although the United States had not yet entered the war, many informed, educated Americans must have been very concerned and even anxious about the very real possibility that the raging conflict overseas might one day arrive on their doorstep, including all of the uncertainty, disruption, and physical danger that would inevitably follow.Some viewers may appreciate the love scenes and the soap opera aspects of this cinematic epic, but what I find far more compelling is the dramatic circumstance of the characters who are suddenly immersed, some willingly and others involuntarily, in the middle of the bloodiest and most traumatic war ever to occur on American soil. I agree with other reviewers who wrote that the movie is too long. I believe that at least one hour could have been cut from it without destroying any meaningful continuity. After the explosive action of the first half, the second half appears somewhat anti-climactic and even boring for me.This movie is dominated by the central character of Scarlett O'Hara, so powerfully played by a stunningly beautiful Vivian Leigh. All of the other characters, especially the males, seem to pale in comparison to her with the exception of two of her slaves, played marvelously by Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen, who both manage to upstage Scarlett herself, which was not an easy feat. I realize that these were indeed tough times for the State of Georgia, and one had to be strong and determined in order to survive in such difficult circumstances, but did Scarlett have to be ruthless to the extent that she would steal her own sister's beau, a man she did not even love but decided to marry only on account of the economic potential of his hardware store, including its promising lumber business? Some may say that she only did this so that Tara could survive. Would that alone justify her callous, almost inhuman, behavior?The scenes of beaten, war ravaged Atlanta are very impressive, especially for their time, and must have been a daunting task for the director, Victor Fleming. Although the music and frequent scenes of blazing sunsets behind dead trees have become clichés in time, I think that they were much more effective before ""Gone With the Wind"" became such a widely familiar cinematic classic to us. In many regards, ""Gone With the Wind"" has become a victim of its own huge success in the way that its most famous scenes, music, and characters have become too familiar to us and the object of constant spoofing, satire, and even derision. What a shame.To me, this is a ""must see film"", not only for Ms. Leigh's remarkable performance but for the historical drama that is so effectively portrayed as the South becomes tragically victimized by the very war that many had initially glorified so unrealistically. The reality of war's horror, conveyed so convincingly in this film, is its most important message. A world in a state of peace and prosperity must never be taken for granted. No one would agree with this more than Scarlett O'Hara herself, a casualty of a major conflict that she never wanted in the first place. Of course, Ms. O'Hara would never allow herself to be victimized by anything or anyone for very long. In any case, ""she's not going to worry about that today. She'll worry about that tomorrow.""",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
4 Hours. Nothing Really Happens,"I'm a big Civil War fan and I've seen most of the movies about the era except this. My aunt recommended it saying it was great. I rented it and started to watch. It's a love story! Not a war movie. But I watched it anyway.Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a stuck up, beautiful southern bell from Georgia and a gambling captain, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) falls in love with her. Most of the movie is just Scarlett sitting around complaining how she can't marry another woman's husband by the name of Ashley (Leslie Howard). But within the last half hour their child manages to die, they go to Paris, and sit around in a mansion watching Rhett get angry with Scarlett.I know the film was a breakthrough in film. The film does have its upsides. The filming locations selected were dazzling, the recreation of the escape from Atlanta was doen very well and Clark Gable gives off the sense of a true southern gentleman.

Gone With the Wind was a beautiful movie that so clearly showed the devastation of the Civil War and how during the Reconstruction the Southerners had to adjust to the abolishment of slavery. Although there are racist undertones and many of the African American characters are stereotypes, one has to take into account the time the movie was filmed and released, and the time it is depicting.

Just look at the cast - Vivien Leigh was the ideal choice and if you care to think about today's actresses, who could play the role better? Clark Gable was ideal as Rhett Butler and by today's standards, maybe a bit over the top in some scenes, but still excellent. Melanie, a very difficult part was played to perfection by Olivia de Havilland, while Hattie McDaniel's Mammy was brilliant. You can go through the whole cast and rate them so high.

Legendary history,"Gone with the Wind in 1939 is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema. Probably, everyone knows this classic. The picture leaves an unforgettable impression and makes the viewer think about many things. The film, which managed to win 8 Oscars, including the main awards for best film, best director, best adapted screenplay and a number of others.The picture presented the audience with the magnificent acting works of one of the most recognizable duets on the screen - Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, who played Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The story immerses the viewer in the era of the American Civil War and makes the main characters live their whole lives, feel all their emotions and feelings.The role of Scarlett O'Hara went to Vivien Leigh, who played her so flawlessly that she received praise from Margaret Mitchell herself, the author of the novel on the basis of which the film was created. However, the search for a suitable actress for this role was not easy. David O. Selznick was looking for candidates among many famous actresses, but they were all rejected. He kept looking until he found Vivien Leigh, then a little-known actress. Selznick recalls how Vivien looked at him provocatively from under her hat, and he realized that she was the perfect choice for the role of Scarlett.Some bosses who financed the film did not agree to the participation of an unknown actress in the project, but Selznick insisted on his own. As a result, Vivien Leigh became Scarlett O'Hara, and her acting was amazing. She embodied the image of the heroine so naturally and truly that she became the only true candidate for this role.Lee and Butler generate some kind of flawless chemistry on the screen. Their characters, sometimes so close, but more often absolutely unsuitable for each other, are forced to watch with interest the development of these relationships. Scarlett and Rhett have some common features, but she constantly lacks his foresight, sparkling humor (which is necessarily accompanied by a slightly malicious smile) and the ability to admit her mistakes. Rhett knows how to see through people, is always able to distinguish when a person is cowardly, and when he retreats reasonably, respects courage and does not accept recklessness, respects sincerity and does not tolerate greed. He observes from the side how fake people, surrounded by deception, find themselves in a whirlpool of dangerous events, where their lies turn into serious consequences.Rhett is far from stupid social norms, openly laughs in the face of old aristocrats and calmly smuggles through the blockade, earning money from it. He knows that society does not honor him, considers him a selfish and cynical person. But Rhett has seen enough to understand for himself that all these assessments are not important to him. He just appreciates honesty and true authenticity in people.Wars rarely leave good people alive, and after that the world lives in a new society. Scarlett from the first frames of this story presented herself as a greedy and capricious person, and the war aggravated these qualities. After the war, she changes noticeably, becoming envious and sometimes hypocritical, she is an egoist with a capital letter, a calculating person with a good share of cruelty. It seems that she has even learned to hate, and her rare acts of kindness are done either out of envy, or out of spite at all, or out of hot hatred for those for whom she does it. Yes. Once she sincerely loved: her dad, Tara, her daughter and even Ashley, but that girl left forever under the weight of her fate. In the finale, as I see it, Scarlett did not feel a shadow of remorse and love, she was rather not in love with Butler, but obsessed with his love for herself.Among the many interesting and notable characters in the picture there is a black nanny Scarlett - Mammy. It is simple and reliable, like the earth, and its naturalness is difficult to convey on the screen. Actress Hattie McDaniel coped with this task at the highest level and was awarded an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actress category, becoming the first black actress to receive this prestigious award. However, due to racial prejudice, she was not allowed to attend the award ceremony, which shows that even at that time discrimination was evident.In the story of ""Gone with the Wind"" we will meet many characters, each of which carries its own meaning and evokes different emotions in the audience. Some deserve admiration, some deserve contempt, some deserve respect, and some deserve pity. The ending of this story leaves a lot of space for reflection and discussion, causing controversy around the world for decades. But it is precisely in this uncertainty that the denouement lies: Scarlett, realizing the true value of life and realizing that she needs Rhett, tries to get him back. Whether she succeeds is up to each viewer to decide for himself. After all, as Scarlett herself knows, tomorrow will be a completely different day, and everything can change.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A classic!,"GONE WITH THE WIND is a classic film. The plot is set against the backdrop of white Southerners and against the 19th-century American South, it tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, from her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, to her marriage to Rhett Butler.Because the film is 4 hours and 18 minutes long, it is split into two parts. My mother has seen it and I have not seen this film at all, but this is the longest film ever made to win Best Picture, but was also the first movie in color.This film was nominated for 13 Academy Award nominations including: Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Editing and it won eight in the process. This film is just iconic and memorable.Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and the rest of the cast in this film are incredible and their performances are good and the screenwriters stay true to the book, but a lot of people complained about the very long run time, but I don't have a problem with the film.This film is remembered in today's popular culture and it's production has also been remembered today as well. It has been referenced, satirized, analyzed and dramatized and this film is just amazing and the poster of the film depicting Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's characters embracing in a scene from the film is one of the greatest movie posters I ever seen in my life and I like the poster.Overall, GONE WITH THE WIND is simply a classic. There is no other way to describe this film and it is an absolute smash hit. 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Classic for a reason,"This is possibly the peak of the studio style factory system of Hollywood with a strong willed producer forcing a huge project into existence. Selznick picked, hired, and fired so many people, put up lots of money, and made sure that a huge book was put on screen properly. Everything looks amazing with great technicolor and settings, even though the period was still color in its infancy.The acting is top notch although Butterfly McQueen is a massive annoyance every time she speaks. Leigh is a revelation having to go through so many emotions and not always be likeable.Now as to the historical aspects... yeah there's some stuff here that was out there even for the era. The picture of the south is a little too rosy and the attempts to sweep the horrors of slavery under the rug are off putting, but darn it all, the movie is sweeping, huge, epic, and well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
good,"It's probably as good an over-romanticised war drama can get. The characters are surprisingly complex, the visuals are gorgeous and the storyline has a lot to offer if you are willing to dive into it.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Maybe The Greatest Movie Ever Made,I think my biggest enjoyment with this film is the scale. The acting is even my favorite which is shocking considering how good that is too. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler is probably one of the greatest role choices of all time and don't get me started with Vivian Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara. The only criticism I have for this movie is probably how it is a little racist but other than that I can see no flaws. The music is so good I can't even explain it's genius. I haven't read the book by Margaret Mitchell yet but I totally will. I am just sad I couldn't get to it earlier but my point is this will stay down as one of my favorite movies of all time.,10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The GREATEST film ever,"This is without doubt the greatest film of all time and is a testament to the golden age of cinema. There is a lot of Ibsen in Scarlett O'Hara,you start off hating her but by the end you admire her for her strength,determination and grit. Clark Gable-what can I say,he just IS Rhett Butler.I am a bit confused as to why the film is ""racist"",Mammy is excellent,she is one of the only people who can control Scarlett, the reason the blacks' all seem very happy is that if the film had gone in to what they were feeling the film would have been a good 3 hours longer,it isn't a story about them so they had to be one dimensional. In fact the most racist thing in it is that all Irish people are not drunks,[the book is a worse offender of this]and Gerald is a main part of the story.My favourite bits are the tableaux of the red sky and THAT music, it makes the audience wish they were back in Tara and certainly aids the understanding is Scarlett's affinity with the land, I get goose pimples every time i see it.This is a film with a strong female lead and helped push for more films with a female lead. I would just love to see the 6 hour long version as I feel many important points of the book were missed out and would help the audience to sympathies with scarlett more,e.g. Will,the yankies burning the cotton or the two extra children needed to be supported.Overall excellent [even though I start crying 15minutes in and can't stop until 10 minutes after it has finished!]",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"classic? Yes... ""good"" classic? decide for yourself.","This is an obvious classic. But, what makes this movie so ""classic""? Nostalgia? High production cost? Popularity?...Personally, I would agree that the *first half* of this movie is excellent. However, I totally lost the point of the movie around the start of the second half. Tragedy after tragedy and annoying character behaviors are enough to drive a person mad.Basically, if you are going to watch this movie, be aware that what you see in the second half of the movie will not nearly equal the brilliance of the preceding half. It is worth checking out, but personally, I believe that this movie does not live up to the image that people built it up to be in my mind. But, its a ""classic"". Just leave it at that.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Can't get past the racism,"Okay, I know it's supposed to be one of the all time epic movie masterpieces, but is it really that good? I'll give the characters a two-dimensionality - barely - but they all play through to type. You can argue it doesn't matter with this movie, that film doesn't have the same responsibility as a novel to explore the nuances of its characters' emotions. But if a film is going to make a claim to be one of the greatest all time, it should show some greater development than Scarlett turning into a spunky survivor. Ultimately, I know the movie is beautifully done with many wonderful scenes, but it's an exercise in sentimental glorification of a world that was far more brutal, ugly, and hollow than the film even hints at. I don't expect a cinematic monograph on the evils of plantation society from a 1939 Hollywood epic, but I also don't have to swallow its assumptions wholesale. The gentility moaning away on their soulless spirituals recalls the ""pastoral scene of the gallant south"" that Billie Holiday sang of in her anti-lynching song, ""Strange Fruit"". The irony is that the lynchings didn't simply date from the Civil War era in which the film takes place, but from the very year and decade in which the film was made and released. So sorry, I give it a 6 for all it does so well, but thematically it has aged very poorly.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

"Frankly, I do give a damn","Rhett Butler: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". I love that line.The story is about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) plans to marry ""mealy mouthed"" Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Despite warnings from her father (Thomas Mitchell) and her faithful servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks.Just like I said in my Chinatown review about checking out beloved classic like well Chinatown and some other movies as well. I have decided to take a break from the new movies that I couldn't give a crap about and I have no interest in them but as a reviewer myself that I force myself to do because that's how much I care about you all, your the reader reading this, before I got zone likes, but now I got you all and I'm very to be alive to review probably the best I've seen since...well since I'm been doing this.This is my first time ever that I've seen Vivien Leigh in and I know it's not the last, because she give such a Oscar worthy performance and- oh wait she already won a Oscar for this movie and for once the Oscars got it right. Vivien Leigh give such a excellent performance and she played the spoiled brat that at the first I hated and then later on her character completely changed and for incredible reason that are both hash but just how life works, and she nailed that perfectly.Now what the Oscars didn't get right is not letting Clark Gable take home gold for his outstanding performance in this movie. Hands down the best character in this whole movie was Rhett Butler, he had the best lines, every time he was on screen I was glued to it and he has a sick sense of humor that most people have, even me.The cinematography in this movie....wow just wow, that's what I call a beautiful sunset in every scene to end the day. There never was a scene in this movie that I thought it didn't look impressive, even with the scenes of civil war at least it looked good and I know that's not a nice thing to say but hey when a movie looks good it's best to be brought up.The director of the movie Victor Fleming who did The Wizard of Oz in the same year as this, and he directed the movie with skill and passion and it really dose show.Now for problems: ................I don't have any.Overall Gone With the Wind is a three hour perfection of art that isn't you bloated stick in the mood Hollywood film, not with this movie, at least I can look at this and actually call it an Oscar wining cult classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A must see!,"Gone with the Wind, Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, is one of the bestsellers of all time, with at least 28 million copies and more than 155 editions having been published in nearly every language and country. David Selznick's film adaptation, winner of many Oscars, including the first for a black actor, Hattie McDaniel. It was also one of the first major movies to be made in Technicolor, Gone With the Wind is an epic from the golden age of movie-making. Overblown and melodramatic, it somehow achieves more than the sum of its parts, thanks to a spirited modern heroine, the main character Scarlett O'Hara, and its refusal to give us the neat conclusions you'd expect This is a must see for anyone living in the south.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Worth a Peek,"A long romantic-historical extravaganza, and the crowning glory of 1930's movie-making, the David Selznick Gone With the Wind is worth watching if only for the color and production design. The story is on the soapy side and concerns a Southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara, her obsessions, tribulations, her flaws and her (few) good points. I've never much cared for her character and have never been able to understand why anyone would. She starts out bitchy and ambitious and ends up the same way, only she's been through the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unlike most characters in serious fiction there's no real growth in Scarlett, no understanding, no self-knowledge. Everything's external with her. She learns about life mostly by watching other people fail.Her lover and then husband, Rhett Butler, is a dashing adventurer who understands Scarlett intuitively, and for all his erring ways really cares for her. Why is anyone's guess. They're soul-mates, in a manner of speaking, something he ""gets"" and rather enjoys, and which she never gets, and suffers for. The man she really wants is the one she can't have, the sensitive planter (plant?) aristocrat Ashley Wilkes, who represents the ""best"" of the South. But Ashley is taken with another. I find Scarlett's infatuation with Ashley the most interesting aspect of the film emotionally. It's so complete, so absolute, so crazy and so human, it's wholly believable, and is the one facet of Scarlett's personality that makes her at times touching. Were it not for her passion for Ashley Scarlett would be no more than a garden variety bitch, but on account of him she is an heroic bitch, a larger than life figure, almost awesome in her ferocious appetite for what is basically a fantasy.Gone With the Wind is definitely worth watching. Its Technicolor is remarkable even by today's standards, or maybe I should say especially by today's standards. Color is the one technical aspect of film that hasn't improved over the years. If anything, it's declined. Another glory of this movie is its production values, and for this a tip of the hat to Mr. William Cameron Menzies is in order. Menzies was many things, but is best remembered as a pioneer of motion picture art direction and set design, and Gone With the Wind is a superb example of this, and his crowning achievement. One has to pay close attention to fully appreciate the Menzies touch. Though he did not formally direct the film he essentially storyboarded it, which is half the battle, and one can see his work in the way characters are framed by, among other things, windows, doorways and fences. There's a completeness to this production, down to the smallest detail, that is astonishing. Menzies was also fond of forced perspective, which is the art of making things look longer or larger than they really are.The film is by no means perfect. It's too long, for one thing, and the second half drags. Much of the book and film's success had to do with its appeal to women. This is after all a woman's story, and it's largely told from a woman's perspective. But they might have thrown in something for the boys. There are no real battle scenes. Aside from the burning of Atlanta there's not a lot of action. While there's a good deal of movement in the film,--people do get around from place to place, usually on horseback or by carriage--it would have been nice to have seen them, once they arrive at their destination, do more than talk, argue, scheme and throw themselves down on sofas or across beds. At least the interiors are lush and pleasing to the eye. Another problem with the film is Max Steiner's overused, emphatic theme music. The more modest incidental music Steiner wrote, including some jolly little mood pieces, are quite nice and used far more judiciously. Still and all, there are some striking images in the film: the first glimpse of Tara, the entire barbecue sequence, the burning of Atlanta, the ball where Rhett ""buys"" Scarlett for a dance. Producer Selznick was very careful to stick as close to the novel as possible as much as he could, as he was afraid of alienating the book's millions of readers. Yet this fidelity gives the film an at times episodic quality, and one yearns for it to break free from its shackles and take on more of a life of its own. Even with these shortcomings, there's more than enough life in this movie to go around.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Just an astounding masterpiece that should be cherished by all generations,"I am 24 years of age and I can say that, for the first time in my life, last night, I saw GWTW. Thats right, I had never, ever seen the movie before, not even bits and pieces of it. Oh sure I saw Rhet sweep Scarlett off her feet and up the stairs, but that was about it. I had never seen one of the greatest American classics ever produced, not even a part of it.And would you believe I saw it alone? I have been asked by noit so few a girfriend to watch this movie, romantic and sweepingly epic as it is, but have always declined. Why? Well because I find, in my own point of view, that older romantic movies, just as older horror movies, are just not as effective on me today as they most undoubtedly were on people of that era. So I stayed away from this movie, believing that the hype and over-zelous love for this film would find me far too expectant of it and, thus, far more dissappointed then I should be. I was, however, very much wrong.I don't believe I will give, in any way, a general review of this film. Anyone reading this now knows of the story or has worshipped at its cinematic feet for years. Besides, a text book review, a dateline chronicle of this splendid film would not do it justice. As with great pieces of literature, the beauty lies not in the details but in the emotions garnered from the experience, and GWTW evokes such earth shattering emotions.You may scoff at my assertion that a movie could render upon me such strong emotions, but I feel that anytime an event takes place which alters the types of things that please you, that motivate you, that entertain or touch you in some way, well to me that is and shall always be earth shattering. I remember watching, as a child, JAWS and realizing that I could watch this story for years and years without ever tiring of it. It started a life long fascination with the sea and sharks which has never subsided. I remember being in 7th grade and reading for the first time a book that was a joy to read, a book that was an event at night rather then a burden. After reading, for my class, Lord of the Flies, I continued on, reading Lord of the Rings, and on and on and on after that to the point I find myself now where no night of mine is truly complete until I read a bit. I remember all of these things, and many more that have meant so much to me, and I can easily say that GWTW was one of those watershed moments for me.I want to visit Tara, I want become kismit friends with Rhet Butler, I want to find people in this world who loath Ashley as much as I do, who love and respect Melanie as much as I do, and who lust after, for some reason and not just physically, Scarlett as I find myself doing now. I want to see the old South as it was, with all of its splendor and horror, in slavery, put out upon the curb everyday for all to see. I want to see what the Civil War really looked like and I want to stand, jaw dropped and with a sense of dread, as men from both sides talk of short wars and little bloodshed.Mostly however I want to live the life that Gone with the Wind lays out. I want that life to be my life, if only for a moment, if only as a whisper in the ear of time. This movie made me believe in love, in that unquenchable love that passes all understanding, and made me afraid of it's trappings. I feel, even now, for Rhet Butler, so many years of wasting his love on someone incapable of returning it. I pity now Scarlett, left sobbing on the bottom steps of her gigantic home, loving the man she had just driven away with every pore of her being. I feel for them all as if I had known them myself, greavied with them in moments of lose, and celebrated in moments of triumph.This movie made me feel good, fullfilled, and satisfied completely at the end, so much so that I went to bed as writer, director, and actor, finishing a story I had just watch unfold. Sending Scarlett off to fight for Rhet, leaving Ashely behind to wallow in his own well deserved misery. I watched in my mind as Mammie grew older and more gentle as the years went on and Tara became smaller, yet more open and loving in its old age.I saw all this in my miond only because, as a great novel does, a great poem does, a great prose does, this movie left us all wanting more. Wanting it so much that we would stay awake at night, creating a larger, even grander world then the one we had been allowed to peer into. We needed to create more because 4 hours and 20 some odd years was not enough for us. It was but a taste, one so good we needed to raid the rest.And so will it go. New movies will evoke new emotions and new characters will make me laugh and cry and groan from disapproval, but GWTW will live on in my memory. With other films, they will pass in the halls of my thoughts only when I see them on TV or hear of them from friends, but GWTW will visit those halls from time to time without any pre-announced engagement. It will come in to brighten my day, to promise of something better, and to focus me on the beauties of life and all it has to offer. It is why we stare at the Mona Lisa, listen to Beethoven and Mozart, read Dickens and Shakespeare, and in the end, why we watch GWTW. For it gives us a sense of relief or purpose the likes of whcih nothing else does. For that, for last night, I am grateful for that story.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
THE Hollywood Period Classic Film,"""Gone with the wind"" is the best story - the best book adaptation - the best classic film ever. I first saw it when I was just a kid, and I immediately fell in love with it. I re- watched it millions of times. And I still can't get enough. Scarlet O'Hara is one of the best film/book characters of history as she represents the spoiled flirty Southern Belle that - when in need - can react to destiny and war and fight like a tiger to survive. She is my idol. Strength combined with beauty, passion with a tantrum, shrewdness with sweetness. The only thing I hate about this heroine (apart from basically killing the poor horse when she finally reaches the ruins of Tara) is her blindness: she just cannot recognise Real Love and a Real Man. The book isn't altered too much, but something is different compared to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece. However, the war and the slavery are well pictured, the intensity of the story and every single character is strong; the setting is just perfect, in particular if we note that this movie was made in 1939! I think ""Gone with the wind"" is the most genuine mix of love story, war narrative, great acting (the charming Rhett Butler played by the superb Clark Gable, the weak Melania played by Olivia de Havilland - the only living actor from this movie) and amazing music scores. It is definitely a must- see and the 220 minutes time just flies.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

A well standing aged-ageless film!,"Having watched it multiple times, I have always admired its colorfulness and its technical excellence.One of the first colored films and certainly in the top color films of the black and white era, that is until the early sixties,it exploits all means to convey the traits of characters most effectively through color. Eye colors, hair colors and clothes are used for that purpose.Its extended use of matte paintings is effectively counterbalanced by their absorption and adjustment with live action footage. Certainly well deserving its Production Design and Cinematography Oscars.An equally well distributed and chosen although not flawless cast choice adds to the result. Gable and Leigh are the only, literally speaking, actors of the era that could convincingly incarnate Scarlett and Rhet Butler, and near their top throne also rests Olivia De Havilland. The main cast suffers mostly from Leslie Howard as Ashley. Though he is convincing as for the mental and intellectual traits of the novel character he lacks physical resemblance and his under- toned and flat performance is somewhat distant from the presence of Ashley in the novel who has a few emotional outbursts. The rest of the cast is magnificently positioned, to mention a few: Thomas Mitchell as Gerald is very suited to the emotional spectrum of his character and I would have wanted him in more scenes which were present in the novel but edited out of the film unfortunately, including one that involves Gerald in Atlanta after the bazaar to reproach his daughter, Barbara O'Neill is physically perfect though limited in stage presence and of course Hattie McDaniel shines as Mammy with the strong character and the tough heart. She is something of an accomplice more to Scarlett than a servant or executor. Also, Laura Hope Crews is satisfactorily presented as Pittypat and not deprived of quantity and quality of scenes. Unfortunately, many other characters omitted, edited out or merged with others from the novel are just a little more than extras, including the terrific Jane Darwell and Leona Roberts whose characters are much more significant in the book.Apart from any above mentioned flaws I credit the production with its departure from Mitchell's descriptions of mansions etc, like Tara or the Twelve Oaks, and the quite limited running time of the film. I think it should be presented as a two 5 hour movies sequence to adequately be faithful to the book. I know this is impossible to have happened back then as neither Cleopatra of 1963 managed to be something that innovative, but I lament because only this specific cast could master the whole novel to perfection with all its nuances, so today the latter is not possible anymore. Nowadays it is feasible to make a TV series of better technical standards but such actors are almost impossible to find today!!!!I refrain from criticizing the racial and sociopolitical stance of the film's depiction of slaves, Reconstruction an such things as it was 1939 back then and the novel remained faithful to the depiction of the characters in the book. It is important to understand that the film wasn't supposed to depict 1861-1871 faithfully and objectively but to adapt for the screen a very specific piece of fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Overlong, overrated, but OK","I didn't really think Gone with the Wind was as great as everyone says it is. Granted, I am a teenager and I do tend to enjoy modern movies a bit more than older ones, but I love movies of all kinds. I did enjoy Gone with the Wind, but it was entirely too long, and it left me bored at times.The acting was OK. I don't think it was anything to get in a big fuss about, but it wasn't so bad. The scenery was pretty cool, especially the mansion. I found the characters to be, for the most part, annoying. Scarlett was a first-class sl*t if you as me. She would marry man after man just to serve her own purposes, often involving revenge or money. She struck me as a leech in this way, and her screeching voice tended to get on my nerves. Brett seemed like a jerk, but at least he was a first-class jerk. I found it very funny when he would try so hard to get Scarlet to admit that she loved him, and when she finally let her feelings out, he'd call her stupid. The black-stereotype servants also were a little annoying, though funny for the most part.I did like the movie, even though I speak bad of it. The storyline was good and it was interesting to watch Scarlett go change from the hopeful romantic that she started as to a very different woman. I just don't think this movie is as great as everyone says it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Shines brightly through the ages,"Gone with the Wind is appropriate for those 12 and up. If I could have given the movie a 20 out of 10, I would. 1939 was a golden year for movies with both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. Color scenes in Gone with the Wind were hand painted movie frames. The era of royalty and nobility in America gave way after the Civil War to democracy and freedom. Yet, dreams still exist. The number 1 and number 3 movie phrases of all time are in this movie. I for one have used both. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are both so good in this film that if all the other characters messed up, they alone would carry the movie. Leslie Howard depicts the nobility and royalty of the South, who, when the war was lost, he too was lost. Clark Gable portrays the ultimate survivor and realist. Vivien Leigh plays a character who is in love with the dream, yet has to become a survivor at great personal cost and learning too late what is truly important to her. The director leaves out one-half of the book. Yet, he produces a wonderful, classic movie. If it weren't for the intermission, the movie would be too long. Everybody should see this movie at least once. I think I have seen this movie more than a dozen times. I fall in love with this movie with each and every showing. Great romantic movie.

Introduction of the Epic,"This is perhaps the most classic movie ever made!! ""Gone with the Wind"" is always on every major critic's list of top ten movies in the history of American movie making!! So much of this film became an introduction to an onslaught of numerous elements of creativity to the American cinema!! ""Gone With The Wind"" was one the first recognizable color films in Hollywood!! Clark Gable's parting goodbye of ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" spurred on a nefarious notoriety which correlated to a very real aspect of candid expression!! This quote by Clark Gable has been voted by this website as the most classic line in the history of all movies ever made!! This ending line of his was considered very dare devil back in 1939!! By today's standards, of course, this seems ridiculous!! ""Gone with the Wind"" became a legendary favorite with the movie audience immediately, and it has been an all-time classic ever since!! The epic tale of Sherman's march into Atlanta at the end of the Civil War sparked a precarious nostalgia with the average American in 1939!! Scarlett O'Hara (played by Vivian Leigh) was a fickle and self serving Dixie maiden with a comical resilience!! Clark Gable was the straight forward southern gentleman who had to piece everything together!! Olivia De Havolind played Melanie, the bastion of hope for the faltering south. Lesile Howard played Ashley, Scarlett's true love!! Ashley was the man with whom Scarlett was fixated on!! Such a tale of morose, and flippant, intangibles, became a dramatic aspect to this movie!! This innovative genre easily garnered a positively peculiar camaraderie with the movie audience!! Margaret Mitchell's novel acquired a new found fascination with the American people when it got presented as this spectacular extravaganza of a motion picture!! ""Gone with the Wind"" won for best picture in 1939!! I have not seen ""Gone With The Wind"" in quite some time now, but, I did enjoy the film the last time I viewed it.

Beyond Magic,"""Gone with the Wind"" is definitely one of those films that have time as their best judge. The highest-grossing film of all time, accounts its achievement through its outstanding quality. It is a film that was not made in a rush, one which benefited from the work of one of the best people in their field at the time: Selznick, Fleming, Cukor, Gable, Leigh, Havilland, Steiner - all proving that a masterpiece needs both time and talent to achieve completion.The first thing, which astonishes the viewer, is its sheer vastness. The large landscapes that seem to stretch to eternity are juxtaposed to some telling close-ups, allowing the audience to be absorbed in that era that was gone with the wind.In a period, in which Europe was preparing for war, Selznick was producing a lavish film, which tackled so many sensitive issues at the time, and yet without imposing any particular view. The best way to understand the impartiality is probably by quoting a Yankee woman, from the novel, who after receiving an answer from Scarlett about where to find a good nanny for her children, ends up saying: `I would never allow a black person to take care of my children'. Scarlett has nothing else but conclude that these Yankee's are just ignorant, remembering the soft bosom of Mammy. The main characters are nothing but great supporters of the humanity that lives in the heart of their slaves, as opposed to the liberators who would not bother a lot about the fate of a nation after it's sudden fall.Regardless, of its political difficulties, ""Gone with the Wind"" is a landmark in the history of film. The great performances are probably the main reason why people continue to adore the love story between the dashing Rhett Butler and the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara. Clark Gable has all the charisma and all the charms of Mitchell's character, raging from sheer passion to absolute destruction of the ego. As for Vivien Leigh, there is nothing to be reproached, apart from the fact that she is too beautiful for the characteristics given in the novel. She delivers a truly memorable performance, portraying so clearly the psychological struggle behind her choices. The supporting cast is applaudable: Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil give some of their most memorable appearances.And then there is the soundtrack. The main theme is a haunting piece, possibly Steiner's best achievement. The vibration of the sound connects naturally in the masterful cinematographic work of Ernest Haller.""Gone with the Wind"" is probably the definition of what Hollywood can do at its best. A truly magical piece that survives and lingers at our hearts like a newborn baby.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Beautifully Crafted Yet Problematic,"OVERVIEW
Gone With The Wind is considered by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. It is the highest grossing movie of all time when adjusted for inflation, won ten academy awards including Best Picture, and has appeared on several Best-Of-All-Time lists. However, in recent years, particularly with the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement, Gone With The Wind has received a lot of controversy for its depiction of the South and slavery in a positive light. I eventually got the opportunity to watch it, and I can say that I agree with those sentiments, because while Gone With The Wind is a beautiful movie, there are a lot of things that keep me from outright loving it.SYNOPSIS
Gone With The Wind is set in the Civil War-era South and follows Scarlett O'Hara, daughter of a Georgia Plantation owner, and her romantic pursuits, namely with gambler Rhett Butler.THE GOOD
The production for this movie is outstanding. The sets, use of color, and cinematography are a wonder to the eye and really make this story feel larger than life. The score is also fantastic.Clark Gable is so charismatic as Rhett Butler. He is a cool, know-it-all kind of character who also has a great story arc from beginning to end. Many of the performances in this movie are really good, even if I'm not a fan of the character itself (we'll get to that in a moment).The second half of the movie is really interesting to watch as we see how life changes for everyone. We see the change in attitudes and motivations, and the drama that takes place between the characters keeps you invested the whole time.THE BAD
As I said, this movie has a lot of problematic moments throughout, specifically with its portrayal of the South and slavery. The South is portrayed as this beautiful land that is stripped away and reduced to desolation by the Union armies, and the ending even seems to suggest a return to the old ways of life in the South, which is really uncomfortable to think about.On top of that, all of the black characters, with the possible exception of Mammy (portrayed by Hattie McDaniel, who became the first African American to win an Oscar), are portrayed as stereotypical or foolish, and all of them are portrayed as being complicit and comfortable being servants. The film essentially ignores the truth about the horrors of slavery and paints the South as a beautiful place where Master and Slave are happy in the positions they are in.Finally, I have to be honest and say that I do not like Scarlett O'Hara. I know this is probably the intention of the story, but O'Hara is a manipulative, gold-digging brat throughout the story. I thought at one point near the end of the first half that she was going to grow into a more mature and kind woman, but as the story went along she gets worse and worse. Not only is she horrible to her own family members, she's horrible to her husband and her child. She's a character who I found myself hating more and more as the movie went on.OVERALL
Gone With The Wind is a beautiful looking movie. It has great production value, strong performances, and excellent cinematography. It even has a gripping story, particularly in the final half. But its depictions of the Confederacy, the South, and slavery just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and the story is weighed down by an unlikeable protagonist. It's not a movie that I feel obligated to watch again, but I will give it credit where credit is due: I have not been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it. Good or bad, it definitely deserves to be recognized for that.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone with the Wind,This film truly does show the best of American Cinema. It brought together the best people of Hollywood. It is a four hour film that keeps you intrigued the entire time. I truly feel like this movie will always be popular despite the different opinions from the two different factions in the war.,9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"I Don't Feel Sorry For You, Confederacy","Imagine if Schindler's List was made from the Nazis' point of view, with our sympathy being invested in them. That is my way of describing Gone With the Wind. It's a bona fide epic of absolutely magnificent film-making that, since it can hold its own shockingly well right now in 2007, must've been the holiest of holies in 1939, but it's made from the point of view of the Confederates during the Civil War. Hello. They wanted to perpetuate slavery. This film is an adaptation of a novel that works as propaganda for the wrong people. That's not excusable the way The Godfather is excusable in its glamorization of an organized crime family or Cool Hand Luke's glamorization of prisoners. This film actually makes these slaves look healthy, well-fed and treated with dignity, downplays the wrongful deaths of loyal horses, and treats the South's blind pride and nomadic, Leonine attitude towards anything nonchalantly, like we aren't supposed to analyze it.Somehow, I find myself hopping on the band wagon anyway and finding this film to be great. Margaret Mitchell, though she is the brain behind the film's aforementioned justification of the Confederacy, writes a story with unabashed love and emotion. Eventually, we learn to love these characters as individuals, the drama is constant and affecting, and thus the film overall is a very intense experience. The film's cast is led by the tremendous performance of Vivien Leigh, whose realization of hot-headed, selfish, greedy, impetuous and aggressive Scarlett O'Hara is clearcut and realistic. Hattie McDaniel, who plays the oldest slave who is somehow able to bark orders and take charge in some situations, has riveting moments of her own, especially one near the end that has an almost contemporary feeling in its elusive steadicam shot that loses itself in her gushing monologue. Olivia De Havilland inspires the most emotion from the audience, becoming the sweetest and most compassionate character you could imagine in that particular time and place, almost like an otherworldy personality in that setting.The cinematography, the most staggeringly beautiful thing about the film, is full of beautiful framing, rich colors, and a look as if it were made just this year. There is a scene where Leigh and De Havilland are speaking in a dimly veiled room, and we only see their silhouettes. This is breathtaking film-making for 1939. The music is wonderful and lush, the epitome of a large-canvas orchestral score.However, I could never see this film ever again. The length is not what bothers me, because there are many favorite films of mine that I would not mind any more if they were four hours long, but if the first two hours were as hard to swallow as those of this film, I definitely would. This movie's first half panhandles for our sympathy during scenes of wounded Confederates and weeping townsfolk. It displays a society that was naive, barbaric, and lazy yet arrogant, proud, and melodramatic, two trios of adjectives that are preposterous when hand in hand. However, once the intermission is over, the second half begins, and that is when the film is truly interesting to me. It becomes a saga that could've been set in many different contexts, because the last two hours are all about the individuals themselves and the motives each of them have that tie themselves in knots. The drama then is truly felt by me.Let me finally note that the only older film available in any of the six video stores in Gatlinburg, Tennessee is Gone With the Wind.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Small Moments,"Some of the best moments in GWTW are small ones, some with no dialogue at all. I love the scene where Mammy is trying to get Scarlett to eat her breakfast before the barbecue, and gives her a dig about Ashley not proposing to her. The sideways look of death that Scarlett gives her, and her own smug expression when she knows she's won the exchange...brilliant. Also the scene at the barbecue just after she's overheard the other girls criticizing her, and she slowly climbs up the stairs, completely oblivious to everyone else running down the stairs around her whooping and hollering. And the scene at Aunt Pity's house on Christmas night where Scarlett stands alone at the bottom of the stairs watching Ashley take Melanie to bed was one of the few that made me feel sorry for her.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
An Old Hollywood Epic on a Grand Scale,"I'd heard about the film version of Gone With The Wind long before actually seeing the film, so my first viewing was rather auspicious. Much to my relief it didn't disappoint. The story, the direction, the sets & costumes, along with some very solid performances this film for the most part does deliver a solid, well-turned drama. Yes, it is a long film, and I'm not going to say that it flies by, but simply that it was the length that it needed to be to tell this particular story. For anyone out there who has still not seen this old Hollywood classic, it is definitely time to check it out for yourself and see what you think.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
CSUN Student Review of Gone with the Wind (1939),"I was introduced to this film at a young age by my parents. They have always wanted me to be well versed when it comes to classic films, and this film was one I saw many times growing up. As a kid, I never knew about the racist tones in this film, I think I was probably too young to understand. Now, when watching this film on (HBO) Max, there is a disclaimer that states that this film was a product of its time, with a discussion about the negative way it portrayed slaves. I think that this film was a product of its time, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think it being a product of it's time is okay. This film is still great and is still a classic, iconic, piece of cinema history. Filmmakers can learn from mistakes of the past, and society can grow and change hopefully for the better. This film needs to be taught and watched so that people can understand why it is controversial.Scarlett O'Hara is the stereotypical Southern Belle, but what makes her stand out is that she is extremely selfish. A lot of people love her, and a lot of people hate her. I feel like I fall somewhere in the middle. Her character definitely makes the film interesting, because you want to see how she will handle certain situations; will she be selfless and do something solely for the sake of another person? Or is there always going to be some sort of selfish anterior motive? The way she treats the slaves that tend to her family is kind of all over the place. She can be very kind to them, but she can also treat them horribly.Even though this film is almost four hours long, I would recommend that people take the time out of their day to watch it. It is literally a piece of history and needs to be understood for what it was. This film has always been controversial, even back in 1939, for the way it depicted Black people and slaves. This film is what it is, there is no changing that.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
racist and overrated,"I've never been that interested in seeing this movie, but I finally decided to watch it, to see what the deal was. In the opening scroll, as it described the glories of the Old South, it spoke of 'Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave...' My mouth hung open. I couldn't believe it was so overt about slavery. I expected it to circumvent the issue, much like The Patriot and Cold Mountain today. Instead Gone with the Wind glorified slavery, right in the opening act a character decries the North for telling them they can't have slaves.We see Black children fanning napping White women, an abhorrent image. Blacks working in the cotton fields seem to be having the time of their lives. In the post-Civil War years, the character of Ashley talks of how well-treated he treated slaves, never mind that they were human beings treated as property. Ashley saying he would have freed them is a nice way to evade what he was.As days went by and I couldn't get Scarlett always saying 'fiddle-dee-dee' out of my head, I realized I also hated this movie as a movie. As so many old movies, it was completely overacted. The colors were too good for their own good, bright to the point of being fake. The more realistic colors of today are a vast improvement over the gaudy colors of old.I will admit Scarlett's escape with woman and child as Atlanta burns was well done. There is room for moral complexity in this movie. People fighting on the wrong side still have romantic entanglements, and still are devastated by the effects of war. Rhett and Scarlett could be seen as flawed characters not just because of personality but because of racism. But there is not much room for moral complexity in Gone with the Wind, it takes a clear stand.Unlike DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind does not have the KKK riding in as heroes in the last act, instead its last act was tedious and overly weepy. However its portrayal of Reconstruction South was not much different than Birth of a Nation, with Blacks as either newly wealthy bullies or animalistic rapists of White women.Gone with the Wind does have important technical and artistic innovations, but so did Birth of a Nation. The difference is that with Birth of a Nation there is no separation. You cannot talk about Griffith's innovations without talking about his abhorrent politics. Gone with the Wind seems to get a free pass. The majority of IMDb reviews do not talk much about the racism. I found the usual digs at CGI in today's movies to carry an irony. The CGI alien character of Jar-Jar Binks is reviled as a racial stereotype, where as the flesh-and-blood racial stereotypes of Gone with the Wind are mostly ignored.What is most shocking is that to this day liberal Hollywood, and liberal critics, celebrate Gone with the Wind as a masterpiece, while ignoring and apologizing for its overt racism, which went beyond the usual stereotypes of the time, but in fact idealized the slave-owning South. How can this be?",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A Movie I won't watch for another couple of years,"This movie I believe is very overrated, it is just tooooo long. I first tried to watch the film a couple of months ago on TCM, I watched it for 1 1/2 hours before I gave up. However I seen that it was on again and I just had to watch the full movie because it is so famous and a lot of the people on this website said it was a classic. So this time I didn't find it boring, I found it to be a good movie BUT not a classic, not a masterpiece, and not a rewatchable movie. I might watch this movie again in my life but I'm sure it won't be for a couple of years.

More ham than a Danish abattoir,"""Gone With The Wind"" is one of the most overrated movies of all time. It's one of those 'emperor's new clothes' movies (""Citizen Kane"" being another prime example) which has created its own myth and which it seems to have become almost blasphemous to criticise. Call me a Philistine if you like, but to call this load of old toffee the greatest movie of all time - or even one of the greatest - is just plain rubbish. It may have been okay in its day, but now it's just so dated. Clark Gable is nothing more than a kind of proto-Timothy Dalton, and the much lauded Vivienne Leigh is positively hammy all the way through. In parts she's quite nauseating.

THE American Classic !,"Gone with the wind-the most magnificent movie ever!As probably the greatest fan of this movie, and a Film Studies student with a clear conscious I can assert that Gone With the Wind is a cinematographic masterpiece. It is the legend amongst motion pictures based on Margaret Mitchell's novel produced from the impulsive outbreak of emotions. It's a romanticized depiction of the Civil War from the point of view of a southerner. It is a romance pictured on the war background. It is the story of a Southern belle who changes from a flirtatious, spoiled girl with not a care in the world less then what dress to wear to a hard-working and experienced widow determined to achieve everything she desires. The movie is diary of Scarlett O'Hara's troubles and skirmishes with her friends and lovers. Gone With the wind was Hollywood's most lavish and splendor movie in the 30s. With an excellent crew of stars, such as Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, it won Oscars and many hearts. If Gone With the Wind was shot in the 21st century it would be the type of movie starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The Oscar for Best Actress proves that Vivian Leigh did a great job at playing the gorgeous and spectacular character of Scarlett, and while Clark Gable was not singled out with any awards he faithfully represented the rude and gallant Rhett Butler. The movie shocked with it's rich and showy cinematography, 19th century costumes and breath taking details ranging from Scarlett's hairbrushes, through Rhett's shoes covered with Georgia's red dirt to the architecture and design of the plantations. It is no doubt that 67 years a go Victor Fleming directed an American stunning success, which watched every time evokes different emotions and comes back to redeem the good name of melodrama.

However in my opinion, her capricious thoughts also are the factor to lead this tragedy. She is like a spoiled child, always want something she thought should be good, but not really in reality.Beside Scarlet should be blame for keep tempting her friend's husband.

"Having finally watched Gone with the Wind, I'll now just say that I loved it!  That's it!","After hearing about this movie for most of my lifetime, I finally watched Gone with the Wind on two DVD discs. It was my watching The Birth of a Nation earlier this month and that it's Black History Month that finally got me to do so. My verdict: I loved it! The story of Scarlett O'Hara and all her trials during and after the Civil War really got to me and her constant pining for Ashley Wilkes and her later relationship with Rhett Butler got me staying for the whole thing in one sitting. Vivien Leigh truly deserved her Oscar for the role of her lifetime. I wasn't so sure about Hattie McDaniel's award until her emotional scene near the end though her role-like many of the other black servant roles in the movie-do strike one of Minstrelsy especially when it came to Butterfly McQueen's. Still, there was some amusing scenes I liked among them like that of Eddie Anderson's-this was before he became well-known as Rochester on ""The Jack Benny Program"" on radio-when trying to catch a chicken! Olivia de Havilland was also fine as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard likewise as Ashley Wilkes. Oh, and Clark Gable was perfect as Rhett Butler! I'll just now say if you hadn't seen Gone with the Wind yet, well, if you're so inclined, just do it! P.S.

Not to mention the simple fact that whether you like it or not, both book and movie glorify the most degrading and longest-lasting oppression visited by one people upon another since The Grandeur That Was Rome. Imagine this story in a more modern context, with Scahlett and her precious crew as Germans in the 1930s and Mammy and her folk as Jews. Somehow I doubt such a movie would've been made.

Entertainment,"Now...this is a MOVIE. Huge, sentimental, melodramatic, earnest, detailed, ambitious, impressive, and eager to entertain across four brisk hours, David O. Selznick's Gone with the Wind has dominated the popular cinematic consciousness over the past few decades for a reason. A few reasons, really. Made at the height of Selznick's professional and creative powers, after he had gone independent from RKO and before his obsessive tinkering and control over the people he hired became a detriment, Gone with the Wind was Selznick's biggest, brashest attempt to entertain the masses, hooking onto a popular book and throwing every cinematic tool he had at it until it became the biggest movie of all time.There's an earnestness to the film's portrayal of the Old South evident from its opening text that talks about the time and place as the last vestige of Knights and Chivalry. However, the ""knights"" we see are almost all effeminate dandies with little but big talk to back their assertions that they are much better fighters than the Yankees that they're spoiling to fight (the two exceptions are our two male leads). The ""chivalry"" is these men dropping their woman at a glance from Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) just to jockey over which one of them will get her dessert. Essentially, these opening moments, the first half hour or so of the film, feel like the dream of a woman child where everything is perfect except for one detail: the man she thinks she loves, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), doesn't love her and wants to marry his cousin Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Ashley and Melanie are the two purest individuals in the film, especially Melanie. Ashley is a good, resolute man who has his head on right, especially regarding the South's chances in the upcoming war (he's not aching for it like the younger suiters), and Melanie is so pure and good that she can't ever see Scarlett as the conniving, selfish, and manipulative spoiled rich girl that she really is.O'Hara, daughter of an Irish immigrant played by my favorite character actor of the era, Thomas Mitchell (who is kind of wasted in the relatively small role, to be honest), is really a waste of a human being at the beginning. I read her as being at least partially representative of the Old South in the narrative, and if that's true, then the Old South was a silly, unserious, uncaring, and manipulative. Her only saving graces are that she's pretty (Vivien Leigh was very pretty) and she is the eldest daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. One of the other bits of irony is how the film deals with slavery. It doesn't deal with it much, and it's really a minor point in the film, but slavery is only ever questioned directly once in the film (late in it) but there are a couple of small instances of people, especially the wealthy, older women of the social circle balking at the idea of a charity auction for dancing at a ball might be like slavery. The focus of this film is simply not slavery, but it's another small piece of evidence that there's an ironic effect in how the film is put together, and I really don't think Selznick, noted big-hearted lover of melodrama, really realized was there.Anyway, the core of the film is O'Hara's love of Ashley going completely unrequited while the visitor from Charleston, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a noted runner of the Union blockade during the war who builds up a huge fortune doing it, falls in love with the woman who's just like him. This plays out against the grand backdrop of the American Civil War. The conflicts of the war itself are never the focus, with the first two years playing out quickly before things turn at the news of Lee's defeat at Gettysburg where anxiety begins to build in the hearts and minds of the planter class of the Old South and their livelihoods, marked over the first two years of the war by some limitation on goods but not a real degradation of their stations, actually do begin to falter. As General William Tecumseh Sherman comes closer, news comes through Ashley on a visit that his men are barefoot and losing, and panic begins to set it, but O'Hara can't leave Atlanta to run back home to the plantation of Tara because Melanie is pregnant and can't move without endangering her own life.O'Hara's growth as a person is most evident here where she has to go from completely relying on the few men left in her life, namely Dr. Meade (Harry Davenport), and rely on herself. Melanie goes into labor as the Confederate troops are beginning to pull out in the face of Sherman's march, and Dr. Meade simply cannot abandon the hundreds and thousands of injured Confederate troops to help with a delivery, so O'Hara with her house servant Prissy (Butterfly McQueen), must do it herself. This leads to recruiting the help of Butler who's in town with his preferred company (prostitutes, but the film can never say it because of the Hays Office), who manages to get the group of women out of town through fire, aggressive scavengers, and special effects. They get back to Tara, they see the damage left by the war on their precious home, Butler runs off to join the army after protesting his love to Scarlett, and Scarlett swears to never go hungry again. Intermission.The second half of the film focuses mainly on Reconstruction and Scarlett's attempts to reclaim the life she had before the war (the war that all of the chivalrous knights who are now dead were demanding, by the way). She's met with obstacles from the state of the land to the new governing bodies demanding large sums of money in taxes to the fact that the one man she knows who could help her, Butler, is in prison as a prisoner of war and has no money. Scarlett makes a rash move and marries the beau of her younger sister, Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye), who can cover the cost with the proceeds from his new shop in Atlanta. She pushes him around in the marriage, does whatever she needs to in order to survive (including doing business with Union officials), and forces Frank to buy a lumber mill that she heedlessly fills with convicts as workers. Ashley, having been freed from a Union prisoner of war camp, comes in on the deal (because Scarlett wants to keep him close, of course) and offers up the closest the film has to a direct rebuke of slavery by equating the use of the prisoners with the use of slaves. Scarlett dismisses that concern because her family treated slaves pretty well while not caring at all that she's treating these prisoners terribly because Scarlett is, through and through, an awful person.Her reckless disregard for her station leads her into a dangerous situation where she's attacked on the road outside a shanty town, which leads the men in her social circle in Atlanta to lead a raid against the town, burning it down. Once again, these chivalrous knights are thick-headed and prone to outrageous violence at the slightest of pretexts. I am pretty sure that everyone involved with the production saw the act as admirable if misguided, but I find it hard to read the film that way. This, however, leads to Frank's death (her second state as widower, since I've completely skipped over her first marriage which lasts a grand total of about three minutes of screentime), and her freedom to marry Rhett at long last.This final section of the film, about the last hour, is where it becomes most evident that the film is really about trying to cling onto dreams. Scarlett and Rhett are perfect for each other, and there's obviously great love between them. However Scarlett simply will not let go of her love for Ashley despite his obvious devotion to Melanie. He provides Scarlett with what could easily be described as friendly gestures because he's simply a good man who does have affection for the pretty young woman throwing herself at him, but it's obvious that he's devoted to Melanie no matter how he frames it. Scarlett simply won't let go, and despite Rhett throwing his entire fortune at her to make her happy, she won't accept that happiness because it's not the dream she had before the war.What's kind of amazing about the film is that it never drags. It is four hours long, and it simply keeps moving with events, but those events are tightly intertwined with our main character's story. This film becomes a bit more random if Scarlett doesn't somehow represent the Old South because her journey mirrors that of the South from the Antebellum period through the war and into Reconstruction, ultimately losing the dream she had when she realizes its not real and what she could have when she lost herself in her dream. Again, I don't think anyone involved intentionally put this stuff in, the film is simply too earnestly presented in every facet of its cinematic storytelling to convince me of that underlying irony, but the elements are there nonetheless.Gone with the Wind is a huge melodrama that is played to the hilt by everyone involved. Leigh throws herself into Scarlett with complete abandon, playing her big emotions big but providing enough small shows of inner life throughout the film to give Scarlett a deeper life. Gable is a cynical counterpoint to so much that goes on all around him, especially in comparison to Leslie Howard's take on Ashley, and he ends up being the voice of reason as the South begs itself into a war that destroys it. De Havilland probably gives the best performance in the film as Melanie, containing eternal suffering and love through all of the trials and tribulations the two families from rural Georgia face. Hattie McDaniel is mostly a fun presence through the film in the supporting role of Mammy, but she has some very nice moments late in the film where she has to deliver a lot of expository dialogue through tears quite effectively.Gone with the Wind is a grand adventure and melodrama, and it still entertains eighty years later.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

"""The Human Equivalent of Perfection""","This film is one of the few that I call ""The Human Equivalent of Perfection"".  It ranks with ""Citizen Kane"" ""The Godfather"", and ""Casablanca"" as one of the few films to recieve this honorable mark. The film's producer, David O.

It represents greatness, in some ways.  If someone were to say ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" in a crowded room, every single person would be able to make the connection.  The same goes with a many other quotes from the film.  Every part of this film is done right.  From the direction and the story to the make-up and set decoration.

I recently created a post in the Best/Worst section of the message boards nameing the greatest characters of all time, I immediately placed Scarlett at #1.

Her first two husbands are killed and just as she really begins to love someone, he walks out on her.

A classic story of love,"Gone With the Wind is a story of a love triangle, or more likely a quadrilateral. Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a young woman who is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). The only problem is, that Ashley marries another woman, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Then there is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who is in love with Scarlett and eventually marries her, becoming her third husband. A love quadrilateral begins to develop throughout years.The story itself seems pretty easy and without good actors it would be a lame story. But it sure ain't. Clark Gable is a true 'mysterious man', sort of a macho who is always there when you need him and even if you don't. Vivien Leigh plays very well the development from nice and sweet Scarlett O'Hara to harsh and cold-hearted Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler. Olivia de Havilland is then again the soft and loving Melanie who cares for Scarlett and doesn't abandon her. Leslie Howard is a man struggling between Melanie, whom he loves and Scarlett, whom he (probably) desires.The story was simple but played brilliantly. I think that it deserves to be called the top of film history and even the best movie of all times. When watching it you get emotional and want to feel sorry for Scarlett, who is really nothing to be sorry of. I could recommend it for everyone to watch, especially film directors and producers of today. Maybe then we'll have something like it but it is sure that no one will ever make another ""Gone With the Wind"".",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Home Run? No, Just A Measly Single","As with the headline here, this was ""home run"" with audiences....but it was only a single to me. Maybe just a long fly out. I was greatly disappointing after all the hype that has been generated over the years for this movie.I'm not saying it isn't good, and a true classic. It's just not my cup of tea, as the expression goes.Why? Mainly because the main character, the famous ""Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh). is an extremely annoying woman. She is a spoiled brat who usually gets her way, scheming for this and for that and marrying out of spite, etc. Who wants to watch and listen to this lady WHINE for four hours? Not me.For me, the best parts of the movie were the cinematography and the segments in which Clark Gable tells off the spoiled brat. Gable is the one person who really gives this movie some spark, although Leigh certainly is effective in her role. Leslie Howard plays a nice guy and Olivia de Havilland is about as sweet as you could get.In many respects, this is just one, long soap opera centered around O'Hara's selfishness and the men around her. To be fair, it's a powerful story but one I think is overrated, story-wise, unless you like melodramas.",4.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

movies don't get much better than this,"The history of the cinema is full of monumental achievements coming from directors such as F.W. Murnau, Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and Sergio Leone and many of their successes became known as all-time classics. And even among these fabulous titles, there are those so monumental that they tower above even the others in their rank. ""Gone with the Wind"" is one of those pictures. In a way, it's the most important Hollywood movie ever made. Not only is it the most successful movie of all time (in adjusted dollars), but it revolutionized and inspired the world anew with its breathtaking, sweeping power and iconic portrait of the Old South and the Reconstruction, all seen through the eyes of not a man, but a woman, Margaret Mitchell's unforgettable character of Scarlett O'Hara, played unforgettably by Vivien Leigh.""Gone with the Wind"" is a movie about a great many things, but it is really the story of Scarlett. The movie starts in the dawn of the Civil War, when Scarlett was a high-strung sixteen-year-old and follows her experiences through the war, watching people die before her very eyes, and her undying effort to not only survive but to prosper through the Reconstruction of the Old South, a world she shall never see again. The movie is also about her relationship to the charismatic Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) and what evolves into a turbulent love affair.Clark Gable had received top-billing due to his fame, but the movie is about and really works because of the Vivien Leigh character. Vivien Leigh and her enthusiasm and her never-say-die attitude throughout her performance is the cement foundation that keeps this near-four-hour epic fresh and powerful viewing after viewing. I have debated and debated and still not decided who gave the best performance by an actor in a film, but after looking at ""Gone with the Wind"" just once, I knew which *actress* had given the best performance. And that is Vivien Leigh. Leigh simply *is* Scarlett O'Hara, never striking a false note in her performance. At the beginning of the picture, she's only supposed to be sixteen. Leigh was much older than that, but she carries the performance through and convinces us that not only is she sixteen, but that she's maturing throughout the picture. Despite her character's personality and how Victor Fleming wanted her portray Scarlett, Leigh makes us feel for and take side with this spitfire for a role. Because of Vivien Leigh and her energetic, impeccable performance, Scarlett O'Hara became not a snobbish anti-hero of a protagonist, but one of the screen's greatest and most admirable heroines.But I cannot – shall not – leave out Clark Gable. I still don't know which actor gave the best cinematic performance, but Gable's portrait of Rhett Butler in ""Gone with the Wind"" is an undeniable candidate. According to Hollywood lore, Gable did not want to make ""Gone with the Wind"" and did not care for the picture even though it immortalized him. Rumor has it he only did the picture for the paycheck, but he was entirely professional in his work nonetheless. Because of his strong charismatic acting, the Rhett Butler character not only stands out strongly in his early scenes, but by the last third of the picture, the movie is equally about him as well as Scarlett.Powered by the immortalizing performances by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, ""Gone with the Wind"" is still a landmark is many other regards. Even though the movie does, in a way, glorify or at least take a sympathetic approach on the Old South, it does it with nobility. It does not make the Old South look like a heaven, but a once peaceful, if corrupt world gone forever. For example, although the O'Hara family owns slaves, they do not treat them as slaves, more as hired servants. Even after the war is over, their slaves return of them. And as for the African Americans in the picture, they have been treated in screenplay and acting honorably. They have to be shown as servants, because unfortunately that's how they were treated back then. But we can see by the Hattie McDaniel performance that the movie knows that despite their treatment, African Americans are human beings themselves and are as infinitely different and equal to everybody else. Apart from this, ""Gone with the Wind"" also stands out because McDaniel became the first African American to not only be nominated for, but win an Academy Award and it was a well-deserved gesture.Although filming ""Gone with the Wind"" may have been as turbulent as Scarlett and Rhett's relationship became, the final product was truly marvelous. Director Fleming and producer David O. Selznick (who naturally watched over the production like a guardian) made ""Gone with the Wind"" one of the most professional-looking and feeling pictures of all time. The scenes of the Civil War through Scarlett's eyes are some of the most powerful, gritty, and moving moments in cinema history including the burning of Atlanta scene in which many Hollywood props of the past were wiped out of existence. And the screenplay is as perfect as they come. The movie runs nearly four hours in length and there's not one scene – not one bit of fat – that feels like it needs to come off. The numerous characters all serve their purpose. And it's just wonderful to look at this picture and pick out familiar supporting role faces such as Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mithcell, Ward Bond, and Butterfly McQueen.Just about every moment of ""Gone with the Wind"" is an iconic, revolutionary scene. I have seen the picture three times within the past six months and it hasn't shed a bit of power or sweeping authority yet. From its high-spirited opening to its tear-jerking but optimistic end, it is an enthralling cinematic experience. Movies don't get much better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

The mother of soap operas,"It's extremely rare that I'm such that bored of a movie that's that respected and popular (popular in a positive way). So I'm surprised by myself that this movie was so terrible for me. I expected to see a quite good movie (minimum).I think if I had seen it about 2 or 3 years ago it would have been quite entertaining for me. But I have enough of love stories yet. And especially love stories that are told like this. I know this is probably the mother of great love stories and that's why I respect it. But there was NOTHING that I haven't seen yet in other movies. Of course 'Gone with the Wind' inspired a lot of them. But I really have enough of it and that's why I couldn't enjoy the movie.But except of the innovative style it really had a stupid story. It's about 230 minutes long and it didn't happen that much. I hate that Scarlett turns from a hoity-toity Lady into a hard working person WITHOUT A SINGLE COMPLAINT. Suddenly she is leading the family. That wasn't convincing at all. She is in love with Ashley without any reason given. It's just a constant in this movie that you have to accept. She never thinks of NOT loving him. What's so special about this guy? Not convincing at all. You don't get any case history, nothing.Clark Gable's character was SO stereotype. They all were completely stereotype. There was not a single surprising action of any character. You can say that's because this movie was ""copied"" so often. That's half of the truth. It was really boring for me. It wasn't suspenseful, very less action, boring comedy, stereotyped and predictable drama. Romance? - Maybe, but I'm not naive enough to swallow that.Probably an enjoyable and entertaining movie for me as kid, but I'm too old for it now.

"With remarkable characters and quotes, ""Gone with the Wind"" is the greatest representative of masterful cinema made in the first half of the 20th century","Who hasn't heard of ""Gone with the Wind""? Or quoted, even without knowing the origin, one of his famous phrases, such as ""Tomorrow is a new day""? Who doesn't know Tara's musical theme, composed by the brilliant Max Steiner? One of the most interesting questions to ask yourself regarding ""Gone with the Wind"" is: who is the true author of the feature film? Normally, the director is the one to whom we attribute the authorship of a film, its failure or its success. With our film, that wouldn't work. To begin with, ""Gone with the Wind"" was taken over by three directors (the official one, Victor Fleming, and the uncredited George Cukor and Sam Wood) and none of them managed to have enough freedom to give the film their vision of history and their style. This is explained by the fact that producer David O. Selznick is extremely interventionist. Selznick is one of Classic Hollywood's greatest producers. Controlling, a lover of literary adaptations and grandiose productions, he was every filmmaker's nightmare, as he always imposed his will. Selznick is arguably most responsible for the success of ""Gone with the Wind"". He bought the rights to adapt Margaret Mitchell's novel even before it became a bestseller and began production in 1936. It would, however, be unfair to attribute ""Gone with the Wind"" to Selznick alone. William Cameron Menzies, renowned art director, is responsible for the aesthetic conception of the film, as well as for the masterful use of colors, with emphasis on the characteristic saturated red. Menzies was hired by Selznick to storyboard each shot in the film. ""Gone with the Wind"" was one of the first feature films to have each of its sequences planned through the process of storyboarding. Menzies was also important for giving unity to the film, which could have been a mess due to the constant change of directors.From the moment the film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel was announced, there was a massive participation of the American people in the project, such was the popularity of the story. In a national poll conducted at the time, Clark Gable (pictured) was chosen as the public's favorite to embody the protagonist Rhett Butler. The choice of supporting actors took place with a certain ease. Olivia de Havilland, one of the most popular American actresses of the second half of the 1930s, wanted to give her career a new direction and leave aside the roles that made her famous in swashbuckling movies. She was nominated by her sister Joan Fontaine and quickly accepted to be the interpreter of Melanie Wilkes. To play Ashley Wilkes, Selznick wanted none other than Leslie Howard. To participate in the film, the actor demanded that Selznick produce his next film: ""Intermezzo - A Love Story (1939)"". Much more complicated and time-consuming was the choice of the female protagonist, the (anti) heroine Scarlett O'Hara. Several famous names were considered, such as Bette Davis and Paulette Goddard until Vivien Leigh, an unknown actress in the United States, was chosen. A good part of the public negatively reflected the choice of a non-American actress for the role of Scarlett O'Hara. Nowadays, it's almost impossible to think of another actress in the skin of the iconic character.Many problems interfered with the filming of ""Gone with the Wind"". Selznick demanded several changes to the script, which ended up being written by five hands. Pages of the script were even rewritten on the same day of filming. To direct the feature film, the producer invited his friend George Cukor. After some time of filming, Selznick removed him from the production, saying he was not happy with the result. Cukor, known for his sensitive portrayal of the female universe, had a great relationship with Leigh and Havilland, but did not get along with Gable. The actor felt that the director paid much more attention to women. In place of Cukor, who was homosexual, Selznick put Victor Fleming, who had a reputation for sexism, and who was a friend of Gable. Leigh and Havilland hated the new director. After Homeric fights with Leigh, Fleming moved away. Sam Wood was then called in, but Selznick was not happy with the result, being forced to call Fleming back to direct the rest of the main scenes.""Gone with the Wind"" is the only film about the American Civil War that does not have any war scenes. Perhaps that is its fascination, that of showing the suffering and growth of the characters, making the viewer imagine the scenario they are living in, all of this wrapped up in the story of the end of an innocent love and the discovery of a real and lasting love. Mature. At first glance, it may seem like a conventional romance, but behind its seemingly simple love story lies a powerful and unforgettable work. The film, which in 1940 won 10 Oscars, remains the ultimate symbol of overproduction that has withstood time, gaining thousands of admirers each year.Thus, the story differs from several others because it contains elements that can be classified as outside the standards of the schematic script, because here we have characters that are not very romanticized and cannot get along. The plot ""Gone with the Wind"" can be summarized as follows: in the midst of the violent separatist war between the south and north of the USA, young Scarlett never gives up pursuing her dreams and romantic ideals. Ambitious and persistent, she finds herself rejected by the man she claims to love, but her struggle to conquer him goes on, even if she marries out of interest with other men to get what she wants. Several twists and turns will make her and the insistent Rhett have their lives transformed. Both never give up their choices, until some losses make them reflect on what they really want.Hollywood was going through big changes. Strong and determined women were growing and standing out more in cinema, defining and conquering their space. In 1938, Bette Davis in ""Jezebel"" played a woman of great personality, in a film that also takes place during the American Civil War; a role that could be seen as a mold of Scarlett O'Hara. And strength is what Scarlett doesn't lack. With a lot of persistence and courage to face the greatest adversities ahead, Scarlett stands out as the central character of the work. At first spoiled, little by little, with the course of events in the war, she becomes a firm and disguised woman, even capable of making urgent and unexpected decisions, as in the scene where she needs to defend the house from attacks by the Yankees; and a curtain in her hand turns into a persuasion piece. Her relationship with Rhett is at first distant, little by little she acts with him in a self-interested way, until the ""game"" changes, but then it may be too late for her.The public demanded Clark Gable in the role of Rhett. Gable, with his usual cynical air, is perfect in the role. The actor considered this the best performance of his entire career. Rhett Butler, an adventurer with a bad reputation, used to gaming tables and many women at his side, is at heart an understandable and sentimental man; however, he is also very attentive to everything that is happening. The scene in which he suffers a great loss and locks himself in a room is one of the most moving scenes ever shown by cinema. One of the most striking scenes is when he, near the end, sees his beloved Scarlett crying and comforting Ashley, motivating his unexpected final decision. Closing the main trio, he wins honorable mention for the character with the purest heart in the entire history of Hollywood: Melanie Wilkes. Married to the protagonist's great passion and never speaking ill of anyone, Melanie may sound implausible in that universe. However, Olivia de Havilland manages to transform a character that, at first, could sound completely uninteresting, into a pleasant surprise for the production. Still composing its rich panel of characters, mostly determined and striking, we have Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel (Mammy, a key character in the story), Thomas Mitchell (father Gerald O'Hara), Barbara O'Neil (the mother Ellen O'Hara) Ann Rutherford (Carreen O'Hara), Butterfly McQueen (Prissy), Harry Davenport (Dr. Meade), Jane Darwell (Miss Doll). Alicia Rhett (India Wilke), Ward Bond (Tom), among others.The main issue that is currently being raised about the film is the romanticization of the Confederates (slavers of the American South), quite possibly derived from the book on which it is based, since the story is told through the eyes of the southerners. This romanticization has its problems in portraying slaves who are happy to serve and faithful to their masters. It is paradoxical that, even with this idealization, the production is responsible for the first black person to win an Oscar. Hattie McDaniel, the actress who plays Mommy, the slave who practically raised Scarlet, took the statuette at the 1940 ceremony. Americans who supported slavery. Fortunately for the real History, this installment was won (and, from there, the second part of the plot begins).Despite some happy moments and comic relief by some characters, the film is a sad work, carrying behind its intense coloring a set of tragic and bitter situations, culminating in a heartbreaking ending. A classic of classics, ""Gone with the Wind"" is the greatest representative of masterful cinema made in the first half of the 20th century. It is true that the duration of almost four hours of the film can scare and that the second part of the feature is much less interesting than the first. However, the strength of the characters and the beauty of the images - linked to the unforgettable music of Max Steiner - make the task not at all thankless. An insurmountable super show that the wind did not take away.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

When I was a little girl in the early 90s, my grandparents would babysit me when mother worked. So naturally I'd watch movies they owned, & ""Gone with the Wind"" was apart of their movie collection. I was like 6 yrs old & I fell in love with it! I wanted to grow up to be just like Scarlett O'Hara/Vivien Leigh!

With her charm & beauty she had every man eating out of the palm of her hand! & she even got the unattainable wealthy bachelor to fall in love with her & she didn't even have to put out!

"Fair, at best.","It is always a shame not to have grown up with something that is considered a classic.  I can't draw back on my childhood memories of visiting a movie palace and taking in this movie in the time for which it was intended.  I saw this movie for the first time on DVD, remastered in 5.1 dolby digital. It is a beautifully photographed movie, but other than it's historical significance I can find little positive to say about it.  Much like Star Wars for my generation, this movie lives in the glory of its period.The acting was, for the most part, good.  I can't really criticize any of the actors, as they all play their parts well.Much of what makes a movie enjoyable to watch, however, are the characters. When have lead characters been so unlikeable?Scarlett O'Hara may be the least likeable female romantic character ever conceived.  I did not, for one minute, give a damn (no pun intended) about her.  She was whiny, bratty, conceited, and annoying from the first scene. Nowhere in three hours and fifty-two minutes did I find myself with any sympathy for her.  Her epiphany was about three hours too late in the movie for me to even consider.  And the glory of her ancestral home was lost on me.  ""As God is my witness, I'll never go hungry again!"".  Hmmm.  If the purpose of Scarlett was to annoy and alienate the audience, I must say, she was beautifully acted.The altruistic Melanie Wilkes, played convincingly by Olivia de Havilland, was another character I could not bring myself to care about.  Her fragile naivite made her feel weak and stupid to me.  Constantly abused by Scarlett, she never came away from kindness.  What a little angel.  The anti-Scarlett, (and equally extreme in goodness as Scarlett was in whinyness) I found her character ridiculous.  Olivia, in my opinion, was the film's most physically appealing actress.  By far.Hattie McDaniel's character, Mammy was archetypical, but appealing nonetheless.  Her acting was excellent, with well timed deliveries and always an appropriate look of fear on her face.Clark Gable is a charming actor.  I enjoyed his performance.As for the plot, drama, drama, and more drama.  Endless ridiculous drama. This movie is like a realization of Murphy's law.  Everything that could go wrong, does.  Despite the extreme length, the movie moves along fairly briskly.  This is due to the continuous string of tragedies that play out over its course.  Make no mistake, this is a soap opera, in perhaps it's grandest form, but soap opera nonetheless.  Non-stop yelling, whining, death, unhappy marriages, and more death.  I threw up my hands on more than one occasion.  Isn't there a limit on the number of horse-related accidents you can have in one film, no matter the length?  No rest for the weary, let me tell you.Wow, this is sure starting to sound cynical.  I gave the movie 7 out of 10 stars, based solely on a few good performances, the stunning cinematography, and the historical significance.  I can't say I enjoyed the film, and honestly, I don't think I'll ever sit down to watch it again.  But I think everyone should see this film once, simply to make up their own mind on it's value.In sum: a glorious relic from the past that has acquired a sour taste in the present.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Magnificent Movie!,"I watched this movie last night after not having seen it in many years. Even though I have seen this many times in the past, I was bowled over by the quality. From the beautiful cinematography to the rich characterizations and the wonderful acting, this movie is Hollywood at its finest. Scarlett ""over-the-top"" character is played wonderfully by the beautiful Vivian Leigh. What more can be said about Clark Gable's masterful performance? There is also a great supporting cast.

A powerful love story during the civil war,"¨Gone with the wind¨ takes place in the confederate old south during the civil war. Southern girl Scarlett O'Hara falls in love with Ashley Wilkes, but when she finds out he is engaged to Melanie Hamilton and the war begins , her life begins to fall apartThis is a strong love story between two people during a stressful and dangerous time period to live in, the Civil War era. I think this story strongly shows the true effects of this Civil era and how it affected people's lives during this time.The characters were all well portrayed and well the story goes on, you begin to feel their pains with them. The war is not only involves soldiers of the confederacy and the union in this story, but it involves every single person. There is a lot of fighting in the movie, and a lot of romance. The movie is 4 hours long, which because of the quality of the movie is not difficult to sit through, and is rated G. If there was Pg 13 rating though at the time the movie was made, it probably would have been rated that because of the violence of the war.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A near masterpiece,"Gone With the Wind is really that good of a film. Disregard the stereotypes in it. It is not meant to be historically fact. It is merely to entertain you. It is incredibly long. You have to find three hours out of your busy life to watch it. The movie has an unlikable character But that's also its strength here. She is probably the real reason I liked it so much. She was despicable but I felt sorry for her. You just have to watch it. It was a well written movie. It's very long though. Probably, and I mean this sincerely. It's not a movie you watch with a date, more like a friend. You make out watching other movies. I will review a few here and post them soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A Slice of History That Should Be Memorialized in a Museum If It Hasn't Already,"Even though its age of 80 years can be a turnoff for modern day film watchers compared to the CGI and other technological advancements, GTTW remains a modern marvel. Perhaps the most difficult part of appreciating it is forcing yourself to finally watch it if you haven't already. The anachronistic, outdated romantic love story may not popularly appeal to young audiences of today- that and the approximate four hour runtime, which makes it sound like a chore. That was me.Once I dove into it a few years ago for the first time as an attempt to appreciate both history and film history, I quickly realized why it was so popular. What impressed me the most was how good the cinematography was for a movie from 1939, as well as how believable the dramatization was in bringing to life a love saga from the civil war period.Prior to watching the film, the only learning I ever had on the civil war was based on textbooks and documentaries, most of which were a bore. There are war tales of the great commanders and generals involved, but there was never a colorful depiction of society that humanizes people who lived in that era and what it was like. Of all places, the South was the perfect setting to depict an era in history that was tumultuous, painstaking, unstable, and just like that, gone with the wind.The acting is as good as you can get for an old film period, not just 1939. It's better than any acting I've seen well after 1939 into the proceeding few decades. The directing is crisp, music emotive and epic, and Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is unforgettable. Even not being a big fan of older films, the thing that struck me as the most impressive thing about GWTW was its realistic, historical reconstruction of an era and place in time that is scarcely described throughout history lessons. In doing so, it creates an timeless, artistic display of that time. It's epic and important, there's no denying that.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
An epic movie in every meaning of the word,"One of the most well-known films even today. Still the highest-grossing film ever released if you account for inflation. A grand epic about the times of American Civil War and how it affected a group of Southern landed gentry.Starring the indomitable Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, the oldest daughter and presumed heir of the Tara plantation, and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, her on and off mentor slash rival slash romantic interest. The story revolves around Scarlett in the months leading up to the Civil War and in the years that followed. And what a character. Very few movies I've seen in my life I have been able to call Films with a capital F. But this belongs on that elusive list.I find it especially intriguing how jaded they portray Scarlett. She is not a pleasant person, not at all. She's scheming, manipulative, almost purely after her own interest and she most certainly does not take a no for an answer. And yet the scene just before the interlude, where she swears that she and hers shall never suffer like they have suffered, is one of the strongest scenes I've ever see put on film. And the reason for that is the fact that you can understand where she is coming from. Likable she may not be. Admirable, on the other hand, oh so very much.And it's not like she's a pure villain or a monster either. She is not immune to the suffering of others, she is loyal to those she considers hers and her sheer willpower and force of personality are certainly something to be praised.She's also beautifully set up and contrasted by those around her. From Rhett Butler's more relaxed scheming to Melanie's (Olivia de Havilland) straight up sainthood.The only real problem I have with the film is the way it shows its age. More specifically the way it portrays slaves. It is told from the point of view of the South, and it tends to portray slaves as a simpler people, who are being gently looked after by their white masters. More often than not the slaves are shown either as people of limited understanding or as straight up mentally handicapped. It usually isn't the focus of the film, but the story is about the Civil War so it's always on the background. And it is uncomfortable, to tell the truth.Aside from that, the film is really good. A masterpiece. Masterfully acted, masterfully scripted, masterfully made. It is hard to recommend a film almost eighty years old and almost four hours in length to anyone. But in this case I believe the recommendation is more than warranted.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Underlying theme,"Being an American who grew up in the south, I have a little extra knowledge of what the movie Gone With the Wind is about. When you talk to people in the southeastern states, sooner or later you're going to hear about the Civil War, because that subject is still under serious debate there, and there are a great number of people who are experts. Margaret Mitchell herself said that when she was a child she heard very many personal remembrances of that time, and in fact she was steeped in the living memory of the Civil War period.The book that she wrote is a recreation of that period, and the movie is a sort of living portrait drawn from the book. Even though the very strong characters of the story occupy the center of the stage, still the background is just as important, being the result of Margaret Mitchell's need to give expression to all she knew about the agony of the Civil War, still living so vividly in the minds of so many people in America.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
I will not be putting this film down!,"I am disgusted by the comments of some of the users on this site who claimed Gone With the Wind is racist, who claimed that Scarlett is nothing but an arrogant b****, and so on and so forth.First of all, of COURSE this movie is racist. It was taken from a SOUTHERNERS point of view during the Civil War. The movie was not being racist on it's own saying that slavery should still exist, it was simply FOLLOWING the book. It is ridiculous to claim otherwise.Second of all, Scarlett was portrayed as a conniving, ""vile"" woman. However, she DID love Rhett...and of course she didn't love Ashley- that was pointed out in the movie and the book that it was an infatuation, she simply wanted what she ""couldn't have."" Perhaps the author wanted to display how Scarlett blooms. One must remember that in the beginning of the book Scarlett is only 16. She is not an adult, she is a spoiled girl used to being a Southern belle. She may be sassy and audacious but she has grit. By the end of the movie/book for those who MISSED THIS WHOLE POINT. Scarlett realizes she loves Rhett and she realizes her wrong doing. If you read the book and watched the movie ""Scarlett"" you would watch her progress even further into womanhood. Scarlett was proving feminism (taking matters into her own hands) long before the idea ever broke out.It seems to me that those who disliked the book would make a point that proved they just didn't get it. I'm not sure if they are used to cut and dry movies and books...but for crying out loud...expand your minds. The movie may not be the best acted/directed/whatever, but remember how early on this movie was made...it's not going to be today's Hollywood. But the story is timeless and incredible and BRAVE. It takes on the viewpoint which no one wanted to admit was out there.Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Continuity,"In the first scene when Melanie is introduced to Scarlett again by Ashley, Melanie is wearing a dove gray and white lace costume, an understatement to the more flamboyant Sarlett. She is also wearing straw bonnet with a dark peach velvet ribbon.In a subsequent scene between Melanie and Ashley where they are discussing Melanie's joining the family and the fleeting beauty of the southern way of life and, if war comes, it will not matter to their commitment to each other. This is a touching scene; one of a deeper understanding than the superficial one experienced by Scarlett and Ashely.Melanie and her betrothed are standing in front of a curtained window facing each other. The window overlooks the gardens. This is one of the most private moments in the whole movie and quite a contrast to the rest of the movie.Melanie is wearing the same dove gray and white lace costume a straw bonnet with a light maroon gross-grained ribbon.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone with the Long Winded,"I'll freely admit my girlfriend and I have quite different tastes, but we usually both recognise really great films when we see them. This meeting of minds, alas, has not happened for the much-vaunted classic 'Gone with the Wind' - she loves the costumes and Vivien Leigh; I loathe the slave-era nostalgia, weak script, hammy acting, overlong show-time (and I'm a Peter Jackson fan) and above all, Vivien Leigh. Only Clark Gable gives a creditable performance as the charming rogue, Rhett Butler.On the first viewing, the film lost me early on with the depiction of cheerful, singing slaves returning from a day in the fields; it continued to elude me as Scarlett O'Hara, initially portrayed vividly as a spoiled, shrill, ego-centric rich girl, proceeded through the film to become...well...a spoiled, shrill, ego-centric rich woman. If I ever hear her breathily begin a sentence with ""Oh, Rhett!"" one more time, I think I may scream.For sure the most overrated film in the IMDb top #250 I have seen, more so than Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove, both of which have at least some merit beyond the production values.",3.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Scarlett's hopeless love for a married man makes this movie worthwhile. Four whole hours of Scarlett's fight for true love. Even though it's all about Scarlett O'Hara, it still gives appeal to life during the Civil War. Vivien Leigh portrayed Scarlett perfectly and really became Scarlett in this jaw dropping film.

Fantastic Dramatization of the Civil War,"I watched this movie for the first time at fourteen years old. I enjoyed it immensely. I have always been a fanatic for anything Civil War themed, so when my mother recommended it to me, it was a yes from the start. The opening scenes show the young Scarlett O'Hara as she awaits her father's arrival. Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county, Scarlett has acquired a high self-esteem, but when the War is announced to come after all, the high-spirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope. She meets many people along the way, she even gets married. With new relationships, new responsibilities come as well. Rhett Butler, a man determined to have Scarlett for his own, comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie, and he fights her on topics such as love, politics and societal roles. Even after the Civil War, Scarlett is still faced with many decisions. She has faced death, marriage and defeat many times. Still willing to go on, even when it seemed impossible, Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book, ""After all, tomorrow is another day.""",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Gone With the Wind? If it were up to me it would be,"I'll state right off the bat that the cinematography and art direction of ""Gone With the Wind"" is extraordinary,and ahead of its time. I will also say that is were my liking for the film ends.The fact that the heroine is a manipulative bitch who doesn't care about anyone but herself(contrary to popular belief, Scarlett DOES NOT love Ashley OR Rhett and as for Tara,it's basically an extension of herself), coupled with a skewed, disgustingly idolatrous view of the American South and the Civil War in general is probably the most honest reason for my intense dislike for this film(as well as the book).I admit to empathizing with two characters: Melanie and Mammy. The former because she is everything that Scarlett is not, and the latter because she's the one that sees through Scarlett.For a meaningful Civil War story, I pick ""Cold Mountain""(film and book both) over ""Gone With the Wind(book and film both) any day.",3.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

THE American Screen Masterpiece,"""Gone With the Wind"" is THE American screen masterpiece, even though nearly 77 years have elapsed since its premiere in December 1939. The script, casting, plot, and music are superb.What stands out as something ahead of its time is that the moral center of the story is African- American--""Mammy"" played by Hattie McDaniel. From her initial admonishments to Miss Scarlett not to eat ""like a field hand"" and not to ""show her bosom"" before 5:00 p.m. and throughout the story, she is the voice of common sense and authority on what's ""fittin'"" for any and all occasions. It's little wonder she was the first African-American person to win Best Supporting Actress for this role, and her acceptance speech at the Awards ceremony on February 29, 1940, is a model of tearful modesty.The film was exhaustively researched before production even started. After seeing the latest 2K digital restoration on TCM, I noted that the paisley cotton dress that Scarlett wore when she fled Atlanta with Melanie (Olivia de Havilland), her newborn, and Priss (Butterfly McQueen) was mauve rather than brown. I thought at first that it was an anachronism--mauve was the first totally synthetic dye. However, it was discovered in England in the 1850s and could very well have found itself on a bolt of British cloth that was marketed in the Old Confederacy.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
David Selznick's Film Masterpiece,"Irene Mayer Selznick wrote when the titles of this film appeared on the screen during the sneak preview of this great film she wept and could not stop crying. Deeply Mrs. Selznick knew that David Selznick bet all on this film, that he was obsessed with the film and that in a way He loved it more than David Selznick loved his wife. When one thinks of 1939 and the way this Film advanced film, that Selznick took a civil war story and made it the most famous and possibly one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the American screen has regressed since 1939. Nowadays all we get is too much Special Effects.Casting Scarlett O Hara, Selznick built up a PR frenzy among the public as great stars such as Norma Shearer, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Arthur were mentioned as well as then newcomers Susan Hayward and Lana Turner. Bette Davis went to her grave wishing she had been cast as Scarlett. Other stars tested were Lucille Ball, Joan Benneet and Paulette Goddard who looked like the likely selection until one night Vivien Leigh appeared on the Selznick back lot. From then on Vivien Leigh 'became' Scarlett O Hara and gave one of the screen's greatest performances and won the Academy Award.Superbly produced by David Selznick at Selznick International and released thru then mighty MGM, and directed by Vincent Flemming, Gone With The Wind is one of the greatest films of all time and indexed for inflation, the biggest moneymaker of all time. George Cukor had been Director but Selznick fired Cukor. In retrospect a wise move as I do not think Cukor could have directed the action and Civil War battle scenes as Flemming did.Clark Gable is a dashing and great Rhett Butler, and splendid support by Olivia De Havilland Leslie Howard with a peerless performance by Hattie McDaniel who infuses soul into her great performance and justly won the Oscar. Costumes, Set and Art Direction, Cinematography are all tops with a thrilling score. This movie advanced the picture making into a modern era.David Selznick ever the gambler won his gamble, but would soon lose his wife due to his affair with Jennifer Jones. And ironically while creating the second greatest female star of her era (after the great Garbo), Vivien Leigh and David Selznick never made another movie together. Irene Selznick's powerful tears were momentous not only for the success of this film, the impending failure of her marriage and Selznick's eventual decline.Film scholars should read ""Memo From David O Selznick"" -one of the most intensive books ever on the life of DOS and ""Showman"" by David Thomson for more info on Gone With The Wind",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Also, very good choices from filmakers to not include some things in movie that are in book, such as Scarlett's kidds from previous marriages etc. People who didn't read the book seems to don't know how hard is to portray Scarlett O'Hara's character because she's the most narcissistic and most cold-blooded snake even to her kids (and that's one of the reasons why is it so hard to read this book - i mean it's written mostly in first person, from Scarlett's twisted childish mind's perspective) and I can assure you, Vivien Leigh did an amazing job and this is one of the best performances ever, i'm simply stunned.

GWTW -- The Hollywood Sex Magic History Machine,"The creators of WIND did not envision a 65-year life to their work.  Indeed, David O. Selznick sold his interest in the film within years; Margaret Mitchell remarked on publication that she hoped the book would sell a few thousand copies(!).  So it's a huge mistake to judge WIND on any terms but its own -- what it ""was"", and then, what it ""is"".  Today we see a colorful, vividly realized costume epic.  But in 1939, it seemed like the Sistine Chapel had come to life and was appearing at the downtown Rialto.  Forgive the silly metaphor, but you get what I'm after -- the size and scope of WIND on film had no precedent.  Released in the shadow of the Great Depression, WIND in hindsight is less about the Civil War than a nation's slow crawl out of recent poverty.  When Scarlett said `I'll never be hungry again,' the nation rose and said `Damn Right!'  The moment was set to fiery, defiant music, and the illusion of America, as she wanted to see herself, was set. History, right or wrong, was suddenly embodied by a sexy young girl who wants, not just to survive, but to prosper.  Powerful stuff.  But is that enough to hold our attention, year after year, decade after decade?  WIND is still visually persuasive and always will be.  Max Steiner's score beneath those images cannot be underestimated -- there had never been so much music outside the realm of grand opera.  Music completes the illusion.  The script however, full of momentum, has little substance.  It weakens as years go by. Mitchell was no Tolstoy, but her brilliant novel is condensed to a long, shallow, sentimental melodrama.  The writing is redeemed only by two key performances:  Hattie McDaniel, as Mammy, is the first African American allowed to create a real human being on screen (for that we thank David O. Selznick); and of course, Vivien Leigh's complex, amazingly sexual Scarlett. In a strange mix of glamour and guts, the vortex of her acting seems to create the film around her; she wills it to happen.  After 35 years of watching, I've come to regard her as, not merely the leading actress, but the real director of Gone With the Wind -- and the reason to keep watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone with Duh Misery,"Yes, I know! Gone With The Wind is considered a classic! The first time I saw Gone With The Wind was when the wide-screens hit the theaters and they had stereophonic sound, and when I saw Gone With The Wind around this time, they advertised the movie would have a stereophonic soundtrack but, of course, it would still be shown in its original screen size. It wasn't until years later that they redid the movie in a sort of 75 mm widescreen process using this earlier stereophonic soundtrack. Very impressive, even though the heads were chopped off, somewhat, in the viewing!Well, poor Katy Scarlett had more twist and turns in her life which equaled the twist and turns of Erica Kane on All My Children, and after almost four hours of Gone With The Wind, what did Scarlett learn? Not a thing! She should have taken the prophetic words of her father when he told her that the only thing that meant anything was Tara and, especially, the land, before she went out chasing after Ashley and Rhett Butler with no success. Vivien Leigh played Scarlett like a grown up Shirley Temple who never grew up, and as far as her southern draw in the film goes, this was no problem. When the English first came to this land, they were up north and up north it gets so cold that they speak rapidly and when they migrated to the south, they spoke very slowly, and all Vivien Leigh did was draw out her English accent which made her sound like she was born and bread in the South! And what was also amusing was that after Vivien Leigh was chose to play Scarlett there were some catty remarks from southern women that at least no Yankee would play Scarlett! Can you just imagine Bette Davis and Errol Flynn playing Scarlett and Rhett?This is probably one of the greatest Soap Opera's ever put on film, and what Acadamy Award Oscar Wining lines?SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! GERALD O'HARA: It's I'm proud to be Irish! SCARLETT: War, war, war! PRISSY: I can berth babies! SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! RHETT: Has the war begun? SCARLETT: Sir, you've no gentleman! BELLE WATLING: It wouldn't be fit-tin'. SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! MELANIE: Oh, Scarlett, how I envy you! SCARLETT: Oh, Fiddle Dee Dee!SCARLETT: After almost 4 hours in the movie theater: ""Ashley, why didn't you tell me you didn't love me!"" Uh! Pardon me? You mean, after almost 4 hours of movie time, Scarlett didn't know this, and decided, right there on the spot, that she really loved Rhett, but didn't know it? Well, the little user of men's flesh, just couldn't make up her mind, and it's a wonder that at that moment she didn't break into song singing ""I'm Just A Girl Who Cain't Say No!""Now, what puzzles me, and really amuses me, is why any red-headed sexy Sounthern Belle, like Scarlett O'Hara, would want to not trap some handsome man like Rhett Butler who just happens to look like Clark Gable, and not do everything possible to trap him and keep him! Scarlett had to be nuts! Let's face it, Leslie Howard was not that handsome for anyone to want to live with forever, and besides that, he and Melanie were cousins; and they got married? Was Scarlett nuts, or not? Well, maybe a little psycho! Give up Glark Gable?I will, though, admit that the end of the first act where Scarlett vows that her kin-folk, and especially her, will never go hungry again, is a powerful scene and worth sitting through. especially since you're sitting through all the nonsense of her chasing after Ashley, ignoring Rhett, and facing the Yankees in the Civil War, plus Melanies birth of her baby, makes this scene worth it! Of course, Rhett was right when he said, ""God help the Yankees if they ever captured her!""So, when I finally saw the end of the film, I wanted o destroy the projector and the theater for such a silly ending, and there's Scarlett still living in her dream world that she would go back to Tara and think about a way to get Rhett back which at that time was really very unrealistic, but not to Scarlett acting like a grown up Shirley Temple still living on the Good Ship Lollipop! But, at the end, Rhett summed up the whole thing when he said, ""Frankly my dear; I don't give a damn!"" And that's how I felt when I finally got a chance to leave the theater! Of course, before the movie ended, this would have been a great time for Scarlett to break out in song and sing ""The Man That Got Away"", or maybe re title it ""The Men That Got Away""! And, of course, no one would realize that many years later, one of the Tarleton Twins, George Reeves, would end up playing Superman on the television series. He couldn't make it as an actor, but he sure made it to the top playing Superman!Years ago, the British turned ""Gone With The Wind"" into a musical, and Rex Reed panned it and said that it was so bad that at the end of the 1st Act, the horse on stage did something to show what even he, the horse, thought of the production and the 1st Act curtain lowered! Remake ""Gone With The Wind"" today? What a tragedy that would be! Who would they get to play Rhett? Danny DeVito?Now, years later, I have to admit that I do appreciate the movie more than I did years ago seeing it as a teenager, but these very long movies only teach you one thing: When you go to a movie that's going to run for 3 to 4 hours, make sure you take with you, your lunch, a toothbrush, and a fresh change of underwear!",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

It didn't matter - that started me on my life-long love of the Civil War and history in general.

Really first-rate and amazingly so when you know the difficulties that Selznick went through to get it to the screen.  This ranged from casting challenges to director and script changes.It does stand the test of time well.  I have noticed that there is another whole new generation of GWTW lovers coming up.  My friend and I took our two young daughters to see the newest digitally mastered print that recently was released. (It was great to see the film in a theater again with great sound...)As always, (and wherever and whenever I have seen it), the first shot of Clark Gable produced gasps from the audience.  It is shot from the top of the staircase at the Wilkes mansion during the barbeque and we see Rhett Butler from Scarlett's viewpoint, when she first sees him.  The camera pans down to his face, as he is leaning on the bannister, looking up at her. I have never seen this film, when that shot of Gable failed to elict sighs from the audience.Anyway, our daughters loved the film and we hope that they will continue to enjoy it and pass it on.  Its that type of film - one to be enjoyed over and over again.  Even with all the times that I have seen it, I rarely watch it without seeing one or two new things.  That's the mark of a great and timeless film - which ""Gone With the Wind"" is!",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"The movie is amazing but, I prefer the book.","The first time I watched Gone With the Wind was at school, it was required. I was not a fan of the movie the acting was good, the costumes amazing, the sets great, but in my opinion some of the story line didn't make sense. Reading the book GWTW highlighted and explained the storyline issues I had with the movie. For anyone who has watched the movie and enjoyed it or for people out there who had an issue with the storylines in the movie adaptation not making since one really needs to read the book.Their is a sequel that finishes the story ""Scarlett""Because the actors are different between Gone With The Wind and Scarlett one has to think of the movie adaptation as a continuation of the GWTW saga and not compare the actors from GWTW and Scarlett to or against each other. One has to go into watching both movies accepting three things, one that many years had passed between when GWTW and Scarlett were made. Two that each book the movies were based on were written by two different people. Three that the scripts were created in different times in history and by different people.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Despite the epic grandeur, Gone With The Wind is still a performance driven film","When I was very young, my parents would often load her eight kids into the car to see a double feature at the drive-in.  Occasionally, we were able to go to the matinee at a walk-in theater, but that was the exception rather than the rule.  There was only one occasion that I recall my mother having ventured into a regular movie theater.  That time was during a re-release of Gone With The Wind.  I knew that for her to do something so out of the ordinary would take an extraordinary event.  Because it was her all time favorite film which she had often spoken of, there was no doubt that Gone With The Wind was an exceptional film in her eyes.  The question that remains is whether it would be such a prodigious event for me.I enjoyed my first viewing of Gone With The Wind.  It didn't bore me.  Yet, I hardly remember it being unforgettable which is understandable when you're thirteen years old.  I tried reading Margaret Mitchell's novel once and believe I made it more than half way through.  It was not until years later after having viewed the film several more times that I began to appreciate the epic grandeur of Selznick's film.Many have classified Gone With The Wind as a love story told against the backdrop of the Civil War.   I think that is an oversimplification.  Though, there is a love story involved, this is strictly a film about a woman, who happens to want a man she can't have, but ends up with those men who suit her purpose to further her needs.Scarlett O'Hara is on the surface, a spoiled rich Southern belle.  In the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, we find her conniving schemes to corral Ashley Wilkes almost humorous.   As the film progresses, and the brutality of the Civil War and its aftermath, envelop the South,   we see changes take place in Scarlett as well.  As she matures into womanhood, Scarlett remains the conniving schemer, but becomes an extremely complex character also.  Until the war, her conniving is strictly that of a lovesick teenager.  After the war her schemes are those of a woman hardened by the brutality of a vicious war, and her plans serve a distinct and powerful purpose.  We may not agree with what she does or how she does it, but we understand her motivations.To bring Scarlett to life on the screen, Selznick chose Vivien Leigh. Whether it was pure luck or fate it doesn't matter.  I can think of no other actress who could have possibly fitted the role as well as Leigh does.   If I had to name the top ten performances by an actress in a film ever, Leigh would certainly be in the top ten if not at the top of the list.Rhett Butler is the male version of Scarlett in many ways.  At one point in the film Rhett brings this fact up himself. `Because we're alike - bad lots both of us, selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names', he states.  He loves Scarlett, yet for most of the film she is out of his reach.  Only when it suits her purposes, does Scarlett give in to him.  She marries him not for love but for fun.  She may indeed love Rhett, because she is stubborn and self-centered, Scarlett can't acknowledge it.  Just as Vivien Leigh is the only actress I can picture as Scarlett, Clark Gable is the definitive Rhett.  There is no denying the chemistry between Rhett and Scarlett when these two great actors are on the screen together.  I have seen many of Gable's films, and have never seen him as good as he is in Gone With The Wind.If the film has one flaw for me in the acting department, it's Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes.  Although Ashley is a noble character, he is weak and wishy washy.  He is unable to tell Scarlett his true feelings one way or the other, yet is able to fight nobly for the Confederacy.  Howard manages to convey the indecisiveness and the weaknesses of the character, yet he fails to do anything to have us believe there is a reason why someone as strong willed as Scarlett might find him remotely attractive.Melanie Hamilton Wilkes epitomizes the example of pure goodness and greatness that one could only hope to achieve in life.  Yet, she sees in Scarlett a zest for living that seems to be unattainable to herself. Because of this and the fact that she finds it difficult to find the evil in anyone, Melanie is blinded to Scarlett's love for Ashley.  Olivia de Havilland gives us a Melanie every bit as real as Rhett and Scarlett.Of all the characters in Gone With The Wind, Mammy is the one who is shrewd enough and smart enough to see everyone for what they really are.   It is a fact that continually infuriates Scarlett.  Hattie McDaniel's  Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of  Mammy may be the most deserving of all.  When she is on the screen, her presence overshadows that of even Leigh.For all of Selznick's attention to detail, for all the grandeur of the Southern Plantations, for the incredible scenes of the burning of Atlanta and the long back wards crane shot of the thousands of wounded soldier lying in the streets, without the complex characters, and the incredible performances by the actors to portray them, Gone With The Wind would quite possibly have never achieved the historical significance that it has.  It is this fact that makes it a great film.My Grade A+",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
in 2020,"A great film. In 2020 , the motif to define so is not the artistic value, the acting, the cinematography or the story itself. But the profound feeling to be part of its world. Not the romance but the career and lives of actors, the high incorrect policy front to contemporary social movements, the nostalgia, the nuances of dialogue, the death of Miss Olivia de Havilland as end of the circle and the new senses of ""tomorrow"" of Scarlett O Hara Hamilton Buttler are pieces to see it not as a masterpiece - always was so easy to critic and see it more or less between pathetic and kitsch - but as trait of a world who makes it more than a good adaptation but testimony about the spirit , more modern than you expect, of a great form to be yourself. A film becoming, for the future, a sort of manifesto. Courageous and wiseful. So, only""Gone with the Wind"". The same.

"Still as powerful as 10, 20, 50 years ago","Unarguably, one of cinema's finest achievements and , arguably, the most popular film of all time.  Get your favorite snack and drink, pop in the dvd and just enjoy.  At almost 4 hours long, rarely does this classic drag. It is an engrossing antebellum soap opera that exceeds the novel in drama and scope and excellence (a rarity).  So much has been said of this movie that accolades from me would just be piling on.  Suffice to say, the production values are beyond top notch.  You actually are viewing 1860's Carolina and Georgia.  The acting is so good, the actors were type cast for years after. Specifically, Vivian Leigh never ever got past the Scarlett O'hara character with the possible exception of Streetcar.  The film won 10 Oscars and rightly so.  This in what had to be the toughest competitive year ever -- 1939.  For those Widescreen buffs (me included), note the dvd is only in fullscreen simply because that is the original format.  This was before Panavision and Cinemascope.  Definitely a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Great classic,"Great classic. Scarlett was such a complex character, selfish, spirited, passionate about everything she wants. But in the end you see that Scarlett changes, she learns about communication and respect for all those who love her after she lost everyone who did.

When men were still men.,Before I watched it I had heard so many times about how fantastic this movie was. I've always thought it was a kind of a cliché that people felt the need to say just because everybody did. Now I can say that it really is good. It's simply a masterpiece and probably one of the greatest movie of all time. It's hard to explain why it's so good... It just is. Everything is just perfect from Vivien Leigh's excellent performance to Clark Gable's. The bravery and toughness showed by Scarlett O'Hara is what we need to see more often on screen: strong female characters.,10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
one of the best movies ever made!,"This, by far, is the one of the best movies ever made. I love it. However, the book is even better. I love the story of Rhett and Scarlett. It is so interesting. Scarlett is one of those characters most people love to hate. She never realized how great things were until she lost them. Melanie Wilkes is a perfect example. Rhett is another example. Boy, she did that man wrong at times. I don't even understand how a man could love a woman with her antics and motives. She was un-conventional, snotty, and cold-hearted. In a way, I think that is what attracted Rhett to her. Rhett was the type that was a rebel. He did not follow the rules of society. He went his way, as did Scarlett. That is probably the key thing they had in common. Scarlett was quite stupid at times. What was so great about Ashley Wilkes?! He was such a wimp. Rhett was a catch! One might think that Scarlett would move on after he married Melanie and take a hint that he was unavailable. Oh well. I guess these things kept the movie interesting. Scarlett did have some good things about her. It just blew me away how stupid and hard headed she was. She was strong and went after what she wanted. She helped keep things together during a time of crisis. Many, from what I noticed, did not have her strength. They followed the crowd and were so afraid of what people would think or say, it was awful. But then again, people were and still are very judging. Scarlett did what she had to do. She had a lot of courage. I admired her for that. Oh yeah, Mammy was another character I liked a lot. She was pretty funny at times. Too bad Scarlett never listened to Mammy's advice. She was a very wise woman. Like I said, this is one of the best movies ever made. I enjoyed it a lot. 10 stars out of 10.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

GONE WITH THE WIND hasn't gone with time,"Some movies you always know you will watch and you must watch, simply because it is a must-see and GONE WITH THE WIND is definitely one of them, hailed as ""the greatest film of all time"", how can I hold it up until now? Personally I can never find a right time to watch it not just because of its nearly 4-hour running time, also subjectively I am not a fan of Clark Gable, as he perpetually reeks of bad breath (thanks to the IMDb trivia section to ruin his silver-screen charisma for me), and feel daunted by the melodramatic nature of its source novel from Margaret Mitchell, but the moment has finally arrived and I have watched it for the very first time, and it is as good as I could ever anticipated, although with an epithet like ""the greatest of all time"", how can any film hold out on that supreme crown unscathed?The movie is an American civil war saga entirely enters on Scarlett O'Hara (Leigh), a crafty Southern belle whose comfortable life has been ravaged by the war, oscillates between the man of her dream Ashley Wilkes (Howard), who marries Melanie (de Havilland), a girl with all the virtues of that bygone era, and her similar kind, the rich pursuer Rhett Butler (Gable), it takes her three marriages, two dead husbands, one miscarriage, a devastating loss of her young child to finally realise her deepest love for Rhett, only in the end, she is unable to mend her fence with the overdue repentance, she has been a fool to chase her ideal yet unrealistic passion for Ashley, which is merely an illusion for her to grasp in troubled times. So she is the only one to blame for all the misfortunes? Almost eighty years later, my take is that Ashley and Rhett are equally accountable for the love triangle tug-of-war, it is the battle of sexes, Ashley is too weak-minded to disclose the wrong facade of his true feelings towards Scarlett, or, even worse, he gloats in the admiration of a woman who adores him as the specimen of a perfect man, either ways, he cannot be exonerated for acquiescing Scarlett's unrequited ardour. As for Rhett, his frivolous manner firstly establishes a wrong impression that he is a philanderer, charming but never the marry kind, and when he realises his feelings for her, his devotion is markedly undermined by jealousy, which only pushes Scarlett farther away, so why on earth he can act as all the justice is on his side and desert her when she eventually wakes up from her protracted mirage? On the other hand, it is all their imperfections make them a perfect match for each other, for sure their life together will not be perfect, but they cannot stand one without each other, that's the essence of monogamy.One sure thing is that the film's epic production scope and grandiose settings signal the hallmark of Hollywood's cutting-edge creativity and capability at then, its vividly expressive cinematography alone can captivate the utter veneration from even the fiercest dissenter. It is so incredible, how come Victor Fleming can master two cinematic juggernauts (this and THE WIZARD OF OZ, George Cukor is the poor guy uncredited with both pictures) in one calendar year, 1939 is really the high tide of the world cinema, symbols the celluloid industry enters its full-grown era.An iconic performance from Vivien Leigh, her Scarlett is never a damsel-in-distress, she is a spoilt and wilful brat at first, life is too easy for her to get what she wants, but her iron- willed personality has been mould after the baptism of the civil war, nothing can pull her back into poverty, she has a cunning mind of manipulation, mostly towards men who are too upright to run away from her smug calculations, only Rhett is her match to fence back, but she saves her most precious and vulnerable part for Ashley, and involuntarily grows close with Melanie too. As a Briton, Ms. Leigh brilliantly nails the southern accent, wholeheartedly teases out Scarlett's rite-of-passage and culminates a timeless performance allows generations to idolise. The same cannot be said to Clark Garble and Leslie Howard, male characters are uniformly given less range to leave the same impression as Scarlett, or even Olivia de Havilland's Melanie, who undertakes the burden of being an immaculate saint, fully embodies all the good virtues of humanity, but must face the cruelty of destiny, it is a tremendous blessing Ms. de Havilland is still with us today, and from the bottom of my heart, I wish she will safely pass her centenary 1st July next year.One cannot review this film without mentioning Hattie McDaniel's historic Oscar win as the faithful servant Mammy, in retrospect it is exactly what one would expect from under that social current, sans the horror one might trigger from 12 YEARS OF SLAVE (2013). Despite that her view towards the war has never been explored on the screen, anyhow it is a war under the name of abolishing slavery, yet she never leave O'Hara family even in the worst times, maybe her side of story can more accurately point out the sinister nitty-gritty of war, any kind of war, no matter under what name men are fighting their lives for, it is always a go-to manoeuvre to openly sacrifice innocent lives in exchange of benefits for the few ones, and it is a crime at any rate.Sorry for the digression, all in all, the film is a worthy classic, a bit too mushy in its second half for my taste, but one cannot hold too much grudge against it for all the genius involved and the first-rate end-product it hatches, an 8 out of 10 is my verdict.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Gone With The Wind is one of those absolutely essential films that all movie lovers must see before they die.,"Gone With The Wind is one of those absolutely essential films that all movie lovers must see before they die. This Civil War epic romance/drama centers around a rather spoiled and selfish young Southern belle named Scarlett. The story follows her through the blissful paradises of plantation dances and pretty dresses to the bitter, cold realities of war and scraping up the pieces afterward. During these trials and tribulations, many very complex relationships and people are examined, all the while using Scarlett as the catalyst. Victor Fleming's visual interpretation of Margaret Mitchell's famous novel is nearly flawless and represents, in my opinion, exactly how a story like this should be told. The lavish sets and costumes burst from the screen in an explosion of color. The cinematography and visual effects evoke a certain dream-like fantasy at certain times and offer stunning realism at others. It's hard to believe this movie was made 70 years ago and it's easy to see why this movie was considered so far ahead of its time upon its release. However, as great as these elements are, the aspect that makes Gone With The Wind a timeless classic is the great performance by the cast. Most have heard of Vivien Leigh's career-defining performance as Scarlett and the way she makes the viewer both love her and hate her with equally burning passions, or of Clark Gable's equally good role as Rhett Bulter, the self-reliant, and some might say, self-centered man who comes to understand the value of integrity and character. But sometimes these two giants overshadow very underrated performances by Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, and Olivia de Havilland. Leslie Howard does a tremendous job of relating to the viewer the inner torment of love versus lust that his character deals with everyday. McDaniel offers a lovable toughness, wisdom, and discipline as the house servant. De Havilland's performance is the most pleasantly surprising, however. In every scene, her character emits purity and goodness in abundance. She truly demonstrates an unconditional love to all those around her despite the difficult circumstances she often finds herself in and is the perfect example of the model that other humans should aspire to become. Through and through, Gone With The Wind is a story that will probably never grow irrelevant, and this 4-hour movie is an astonishing masterpiece that is able to bring deep-buried emotions out of even the most hardened of hearts.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

It's maximum effort and art and craft and production ingenuity in service of a story where the character doesn't grow (or, if she does, it's a fake and she goes back to being the spoiled 'fiddle-dee-dee' brat of the world) and seriously lags in the 2nd half until a lot of people start dying and/or get hurt.Oh, and the ""I'll never go hungry again!"" bit makes no sense.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

A masterpiece!,"The performance of Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara is definitely unparalleled. She managed to create a totally identifiable character, characterized by her constant changing range of emotions and by the incredible strength she acquires through life, since she must escape from the disasters caused by the war until she's forced to grow her own food in incredibly tough life conditions in order to survive.Somehow, when Scarlett swears ""she'll never be hungry again"", the moment turned out to be so inspirational that she awakened the hearts of millions of people, and if some were not awakened, these were definitely moved permanently to an impressive level. It ended being a reflection of how thankful we should be with what we have in our daily lives and the negative effect (or devastating effect, depending on the degree) that may be caused in us if we lose the object or even our loved one before we really knew how to be thankful and make the best use of it.This is how the first half of the film ends, which decades ago ended up being the famous intermission. Both the intermission and the ending were perfectly planned. Scarlett O'Hara was an effective model of strength and perseverance, no matter if the audience were male or female; the moral of the story stroke in a very inspiring and direct way, and the intermission as well as the last shot of the film are two of my favorite scenes in movie history for my taste.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The most beautiful love-story ever written,"Gone With the Wind is by far the best all-round movie ever made (and especially of its time). The cast is fantastic, with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable portraying one of the most passionate and complex love story of all time. Head-strong, spoilt, beautiful Scarlett O'Hara is the belle of the county. With more beaux than anyone she is envied by all girls, admired by all men. But the only young man of her friends who is not her beau is the one she wants. Ashley Wilkes is to marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and Scarlett is determined that this should not occur. Meanwhile, Rhett Butler, the rich, debonair Scallawag, is determined to have Scarlett, by any means possible. His suave mockery at firsts irritates Scarlett, but his charm slowly wins her over. The American civil war throws Scarlett's world into disarray, dramatically changing her life, and everything she ever knew is now challenged. Gone With the Wind tells Scarlett's story, of her three marriages, her struggles for money, food and security, her love for Ashley and her dislike for his wife, the kind-hearted, gentle Melanie. But most of all it tells the story of Scarlett and Rhett, a story of friendship, mockery, pain, sorrow, happiness and, ultimately, of love.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Tomorrow is another day :),"A movie based on the book with the same title. It tells a story of beauty from Georgia during the Civil War and just after it.

Overrated,"First off, I love older films - especially the classics.I don't know how anyone could give this a 10.It's incredibly boring, from start to finish.You'd have to be a woman to last the length of it.

But because it not only focuses on the mundane - it emphasizes the mundane.Casablanca and Dr. Zhivago are both 'love story' classics I'd give a 10.I can't imagine how boring this novel is.I have no doubt the female author spends pages on the different types of lace doilies.I can see why it got praised for the technical achievements of its day - but I guarantee every husband dragged to it was dying inside, sitting through it.The best part are the words scrolling in the beginning.It's all downhill from there.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

How do you rate a classic?,"You have to acknowledge the grandeur and technical and logistical achievements of Gone with the wind. Even by today's standards the filmmaking is superb, let alone if you compare it to other films of the late 1930s.
Which leads to my question: can you watch this film today and rate it with a contemporary view on cinema? Or is it unfair to apply 21st century standards to this epic?If you take a look at it with a modern approach, it's not hard to see flaws:it's very long and inconsistently paced.the views on slavery and the 'happy big black mamas' is dated and hard to bear.the (over-) acting looks fake.a spoiled brat is our heroine.Having said that, I still love this film. Seeing it is like coming home. Nostalgia is a powerful sensation and I feel it every time I watch it.In conclusion, I think Gone with the wind isn't a perfect film. But it is perfectly realized and can still warm your heart if you can switch off your 21st century views and ignore what you're used to seeing nowadays.

Scarlett. The spoiled girl of the movies.,"For me to see ""Gone with the wind"" was very difficult. Because, years later, i pass TV channels and suddenly, i see the end. I say, ""well, i mean... maybe, the movie was not so good as they say""... Wrong!!! ""Gone with the wind"" is maybe, the best movie about a civil war. The cast is great. Clark Gable is the arrogant Rhett and Vivien Leigh as the famous Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled girl of the movies. With the charming Olivia De Havilland, ""Gone with the wind"" is a good tale of war, love and tears.This classic film was maybe one of the most difficult projects to carry out. David O'Selznick, the produce of this masterpiece, thought that the Margaret Mithcell's book it could not be. With insistence David O'Selznick decides to accept. For the cast, was put Gable in the act. But, Scarlett!!!. A quantity of actresses go for the character. For example, Diana Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Lucille Ball and Loretta Young. At the end, was Vivien, who was presented to Selznick by his brother, Myron Selznick. Vivien was daughter of a french man and a Irish woman as Scarlett, her character, was daughter of an Irish man and a french woman. Selznick with Gable, Leigh, a wonderful cast like Olivia De Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hatie Mc Daniel, Thomas Mitchell and various directors as Victor Fleming , George Cukor, Sam Wood, William Cameron Menzies and Sidney Franklin made one of the best historical films of all history of cinema. A true masterpiece.And now i think that ""Gone with the wind"" and her little character is inspiring. A life of battle, a life of war, a life of love. ""Gone with the wind"" is one of those masterpieces that are unforgettable.* Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Most tickets sold of all time,"In 1939, when the US had 210 million fewer people, and they were still reeling from the Great Depression, more people bought a movie ticket to see Gone With The Wind than ANY movie since.

Undeniable power,"I was watching ""Odds Against Tomorrow"" in the video lab at my school the other day, and ""Gone With the Wind"" was playing across from me, where a girl was listening on headphones. Even muted, and watching an already good movie, I ended up paying so much more attention to ""Gone With the Wind.""The offensive politics, the pompousness, the bloated plot- none of it really detracts from the movie's undeniable power, which could rest (but doesn't) alone on the crisp, HUGE Technicolor vistas. Never have sunsets seemed so beautiful! If you can stay awake through one prolonged sitting, it is actually a very involving and emotionally tense experience. Nowadays movies are so fast-paced and self-referencing that they have the opposite effect: losing my attention in a blur...but HERE is a movie! Hollywood at its best.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

A civilization gone with the wind...,"While most will argue with me, I must begin by saying that I was not impressed with the overall final results of this ""epic"". The hype surrounding it, the overuse of Rhett's infamous line in pop culture, and the fact that most people rave about this being one of the most romantic films ever produced set my standards extremely high. I wanted to be blown away by the scenes, I wanted characters that would invite me into their worlds and never make me leave, I wanted tragedy on a grand scale, but alas, that wasn't what I witnessed with Gone with the Wind. Somehow I ending this film with a sense of astonishment, a sense of being robbed, and not at all the romantic film I thought I would be enjoying. Instead I saw hatred, sexism, racism, alcoholism, anti-love, pro-Confederacy, and ignorance all rolled up together into a two-disc packaging, which would be later called Gone with the Wind. It was embarrassing to watch and call as one of our ""greatest love stories ever"". While it may show us what society was like during a pre-Civil War era, that doesn't mean we have to condone it and embrace it.I realize that the point of this film was to show us a different side of the war. That all Southerners were not fueled by hatred and surrounded by a violent slavery system. Instead, there was quite a bit of beauty to the old South. A sense of pride, a sense of gentlemanly nature, and a sense of honor, which was difficult to witness being trampled on as the North continued its destructive war path. In that sense, I think it gave us a glimpse of what we lost with the Civil War. That image of the South was beautifully captured in this film. This film gives us some of the most beautiful sights of lavish plantations, beautiful greens, and civilized parties. The technical aspects of this film are astonishing. While I will agree with most that a widescreen version of this film may have swayed me to giving it one more star, the full screen still demonstrated the amazing sights of the South. The wide shots of the mansions, the bustling Atlanta area, and terror/tragedy of war was beautifully captured in this film. For that, I cannot fault this film, but what I can fault it for are the stereotypes, the shallow characters, and the faded ending that just didn't seem to match the overall tone of the film.To begin, the stereotypes. While most will say that the stereotypes in this film accurately depict the voice of the South, I just didn't feel comfortable watching it in today's society. I realize that this was made back in 1938, but I still didn't feel comfortable with slavery, sexism, and ignorance surrounding these characters. Does that make this film dated? Perhaps if I witnessed our characters going through some form of change I would have softened a bit, but I did not see that at all. With the continual struggles that minorities have in cinema today, is it wise to continue to think of this film as a masterpiece of cinema? Is it worth of all the accolades that it received? No. In fact, I am surprised that this film hasn't been shunned by a majority of communities during each release. This is a pinnacle example of what obstacles African Americans are trying to overcome in today's Hollywood.There are those that speak so highly of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's chemistry, but for me, it was non-existent. I did not see why there are those that fall over this film and praise the story. I thought that Leigh was horrid as the early Southerner turned feminist. Gable was so inconsistent with his character that I didn't know whether to love him or hate him. There was no chemistry or connection between Leigh and Gable. They were together because the director (which this film eventually went through three of them) knew that audiences would want to see them either together or going to get together by the end. The rest of it was just trivial. With the fuzzy direction of Leigh's character, you never quite felt that Scarlett had an ounce of passion in her heart. She wanted what she couldn't have, like a spoiled child, and that was reflected again with the inconsistent ending. Gable's character of Rhett was underdeveloped. We knew nothing about this man except that he randomly continued to jump in and out of Scarlett's life. Where did his wealth come from? What was his past? Who knows  and none of it was fully explained. This can be said the same with Ashley. Who was this guy? Why did Scarlett choose him over the other possible suitors? Was it simply because she couldn't have him, or because of some darker reason? Did anyone else notice that she was Irish, not quite the Southern belle that we had originally hoped for? Overall, these characters hurt and built upon the ultimate downfall of this film. They were forgettable from the first time that we met them until the very end of the film. Underdeveloped, unintelligent, and downright dull. All elements that gave us too long of a film centered on nothing.Overall, I just didn't see what all the hype was surrounding this film. Our society has moved forward from this period, but do we need to be reminded of it continually by giving this film more and more accolades? I don't think so. I do not wish to see this film again and hope that it does not continue to be a staple of our cinematic society. From the unexciting, unloving characters (of which we all hate, yet are supposed to love by the end) to smile on Scarlett's face after the marital rape scene, this movie was a disaster.Grade: ** out of *****",4.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

I remember the 50th anniversary release in 1989 having to queue for over 3 hours to see it. Was it worth it ? You bet it was. There has been too much negative reviews over the years regarding the wooden acting, soppy story line, but does ""Titanic"" fare any better ?. Would Di Caprio and Winslett have made a better Rhett and Scarlett ?. Hardly bares thinking of. Best movie ever? Yep!",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A glorious cinematic achievement setting the standard for epic movie making,"I may be biased, as Gone With The Wind is my favorite movie ever!! I can't count how many times I have seen it, and I still cry every time. What originally touched me when I first saw the film was Scarlett's strength and fearlessness. Rarely has there been a heroine equal to Scarlett O'Hara, and certainly not prior to 1939. She is selfish, ruthless, determined, manipulative and vain, but also courageous, protective, naive, loyal and at times compassionate. Rhett Butler is also selfish, vain and determined, and yet sophisticated with a wit to match and a tongue like a whip, he is Scarlett's perfect verbal sparing partner. To watch their relationship evolve is what has made this film an enduring love story.Gone With The Wind is an incredible achievement showing us a broad spectrum of human emotions. Confronting war and adjusting to peace, love and hatred, adultery and loyalty are all explored in this vivid masterpiece of Hollywood's golden ageThe acting is wonderful, Vivian Leigh brought Scarlett to life just as Margaret Mitchell had written her. Vivian's amazing debut performance won her an Oscar. Not to mention that no one could have played a better Rhett Butler than Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel was captivating as Mammy, winning best supporting actress for her role (the first for an African American actress).For those of you who watched the movie and fell in love with it as I did, I strongly encourage you to read the book. Although the film is relatively accurate to the novel, (if they had made the film true to the book, it would have been 8 hours long) the book is magnificent and a milestone in American literature. There are more fascinating characters to discover, great action and humor and a better insight into what's going on between Scarlett, Melanie, Rhett and Ashley. There is so much that happens in the novel that isn't even hinted at in the movie. For an example, in the novel Scarlett has 3 children.The film is timeless; deserving of it's 10 Oscars, and its place in film history. Don't let the length of the movie or the size of the book turn you off, once you get into the story, you'll be hooked.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Still my favorite movie!!!,"I was in middle school when I first saw this great movie. Our history teacher had us watch it for American History class. This movie has it all! From drama to romance to war to death, it's great! I think we all appreciated the movie at an early age because of how Scarlett was young and spoiled she had everything going for her and at a blink of an eye everything turned upside down. She had to go through her mother's death, to taking care of her sickly ""rival"" Mrs. Wilkes, to losing all material things. But despite of all her loss, she came back and no matter what she had to do to make it happen, she did.I personally fell in love with the love story. Scarlett fell in love with Ashley Wilkes but he didn't want to be with her and Rhett Butler wanted her, but she didn't want him and when she finally realized he was the one, he was gone with the wind!! So if a history teacher ever reads this comment, you may consider showing this movie to your American History students.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Kinda Long,"Saying that ""Gone with the Wind"" is one of the trickiest movies to analyze in a modern light is a huge understatement. There's no getting around the racial stereotypes and historical mythology displayed in this film.The stereotypes of happy slaves who support the Confederate cause and who have familial relationships with their slaveholders is not something that you can get around. Neither are the stereotypes of Union soldiers and northern businessmen as scoundrels, barbarians, and ""carpetbaggers.""Outside of the film itself, David O. Selznik successfully campaigned for actress Hattie McDaniel to win an Oscar for her performance, being the first black person to ever do so.My real complaint with this movie honestly has nothing to do with the handling of the subject material, though that does knock it a lot. This movie is just too long. Way too long. And it's almost like we have two completely different movies before and after the war itself takes place. The first half is pretty great, we see the affects of the Civil War on the populace of Atlanta. The amount of extras involved during the sequences of Sherman's invasion of the city is awesome. The second half of the movie is a melodramatic look at Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and her struggles in the early years of reconstruction.It's the story of a wicked, selfish, and impulsive woman who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Vivien Leigh definitely deserved the Oscar here. Clark Gable probably should have won as well, he gives a phenomenal performance as well. He's probably my favorite part of this movie.The last half hour or so of this movie is what gives it its lasting impression. Terrific dialogue and acting. Honestly this movie should have been trimmed by at least an hour. There is so much bloat and filler and scenes that add absolutely nothing to the story. This movie probably would have rated a 9 or even a low 10 for me if it wasn't so long. The first hour and the last half hour really are that good. It drags so much in the middle that I'm not ashamed to say that I had to split this one up over multiple viewing sessions.There are many layers to critique here; it's a very complex and complicated movie. I wholeheartedly recommend giving this one a watch. And that isn't just because of its immense historical reputation. It really is an interesting movie to talk about.

"Book is epic, the movie adaption mediocre","I am reading a lot of books during a year and I wanted to mix in some Classics which I get recommended a lot as must reads. One of them was Gone with the Wind from Margaret Mitchell and what I can say, this book is purely a masterpiece and deserves all its praises even in 2024. The main characters are wonderful scripted and you will laugh, cry and hate them. It's also far more than a love story which I always thought it was. It's a journey to the past, in times of civil war from a perspective of the Southerners.I love the book and I wasn't sure I wanted to see the movie though it received so many Oscars. I expected much and unfortunately was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, in my opinion there are a lot of great movies coming from great books. To just name a few, LOTR Peter Jackson, Latest Dune from Villeneuve, etc. This Adaption doesn't come close to it. Maybe because it's from 1940 and acting and technical aspects where different to that time but I cannot overlook the small but substantial differences made in the movie (*example at the end of this text).You will miss a lot if you just see the movie, it doesn't even come close to understand the wonderful characters and story written by Mitchell.************************************************Spoiler:
In the book Scarlett is giving away her wedding ring easily as a donation to the southern so called cause because she doesn't cared about her dead husband Charles and after that Melanie doesn't want to show any weakness and is also giving away her wedding ring which is heartbreaking for her and she struggles a lot because she loves her husband Ashley so much, which Rhett Butler is noticing and buys just her ring back later.In the movie the scene is reduced to a few seconds where Melanie first throw her wedding ring happily and smiling into the donation box and after that Scarlett does the same.

A Beautiful Epic,"Margaret Mitchell's civil war classic in the immortal film of 1939 has been for a long time now, a firm favourite of mine. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest adaptions from a novel. One of the greater strengths from the film was the overshadowing of the racist tone of the blacks in the book. Both film and book have painted what seems to be an apparent and truthful portrait of the emerging 1860s America.Scarlett and Rhett are truly two of the best characters have created. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable have forever left their mark on these literary legends. It would be hard to imagine anyone but these people in the roles. Despite the legendary Katharine Hepburn's similarity to Scarlett and Bette Davis' uncanny ability to play spoilt belles of a similar nature (""The Cabin in the Cotton"", ""Jezebel""), the heights of excellence, fierceness and determination reached by Leigh would not be able to be matched. The same could be said for either Errol Flynn or Laurence Olivier in the other role.Although they almost don't need it, ""Gone With the Wind"" has one of the best supporting casts a movie will ever have. With Olivia de Havilland as Melanie, Leslie Howard as Ashley, Hattie McDaniel as Mammy and Butterfly McQueen as Prissy, they all contribute highly to making it a better story.David O. Selznick was responsible for the massive undertaking, bringing life and realism with vivid and splendid technicolour. The restored version is truly a sensation to look at. On the grand scale it was produced, it is sort of difficult to see it barely equaled in his later films of the 40s.George Cukor was to be the original director of the film, but was fired for supposedly devoting more time to Leigh and de Havilland. Despite my fondness for his works, Victor Fleming made this film eternally, and in its own day, stand out from the other period pieces and creating the unbroken legacy which has not died, unlike some of the other hits of the time.Max Steiner's score was haunting, which gave a real flavour to the movie. Who can forget the unforgettable last strains of ""Tara's Theme""?Set decoration, costumes and the rest have an eye for detail. The beauty of it all, and its grandeur, is just stunning.This movie, I found, has just one flaw. Epic length. But it wouldn't be right without it.

You watch Scarlett go from a will-full (albet beautiful) child to a mature woman at the very end (who is still beautiful, will-full, and self-centered mind you, but you do see her grow).

Margaret Mitchell's Legacy - Tomorrow is Another Day,"Young Scarlett is infatuated with Ashley Wilkes, but is disappointed to say the least when she hears of his engagement to Melanie Wilkes, who's a goody-two-shoes and Scarlett cares nothing for. Such begins the life, loves and whims of young Scarlett O'Hara in this Civil War-era story. Why is there another review to add to the already many reviews of this granddaddy of all movies? As I saw this for the umpteenth time recently, it crossed my mind that I hadn't reviewed it and to give a heads up for all those young enough to have never seen it or been introduced to it by their parents and are interested in seeing this long movie. What's so great about this movie, anyway? To begin with, author Margaret Mitchell was not your average girl growing up at the beginning of the 20th century. She was an independent creature who possessed a determined mind and a different outlook on the way things are supposed to be. To say she was a tomboy was to put in mildly. She was nicknamed ""Jimmy,"" by those who knew her tomboyish ways and she loved the nickname. She was also called ""Peggy"" by her mother, which was a nickname for Margaret. She loved writing even as a young girl and would be writing constantly in her diary. Years later, the idea came to her for a novel when she recalled from her youth the time her mother took her to all the plantations and lands that once were prosperous during the pre-Civil War days and how the people lived and how they lost all they had when the war came, and it intrigued her how the families and generations must have endured that terrible inevitable war. Her mother's point in telling all this to young Peggy was to instill in Margaret a survival instinct. Drawing on her own husbands and beaus, Margaret conceived of the leads of Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes. And even the young girl's name was not Scarlett in the beginning, but Patsy. Taking three years, she wrote laboriously until she got her draft the way she wanted it, somewhat. She began her story with the end and wrote backwards. So she knew what her vision and her message was, even from the first word. Given the fact Margaret Mitchell was an independent person, the book's ending is not totaling surprising. It was really all about survival, no matter what. But what plagued her throughout writing was her first chapter. Not feeling completely satisfied, she shelved it, despite her insistence of her second husband and a publisher. When girlfriends heard of this novel, one of them made a remark that would change not only film history, but book history: ""Margaret, you wrote a book! You? I didn't know you had it in you."" With this anger and almost uncontrollable rage of being put in her place, Margaret got her draft and gave it to her publisher friend. Although he said it needed work, he was in awe of what he read. Despite the fact Americans were in the midst of the depression, ""Gone with the Wind"" took them by storm. Due to its bulkiness, it cost $3, and Margaret was impressed that anyone would spend $3 for it, given the hard times. ""Gone with the Wind"" broke all book records and still today sells hundreds of thousands of copies each year. With the name change to Scarlett encouraged by the publishers, ""Gone with the Wind"" was an extravaganza that debuted on December 15, 1939 in Atlanta, Georgia with most of the cast there, except for the black supporting players. Winning 10 Oscars for Vivien Leigh as Scarlett, Best Picture and Best Director, this has been the definitive example of story-telling splashed on film. Director George Cukor started production but was replaced by Victor Fleming who was credited and who received the award. Ben-Hur would later break the record for the most Oscars, but it's ""Gone with the Wind""'s characters and their real flaws and dreams that have kept this film alive and in the hearts and imaginations of generations ever since. Upon seeing again, it occurred to me that once you have seen a movie over and over, sometimes it feel like you're just seeing it automatically, having it all memorized. But the magic of ""Gone with the Wind"" is that you are transported to another time that is made so real and so vivid that you never feel bored or unaffected with what you're watching. There are too many good actors in this to go into that, but suffice it to say that neither Clark Gable nor Leslie Howard wanted to be in this film, Clark for fear he could not live up to the young ladies' expectations of a Rhett Butler and because it was essentially a woman's film and Leslie Howard felt that Ashley was weak and Leslie Howard had a reputation as a ladies' man. And, the role of Scarlett O'Hara was the role of a lifetime, and that's another story of how they were filming the burning of Atlanta when in walks Vivien Leigh. End of discussion. Why should anyone today, new generations and you watch this film – because it shows you how to write films, how to develop strong characters, because it is part of our culture that shows what we came from and where we may be going in the future. That's just a few reasons. For sheer entertainment, nothing can really top this – no words are big enough or opulent enough – to describe the experience of watching ""Gone with the Wind,"" especially for the first time. It's cinematically beautiful, majestic, stirring, and stupendous. Well, less is more, so suffice it to say, I would recommend ""Gone with the Wind"" to anyone serious about watching good films and interested seriously about making movies. Margaret Mitchell left quite a legacy – the dreams, the hopes, the drive of a young woman who influenced the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

A civilization has gone with the wind.,"""GONE WITH THE WIND"" has two versions translated in China: ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Gone with the Wind."". I prefer the latter, as in the beginning of the movie, a line of subtitles appeared: A civilization has gone with the wind; A person's fate is floating with the wind, and eventually it will drift away. In fact, it is not just the drift of a civilization, but the drift of civilization is accompanied by countless individuals, generations, dreams, and lifestyles. It's like facing an ultimate goal - death - whether you choose to live soberly and pessimistically and emptily, or to live blindly and actively without this ultimate goal; After the disappearance of a civilization, do you choose to live in remembrance or abandon the past and start anew.

We should stop giving extra points just because it's classic and evaluate 'Gone with the Wind' with 2021's perspective,"'Gone with the Wind'. The best movie of all time, a highest-grossing film, the most famous and the most watched movie, the film with the most iconic quotes 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn', and so many other modifiers will still not capture the significance of 'Gone with the Wind'. It was well-made enough to attract more than half of the U. S population to theaters for four years after release and to impress international viewers with Hollywood glam, all happening in 1939. In 1939, I would have praised its story development and character development and said I had never seen such a confident, talented, and blunt women protagonist in the film history. It lasts for FOUR hours (Gosh, it was long), but that four hours are worth it because the movie tells so many stories based on different stages of Scarlett's life and has characters with distinctive personalities. The use of color in the movie is marvelous. When Scarlett stands on the top of Tara with her father, the camera zooms out and the audience sees the whole orange-ish screen. Great scene with great aesthetics: vast field and sunset. It looks as if rays touch all parts of the land as Scarlett will soon do. They represent her passion and care for homeland. After the war, audience watches more brown and red. Factories engulfed in flame, we see the screen full of red. When Scarlett and Melly comes back to Tara, we see nothing but the brown, which emphasizes barrenness and desertedness.However, I cannot help feeling uncomfortable when the director sugarcodes the reality of slavery. I'm sure some slaveowners treated slaves with some respect, but as the history tells us, that is not the case. How the movie portrays the Civil War is very one-sided, labeling Yankees as thieves, greed bankers, destroyers, and authoritarians while the director MUST add the line for Ashley that he was going to freed the slaves. At some point, I felt as if I was watching Confederacy propaganda.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Why ""Gone with the wind"" is so good?","Why ""Gone with the wind"" is it so good? Maybe because it encompasses all the states of human soul: love and hate, happiness and pain, tenacity and weakness, enthusiasm and disappointment, compassion and indifference, honor and dishonor, sincerity and hypocrisy, wealth and poverty, ability and inability, courage and fear, desperation and hope. And the series could continue. A series as complex as human existence. A movie of success and fails. A movie from which everyone can choose their own way forward in life. A movie of search and self-knowledge. A movie about the mystery of life and death that trying to understand. And believe me. A movie like that will no longer do. Many see and like what they see, little think and even fewer say it. Margaret Mitchell, the novel writer, was one of the very few. If you are one of those few who really ask questions about the meaning of existence, review the film and I am sure you will find the answer to your question. Fortunately for humanity and the human race, most people are mere transmitters of genetic information. I recently reviewed, in order not to know how many times, every time with several years added to the thread of my life, this masterpiece that is not only a great film. It is a living history of human existence in which the author of the novel, not only notices the problems of human existence, but to her great generosity, also offers viable answers. Among many other remarkable scenes I really like one. That oath that the heroine makes, filled with hunger and suffering, in which she synthesizes all the faith of her existence and not only of her.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

THANK YOU TCM FOR RUNNING THIS MASTERPIECE.,"THE soap opera of soap operas, and it's a long road to travel. Perhaps the most fascinating item about this epic is the incredible list of actresses who tried out for the lead role of Scarlett O'Hara. That in itself is a remarkable story.Most every scene is a gem, but the train depot scene is regarded as legend, certainly from a technical standpoint and the astounding amount of extras used.True, the MGM lot was literally torn down to make way for the burning of Atlanta, and did it burn.Screenwriter Sidney Howard was, in fact, assisted by F. Scott Fitzgerald, a super trivia question. Not to forget some of the dynamic supporting actors in smaller roles but quite memorable, a who's who of Hollywood, including master stuntman Yakima Canutt, Ward Bond, Isabel Jewell, Ann Rutherford, Eddie Anderson, Cliff Edwards, Victor Jory, Rand Brooks and Violet Kemble Cooper, many more.Oscars for Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), Best Director (Victor Fleming), Best Interior Decoration, Best Color, Best Editing, Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Supportin Actress (Hattie McDaniel).

"""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.""","This film is a prime example of quality American cinema. Whether the movie is for you or not, one has to give it it's due credit as one of the most finely made films ever to come out of Hollywood. Gone with the Wind changed the way movies are made.Victor Fleming did a magnificent job directing the movie and bring to life the vision of David O. Selznick.Gone with the Wind was a product of the best filmmakers in the business, and the final product is impressive, to say the least. The story adapted here does not fail to keep us engaged, even with the films 4 hour run time. From Victor Fleming's direction, to Sidney Howard's screenplay, to Ernest Haller's cinematography, to Max Steiner's beautiful score, the film is a masterpiece.Vivien Leigh is an inspired choice for Scarlett O'Hara, and it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role. She encapsulates beauty and brings a sense of depth to the role that makes it one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema.Clark Gable is the perfect choice for Rhett Butler. It is hard to imagine anyone else in this role as well. He also brings a sense of depth to the character that just could not have been done better.While the cast is simply too large to mention everyone here, it is necessary to mention the perfect portrayals of Olivia de Havilland as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard as Ashley.Another performance that must be mentioned is Hattie McDaniel's portrayal of Mammy. McDaniel plays the role so naturally that it is hard to believe it's just an actress playing a role.Ultimately, this film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's book is an all- time classic and monument in cinematic history that is simply a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Top Quality Story-Telling Helps Make Up For Its Weaknesses,"Story-telling technique doesn't get much better than this, so it's no surprise that the movie is still so well-known despite its age and length. From the detailed, lavish settings to the carefully filmed action scenes to the well-timed, steady pace, many things are done masterfully.  These and other strengths make it an entertaining and sometimes exciting classic despite some weaknesses in its characters and its historical perspective.In one sense, you have to wonder whether it would have been a better story if the main characters were more worth caring about.  Nothing against Gable or Leigh, who both give fine performances that bring out exactly what their characters are about, but despite Rhett's resourcefulness and Scarlett's strength, they really are not very admirable persons, and it's just hard to care very much whether they are happy or not.  It makes the whole movie rather less affecting; it's always interesting yet only occasionally is it really compelling.  Yet at the same time, the characters in themselves are convincing, and perhaps their less-than-admirable nature makes for a more believable balance to the historical backdrop, which is a highly idealized, not to say sanitized, portrait of the Old South.All that aside, whether you like the characters and settings or not, it's filled with good examples of how to tell a story on film.  The escape from Atlanta sequence deserves its place as one of the finest set pieces in movie history, and although nothing in the rest of the film has the same intensity level, there are many other good scenes that make it a picture well worth watching.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The trouble lies in the casting,"Seeing Gone With the Wind today isn't the same as seeing it in 1939, and there's nothing we can do about it. In 1939, you got Margaret Mitchell's novel hot off the presses and read about the snotty heroine with arched eyebrows, green eyes, and an impossibly tiny waist. You read about her love for her frail, fair-haired neighbor who was too intellectual for his own good; and about the dark, swarthy visitor from Charleston with large dark eyes and a cocky smile. Then, lo and behold, Hollywood bought the rights to the film and generated more publicity than humanly possible about their search for the perfect Scarlett O'Hara. When you saw the film for the first time, you saw the characters from the book come to life in Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, and the brand-new face of Vivien Leigh.You didn't have the resources of the internet and video rentals, to go back and watch Fire Over England, to find out that Vivien Leigh was Scarlett O'Hara in all her movies and that her arched eyebrow never un-arched itself. If you missed The Prisoner of Zenda in 1937, you couldn't go back and watch it, to find out that Victor Fleming's claims of boasting the first crane shot were false. You weren't desensitized by all the foul language in modern movies to appreciate the curse word that was made an exception by the strict Production Code. And you wouldn't dream of coming up with an alternate cast that would have been even better.The problem, therefore, lies in the casting. There's a book I own devoted solely to the casting process, production, and publicity of this epic movie. Hollywood went through thousands of Scarlett O'Haras, choosing an unknown for her new appeal. Susan Hayward, Maureen O'Hara, or the relatively small star Maureen O'Sullivan would have been just as effective and believable as Miss Leigh. However, if given a different publicity tactic, a known star would have been just as effective: namely Miriam Hopkins, a native from Georgia who, understandably, wanted the part very badly. Joan Bennett, who looked like Vivien Leigh when she dyed her hair, could have easily been Scarlett.As for the two Southern gentlemen, the loves of Scarlett's lives, why wouldn't they choose an actual Southerner for at least one of them? Could you imagine the publicity of pitting ""Hollywood's finest and truest Southern actors in the greatest Southern literature of our time""? Randolph Scott, the most famous Southern actor who literally never made a movie without his accent, was passed over. He could have played either Rhett or Ashley, depending on what dynamic they wanted - and the following year, he, Errol Flynn (who could have easily been Rhett), and Miriam Hopkins all did a movie together to show the public what they could have had: Virginia City.Ronald Colman, a frontrunner on the short list, would have excelled in either role as well. Laurence Olivier, who won an Oscar for playing a blond brooder, could have easily acted opposite his wife. Before watching the screen tests that are now available on special featured DVDs and YouTube, my favorite choice for Ashley would have been Franchot Tone, whose understanding and sensitivity seemed to be born for the part. Once I watched Melvyn Douglas's screen test, I was shocked. He was fantastic! I never knew he had such tenderness in him, and he would have been a wonderful choice.Olivia de Havilland was cast to play the simpering, unbelievably kind Melanie - but that's just what she was: unbelievable. I didn't believe for a second that she was kind and loved everyone, merely that she was upset she hadn't been cast in the lead instead. She was also supposed to come across as weak and frail, but her sister Joan Fontaine, who always came across as sickly and frail, would have been a better choice. Margaret Sullavan, Jane Wyman, or Norma Shearer each would have seemed kinder and frailer.Thomas Mitchell's performance can only be appreciated after you've read the novel and learned he was supposed to have extremely high energy. But, he wasn't the only actor who could have tackled the role. Charles Winninger always took on high energy, Irish father roles. If Hollywood wanted a calmer paternal role model, they could have chosen Donald Crisp, Charles Laughton (who could have received a proper 'and' in the credits), or Claude Rains.Given the fact that both male leads didn't want to be in the movie, the female lead would have had a happier marriage if she'd filmed Wuthering Heights with her husband instead - in which case, the second lead would have gladly stepped up and filled her place - Leslie Howard complained about being carried by his costar, and Clark Gable not only refused to put on a Southern accent (which pretty much ruins the point of the story) but got the first director fired, doesn't it make sense to recast it?There are three aspects of Gone With the Wind that I will never criticize: Walter Plunkett's costumes, Sidney Howard's screenplay adaptation, and Max Steiner's music. Although Max Steiner's music revolutionized film scores forever, by giving each character and place in the film its own theme, and although the film swept up eight Academy Awards, he was passed over for the blatantly unoriginal The Wizard of Oz, which should have been placed in the Music Adaptation category. At the Rag Awards, we righted the wrong. Gone With the Wind may not have come away with any of the awards given at the Oscars, but the one award we bestowed was to Max Steiner. Congratulations.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
My all time favorite movie,"This movie is my absolutely favorite. It is the only film I have seen from the studio era that makes me forget it was filmed half a century ago. The acting is superb (although I hated Vivien Leigh's acting in the scene with Mammie while she is getting dressed for the TwelveOaks Ball) and the casting is perfect.Every film goer should see this film not only because of its quality, but also because of its place in history. GWTW was filmed during Hitler's reign in Germany, and it is reported that after watching this film Hitler dramatically increased funding to the German studios (which were at the time the only studios able to compete with Hollywood).If possible, try and find a copy of the new DVD version.

I don't see the appeal,"My vote is for the technical achievements. It would be higher if the plot and characters were more appealing to go along with those, but unfortunately they aren't.I guess the Civil War is thought of romantically by some, which I find odd. I'm old enough to remember the miniseries ""North and South"" that you absolutely could NOT get away from when it was on TV. Everyone but me seemed to be watching it.I'm not overly offended by the portrayal of slavery in GWTW... it's inaccurate for sure, but it's no worse than that portrayed in ""Song of the South"" which has been banned and shunned for decades. Why is GWTW still worshiped? I don't know. Scarlett can threaten to beat Prissy with a strap and that seems to be okay, but God forbid Uncle Remus tell a few morality tales about a cartoon rabbit to a little boy. But I digress.My real problem with GWTW is that all of the characters are either unpleasant or stupid... sometimes both (hello, Prissy). It's hard to sit there for four hours without being invested in what happens to anybody because they're so difficult to care about. Scarlett is cruel and selfish, Rhett is cruel and selfish, Ashley and Melanie are so dimwitted one wonders how many generations the Wilkes cousins have been intermarrying.In short, it's beautifully filmed, but leaves me almost entirely cold.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Hollywood's most loved film - but what in God's name is there to love?!!!,"Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara who is powerful, sometimes nasty, and beautiful and that matches perfectly with Clark Gable who plays the muscular, arrogant and seductive Rhett Butler who is handsome. Many of the film's characters are horribly arrogant in their own ways and that is one of the things I hate about this long, lifeless movie. Other bad points are that the film's storyline is so hard to understand, Scarlett and Rhett hardly ever get on, Rhett getting drunk so many times annoys the life out of me, all the nice characters die - like Melanie and Scalett's mother and so on, Scarlett suspects rivalry with Melanie over Ashley Wilkes who is dull and even just that little bit unattractive and I would expect someone like Scarlett to have a crush on strapping young men who have nice looks. Some scenes he looks better than others. I don't see what people love about this movie - it drags, its drama is extremely heavy, there is hardly any romance instead there's constant rowing and that doesn't create much of a love-story I don't think. It's on for 4 hours so I believe and to most people, ""Gone with the Wind"" would seem like 4 hours of romance, action, melodrama, difficult situations, stunning fire effects for Atlanta in flames - it's got the lot some may say, but I personally think that I can be so boring throughout most of its 4 hours. Very soon, in a couple of days or so I hope, my mum will watch it with me (I've got it on video and 4-disc DVD) and help me to get to know it better meaning she will hopefully help me understand the story and, who knows? I may grow quite fond of it. I do like the scene when Scarlett is forced to nurse a pregnant Melanie who is also very poorly and Prissy lies about being good at helping to drop babies she gets hit when she is caught out. I love the scene when Scarlett and Rhett take Melanie, her newborn baby and Prissy back to Tara and the fiery backdrop. It's not the best film I've ever seen I can tell you. I did watch it with mum and I did start to understand the story a bit better but I still find it rather uninteresting and irritating there really are so many things about it that irritate me arrgghh! - you wouldn't believe it! Oh, and by the way, as big, sometimes bullying and rather offencive Rhett Butler is (to all except little Bonnie who he spends his life and money around) Clark Gable was actually quite a wimp in reality and I found that out on the special 4-DVD box set. I'm not surprised he wanted to turn down the role of Rhett Butler he looks like such a twit but, I suppose, he did his best and nobody can do better than their best. Vivien Leigh looks like she's getting rather overexcited as Scarlett and not thinking about the proper character of Miss O'Hara mind you she is rather a gorgeous girl and I can see why Rhett was so jealous of the unattractive Ashley Wilkes. If you can endure people who always shout in a very grating way whenever they open their mouths ALL THE TIME instead of just talking like normal people do, seeing beautiful but abrupt Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara suspecting rivalry with a sweet-natured young lady over an ugly old man, Scarlett and Rhett's love affair lasting about a mere 10 minutes throughout a massive 4 hours, kind-hearted characters dying every two minutes at the end, seeing drunken Rhett trying to attack Scarlett and then take her daughter from her the very next morning then you are probably very likely to love GONE WITH THE WIND but if not then don't bother.",2.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Boo hoo,"I've read the book and have seen the film several times over the years and to those who whine and complain about it being racist I say: boo hoo. Get over it and get over yourselves. It's an accurate depiction of what it was like (including the language used) during that era of American history, especially in the treasonous South. The book is writing at its best and the film is exceptionally well done. There are reasons why it won so many well-deserved awards. And so what if both the book and the film are long. We know your attention span is limited, younger reviewers, but you certainly wouldn't mind the length if it were some comic book superhero movie, would you? (Plus, GWTW was made before CGI.) It's a ten star film and anybody who gives it less is clueless, to say the least.On an aside, I truly and seriously hope that America has another ""civil war.""

A nostalgia for the American South and a visual delight.,"Gone with the Wind is a visual feast, especially if seen on the big screen. Who can forget those flaming orange sunsets at Tara? or the burning of Atlanta, and the use of the camera as it shows the dying and wounded soldiers.But more importantly, I think this film depicts a mourning and nostalgia for what was considered to be an elegant agrarian society, when gentlemen callers courted Southern belles.  Ashley Wilkes constantly refers to a (Southern) gentleman's code of honour in contrast to those marauding Yankees. The beauty and elegance of Tara is reduced to a wasteland caused the devastation of the Civil War. In other words, the film mourns a past that can never be recaptured.As this film was released in 1939, I wonder whether this film was mirroring the anxieties that existed on the eve of the 2nd World War, when the threat of the possible destruction of civilisation was looming on the horizon?",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

A foul wind...please recast Ashley!,"The production values are spectacular and many of the performances are excellent, but the central theme of a romantic triangle ultimately fails to convince. It isn't that Leslie Howard was a bad actor. He was a great Henry Higgins. He was simply not the right casting choice for Ashley Wilkes. Yes, he played Ashley as a moralizing weakling, which is how Mitchell wrote the character. But he could not create the charisma one needed to sympathize with Scarlet's feelings of loss. Had Howard been cast opposite someone like Miriam Hopkins as Scarlet O'Hara, he would have held his own well enough. But throughout the 3 plus hours of the movie as produced with Vivien Leigh in the title role, one is too mystified as to why someone so glamorous and sexual as Scarlet cares about this flat-liner. One can't even buy it with the explanation that she only wants what she can't have or she only wants someone who rejects her. It's not just because Howard comes across as a colossal closet case, who married Melanie only because no one would expect sexual ardor of him with such a woman. It's just that Vivian Leigh's Scarlet is so aware of her worth and radiance, one can't imagine her being enthralled by anyone so inferior as Ashley, someone who doesn't even stand up well in comparison to her other long-shot suitors, let alone to Rhett. This fatal casting flaw makes the movie a magnificent misfire. In a few years, with the advance of computer imaging technology and convincing vocal duplication, Gone With The Wind can at last be redone with the existing footage enhanced by a better casting choice for Ashley spliced in. There are two ideal actors from the period. Both are blonds and exceptionally virile, offering a much more convincing counterbalance to the machismo of Clark Gable. The first is Errol Flynn, who, had he been cast, would have played wimpy against type and beat Gable and Robert Donat that year for the Oscar. The Academy loves the fabulous playing unfabulous. The second choice would be Brian Aherne, like Flynn also breathtakingly handsome and able to play the character as written by Mitchell. Both casting choices would have made the viewer understand Scarlet's misguided attraction. You would totally comprehend how it is possible to look at such a man and imagine something that is not there in a way that simply is not possible with Leslie Howard in the role.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

"A ""Woman's Picture"" and a Dated Curio","We know that much of GWTW was great: sets; performances; music; the epic scope; etc. But I will not say the plot was a standout, and here's why.After the war was over, GWTW devolved into a tedious over-drawn soap; I really squirmed with some of those scenes in the mansion. It had been a ""woman's picture"" all along, and the last half of the movie was really a drag. Besides that, the appeal of Scarlett for Ashley - and Rhett for Scarlett - has long been a mystery to me. Scarlett herself was a conniving, selfish, self-centered, manipulative little witch with no discernible redeeming values. And Melanie and Ashley were bores, while Rhett was a smug egomaniac. No, I did not like the characters! Hattie McDaniel's ""Mammy"" did deserve the Oscar she got, though.Besides the problems with the plot, ""GWTW"" is historically a tired old curio rife with distortions, although nowhere near as bad as the vicious ""Birth of a Nation"". The stereotypical scenes were all there: the ""happy darkies"" so pleased to be slaves; the malicious ""Yankee overlord""; the ""evil Carpetbaggers"" after the war; the ""poor oppresed South"" during Reconstruction; and so on. It was all a lie. The slaves were not happy to be slaves; the overlords were either Southerners or often slaves themselves; and Reconstruction was too easy on the racist South with it's Ku Klux Klan and other white racist gangs working to restore the status quo ante-bellum by terrorism.If you like women's movies and know the History presented is nonsense, you can surely enjoy the grandeur of ""GWTW"" and the great performances of its huge stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The true worst film of all time,"I didn't think Plan 9 From Outer Space was the worst film of all time. I think either The Creeping Terror or Gone With The Wind. At least, that's what the interviewee I refer to in my summary said. Not having seen The Creeping Terror myself, I will just nominate Gone With The Wind. The reasons why this film is horrible and overrated are numerous. Some of them may be considered politically correct, I don't know. But even the politically correct reasons have some pretty solid sub-reasons built into them.One such reason, and it shows the mentality of the times, is Prissy, the maid who simply cannot seem to talk in a normal tone of voice. When she is telling Scarlett how she knows nothing about birthing babies, I could have sworn that if the lines were being ADRed (highly unlikely in those days, but bear with me), someone in the studio was putting a live wire somewhere where they probably shouldn't. African Americans constantly complain about how they are unfairly stereotyped, but I never hear them complaining about this film, which bewilders me to no end.The opening crawls describe the lifestyle led by the so-called heroes as something ""gone with the wind"", hence the title. Well, things die for a reason. It's funny how they don't mention the rampant smallpox or measles that killed more Americans than the last five wars (that's wars, not three-month skirmishes) put together. Eras are only as wonderful as your investigations allow them to conclude. There are people, after all, who seem to believe the Middle Ages were a better time to live simply because the church had greater control over our society. Never mind things like bubonic plague (and people wonder why I consider Paul Verhoeven, maker of such realism exhibitions as Flesh + Blood, one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived).Clark Gable makes a decent fist of his role, playing the cold, cool heroic character that has served as a prototype in everything from Elvis pictures to The Godfather. Vivien Leigh, on the other hand, is utterly annoying, and comes off more as a spoiled, bratty child than a heroine. Seriously, listen to her ""fiddle-dee-dee""s enough, and you'll be instantly reminded of that brat whose head got stuck in the lavatory bowl in a boarding school on a regular basis. Such a scene would have improved the film immeasurably.And that, in a nutshell, is why I gave Gone With The Wind a one out of ten. People look back on the pre-civil war days with fondness, perhaps, but they only do so because of the rose-coloured glasses they look at the past with.

A classic that will always be relevant,"I decided to watch the movie ""Gone with the Wind"" after reading the book. And to be honest, I imagined the characters a little differently.

But the actress plays the role of Scarlett perfectly and outwardly I imagined her that way. The film is certainly shot amazingly, but after the book there were completely different emotions. But it's very interesting to watch and compare the script with the story in the book. Despite some disadvantages, this film is a world classic and is a masterpiece of cinema.

MGM's Overrated Glory,"What we have here is the single highest grossing movie of all time (to hell with your TITANIC and your E.T., the figures are inaccurate because inflation is not accounted for). This thing is the triumph that haunted producer David O. Selznick until his death. It's extravagant, it's well made, it's a landmark, it's highly overrated. What we have here is three good directors slaving under a maniacal producer to film a stuffy book to his satisfaction. The film is praised for its romance and scale, but its true assets are the crew and Clark Gable, whose Rhet Butler charmed the pants off multiple generations of viewers. The picture is a testament to the worth of the studio system. The trouble is that it just isn't as great as people say it is. The story is far from being the best (although it would be a challenge to find a better romance-against-the-backdrop-of-war picture). There are mistakes, like a pregnancy that lasts too long. Parts of the film drag terribly, particularly Scarlet and Rhet's marital troubles. In spite of all its strengths, GONE WITH THE WIND cannot rise above its short-comings to be what people claim it is.

Amazing in nearly every way--with an insidiously racist undertone...,"Gone with the Wind (1939)What to say after thousands of other reviews?First, see it. See it big. It has so many different kinds of scenes, such terrific color and photography, and is dripping with so much history come alive it is a thrill and a joy. It's just a really really well made movie.The acting is superb. You might not think about this since it's such an ""old"" film and it might automatically be old-fashioned. But it is not, not with the two leads above all. Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are justifiably revered for what they did here. Leigh in particular works her butt off making scene after scene come alive, with horror and frivolousness and charm and passion.The story is great by itself (based on the book which was the best selling novel two years in a row). It's not about the Civil War and its aftermath, even though that's prominent (and vividly, memorably). It's about a woman who is so self-absorbed in her infatuation for another man she misses out on true love.Some of the side characters are amazing.So yes, a great movie--but one that bothered me all the way through for its handling of African Americans. I may have noticed this years ago but I don't remember being so disturbed by the constant stereotyping. The slaves are naturally uneducated, so I try to overlook that as simple truth. And the black actors who play the three or four main parts are astonishing, all of them. Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar that year for best supporting actress.The problem comes more from what all the white people say, or don't say, and what they don't do, over and over. There is no sense of shame, or apology, or perspective on their position as land owners and slave owners. Not before and not after the war. All of them, except Gable most of the time (he's a worldly and modern Southerner), mourn the loss of a great civilization, one built on slavery. They are so unabashed about this, and so many people say it, from Scarlett herself to the man she is infatuated with (the admirable Ashleigh) to all kinds of older and younger folks. Even the blacks are shown not in rebellion or joy at their release, but as slaves eager to fight for the South.The more I think about it the more it's disgusting. Now the answer to my complaint is probably that this is from the point of view of the South and so it's true to their perspective. And I think that might brush over some of the attitudes some of the time. But where are the slaves dying to be free? Where is a single voice of dissent among all the huge cast? Where are the Northerners with dignity and higher morality? (On this last point, when the Northerners appear after the burning of Atlanta, they too are shown only from a bitter Southern point of view--all of them, black and white, are opportunists and arrogant, selfish, ""un-civilized"" sorts.)I teach a beginning history of cinema class and so see a lot of movies from the whole century of the art. And it's painfully weird that the two lionized, epic, breakthrough films about the Civil War are both from the Southern point of view. I'm talking ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Gone with the Wind."" And both are insidiously unfair to Blacks, one more subtly than the other but true.I'll end more cheerfully. Knowing the movie has this quality doesn't prevent you from enjoying it for a million other reasons. I laughed (it's very funny) and I cried (it's very moving). And I was endlessly impressed.

Supposedly, Bette Davis wanted this role, but could not work around her schedule for Dark Victory, a much better film. Clark Gable is very good in the role, but Davis also wanted Errol Flynn in the lead. Selznik was not having it. The intrigue of the making of this film was far more interesting than the film itself.

But be aware that despite the film's G rating, it is by no means a family friendly film by today's standards! It's at best PG due to frightening situations (many of which involve guns and/or cannons), a few scenes containing blood (though the amount of blood shown isn't too extreme), and many disturbing scenes involving during and post-warfare such as wounded soldiers begging for help, houses burned to the ground and/or looted clean, people running away from nonstop cannon fire in terror, and more.

From loveless marriage to loveless marriage, poverty, hunger, and jealousy, Scarlett struggles with the effects the Civil War has on her life.This is one of the first films done in color and for the time, some of the scenes are absolutely breath taking.

Olivia De Hallivand is especially good, and Vivien Leigh is the perfect lead. The Technicolor sets are delightful: an example of art direction with the focus truly on art.

A beautifully crafted if still troubling masterpiece,"My history with Gone with the Wind is strange. I first saw it in my junior year of high school and was blown away by its technical achievements. Yes, even af 16, I recognized that Scarlett and Rhett's relationship is toxic as hell but there was so much else about the film that thrilled me: the production design, the costumes, Max Steiner's score...Every few months, I would beg my English Lit teacher to watch GWTW, and my classmates hated me for it. As one can tell, I wasn't exactly popular. Soon enough, I knew the lines and said teacher and I would banter in that manner. Since then, I've watched it every few years or so. 2014 was the first time in theaters, for its 75th anniversary. 2019-20 had a local theater take part in annual screenings, with 2022 being the fourth time.Being easily the youngest person in the cinema, in not just this situation, is normal for me. I appreciate a wider range of filmmaking that most in my age group don't. That's not me being a snob but how often do you see someone under 30 going out of their way for the four hours. If I were like them, I'd be watching Spider-Man: No Way Home six more times.Scarlett O'Hara is an interesting character. She begins a selfish, spoiled trollop who manipulates the affections of the simple men around her but as the plot progresses, she matures into someone practical and devoted to survival.In regards to the fantastical depiction of slavery, assuming anyone knows how all slaves were treated by their owners. Having watched Goodbye Uncle Tom last month, a much more disturbing and brutal view, perhaps some weren't browbeaten.Find me another film of the era that shows a realistic aftermath of war.

#1 movie of all Times,"Gone with the Wind is my personal favorite movie.  I am only seventeen years old and I have seen it more times than any of my family members.  I believe this movie to be spellbinding and superbly done.  When the movie came back into theatres I was extremely disappointed to find that none of the local theatres in my area were playing it.  Well being the die hard Gone With the Wind fan I am, I drove two hours into the nearest city that was playing it in there theatres.  Not only is the Movie excellent but the book as well is excellent.  I pity anyone who has not sat and watched this movie simply because of its length.  They do not know what they are missing, for Gone With the Wind is by far a great classic.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The Best Film of All Time?,"Behold one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all time! Gone with the Wind is the 1939 masterpiece that producer David Selznik and director Victor Fleming brought to life. Selznick was the genius who wanted to combine melodrama with advanced production techniques and that line of thinking gave birth to this film. Everything about this movie is perfect from the lush cinematography to the portrayal of women and people of color to the cultural power this movie has given to the world of cinema. For a movie that was released in December 1939, it by far exceeds the quality of film expected of that time and certainly almost beats every film made today. Without further ado, lets delve right into this masterpiece!
This movie is broken into two sections; pre-Civil War and post-Civil War. Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) is a strong-willed woman dealing with the pressures of war. With Atlanta burning and the Union Army advancing, she is put through a lot. However, she has feelings for Ashley (Leslie Howard). But Ashley is set to marry her cousin, Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) warns Scarlett to put her feelings aside as the family celebrates the marriage. There is a new, mysterious man at the party, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who might be the one to change Scarlett's life. 
The movie has a lot of interesting themes. One theme is how women is portrayed. Scarlett acts more like a headstrong woman of the 1930's. The appeal of her character is how she individually goes after her own destiny; both economically (planting cotton and owning a lumber business) and sexually (going after the men she chooses). Audiences at the time were fascinated by her character standing up to the male characters, but she had to be punished in the end because they don't simply allow that sort of woman to stay unleashed for so long. That is where the famous phrase spoken by Rhett Butler, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" comes from. 
 Another interesting theme is the portrayal of African Americans. There may be points of racism, but keep in mind that this film was made when there were still Jim Crow segregation laws in the South. The movie does sidestep that plantations came from the era of slavery. More sympathy is given to the calluses on Scarlett's hands as she works. Unlike any film of this time, at least African American characters were given a sense of humanity. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy comes away as the most sensible character in the movie. She has many good lines, and she completely deserved her Oscar win. Hattie happened to be the first African American ever to win an Academy Award. 
 It's no secret that the roles of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler were two of the most coveted roles of the century. Fortunately, both Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh were able to meet or even exceed the sky-high expectations already set for them. This film seemed perfect for the two actors with incredibly big egos. Gable with his party-boy attitude delivered maybe his best performance as an actor and Leigh, the beautiful actress known for her drug abuse really shined as the likable, mesmerizing Scarlett. 
 One of the amazing things about Gone with the Wind is the breathtaking visuals. Many films of the era had a bland look about them, but this is not one of those films. Ernest Haller's cinematography is the best I have ever seen. The film makes great use of showing off its gorgeous landscape. The burning of Atlanta scenes really brought the movie to life as well. The use of color and lighting is phenomenal. Also, the film produced one of the greatest scores of all time. Before the likes of John Williams or James Horner, we had Max Steiner. Listening to the score really brings out the goosebumps. This score is definitely one of my favorite scores. 
 Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, Gone with the Wind is a majestic, sweeping epic that details a romance within the backdrop of the Civil War. This movie will make tears fall down your face, will make you laugh, will make you shudder up with tension, and so on. Even though the movie is some four hours long, this movie is the definition of why we go to the movies. It tells a great story, and it tells it well. Along with the Wizard of Oz, 1939 turned out to be a banner year for film.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Has its moment but it is boring!,"A lot already has been said here. But what I will really remember from this movie... Is that it's way too long for the story. Hence, it's boring.I have no problem watching a 3 hours or more movie but it has to entertain me. Here, I had to fight the urge to stop. There's nice lines I guess the acting is good for that time, but it was painful to watch without a stop I'm surprised that almost everyone has a very good or bad opinion here.

Not worthy of the acclaim it receives,"I've heard many people say how great this movie is.  The worst part is they claim it is a great love story.  I'm appalled that someone thinks this is a love story.  Scarlett loves a man who will never love her and marries two men she does not love, the second being Rhett.  Rhett, for some reason beyond me, loves this more than rude woman although he barely treats her better than she treats him.  He puts up with so much from this lady only to turn her down when she finally falls in love with him in the last few minutes of the movie.

My favorite movie,"This movie regarded Southern U.S. during the Civil War as the stage.A chief character is Scarlett O'Hara. She was the woman who strongly lived during the Civil War.There were black discrimination and gender discrimination with white men.The white woman had to behave as a lady in those days.However, Scarlet lived through an era of violent change.I held admiration in the Scarlet that was such a strong woman. I like Scarlet character.In addition, a change of a Scarlet feeling is the highlight. The friendship and a change of love were felt.As for me, it was strongly touched by way of life of a Scarlet as the same woman.I love this movie.The last scene is a point.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The greatest of all time,"Gone with the winds is a masterpice and not only in cinema. it's one of the most important things in the world. this movie have the best cast of all time for sure. thanks of Margaret Mitchell, Victor Fleming, Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable and others for blessing our lives with the only movie that Deserves 10.0 (also a big thanks for making it a color film)",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The film that set the standard for grandeur...,"David O. Selznick set out to make the biggest, and best, film that money could buy. The result is one of the biggest, most-successful, most critically acclaimed American films of all time - Gone With the Wind. Based on Margaret Mitchell's tale of long-lost southern gallantry, and a way of life that would never return, Gone With the Wind is a work of fiction, set in a glorified Technicolor rendition of the old south. Now, to say that this is all historically accurate would be like saying that this is a short film. Clocking in at just under four hours long, this story can be a little hard to sit through. You really have to get caught up in the soap opera. Once you do, however, it is not hard to see why this film is as highly regarded as it is. I can't help but feel that it is a little over-rated, but considering when it was made, it is spectacular. Vivien Leigh is extraordinary as the beautiful and manipulative Scarlett O'Hara. The intensity of each emotion she expresses throughout the film is outstanding! Clark Gable is the foil to Ms. Leigh's southern belle, the dashing, devil-may-care Rhett Butler. He is often very cool, allowing room for his bottled-up emotion to erupt. He spars with Scarlett, her intensity versus his calm resolve, but both characters are quite similar in many other ways...Leslie Howard is Ashley Wilkes, the physical embodiment of a southern gentleman. His wife, Melanie Hamilton, is played with a quiet grace all her own by Olivia de Havilland. Hattie McDaniel's Academy Award winning performance as Mammy, the voice of reason amongst all of the drama, is just as astounding as any of the other performances in this epic picture. While not a perfect film, Gone With the Wind is still an extremely important one, and should not be missed by anyone interested in classic American cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The best four hour movie ever made!!,"When it comes to the most popular movies of all time, not any summer blockbuster can't beat this classic, a movie that beat Snow White for the most popular movie of all time when you count reissues, TV showings, and of course home media releases. Based on a best selling book, Gone With the Wind is set during the Civil War, the only war in which two sides of a country fought each other for supremacy. There's love, romance, drama, as well as some comedy and action in this movie that's nearly 80 years old yet feels like a classic movie. Only one cast member, Olivia De Halland, is still alive. The movie has won many Oscars as Titanic, Ben-Hur, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy capper Return of the King. Go watch it on Amazon Prime!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Truly one of the greatest films ever made,"Having seen Casablanca earlier and liking it enough, I decided to give Gone with the Wind a go. After all, tonight I had six hours to spare, and seeing how long it was, this would be one of the only recent times where I would be able to watch it in the comfort of my own home without anyone to bother me. Well, I put off watching it this long because it never seemed that interesting. As it turns out, I fell in love with it.The film's plot summary doesn't do it enough justice. This is really the tale of a woman in the turn of the Civil War and onwards. It is interesting to note that it's told from the perspective of her and many others living in the South, and the historical background of the film also gives it a deeper meaning. It's intriguing to see the different events in history take place, but also how they affect a small group of characters. But the film is essentially a character study of Scarlett O'Hara. Because of the iconic scenes already known all too well, even I knew the infamous ending line said by Gable, and also how the lead female was, ""unlikable"", to say the least. But I thought a film with a female like this would center on the male, and then be about how he meets her. Much to my surprise, it is the female's story, and how she meets several people throughout this time. It is her film, and it's not until about two-thirds into the film that Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) becomes a lead character.Since I don't want to get into much of the plot and actual events that take place, I want to talk about the performances. The supporting cast is fantastic. Olivia De Havilland and Hattie McDaniel give the film the two most noble and giving characters, in their own ways of course. I knew McDaniel looked familiar, and sure enough she's the famous first- time African-American winner. She's fantastic really, nothing else to be said. But It's Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh that are the film's central power and focus. Vivien Leigh gives the single greatest female performance I have ever seen, and no, I don't use that term lightly. I have never seen her in any other film, but she's completely mesmerizing here. All of her flawed traits also make the character the best female character I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing on screen. One doesn't know if we should like her or not, but damn is she a joy to watch. She isn't merely ""acting"" here, she embodies the character in a way that feels completely effortless. Because the film's script gives her a whole lot to work with, she injects humor, sadness, frustration, empathy, and even sympathy, maybe all at once. Every single facial expression, every single gesture is easily visible and perfectly portrayed. And really, it's not such an easy character to bring to the screen. In order for this to work, even if we don't like her all the time, we must still feel something for her and be intrigued by her. Leigh doesn't fail once. Clark Gable has a much more sympathetic character to work with, and he also does it naturally. His charm, wit, and humor mixed with the darker moments in his role create perhaps the best romantic male lead ever on screen. The way he sees Scarlett, the way that he communicates with her in the first two hours are refreshing and unique, to say the least.Like I mentioned before, the characters, and the script of course, are really grade-A stuff. Technically, it's also amazing. From the opening shot to the last, it sweeps you off your feet. You have probably seen many single shots of the film many times before, but all in the context of it they all work perfectly. It's really impossible to find any glaring flaw in the cinematography, or even the incredibly passionate and soaring music score. The editing is brilliant, and must be congratulated for making a nearly 4-hour film go by so quickly. I know someone saying that seems like an exaggeration, but it's really not. It's incredibly entertaining for the simple reason that it's just so incredibly interesting and intriguing.I did take a long time to see this, and normally epic films like this don't ignite anything in me, but this did... oh, it really did. The only other time that a classic film that was deemed among the ""greatest ever"" left me speechless by the end was 2001: A Space Odyssey (which I do consider my favorite film). Oh, and what about that ending? One of the best endings ever, and that final line is as perfect as I could hope for. Don't put off watching it like I did, you won't regret it. One of the greatest films ever made, indeed.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone With the Wind (1939) **1/2,"(!Spoilers!)I finally got around to dedicating four hours to this celebrated film, and while I had to admire its radiant Techincolor cinematography, strong characterizations and magnificent musical score (thank you, Max Steiner), I could not savor much of the actual movie itself. Therefore, I consider GONE WITH THE WIND way overrated in the rankings of all time ""best"" films. While it's very appealing on a technical level, it struck me as an ordinary soap opera dressed in vibrant garnish. It's an ugly, gloomy movie that's all prettied up with fancy decoration. If not for this lavish treatment, this would not be anywhere near as praised as it is today.This is one of the long epics that really feels like it, and the meandering love story could have been told in half the time. The first side of the picture is mostly drawn out exposition, and it isn't really until the second half that WIND kicks into higher gear and finds its stride. As I said from the top, one positive is that all the characterizations are quite potent, and that goes double for Academy-Award winning Vivien Leigh, who succeeded continuously in making me despise her as Scarlett O'Hara, a hateful and abusive witch that makes you wonder why anyone would want to spend these four hours with her, never mind a lifetime (as clueless Rhett Butler so desperately wants to do). Scarlett is so mean and self-centered that I couldn't have cared less what happened to her (and I really wanted something to happen to her). I suppose that's part of the idea - but I can't get four hours of entertainment out of that unless O'Hara is actually Baby Jane or Lizzie Borden. How are we supposed to sympathize with her plight?What does Scarlett see in geeky Ashley Wilkes? More importantly, what does Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) see in HER? Oh, right, I forgot - she's feisty, strong, says what's on her mind, etc. -- but it should have been quite clear to Butler that a marriage with this user could never work. And when they finally do tie the knot (after she's been married twice already to men she cared even less about than Rhett! HELL-LO!) it turns out that Butler finally sees he made a mistake. Well, maybe not -- because one minute he wants a divorce, the next minute he's hoping they can work things out, then it's back to divorce, then a pregnancy lights up his eyes again. Back and forth, back and forth, two and a half hours, three hours -- and finally, like me, he decides he just doesn't give a damn. Well, duh!So Rhett rejects Scarlett. Their little girl dies. Goodbye Ashley Wilkes. Lovable Melly bites the dust too. But at least there's always tomorrow, and Scarlett still has her old land and another chance for Rhett. Ugh. While dramatically well rendered, it's all so sullen for this kind of a movie.I still give GONE WITH THE WIND a rating of **1/2 (""Fair""), because it's certainly at least that - and especially taking into account its great cinematic strengths. When I think of this film, I keep hearing that marvelous, grandiose main title theme, and I keep seeing the beautiful orange sky with Leigh as a silhouette in the night swearing she'll never be hungry again. I see impressive camera shots, like the tracking sweep where Scarlett walks among row after row of fallen war-worn bodies. The only way I could use the word ""classic"" in good faith is to say this film is a classic case of style over substance.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A well made film showing the effects of the Civil War on wealthy Southerners.,"This epic, though overly long, does capture the horrors of the Civil War.

I was not impressed with Vivien Leigh's performance even though Hollywood awarded her an Oscar. I know that this film has received many and varied reviews.

4 hours Runtime?? GONE WITH THE WIND...,"It's not just a story. It's the life of Scarlett O'Hara. Her complicated journey in search of love, comfort and promises. It's full of Melodrama, Comedy and Action. It's a pretty long movie with a solid runtime of almost 4 hours but every minute in this movie is full of beautiful storytelling and intense performance. The most perfect direction that adds the elements of war into the dramatic life of Scarlett allowing the spectators to witness the destruction war brings with it.There are so many characters. It can be hassle to remember all of the characters but their perfomance is what makes their character so significant and memorable to the story. It would be a crime not to mention the practical finish Vivien Leigh brings to her character and the story. Her chemistry with each and every male character is peculiarly a perfection. There are so many lovable characters in this movie but it's hard not to love the vibe Vivien Leigh brings with Scarlett O'Hara to the premise. I'm Not joking when I say this but I can really write paragraphs on paragraphs on about every character of this world but I want to short and spoiler free for the reader and sorry if this whole post is already long enough.The whole movie is visually striking. It perfectly encapsulate the necessary elements of the movie such as the consequences of a war, how it affects the humankind and along with all of this the strange chemistry between the characters in both love and hate situations that actors portray.

The wind done gone,"What a film - watched the digitally remastered version recently, after years of avoiding the film out of a misplaced preconception of it as being one of the first chick-flicks, full of saccharin sentimentality and for those who like their handkerchief wet all the way through. It really isn't like that, although have to admit my feminine side was stirred by the rich colours of the sumptuous ball-gowns in the early dancing scenes. Scarlett O'Hara is a total bitch - what a character. You want to see her fall flat on her face from early in the film onwards, but you keep watching and can't help admiring when she somehow survives and even thrives while most of those around her are suffering terribly. Clark Gable is a dude who would grace the modern film, or films of any era. Olivia De Havilland is quietly, radiantly beautiful, and even the usually boring Leslie Howard makes the rather dull role of Ashley Wilkes come to life. The digital remastering makes this 67-year-old film look like it was made in the 90s - the burning of Atlanta is vivid and impressive. The camera-work / cinematography throughout is tremendous. This film definitely deserves its reputation as a major event in the history of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
One film that lived up to the hype,"The speculation about and anticipation of ""Gone With the Wind"" was greater than for any other film of my lifetime (at least over the age of 10).Everyone was talking about the novel earlier, and David O. Selznick exacted the maximum interest in the movie. It had better be good; it had better be epic, and it was.A great success story.It was perfectly cast, and wonderfully directed. One might not think so, since two directors were involved, with a change to Victor Fleming from George Cukor early on. Usually this doesn't work, but this time it did. It also worked for ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938 with Errol Flynn) -- although in that case two directors were credited.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A passionate and intense journey through the ante and postbellum American South.,"For a film with such a long running time, Gone With the Wind has a relatively straightforward story. Certainly, it is presented in an epic fashion, complete with intermezzos and sublime landscape shots, but this film is all about intimate interpersonal relationships amidst the tumultuous sociopolitical fallout in the American South in the immediate wake of the Civil War. The film would probably be about three hours shorter if the characters realized that their cultural values were actually restraints on their lives. However, these people's obsession with contemporary mores is all part of the intrigue. The occasionally meandering pace complements these anxieties.Vivian Leigh aptly carries the film in an Oscar-winning performance as the feisty, brazen, and conniving Scarlett -- such a strong, independent leading lady, who is certainly more representative of the 1930s than the 1860s. If she were played by another actress with less zeal, Scarlett would simply come across as despicably spoiled and shallow. However, Leigh playfully skirts that line, while also providing enough fragility to convey Scarlett's rise and fall. Clark Gable is another remarkable player as the sly, suave, and frequently hilarious Rhett Butler, the one man who ultimately tempers the spitfire Scarlett. Olivia de Havilland delivers a heartwarming (albeit one-dimensional) portrayal of Melanie, who, because of her genuine charity and benevolence, Scarlett has a difficult time loathing for ""stealing"" her first beloved. Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel -- as talented as she is pioneering -- is a revelation here as the pragmatic yet caring Mammy. And Butterfly McQueen (one of my personal heroes) is an oxymoronic combination of adorable and annoying as the screechy young servant Prissy -- I wonder if Rae Dawn Chong modeled her performance as Squeak in The Color Purple after McQueen here.The technical aspects of Gone With the Wind are, perhaps, more remarkable than anything else. The film's art direction, lighting, color, sound, and cinematography are on par with, and even exceed, some of the work you find in productions today. There are many memorable images in this film. A few of note: the swooping, surrealistic landscape of Tara and her grounds; Scarlett dancing and merrymaking in her black garb of mourning; the young band member playing the piccolo while tears stream down his face; and the parade of fieldworkers bellowing their haunting Negro spiritual through the streets of crumbling Atlanta.A landmark cinematic achievement in every sense of the word, Gone With the Wind, as its title and textual narrative allude to, beautifully captures and preserves an era that is gone but not forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Great Epic Movie,"I seen it once when I was much younger and did not understand it. Having seen it last year when I got the chance and again recently, all I can think is how superb this movie really is even today.
David O Selznick is definitely the Ridley Scott or James Cameron of his era! So detailed and so natural yet so delicate when it needs to be as if we are really there with the characters feeling the same. The story line adaption is truly superb as the cast members carefully chosen from thousands who auditioned.

The most symbolic hollywood movie ever!,"There is no possible and reasonable way of electing the greatest movie ever made. There are too many subjectives variables which are based on personal opinions. Nevertheless, I think GWTW is easily defenceable as the most symbolic american movie of all times. Firstly it is the greatest hollywood box office. Outside USA borders, after 65 years, GWTW is still remembered and watched by old and new moviegoers. The plot has everything needed to a great movie; romance, war, tension, charismatic characters. Despite all the racism problems, the plot is focused on the central characters and mainly on Scarlett O'Hara played by the oustanding Vivien Leigh. The movie has, no doubt, a prejudicy view of black people. The american history shown in GWTW is also a fake. On the other hand, the main goal of the film is to show the amazing life of Scarlett. The soberb performance of Vivien Leigh will never be forgotten. This movie is not remembered by the racism message but for being a beloved history of a extraordinary woman and that was the Margaret Mitchell's purpose, at least I believe.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A complicated love story during USA Civil War,"If you really enjoy a classic movie which was released in the 1940s and you want the greatest of all time, you can't beat ""Gone with the Wind"", an American Classic Movie which was directed by Director Victor Fleming and was based on the novel of Margaret Mitchell. This is my number one favourite American movie and I have watched it many times and one of the things I love about it is the authentic 1940s atmosphere of the story, history and characters.The core setting of the movie is the complicated love affairs between the stubborn southern young lady, Scarlet O'Hara and generous northern gentleman, Rhett Butter during the civil war in America. There are many well known houses in the Southern Elite Society. Most of the southerners propose to Scarlet due to her beauty and clinginess but she shows her love only to Ashley Wikes who is falling in love with Melanie and they get married just before the war. Rhett Butter, the man from the North, is one of the many individuals who is interested in Scarlet. It portrays the situations before, during and after the crisis vividly and how lives were hard in the clashes and during the rehabilitation period.What makes this movie worth watching is that it describes not only dramatic relationship concerns but also lives in the 1930s, the class system of Black and White People and the manners and behaviours of the people of that time. It additionally illustrates a man's love for his lady no matter how she responds brutally. Moreover, it significantly points out how war could change the maturity of the young women who did not care about anything except her happiness before the hardship. When the battle starts, all men willingly join the army and Scarlet has to take care of the pregnancy of Melanie and her little sisters. The indecisive young lady was socialised by the experiences of war and became a thoughtful one who would use everyone to be better for life.Gone with the Wind is an enormously entertaining movie and I highly recommend it if you want to learn about the 19 Century Crisis and their ways of living in a completely different place and time. I couldn't stand to watch it again and again and ended up watching it numerous times.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone with my wind,"I love classics, and have watched 100's upon 100's, some bad, some good, and some great.This story, this film ... for all the usual hype and drivel ... is boring. It's so boring the DVD snored.Here's my breakdown:STORY:

Great Movie,"I got this movie from someone else. There would be no way that ""I"" would buy Gone with the Wind. There was no way that I was going to watch literally four hours of a full blown romance movie. But when I decided to try it out I was very surprised that I was eager to pop in the second part. I was surprised that I was engulfed in a romance story but then I though its not like that at all. This movie is commonly referred to as romance and that is how I viewed it when I started it but I quickly realized that its not a romance movie its a war story. I'm not saying that it is not a romance movie. There is a fair share of romance in the movie but thats not the whole movie. Vivian Leigh is great as Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable is great as Rhett Butler. The movie takes place during the civil war and there are a lot of exciting parts. The whole movie is a triumph and it gets a lot of crap from the younger generation. Everyone should at least give this movie a try.

CLASSIC,"It's a solid story, one of survival, love, loss, moving forward from the past, and coming of age. Characters are well developed, cinematography is thorough and the casting was great. Leslie Howard, Olivia De Havilland and Hattie McDaniel compliment Leigh and Gable very well. Speaking of the main stars, Leigh is beautiful and Gable is the type of man that is rarely seen in Hollywood nowadays, an old school smooth alpha. It's a film that deserves the term classic. Definitely a monumental achievement in the history of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A classic for a reason,"While there are many and VERY dated aspects of this film than make it kinda hard to love, I find it extremely hard to dislike. The performances, the direction, the cinematography, the grand epic scale. There's a reason it's one of the greatest movies ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone With The Wind is a Great Movie,"This movie is one of the best movies of all time. It may lasts four hours, but the story is so engrossing that you actually lose track. Vivian Leigh is quite stunning as Scarlett. I would list her in the top 5 of the most beautiful sirens ever to grace the silver screen. It was the performance of a lifetime, and definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actress. This movie may have been made in the late 30's, but it never gets old. It actually makes you feel bad for people of the South right after the Civil War. The desolation, the destitution. But you fall in love in Scarlett, not only because of her spunkiness and beauty, but her resolve, to carry on even when all seems lost. This is truly an epic in every sense of the word. It doesn't get much better than this. I would recommend this movie to history buffs, people who like love stories, and people who just like great movies. That is why I gave it a '10'.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
At the Center of the Critical Triangle,"As a science-fiction fan, I often have to defend my favorite genre from the disdain of mainstream and academic literary and film critics, who complain that it shortchanges plot and characterization.If I'm pressed for time, I shortcut my response by citing Sturgeon's Law. Master of the SF short story, Theodore Sturgeon was once being interviewed on the radio, and the host provocatively asked him why 90% of SF was crap. Sturgeon's snappy reply: ""90% of EVERYTHING is crap!"" And this is tritely true. The only reason anyone thinks of the early 19th Century as the golden age of music is because the only stuff that's survived from then till now is the 10% that's NOT crap. But there was plenty of bad classical music being written then, too, and not even all of Beethoven's stuff is top drawer.But that's the facile reply. With more time (such as what I have here), I expand the limited horizons of the critics by expanding their favorite spectrum into the 3rd dimension. They are accustomed to drawing a straight line, labelling one end ""plot"" and the other end ""character"", and assigning each book or movie to a point somewhere along that spectrum, depending on what they perceive to be the balance between the 2 elements.But I insert a 3rd point, off the line, forming the vertex of an equilateral triangle, and label it ""setting"". I show my own disdain for mainstream mimetic fiction by saying ""Sure, ANY old hack writer can start a novel with 'It was raining as the battered gray Chevy pulled up to the Empire State Building, battered gray Harvey Bluedorn emerged, and his battered gray flannel suit immediately started showing big dark blotches.', because your readers immediately understand the setting and circumstances; they're familiar with New York, Chevies, and suits, even if they've never been there, driven one, or worn one.SF and fantasy writers have the added burdens of not only inventing whole new worlds where their stories take place, they must also describe them clearly enuf to form a useful mental picture without dropping a huge expository lump into the early going. (This is somewhat easier for movie-makers, who can show without having to tell, but it's still more challenging than an establishing shot of, say, Antarctica.)So, to me, the ideal balance is not midway between plot and characterization, ignoring the duty of setting altogether, but rather at the center of the equilateral triangle.By that measure, the platinum standard of accomplishment — the apotheosis of balancing plot, character, and setting, in the full richness of each — is Gone with the Wind, not merely ONE of the best movies of all time but the VERY best.I speak as a science-fiction and fantasy fan who recognizes that there's not a speck of either in GWTW and still rates it higher than Avatar or Lord of the Rings (but they're also smack-dab in the middle of the Critical Triangle if you take the time to look).",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
GOOD OLD FASHIONED MELODRAMA,"When I first settled down to watch this film I was determined not to pity the characters, and to come away from the television mocking the old fashioned acting and the sissy melodrama. however, after three hours of the stuff you kind of get used to it!The basic story is a very simple one. Scarlett loves Ashley, Ashley doesn't want Scarlett but doesn't let on, so she is left chasing him. She settles for Rhett. Rhett realises he's  second best and so leaves Scarlett, just as she realises that Ashley doesn't want her, and it was actually Rhett that she loved all along! In a tear jerking moment we see Rhett slip away from Scarlett as she begs him to stay. And oh yeah, there's a civil war half way through the film in which half the country are killed off and the society of Scarlett and her little 'groupie' comes crashing to the ground. this may seem like a 'beafy' storyline, but for three hours it's a little short. The reason that it is stretched out so long is that the whole thing is seen through the eyes of the self centered, cold blooded, spoilt duaghter of a plantation owner; Scarlett O' Hara, and every single little detail, or misfortune that she encountered is made into a disaster on a global scale! Admittedly she does have some very trying times, but for the majority of the film you just want to slap her and say: 'for god's sake woman! stop being so sulky and childish!' At first the wooden acting is very obvious and make the film comparable to a panto, but by the time Scarlett goes to the twelve oaks barbeque, we forget about the acting. Until the very last speech in which Scarlett exclaims 'tomorrow is another day!' This line is so cheesy that you can't help but cringe at it. Admittedly though it is one of those scenes that sends a chill up your spine. over all I would say to anyone who is thinking of watching the film, to go for it. After all it is supposed to be 'the' film of all time. Its one of those lifetime experience things. you can spend the rest of your life saying; 'yes I have seen gone with the wind.'",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Well Crafted Ugliness,"As a piece of cinema this is a deeply engaging film. The colors, art direction and Fleming's technical composition and staging craft a film that has a storybook and deeply romantic quality. You get lost in the images as you are you get swept up in the storytelling. Each episode of the film has a unique feel to it and there's a ton of artful touches throughout. I especially liked the shadow work in the hospital and birth sequences. It certainly captures the genteel world of the Old South in rose colored glasses.Likewise, the story of a head strong amorous woman doing her best to survive and thrive is deeply engaging and in some ways very forward looking for time. The messed up relationship between Scarlet and Rhett that is the heart of this film is still fascinating, complex and all to human. It grounds the epic actions in a intimate relationship. It helps that Leigh and Gable are at the top of their form along with technical aspects of the film. It is a long movie but story and characters are always vivid and alive.Yet for all that this film is white supremacist to its core. It glorifies and bemoans the destruction of the Confederacy that was fighting for the preservation of slavery. It equates white prisoner's exploitation unfavorable to the chattel slavery of black people. It is insidiously pro-Jim Crow and Pro-KKK. (Through weirdly it whitewashes the hate group as a ""political meeting."")This is duel characteristic of the film, well crafted ugliness, is most apparent in the character of Mammy. She is given agency and dignity by the screenplay; there is no ill treatment of her directly and more to the point Scarlett and Rhett both seek and follow her advice (abet in minor ways). And in McDaniel's hands the character is vividly fleshed out and very real. (She did the Oscar after all). And yet Mammy is a gross racial stereotype, she is still a slave and she is still not treated as an equal human being to the white characters.This film is messed up. It should not be classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
One of the greatest films of all time,"Gone With the Wind is a magnificent Civil War picture that deserved all the Academy Awards it got and it deserved more (Clark Gable should've won Best Actor, why he didn't is one of the greatest mysteries in the history of cinema). The film starts off with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, a selfish, hot-tempered Southern lady, who becomes exceedingly depressed when Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), the man she loves, is getting married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Scarlett then meets a man, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable, in a superlative performance) who falls in love with her. Scarlett feels vague love for him, but she can't take her mind off of Ashley. Scarlett feels her life it tearing apart, when the Yankees come to attack and Ashley is fighting in the war, and what happens at the end is a lesson Scarlett should've learned from the advice that people taught her. It is a powerful, heart-breaking story that will leave you weeping. I believe it deserves to be much higher on the top 250 list. This film is among the greatest films I have seen in my life, and it is the greatest love film I have seen in my life. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see excellent cinema with a non-outdated story.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, Mammy and Tara","Released in 1939 and directed by Victor Fleming, ""Gone with the Wind"" chronicles events at a Georgia plantation and points nearby before, during and after the Civil War. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable star as Scarlett and Rhett while Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard play Melanie and Ashley. Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen appear as Mammy and Prissy.This is certainly an iconic movie and obviously spectacular in its day, but it was outdone by the same production team seven years later with ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946), which is just an all-around superior movie and holds up better all these decades later. Some people wrongly diss ""Gone with the Wind"" for depicting plantation life and the requisite slavery, not to mention portraying it in a relatively neutral light, but this institution was a fact-of-life in the Deep South at the time and, believe it or not, not all slave owners were inhuman monsters dripping with evil.The opening act is weak with its hokey writing/acting. I half expected the peripheral cast to break out in choreographed song & dance at any moment. Once you get used to the quaint vibe, however, the story pretty much takes you in and really perks up with the burning of Atlanta. Unfortunately, Scarlett is a weak protagonist. She's selfish, neurotic and annoying despite her physical beauty. In the second half, just when you think she's redeemable, you find out you're wrong. Rhett isn't much better, but at least he has that charismatic gleam. Actually, I'm kinda impressed that they used these two as the protagonists because they're definitely antiheroes long before the antihero came into vogue. Melanie and Ashley are the true heroes of the movie, particularly the former.Another problem is that, except for establishing shots (in Arkansas and Georgia), the movie was filmed in Southern California, including the outdoor sequences, and it's too obvious. An additional issue is that the last 45 minutes are generally weak for several reasons and the story just goes on & on when it seriously needed to wrap up. And then there's the hilariously delivered final line by Scarlett. Still, the movie's iconic and there's enough good here to make it worth checking out, as long as you can handle old-fashioned melodrama.For a more realistic depiction of the Plantation Era, albeit on a TV budget, check out 1980's ""Beulah Land,"" which was shot on an actual plantation and points nearby in Natchez, Mississippi.The film runs 335 minutes (5 minutes shy of 4 hours).GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Not bad, perhaps, but soooo overrated...","I just don't get the big deal about this movie. I wouldn't go so far as to call it actively bad, but why everybody insists on praising it to high heaven is beyond me.Sure, the statistics are impressive enough: monster length, color, all-star cast, ambitious special effects which were probably unique at the time. It's clear enough that the movie *wants* to be big. The problem is that sheer flamboyance by itself does not make a great movie. The heart of a truly brilliant movie is in the characters and the plot.And there's the rub. Neither the characters nor the plot do much for me. The characters are, to put it mildly, unlikable. Scarlett in particular has no redeeming features at all; she is just the whiniest, prickliest, most selfish piece of mischief I have ever wanted to say ""Frankly, my dear, you make me want to hurl"" to. The other characters are either just as selfish and unlikable or so downtrodden that my initial pity for them has eroded away to nothing by the end of the movie (another drawback of its ambitious length).As to the plot--well, it's basically one melodramatic potboiler run into another melodramatic potboiler run into another... I can stand (even like) melodrama in small doses, but ""as God is my witness, this movie will never move me to tears again"" (as a matter of fact it never did in the first place, but anything for a pun...).For the reasons just outlined, I do not agree with the widespread opinion that this is a great movie. Whether it is a good movie is a matter of taste and probably depends largely on how easily one can stomach its lesser flaws, the most glaring of which is its casual racism (that one carpetbagger just *had* to be an ""uppity n---er,"" didn't he?). But I wouldn't call it a flawed masterpiece--just a flawed melodramatic potboiler with rather uninteresting characters.",3.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A Favorite from Childhood,"I first started watching this movie regularly with my grandmother when I was a little girl. I've also read the book a couple of times, and must say, this is the rare movie that does the book justice. I love the story, the characters, the amazing acting, the beautiful clothes - and oh what a crush I had on Rhett (Clark Gable). This movie is a true classic, and amazingly, it was released the same year as The Wizard of Oz (another favorite classic). What an incredible year for Hollywood. I of course realize that slavery was a sad thing in our country, but we cannot undo history by ignoring it. Rather, we go forward and do better by learning from it. I highly recommend this iconic film and hope that anyone who has not seen it, will take the opportunity to do so!",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Simply a classic,"I have watched the film again and again. So is the book. Male lead is musculine and enchanting. Scarlet is all the way not a typical kind-hearted female lead, but a selfish and aggressive lady. A classical role of a bad heart female protagonist. It is the only movie that i would watch again and again.It is sentimental when I come to comment on old classics. Like Dr Zhivago, the film let me think of my good old childhood, when my brother and I sat in one seat in a cinema to watch a film. Me and my brothers are not so close anymore, due to various reasons.Gone with wind denoted exactly the day when I got admitted into the university. The earth seemed to be under my feet at that moment of time. Comments on these classics let me recall all these precious moments in my life.Many things have changed then and my life is not as happy as those good old days. I was unlucky to come across with bad guys, causing me to have a downfall in the life.But I would be like Scarlett, who still has hope for a better tomorrow.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"a classic, no doubt","having made my way through the book first, i think this a very brave interpretation, and even though it was that length, there was quite a bit missing from the book...it also concentrated a little more on the relationship between Rhett and Scarlett, not that I minded at all, some of the people who have bagged this movie , I think, do not appreciate that it is 59 years old, so there is obviously room for improvement,  and I enjoyed it more than Titanic.There were some clever twists which I did not pick up the first time around... Did anyone notice that Scarlett's nightmare that she relays to Rhett on their honeymoon is also one of the final scenes? In her dream she is running through the mist, trying to find something, but she cannot, and it is through the mist she runs after the death of Melanie trying to find her true love, trying to find Rhett. To me, it wasn't too long, as the drama keeps you interested, you want to know what is going to happen.. i love this movie, and has shown that it can stand the test of time",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
It's the most wonderful film I have ever seen,"The movie, Gone with the Wind, deserves all the awards it has received. It lasts for 4 hours, but it never makes one feel bored. Instead, it seems that it has a magic to attract audiences to go on watching. The braveness of Scarlett O'Hara, the wit and consideration of Rhett Butler and the unperceived yet strong love between them can be tasted between scenes. It really makes me cry when comes the scene that Rhett finds out that Scarlett still loves Ashley and admires his photo secretly after she has married him and after all the things he has done for her. Even through after finding out the fact, Rhett only makes one movement, throwing the glass on the wall, the pain in his soul can be clearly sensed. For me, it's a great pity that Scarlett and Rhett can't have a happy ending at last.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A great film rich in themes,"Very great!!!Definitely a one-in-million film with perfect plot ,vivid characters and a tear-shedding ending.Through the story of Scarlett ,the film,I think, mainly puts forward a question of changing or not.As a matter of fact,Scarlett has always been a controversial character ,deplored by sooo many people.Be that as it may,I still think highly of her.Indeed.Imagine that era in which Sac lived!Throughout the Civil War,actually everything was changed.Turmoil,invasion,deprivation,robbery,arson...those bygone days were definitely nightmare for everyone,forcing them to make a choice between changing and being changed.However,only Scarlett had the courage to rise up against challenges.Only she dared to change herself in order to fight against the uneven and miserable life(in ironic comparison with Ashley who only wallowed himself in the past!)To change is to live!By all means!Absolutely Scarlett was the master of her life ,a great winner despite all her deeds.You can call her cruel, you can actually describe her as crazy,sly,uppity,but all these should be attributed to the era.(she might be a little capricious in the beginning though) .Scarlett just changed ,transformed herself to live through it,anyway.It's not her fault...She was also innocent.
By the way ,the ending in which Scarlett found her true inner self ,revealed the misunderstanding and expressed her deep love to Rhett is really really touching...Of only the story ended not in tragedy....",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A review by a Southern-belle...,"Being from the south, I have always been fascinated with Southern history and heritage. While I'm ashamed of the slavery issue, we cant deny its existence. I grew up near several old southern plantations. I was even an ""Azalea Belle"" in a local festival in my teen years - complete with hoop skirt and spiral curls in my hair.There is a certain nostalgia and charm to the old south that no doubt has captured the imagination of many that find this film so unforgettable. The old oaks trees covered in moss, the huge plantation houses with giant columns,etc.One of my favorite aspects of the film is just to focus on the beautiful Technicolor cinematography that truly was an astounding achievement for 1939. I would have loved to see the faces of the first audiences to experience this marvel firsthand. I also love to study the amazingly beautiful and lavish sets. The furniture and costumes enthrall me every time I watch.And who can surpass Vivien Leigh at the height of her beauty and charm. Her facial expressions and use of her eyes are entrancing. You can't help but fall under her spell, like all the poor boys who were unfortunate enough to cross paths with her.And I don't know that I have ever encountered a more sympathetic character than Melanie, portrayed so unforgettably by Olivia de Havilland. Has there ever been a longer suffering, unselfish person ever portrayed in cinema? Clark Gable is at his usual cad-like best. Not too much of a stretch for him to portray, but you can't imagine anyone else in the role. Truly, Scarlett met her match in Rhett Butler.My only slight criticism would be for Asley Wilkes character, played by Howard. I always found it hard to see what Scarlett saw in him - other than he was the one man she couldn't have. I never considered him much of a prize. He was a little annoying and cowardly to me. Poor excuse for a man if you ask me.Margaret Mitchell's novel truly came to life to millions of fans of her book. I'm not sure there has even been, before or since, a better adaptation from novel to film. And of course there was the legendary search for the perfect Scarlett - who could have asked for better PR going into a film.The story has so many memorable aspects to it. There are the suspense filled scenes - like when all the women are gathered together, while the ""menfolk"" are cleaning out Shantytown of the undesirables who attacked Scarlett. There are the heartbreaking scenes that will have you in tears - like Bonnie Blue's event ( I wont give it away), Mr. O'Hara's accident or Melanie's final fate. You will be moved to outrage at some of Scarlett's antics, while at the same time rooting for her as well. So the whole movie quietly wages an inner conflict as you want Scarlett to get what she deserves, but yet has you feeling sorry for her at the same time.The Civil War ultimately was won by survivors - regardless what side of the Mason-Dixon line you were born. And I think that is what Scarlett represents to the audience. She is a Survivor with a capital S - even if we don't agree with her methods!",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
great movie,"This story is about one woman- she is beautiful, she is rebellious, she is daring, she is strong, she is Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), a young lady from a wealthy family in Georgia in the 1860s. The civil war is imminent, and all men are ready to go to the battle fields. Scarlett is deeply in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he is about to marry his calm, graceful cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland) and Scarlett refuses to accept the reality. At Twelve Oaks, where upper-class people gather for a party, where the gentlemen discuss the upcoming war, where Scarlett pleads with Ashley to marry her, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a free-spirited man falls in love with her at first sight. Out of despair, Scarlett accepts Charles Hamilton's (Melanie's brother, played by Rand Brooks) proposal, only to become a widow soon after the war has started.The nation is torn, the great South is a smoking ruin and Scarlett's home, Tara, is burnt down. Once the proud and shining wealth and glory that used to be no longer exist. They are replaced with misery, starvation, poverty, sickness and deaths. Meanwhile, Scarlett and Rhett develop an unconventional but not physical relationship. But Scarlett chooses to marry Franklin Kennedy (Carroll Nye) in order to save Tara and make a good living. Only Melanie, the most compassionate woman in this story, empathises with Scarlett's intention. Unfortunately, their unhappy marriage doesn't last long. Franklin is later killed in an attempted ambush against the Yankees.Finally, Rhett asks Scarlett to marry him and in the beginning, they live a content life. However, when Rhett discovers that Scarlett still hasn't forgotten about Ashley, his intense jealousy fuels and this marks the start of their troubles. Scarlett loses her unborn son, then her young daughter. After all this, she eventually loses her true love- which is Rhett, as she finally realises.Of course this story is told from a woman's perspective, because this story is about a woman. This is a grand epic, the actors were marvelous and the technology was simply unbeatable. This film is about a courageous woman who goes through three marriages and still confused about who her true love is, and her lingering destroys Rhett's love for her. The whole tale is certainly tragic, but the ending suggests that there is hope, so long as Scarlett remains optimistic about the future. This film, in my opinion, is not just for women. I believe everybody can appreciate this outstanding piece of work. This is an all-time classic.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Frankly its a little overrated,"It is a good film, definitely sweeping but I'm going to suggest you could trim a good 30 minutes out of this one and it would be better for it.Certainly does a good job of capturing the feel of the times and I'm not going to criticise it for being outside of public acceptability in some scenes as they are now viewed. It is what it is.It does provide a romanticised view of the war in general but particularly the South. When I watched it I wasn't as politically (or socially) aware, nor am I American, so I guess I watched it as just a bunch of stuff that happened and without bringing baggage or beliefs into the viewing.Some of it is over the top but it does have a flare to it that does suck you in a little.",6.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Really a struggle to watch,"I finally sat down to watch this ""classic"" movie....and boy what a waste of my time. The acting is over the top, and by that I mean High School theater-like. Clark Gable seems like he wishes he was somewhere else during his scenes, very distant. Vivien Leigh's performance was as dull(two dimensional) as dull can be. Reminded me of Madonna in Evita. The background landscape imagery was a real distraction. Looked like they did scenes in front of a motion picture screen. I guess they couldn't afford to do location shots. The lighting is terrible, indoor and outdoor scenes. The cinematography was mediocre at best. Not much happens during the 3 plus hours, that could have been covered in 1 hour.

A Great Film ?,"It has taken decades for me to see this film, but I feel that even now in 2024 it still has a lot to say. Is it the great film that everyone wanted to see in the 20thc and how exactly did they see it ? I have just seen it twice over two nights and in my opinion it is one of the finest anti-war films ever made, especially in the first half with the aftermath of Gettysburg and the destruction of Atlanta. Perhaps negotiations between North and South could have avoided the massacre of so many men, vividly shown in the Atlanta hospital scenes. Without battle scenes we see the cruelty of badly equipped doctors with no medical means to help the dying and wounded. And Vivien Leigh ( brilliant performance ) realising the full horror. The North had the technical advantage, the South did not and also vividly shown after the Civil War the rape of the South by crude and exploitative carpetbaggers. The South gone with the wind indeed1 As for the making of this film three directors had a hand in it, George Cukor, Victor Fleming and Sam Wood. Cukor in my opinion should have been allowed to continue filming but thanks to a troubled Clark Gable did not. Also in my opinion this film is no love story but shows in the second part a microcosm of battling emotions and the war between Scarlett and Rhett Butler leading to a bitter end. Scarlett loves Ashley Wilkes played weakly by Leslie Howard, who loves her in return but marries Melanie played well by Olivia de Havilland. A quartet of infidelity and recriminations murders any trace of remaining affections, culminating in the death of a child. This is not a romantic film, and almost Strindbergian in its emotional violence. A film that I feel needs repeated viewings and seen in its total uncut version. To sum up I think it is almost a great film created under pressure and hostile feelings among its makers.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
One of the Best of All Time!,"I've seen this movie maybe 50 times. It's a long one, about 4 hours long, but it is my favorite of all time. I love old movies, and there are many superb ones, but this takes the cake. It is superbly acted and directed, the Technicolor is beautiful, there is not a boring moment, and it sticks pretty close to the fantastic book by Margaret Mitchell. 1939 is considered to be the best year of movies ever... and this movie won 10 Academy Awards and Best Picture. That should tell you how good it is. To the people who say it is overrated... I COMPLETELY disagree. It is perfect.Vivien Leigh. What can I say? She is perfect as the stubborn Katie Scarlett O'Hara.

The Magnificence of 1939,"I waited many years to see this. When it was restored, I saw it on the wide screen. I've become a bit jaded over the years, and it was hard to put aside my prejudices and look at it in a fresh light. It is a huge undertaking. When one looks at the year it was made, one would say ""astounding."" There are battle scenes, fires, big houses, romances, Scarlett, Rhett. So many of these are such a part of Americana, I found myself anticipating famous quotes and scenes. I never felt much empathy for Scarlett or for Rhett. There is a chemistry that can't be explained rationally. There's that incredible score that swells and moves and makes what would be much less magnificent into true events. The acting is a bit over the top at times. People are often caricatures. One needs to overlook that racism or you can't watch this movie. I think it is a valid observation to say ""look when this was done."" It is, after all, the Civil War, and it does take place in the South.

A good film (for it's time),"I was finally persuaded to see this film by my wonderful girlfriend, and for the most part I am glad I did; I did not, however, find it the awe inspiring, chest crushing, mind blowing experience that she does every single time she puts it on. The film is a little melodramatic and sentimental but this can be overlooked when we consider the date of its release. The central character, Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a ruthless, underhand, devious little bitch who manages to survive the ravages of the American Civil War and Leigh plays the character with a great degree of skill.Leigh's performance is matched by Gable's and the two certainly have an on-screen chemistry that lends a degree of realism to their highly volatile relationship; and a strong supporting cast lends a great deal of weight to the overall effect of the film.This film however isn't a patch on the book. Whilst Margaret Mitchell's original has been treated with due care and attention, there simply isn't enough time to fit everything in; no amount of acting can do justice to Mitchell's original Scarlett O'Hara.People are often quick to condemn this film as inaccurate and racist or jump on the other side and say that it is a milestone in film history. I think that it is both; it is inaccurate, it is racist and it is a very entertaining film. I cannot condone racism, but this film is a product of a different era, when things were different and should be viewed in that way. The time the film is set in was a highly racist time and this film helped bring black people into Hollywood.If you can appreciate a film as a product of the time in which it was made, then you will probably like this film. It is melodramatic, it is overstated and it makes my girlfriend cry every time. If you want my advice though, haul yourself to the library and get the book out! It'll take more than 4 hours to read but it is sure as hell worth it.Not necessarily my cup of tea, but I don't regret seeing it.Fiddle-dee-dee, I gave this film a 7",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
What more can be said?,"This takes place before, during and after the Civil War. Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) sees her family and country torn apart by the war. She's also inexplicably in love with weak-willed Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). However he marries sickingly sweet Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Scarlett pines after him but she then meets rough tough Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who wants her.It's kind of difficult to make any fair critical assessment of the this film. You either love it or hate it. I happen to think this is easily one of the best movies ever made. It does have some minor problems: Howard is way too old to play Ashley (even he said he was all wrong for the part); Scarlett's obsession with Ashley is never really explained; some of the treatment of blacks is pretty racist--especially in the character of Prissy (although Mammy seems more intelligent than anyone else in the film) and the chronology of the Civil War itself is highly suspect. Still all these problems are trivial because the rest of the picture is so great.It's beautifully shot in rich Technicolor; the score is just simply one of the best ever written; the direction is simply superb (hard to believe that three different directors worked on this); the attention to detail in this film is incredible and despite the almost 4 hour length you're never bored. The acting is great--Leigh (completely covering her accent)understandably won an Academy Award for this; Hattie McDaniel is a tower of strength as Mammy--she was the first black person to ever win an Academy Award; I always thought Gable was too old for his role but he really grows on you; de Havilland does wonders playing an impossibly sweet woman and everyone else is good--right down to the bit parts. Also this movie has some of the most quoted lines in history--""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn""; ""I've birthed lots and lots of babies""; ""With God as my witness I'll never be hungry again"" and of course ""after all tomorrow is another day"".Don't let the 220 minute length deter you--this is a true classic.

A Wind for All times.  ****,"The memorable ""Gone With the Wind"" captures the south at its time of degradation.Margaret Mitchell's outstanding novel was made into a memorable Oscar winning film in 1939.Here we have the lovely Katie Scarlett O'Hara who will not allow the catastrophic civil war to wreck her life. We see her go through 3 husbands in record speed, while she still yearns for Ashley Wilkes, married to Melanie. (Olivia De Havilland) Despite fierce objections by Miss Mitchell, Leslie Howard was cast as Ashley. It was believed that Mitchell objected to Howard since the late actor was Jewish and she could not see him in that particular role. Whether anti-semitism played a part in her objection was unclear.Hattie McDaniel, was the beloved, sly mammy, whose strong will kept a family going despite one tragedy after another. Both McDaniel and DeHavilland were nominated for best supporting actress; the former would win.Scarlett loves Ashley but he is taken with Melanie. She marries his brother who dies of measles in the army. Frank, her 2nd husband, dies for her honor. Rhett, the real man of her dreams, becomes husband #3. Despite a wonderful life with him and bearing him a child, Scarlett can never stop thinking of her precious Mr. Wilkes.There are fireworks from the actors as well as the great civil war scenes. Atlanta destroyed; the wounded crying out in agony is memorable.We have carpetbaggers and scalawags ready to ravage an already ravaged south once the war ends.Melanie's death, in childbirth, makes it very convenient for Scarlett. She can now divorce Rhett and have Ashley. Surprise!!!! Ashley professes never loving Scarlett who runs through the fog back to Rhett. She now realizes that she always loved him. Confusing? The confusion is worth it thanks to Vivien Leigh's forever memorable performance as Scarlett. She would win a well deserved Oscar.As Rhett walks out on her, Scarlett declares that she will think about how to get him back tomorrow. This is one film to always think about. A way of life gone with the wind is an outstanding tribute to a way of life long gone but whose memories are forever etched in our minds.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
GWTW is still the all-time favorite!,"Just as Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was one of the most readable works ever written, so is David O. Selznick's production one of the most watchable films of all time. Something is happening every moment--and all of the characters relate to each other in fascinating ways only apparent after repeated viewings. It's the kind of movie that transports you to a time and place that may not have existed except in the mind of its Southern author--and yet, whatever historical inaccuracies are presented here--it's a remarkable achievement and has rightly become a part of American folklore and culture.No other film has so many memorable ""quotes"" from a large cast of characters--and at the centerpiece is Vivien Leigh's striking performance as the willful Southern belle. Others around her are equally impressive, down to the smallest character roles--everyone has their moment of glory with the only weakness being the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes. Otherwise, the casting is perfect--Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil, Evelyn Keyes, Harry Davenport, Jane Darwell, Victor Jory, Ann Rutherford, Rand Brooks, Ona Munson--and the wonderful Hattie McDaniel giving the most genuine display of emotion in the whole film with her ""staircase scene"" with Melanie when she tells Scarlett's friend what Rhett has said and done after Bonnie's death.All of the sets, costumes, art direction and photography are of the highest order. William Cameron Menzie's production design is superb (he storyboarded the whole concept of what the scenes should look like with beautiful watercolor paintings). The one film above all others that shows what Hollywood's expertise could do with a gigantic novel when transferring it to the screen. Much of the dialog is witty and pointed with some of the best lines delivered in mocking style by Clark Gable.An abundant amount of humor and sharp observations about human nature are present in the script. No wonder it's still the most beloved American movie of all time--not just here in the U.S. but elsewhere in the international market. It was an instant classic and still remains one, richly deserving all eight of the Oscars it won, as well as the Irving G. Thalberg Award for David O. Selznick.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Still pure gold after all these years,"After all this time, this is still (according to many) the greatest motion picture ever made. The making of the film proved that the success wasn't guaranteed. It's filled with memorable lines and images, and gives us flesh-and-blood, complex heroes who aren't perfect, yet keep us cheering them as they go on through hardships they never imagined they'd face. All of this is set against great spectacle and even some ingenious special effects, (the production looks more lavish than it is, due to clever trick photography in some scenes). The fact that people still talk and rave about this story shows that it still stands the test of time. Acting, music, production, photography, and script are all outstanding. It never ceases to be entertaining, and even the outdated attitudes about some aspects of race can be forgiven, as they were consistent with the novel and the time that the story takes place in. And, in spite of lasting four hours, it's never ceases to grip the audience. This film is always worth a look, even if you've seen it before.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A very modern old classic,"Gone with the Wind is one of those few movies in which you don't have to offer a synopsis, as it has one of the most famous stories and some of the most iconic images and acting in Hollywood history.The script is a little bit soapy, that's the truth, but wonderfully portraits female resilience and friendship, the complexity of love relationships, the hardships of life and what it takes to overcome them.All actors are great, playing with empathy their respective roles, all well tuned and directed. They played the roles of their lives in this movie, some of their best performances in the movie. You believe them as the characters they play, they fuse in one and take you on an emotional ride.The colors are just wonderful, eye candy, they don't make them as beautiful these days! The dressed, sets and interiors are glorious, and even the fake sunsets are artistically done.Even if you don't like the story, the film has an overall quality and craftsmanship that goes beyond what most blockbusters have nowadays despite their extraordinary budgets and special effects.The movie was shot in the 1930s, but it has a more modern feeling than many movies made in the 1940s or 1950s.

The first part of the movie(until the oath of Scarlett in Tara)is the best because we see the personal fight of Scarlett to conquest the love of Ashley and the fight against the Civil War.The dialogues are too much literary but in this consists the spectacle.The second part is worse because the marriage of Rhett and Scarlett is a stop in the narrative.The film contains unforgettable sentences like the famous ""Tomorrow is another day"" at the end.

One of the greatest movies ever made,"Almost always included in the list of greatest films of all time Gone With the wind's reputation precedes it. Gone with the Wind is, simply put, a tale of two halves. The movie is divided by an intermission into a pair of roughly-equal segments. The first, which is brilliant and consistently captivating, covers the time period of the Civil War, beginning shortly after the election of Abraham Lincoln, and ending during Sherman's march through Atlanta. The post-intermission half, which dishes out the suds, picks up at the end of the Civil War and concludes about eight years later. This portion of Gone with the Wind, while still retaining a degree of appeal and narrative interest, spins its wheels frequently. One of the tests of the lasting impact of any film is determining whether it's still effective decades after its initial release.

Well done but left me feeling indifferent,"""Gone with the Wind"" is a classic. This is what we're always told. The huge story of Scarlett O'Hara, set against the American civil war and told over 234 minutes is one of the most famous movies of all time and, inflation adjusted, one of the most successful. This doesn't mean that it's any good however...In the movie's favour it looks *fantastic*. Some scenes are incredible - and not just the burning of Atlanta, but scenes such as when Scarlett is walking among the wounded men (there is a LOT of them) or even just the social gatherings. Full respect to the production and design crew - the film looked the part and shows that FX are not always the best way forward.However... Scarlett O'Hara is irritating. She epitomizes the spoilt brat. She'll use and abuse anyone to get her way - this includes any man unfortunate enough to fall in love with her. This is no real fault of Vivien Leigh but it certainly doesn't make me empathize with her character - I'm on the verge of gaining respect when off she goes and marries some poor soul to get his wallet. The idea of impossible love is hardly new and it's the core of this movie as Scarlett yearns for the one man she can never (and doesn't deserve to) have - Ashley. The only true match for her is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable). His character has somewhat more depth than Scarlett's but he seems to spend the whole movie going around with a lop-sided grin. Fair enough but with such a long story I'd have appreciated more.The story isn't pedantic and doesn't actually drag. It doesn't move along at a flying pace but hey, we're not watching your average slash-em up are we? It does seem to recycle the same concepts though - Scarlett wants Ashley. Can't have so marries someone else. Something unfortunate happens so Scarlett wants Ashley. She can't have him so ... - you see where I'm going.The movie is like a pulp novel - it knows exactly what it's doing and mostly pushes the right buttons. ""Titanic"" clued in on this idea of a grand love story set against a tragic event much later to similar success. It's undoubtedly well made but it's not actually an excellent movie when it comes to the story and I'm left somewhat cold by Scarlett's plight (and the rest of her family make me go even more ""fiddle-dee-dee""). Certainly it's superior to ""Titanic"" so those of who you enjoyed *that* movie should enjoy this. For myself I saw a movie that I was glad I saw but have no particular need to ever see again.

"In retrospect, maybe the best ever...","Aug-2019... Time for a late-breaking review from the kid who took a pretty cheerleader to see the first restored GWTW in 1970. I bought the LP Soundtrak with all new simulated stereo sound (wish I still had it-worth a fortune to a collector). Yes, maybe GWTW is the greatest film ever made, esp. now that a wonderful digitally restored version is available on DVD (there is a bluray also, but the DVD is superb).Surprise! I bought the DVD Scarlett at the same time & watched it first. Pretty good story. The 'back' story of the casting & production of GWTW is the stuff of legends & documentaries. Here's my belated summary:1) Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable performed magnificently. It was a crime that Gable was overlooked for an Oscar. Both actors were also very attractive in their roles.2) The photography is stunning-'spared no expense', indeed.3) I love the first half, but the sequence of tragedies that steadily unfolds in Part 2 always turned me off a bit. We are watching a tragedy rushing to it's conclusion. As my wise older brother once explained it to me: At the end, after Melanie passes away, Scarlett comes sobbing out of that room, and 2 men are waiting-Rhett and Ashley. If she runs to Rhett (which she should), we have a happy ending, and a melodrama. But if she runs to Ashley for comfort, Rhett is done with her-forever. A Greek tragedy. Rhett will survive. Scarlett is a tough cookie, who always believes she can get to tomorrow, and 'tomorrow is another day'. Sadly for Scarlett, her tomorrow, as far as a future with Rhett, had passed. Like the hapless Great Gatsby chasing Daisy, 'it was already past him'.. past HER, in this case.Anyway, despite the falling action that gets you to the finale, you will really love this new presentation in digital format.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

My personal opinion of the movie,"Although this epic romantic melodrama is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved motion pictures ever to grace the silver screen, it is also arguably the most overrated. Gone with the Wind is a very good movie, perhaps bordering on being great, but its subject matter and running time. Gone with the Wind is, simply put, a tale of two halves. The movie is divided by an intermission into a pair of roughly-equal segments. Then first, which is brilliant and consistently captivating, covers the time period of the Civil War, ending during Sherman's march through Atlanta. The post-intermission half, which dishes out the suds, picks up at the end of the Civil War and concludes about eight years later. This portion of Gone with the Wind, spins its wheels frequently. Theatrically, Gone with the Wind is an entirely different experience from its small-screen counterpart; some of the second-half narrative tedium is effaced by the glorious visuals. With a restored three- strip. Gone with the Wind has one of the best-known story lines of any film. Is Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), the spoiled, manipulative daughter of an Irish immigrant plantation owner (Thomas Mitchell). Scarlett has two sisters, but she is by far the most spirited of the three O'Hara girls, and her father, seeing her as his successor, teaches her lessons about the importance of the land. Scarlett is secretly in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who is about to marry the gentle, demure Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland). When Scarlett confesses her love to Ashley, he admits his feelings for her, but notes that Melanie will make a much better wife. Immediately after this meeting, Scarlett has her first encounter with the irrepressible Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the cynical, smart hero who eventually falls in love with her. They are two headstrong likes who simultaneously repel and attract one another. Ultimately, when Rhett has finally had enough, he walks out of her life to her plaintive query about what she's supposed to do without him. The pre-intermission portion of Gone with the Wind, which runs about 115 minutes, is glorious from both a visual and an emotional standpoint. It's a grand tale of love and loss in the midst of this country's most bitter war. Most importantly, it shows Scarlett's development from a vain, spoiled brat into a hardened, determined young woman. Her relationship with Rhett is there, but kept carefully in the background. There is sadness, humor, and a number of breathtaking shots of Scarlett silhouetted against a reddish sunset. Gone with the Wind stands as a romantic monument to the Old South -- an homage to an era and a lifestyle long gone. To date, no film has sold more box-office tickets than Gone with the Wind. Domestically, the tally almost doubles that for the phenomenally-popular Titanic. Of course, when the movie was first released, it wasn't just another motion picture -- it was a spectacle, an event. Even though the habits of movie- goers have changed over the years, it's easy to see why this film provoked such an outpouring of praise and adulation during its initial release, and why its stature has grown with the passage of decades. Gone with the Wind has flaws, but it's still undeniably a classic and a legend.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

'She was a fool' but it took her 4 hours overlong runtime to realise it..,"Brief Review :-Watched Gone With The Wind (1939) :She was a fool but it took her 4 hours overlong runtime to realise it. Well, i remember watching this film in parts in childhood days when I had no sense of movie reviews. But in last 10 years I realise how legendary this film was and I wanted to watch it in a 'Single Viewing' and somehow I couldn't manage that due to its 4 hours long run time. Today during the lockdown i finally got to see it in 'One Take' so that i can review it properly. I guess I have said so much in the first sentence itself. I always wonder that why the most watched film of the industry never makes it to the Rank 1 in Best Films List well, there are surely reasons for it. Those films where legendary blockbusters in that time because it appealed to that particular audience of that era but it doesn't mean the film will have timeless magic. Fortunately you see most of the Top Rated films of all time are not legendary blockbusters but, as Feature Films they are much Greater than Huge Commercial blockbusters. I would like to add 'Gone With The Wind' in that list. It may be the Legendary and miraculous film of it's time and there is no denying to that but how does it stand today? Recently, I have seen several timeless Hollywood classics which came before GWTW and even today i found them Greatest of all time and not Just of their times. GWTW has a grand scale, so many conflicts but somehow those so many conflicts aren't enough to make a one Best scenario out of it. I was expecting a Clark Gable's show since i have loved him in several classics films before GWTW but in the this film it was moreover Vivien Leigh's show. The entite narrative is about her and she certainly did a great job. Clark Gable got the enough boost in second half of the film and i liked the way his character ended. I felt like, 'Those days when Men used to be like Men' and 'Women used to be like Women'. The latter part is fully justified by Olivia De Havilland's character but not by amateur and fool character of Scarlett. A story of a manipulative woman who is love with a married man who doesn't love her and the woman doesn't understand the man who man truly loves her, ain't a great stuff. That one thing hurt me more than anything else. When the centre character of the film doesn't seems to be making a sense then i just couldn't help myself. It took her so many years in the film and 4 hours of the runtime to realise that 'she was a fool' and audience realised it in first 10 minutes. If there had been something intellectual or even sacrificing stuff at the end, i would have still loved it more than now. I would definitely love to praise the director Victor Fleming for such a Big and intense film. The production value, dialogues, presentation of the War period, costumes of big cast all these deserves admiration even after 81 years of it's release. No one can take away their credit and Oscars honoured them all. Now coming to the most important point what's there so much in the film for my generation when we have seen so advanced, so complex and almost all kind of films by now then i am afraid i couldn't recommend if you're looking something extraordinary. One should watch it to relive the Legendary Blockbuster all time but you cannot expect the Best film of all time because we got some high time Cult Classics for that. A film with almost 40 crores Footfalls cannot be called Overlong or boring or useless feature film but yes it is Overlong for my generation at least and not boring surely. Nevertheless, this wasn't a problem in 40s and 50s decades that i am sure about. On my personal thoughts, Gone With The Wind could have been a better film and i wouldn't have minded if it had not been such a big commercial success. There would be some people who agree with me and surely there would be some bashing me but i think they shouldn't bother because this review doesn't really matter after 81 years.Rating- 7/10*",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Melodrama has never been this good!,"The highest grossing movie of all time depicting a tortured love-affair in the midst of one of history's most tragic times. No, it is not Titanic! It is Gone with the Wind. The story begins in the Old South on the eve of the Civil War.

She professes her love to her man-of-desire Ashley Wilkes who already belongs to the wholesome Melanie. Scarlett schemes her way to win Ashley's love, but the more she does, the more it backfires. The film takes us on her journey of struggle against the consequences of the war which leads to her stormy love affair with dashing scallywag Rhett Butler. This turbulent romance is one for the books full of fiery sparks. Leigh gives one hell of a performance as one of cinema's most recognizable movie heroines. She is petulant, vain, and spiteful.

the most epic romantic film of all time,"There are different kind of romantic movies. Some make us laugh, some make us cry, some make us think about the culture barriers, while some are just erotic. Gone With The Wind shows us a rich and obsessive girl's mind and how the harsh situations like war change her life.The story makes us part of the film, even if we don't really feel connected to a single character. We feel different about a character in different situations, sometimes we despise and sometimes we feel sorry. I certainly remember a time when i didn't gave a thought to where Frank Kennedy was.The 2 year wait for Clark Gable as Rhett Butler certainly paid off. Event though Vivien Leigh's (Scarlett) initial acting looks like stage acting for the rest of the movie its good. The sets are certainly very grand of production days.

Classic Hollywood Romance Between Two Deeply Flawed People,"Rhett Butler, businessman and acknowledged scoundrel, meets and falls for the lovely young Scarlett O'Hara, heir to a Georgia plantation and well-known heartbreaker. They do a choreographed little dance at public functions, pretending to be affronted and then deftly dismissing each other to maintain dignity, but their true feelings are clear. He really cares for her, sees her as a wild mare to be tamed and treasured, while she considers him nothing more than a promising, wealthy candidate for her next opportunistic wedding. As the clouds of Civil War encroach upon their idealized southern upbringing, fortunes change and friends are lost, but Rhett persists in his pursuit of the girl and Scarlett begins to run out of options.Neither are admirable characters - that's part of what makes them so good together - but Scarlett is, by far, the worst of these two. She's an unbearable diva, two-faced and spiteful, and it takes the better part of four hours for her lifetime of bratty, manipulative behavior to finally come due. After soaking up more than his share of the heartache, Rhett savors that opportunity to deliver a coup de grâce, in one of cinema's most famous tell-offs. My heart leapt as hers broke. Should I feel guilty for admitting as much? He probably doesn't deserve any more of a happy ending than she does, but this particular turnabout is such deliciously fair play.Gone with the Wind is a catty, mean-spirited story, one that repeatedly abuses its cast with a vicious blend of social duplicity and hard truth, but it's also an extraordinarily well-made example of long-form storytelling. Without spending such an eternity at their side, I'm not sure we could properly appreciate all the warts and freckles of this doomed romance, nor the parallel fall of the Confederate way of life. We see the ""great"" south burnt to the ground, its once-refined population reduced to a vast, whimpering mass of dead and dying in the loose dirt that was once Atlanta, and we understand the price they paid for pride. So, I should imagine, does Scarlett, as she watches Rhett turn his back and walk away in the film's closing moments.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Beautiful.,"This is absolutely one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  It was shot masterfully, the acting was awsome and the story was wonderful.  They dont make movies like this anymore. Now it is painful to sit through these 2hr+ movies that they keep coming out with, but Gone With the Wind manages to be almost 4hrs. and be great every step of the way.I must say that when I heard the line, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn,"" my jaw dropped.  I could have watched the movie for even longer.It is said that Vivien Leigh was born to be Scarlett.  It is true, she did an amazing job going from the spoiled young girl she was to the a woman working through tough times, to a spoiled woman. Casting for the part of Scarlett took a long time.  Many women were screened but none got the part.  Then they tested a beautiful young lady from England.  Her southern accent was perfect.  So Leigh took the part.I shouldn't go on for ever, so just know that this is a great film that you should see.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
One of the best ones,"My birthday present at 8 was to go to dinner with my parents and then go to see GWTW, which had been re-released on the big screen. As an 8 year old, I found the story a little hard to understand - I was bewildered by people laughing when I thought they should have been mad or sad, and really the only person I related to was Scarlett's child Bonnie. I thought it so sad when she died and also when Melanie died.In my early teens I checked the book out 3 times or so from the library, I was fascinated by it. The beautiful and involving writing of Margaret Mitchell made me think it the best book ever. I still keep it on my bedside stand, I can pick it up and open to any page and read till I feel sleepy.I think that the movie got the main points of the book - it would have actually made a good mini-series rather than a four hour movie, but I don't think they did mini-series in the 30s.I think everyone knows that it is a historical movie about the Civil War involving a spoiled beauty, a plain, gracious woman, a man that is weak and indecisive, and a charming, masculine rogue.The movie is very well-acted and lovely to look at. The costumes and sets are great.My favorite person both in the book and the film is Melanie. What an impossibly unselfish, kind, sweet, good woman. Olivia de Havilland was so very good in her role as Melanie.  She is the essence of kindness, and the beautiful Scarlett is selfish, greedy and mean. Melanie acutally was more beautiful to me. Even Rhett says, after she died - ""She was the only completely kind person I ever knew.""Great performances down to the smallest parts, you won't ever forget this movie.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Unforgettable,"I still remember her running figure and train swinging in the fire of Atlanta. She is wild and proud, strong and stubborn, unwilling to show weakness or yield. Rhett is similar to her. If Rhett doesn't love Scarlett, he will not fall into the trap of self digging. For scarlet, admire extremely, but for Rhett, regret and regret.",8.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A reasonable film !,"This legendarily popular epic romantic melodrama is in my opinion far from the greatest picture ever made, but is certainly a fine lavish spectacle. It would've been better if I'd viewed it in a cinema, as the photography was clearly luxurious and didn't best suit the small screen. The music is rather fitting, embellishing the emotions of the film well. I thought the historical period was well established, even if one should treat its accuracy as questionable. As for the political correctness, the attitudes and situations prevalent in the film regarding gender and race are redolent of earlier times and cannot be judged in view of today's standards. If it were made similarly today, one would suspect some indignation would arise, and probably be justifiable. I suppose it's the factor of the black slaves being so unrealistically happy in their place that seems historically questionable to me. The film's acting was mixed really; despite its length certain performers either fail to leave an adequate impression (Leslie Howard) or aren't given enough to do (Thomas Mitchell). Vivien Leigh creates a far from particularly nuanced role, but an effective one. Scarlett is indeed a rather flawed, stroppy girl, but one is compelled to follow her miseries with interest. Clark Gable truly gives the finest performance here though, creating a wonderfully wry, suave and likeable character. The plot itself is unspectacular, with aspects of the romantic entanglements not convincing as they should, largely due to Leslie Howard's below-par performance. The extent of Scarlett's self-delusion/misguidedness seems unlikely, even for her character. The length of the film was no problem really, as my interest was largely maintained. I would say the earlier part of the film, before the War is indeed the most cinematically accomplished part, with a good atmosphere well created, and the plot moves on quicker later on, with the numerous tragedies and episodes being well conveyed. There is a fine ending, although it should have ended straight after Gable's ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn!"" ripsote. Clark Gable's fine acting, a steady storyline, fine music and photography are the aspects of this film that most impressed. I wouldn't call it overrated as such, because it is indeed a cinematic milestone, but there are better old films out there, and of the two major popular successes of the year 1939, I find ""The Wizard of Oz"" more enjoyable.

Rotten,"No, this film is not a joke. If you can get past the nauseating nostalgia for slavery and the rotten stereotypes then you'll get to know two of the most insufferable, rotten, bratty, entitled, and obnoxious leading characters of all time. There are very few redeeming character qualities spread across the entire story of Scarlett and Rhett.The obliviousness to the issue of slavery is just staggering. One wonders how anyone could write or shoot this story and not pick up on this serious problem with it, even 85 years ago, there's no excuse.The only way to watch this movie is to pretend it is a Blazing Saddles like comedy which it regrettably is not; it's literally completely serious.

Premiered 35 Years before I was born... and I still think it's one of the greatest films in history,"The period of 1939-1940 was, quite possibly, the greatest period of movie production in the history of cinema. Several extraordinary movies were released during this period, the pinnacle of which is ""Gone With The Wind"".The entire film is shot in Color, which is incredible when you consider that the length of the film meant that production costs at the time were stratospheric versus the standard black-and-white. I can't imagine this movie in B&W (which I'm guessing was the primary argument prior to the start of production as well).I first saw this film with my grandmother when I was 11 years old. Even at that time I was aware at how enormous the picture was (though the length at that point in my life likely influenced my opinion more than anything else).This still is one of the most accurate records of the aristocracy in the southern states during the Antebellum period, and the impact on that society as the nation advanced through the Civil War.If you've never seen this film, I truly believe this is a movie that everyone should see at least once in their lives.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn-Final words of a great performance!","I don't have to read the hundreds of reviews on this website to know that they will more or less agree with me that this was a great movie!

Everyone in the supporting cast was excellent, especially Olivia DeHavilland, Leslie Howard, Thomas Mitchell, and Ona Munson! Now we come to the real star of this movie- Clark Gable! As far as I am concerned, he stole this movie with his great performance-his charm, humor, forcefulness, and humanity seemed to dominate the movie!

Review,"This is one of my favorite movies. I can watch it several times. It perfectly demonstrates the whole idea of the book. Of course, there are some parts, which are not shown in the movie, however, it doesn't impact negatively on the plot of the story. For example, in the book, we see that Scarlett had children after her two marriages, but in the movie, it is not shown. Nevertheless, it doesn't change the main idea of the story. Also, I want to state that the actors of this movie perfectly show the characters of the heroes. I really saw the characteristic of Scarlett in Vivien Leigh's play and of course the same thing I can say about Rett's actor. Thus, overall I think that this movie is one of the greatest movies in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

Great FILM WITH SOME FLAWS,"IMHO this is an great and exciting film! But surely not because of the political ideology of these movie. It is the character of Scarlett O'Hara, which is so intriguing! She in in the center of the storm from the beginning of the story! Raised as a spoiled , aristocrat girl of the planter oligarchy, she seem'd doomed to extinction like most of her classmates in the civil war and after. Only some men, like the opportunistic , if responsible, Rhett Buttler were to be expected to survive these turmoil in a mens world of war and destruction. But she made it. Her methods were sometimes arguable, but she survived, saving not only her life, but identity and sovereignity of her family and her property, when the people of the old South , especially the male dominated oligarchy, only felt, that their time was up, like Ashley Wilkes recognised it. This movie is not about racism or even defending of the so-called southern ""life-style"". Once it was broken down, everybody knew, it will never come back It i about female emancipation, one of the first movies, ever to mention this topic. Of course, the last third of the the movie seems sometimes to counteract this impression. The Scarlett O'Hara, who could do everything, to defend her family and their farm, appears to have fallen back in the unconscious, spoiled , behaviour of her youth, selfish, unable to personnal affection. But the very last scene of the movie is a revue of her accomplishments and failures.She will not bow down even to the man, he now too late recognised as the man, he loves. She will never, even in luxury, forget her task as a self-determinating, strong women and farmer, some distant echo of all the strong farmer wifes, which build the USA. She will not forget her Responsibility for Family, Farm and the whole society, even if someimes to be misguided. As for racism,I have to make some comments after viewing your discussion board. Iwill not go as far as to say, this movie is defending slavery and racism. Ashley Wilkes, a slaveholder has to say the line"" I wanted to free my slaves after the war. And as I mentioned before, once the CSA lost the war, there was no longer any discussion about slavery. Unexcusable, whatsoever , was indeed the stereotypical characterisation of most slaves in this movie as dumb, faithfull loyals to their masters and Owners. But you have to remember, that even this was partially true,because some, not the majority, of the slaves must have felt some affection to the slaveholders, even to be recruited as black volunteers for the confederate armies(Of course, they never engaged in battle, because they were summoned only on the eve of defeat.)In general, the slaves were happy,when seeing some blue soldiers, a point totally ignored in the movie. But saying this, everybody has to acknowledge the great acting performance of Hattie McDaniel as Scarletts black ""Mama"" As one commentator said, everything Scarlett was taught, was taught by Hattie Mc Daniel. But her influence goes even further. The black mama is ""the"" moral authority of the movie. One of the key scenes of the movie is the discovery by Rhett Buttler , that The MAMA is wearing the undertrousers, Rhett once had sent her as a gift. That is not a sign of vanity or shallowness of her or even corruption by gifts. It is a sign of approval to a man , his moralty and his way of life and is more important to him than the esteem of the old southern society. So we have an older women ex- slave, who is actually the highest moral authority of this movie!(Besides Ashley Wilkes wife, played by Olivia de Havilland, of course) This is the opposite of racism! So there is a great ambiguity in the movie, concerning the race issue. Today, this movie must accurately be called politically incorrect, but for the time of the production it was even somehow progressive. P:S: As is known for some years, Margaret Mitchell was a generous sponsor for black students in her lifetime and after. Who will criticise her, should in these respect try to follow her example. PPS: Sorry for my bad english!",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Storybook come to life.,"Goes on a little too long. Casting is good except for ""Ashley"". Absolutely horrible. He is way too old and was not southern at all. These characters are young in the book. Also, there are some things missing here from the book but it still tells the story mostly. It looks otherworldly and beautiful like a storybook come to life. The strongest performances are Vivien Leigh as Scarlett (who rocks it) and Melanie. Mammy is good in the end and entertaining throughout.

A wonderful Classic,This is a wonderful movie. While the film was going towards its end I couldn't control my tears. A good melodrama and the tragic scenes moved my heart. A very touching story indeed. All the characters were portrayed good. I like the role of Butler and Scarlette. Scarlette with all her selfish love and fooling his husband and Butler still loving her wife knowing that she doesn't love him. The final scene is too good. When bulter couldn't control his wife's love for Ashley and leaves her alone while Scarlet realises her mistake and asks for his forgiveness.

A melodramatic and excessive game-changing epic,"There's little doubt that there will never be a film quite like Gone with the Wind gracing our screens in the future.A cultural, critical and genre-defining event that took the world by storm and has continued to play a big part in the history of Hollywood ever since, Victor Fleming's (with help from various others but somehow directing this in the same year he made The Wizard of Oz) adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's story of the Old South is old-school grand film making of the highest order that stretches out to a buttocks numbing close to four hour run-time of Civil War unrest, doomed romances, love triangles and freshly plucked vegetables as Fleming and his iconic cast deliver Days of our Lives like moments in the most operatic of ways possible.Combining together the historical moments in time in which the American landscape changed forever as it warred amongst itself with the convoluted ups and downs and romantic escapades of Vivien Leigh's spoilt and to be frankly honest unlikable Scarlett O'Hara as she traverses the new landscape and holds dalliance's with Clark Gable's roguish Rhett Butler, Wind is all melodrama and big events that sometimes work and sometimes don't but while in today's climate its heated romances and dramatic tension pales to modern counterparts, there's an abundance of Hollywood magic and production here that can't be denied creeping up to 100 years on from its conception.From the lavish frocks and gowns, Max Steiner's humongous score, Ernest Haller and Lee Garme's beautiful cinematography and the intense performances from its loaded cast that is founded around Gable's stoic charisma, Leigh's intense ups and downs, Hattie McDaniel's historic turn as the lovable Mammie and Olivia de Havilland's sweet role as Melanie Hamilton, there's lot of reasons here making one understand why Wind made such a resounding impression as it came into the world close to the starting point of the devastating events of World War 2.Capturing the true essence of what movie magic is all about, the incredible ability to transport oneself from the everyday and the now into a time and place that could be familiar, foreign, uplifting, saddening or a myriad collection of other feelings and sentiments, Wind is a labour of love and technical feats of wizardry that manages to capture viewers hearts and imaginations and take them back to a place in time where dinner parties, luxurious wardrobes and chivalry and honour run rampant around the thieves and crooks and while there's a lot wrong with this over the top story of a spoilt girl being spoilt, Wind is a once off outing that can't ever be fully denied.Final Say -A deservedly iconic Hollywood offering that smiles in the face of excess and relishes in its Hallmark romantic staples, Gone with the Wind is not the perfect cinematic epic but it's something all cinema fans should partake in at some stage in their exploration of the films that changed the game forever.3 1/2 vegetables out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
An American Classic,"I completely and totally disagree with the previous reviewers comments regarding ""Gone With The Wind.""  This is a film which beautifully portrays a time in our history of great selfishness and over-indulgence.  Isn't that what the Civil War was all about?  A war fought by Americans that sought to curb the abhorrent, but selfish nature of slavery. The screenplay is replete with scene after scene of clever and witty banter amongst characters which were written to be overblown, caricatures of the Southerners they represented.  But the actors soften their edges and bring them to a fully realized persona.  Mammy, as portrayed by Hattie McDaniel, is funny, clever, brave, and utterly believable.  Vivian Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara is absolutely delightful as she takes the character from her late teens through late 30's.  She is coy/sassy/brave/dependent/independent on demand, throughout the movie.  Olivia DeHaviland, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Butterfly McQueen, Evelyn Keyes, Ann Rutherford, Ona Munson, and Laura Hope Crews as Aunt Pittypat are all completely enjoyable and believable in their characters. ""Gone With The Wind,"" directed by Victor Fleming, is an absolutely delightful movie that brings to life a long forgotten America.

An epic that has gone with the wind.,"This is truly an epic that has gone with the wind.It was made in 1939.

That was an era that has long gone, yet the same tragic and happiness that we still encounter today.Vivien Leigh is an excellent actress, her fluent performance from her teenage years until her married years is just perfect.

Sweeping entertainment,"Based on Margaret Mitchell's epic bestseller, this film captured the imagination of a nation about to embark on a world war and saw itself in the indominatible Scarlett O'Hara played flawlessly by the beautiful Vivien Leigh in an Oscar winning performance. Scarlett takes viewers on a journey from skirt-swishing plantation flirt to the ultimate survivor, saving her family from poverty and starvation through sheer willpower. There's never been another like her. Clark Gable also proved perfect casting as Rhett Butler, Scarlett's equal, although she realizes this way too late. Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar for her indelible turn as Mammy, a slave but one who really runs the household and keeps Scarlett in line.Maybe it's not the greatest film ever made and maybe, in this age of digital technology, the special effects are starting to look a little creaky, but GWTW remains sweeping entertainment.

One of the great Hollywood films ever,"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" Most famous quote in cinema history came after Scarlett pleading to Rhett Butler about what she should do next. There is no singular motion picture that had left such profound impact on me as film buff and not only film buff but as a regular guy who enjoy really good cinema. I personally think it's one of the greatest epic films ever made and will not be matched because it is really product of its time and everything just fall in right time.Vivien Leigh's performance as Scarlett O'Hara is so outstanding that one has to overlook the many candidates for that role. Also, it should be interesting to see that Leigh has been always first choice, despite huge auditions process with many well known actresses like Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead. Without Leigh, Gone with the Wind would be very soapy, very dated, and somewhat dull. Also, it helped that Leigh had solid co-star, whose is Clark Gable. Gable brought his own style to his role, which is amazing because I cannot think of anyone in that role. In fact, I was surprised to learn that Gary Cooper had been offered that role but rejected it because he thought it would be huge flop in Hollywood history. Gable only accepted that role so he can get married to Carole Lombard, whose was magnificent comedian in her own rights.You know how you always watch great films but always find something new in each viewing? God, Gone with the Wind was like that for me. When I watch it for umpteenth time, there are so many parts that I had forgotten and it add a lot to the experience. I had forgotten how wonderful barbwire dialogues between Gable and Leigh and it enhanced the film very well. I would love to see it in theater someday but I'm perfectly satisfied with my copy of DVD.Gone with the Wind remains landmark because it is quintessential epic film and it has genuine sweep of any epics that I had seen. Modern filmmakers wouldn't know how to structure the film like Gone with the Wind because they don't know how to tell the story. I felt that today's epics are just bunch of b movies with huge budgets like Pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Jackson's King Kong. Gone with the Wind is in class all by itself and the box office has prove that since it is the film that sold the most tickets ever. When you adjust the box office inflation, Gone with the Wind would be always number 1 because it is made for blockbuster and it shows that the audience is very appreciative.On repeated viewing, I was very surprised to see how the editing works so well in Gone with the Wind that I hadn't noticed on my previous viewings. Take the scene where Gable and Leigh are riding through Atlanta when it is about to burn. Look at the background between one of their dialogues part and you can see rear projection but when it is cut to other side, everything around them is very real, especially the house. It show how ahead Gone with the Wind is in technical sense. But it doesn't matter because the story is so gripping and very engrossing that you just develop the attachment to the characters, which I did.It is seldom to see singular piece of motion picture that just fall in right place, right time, and everything is just in sync. But that is Gone with the Wind. It isn't known for director's film but much of the film's success goes to David Selznick, a famous producer of Golden Era of Hollywood. Selznick was able to gamble everything he had on this film and he succeeds. Unfortunately, it's his huge failure as well because he cannot duplicate the success again, which would haunt him for rest of his life. Nonetheless, it remains the bona fide landmark film that would never ever be challenge.It is interesting to see 4 directors worked on this film yet only one got credit. George Cukor got fired because he didn't think it would be good. Victor Fleming replaced him and suffering from nervous breakdown and 2 directors relieved him. But like I said, it is astonishing piece of film-making craft because everything in this film is so convincing real.I don't think I would find another film that is like Gone with the Wind, if one is so inclined to remake it, which would flop for certain since the budget would be so outrageous enough for the studios not to pursue it. I don't doubt that one would be very reluctant to see this film because it is clocked at 3 hours and 50 minutes but I would like to assure that it is very engaging and move at relatively fast paced film. I've seen 2 hours films that would felt like if it last all day with no ending come in the sight but Gone with the Wind, despite its running time, move faster than any 2 hours films I saw. It proved that it is able to engage the audience and left profound impact on them.It is genuine magnificent motion picture, make no mistake about it.",,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
One of the Best Movies EVER!,"As I write this review, today is the 66th anniversary of GWTW. The story about a Southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara showing her trials before, during, and after the Civil War makes up a movie that continues to enthrall audiences even today. Here are the reasons why I think it is THE perfect movie: Cast- The cast gives perfect performances that makes this movie memorable. Clark Gable is Rhett Butler, the role that seems made JUST for him. Vivien Leigh, who plays Scarlett O'Hara, deserved the Best Actress Oscar. Leslie Howard is excellent as Ashley Wilkes, the man that Scarlett loves. Olivia deHavilland plays Melanie, the kind-hearted woman who always thinks of others before herself, perfectly. Hattie McDaniel gives a awesome performance as Scarlett's strong-willed servant.Direction- Victor Fleming (THE WIZARD OF OZ), along with uncredited George Cukor and Sam Wood, directs his cast superbly, making you believe in the characters.There are many more reasons to list,including Sidney Howard's script(based on Margaret Mitchell's novel), Max Steiner's wonderful music, and the awe-inspiring sets and costumes.

A golden age of cinema masterpiece,"There is nothing more wonderful than a sweeping romance from the 30's or 40's. Better still in Southern Belle costumes and fakey Southern accents. Some people find fault that Clarke Gable fails to deliver his Southern drawl, and that Vivien Leigh's is decidedly English (her native country) but I find it unimportant. This is a movie that today people sneer at, think it's cheesy and fake and overblown but in the end, if you let yourself get carried into the emotion, you're in for a treat that's seldom experienced. There's nothing I like better than the soaring music, full-scale orchestra like all old films, and the dramatic lighting changes. Olivia de Havilland's acting never ceases to amaze me and I study every flicker in her face and eyes. She is an incredible actress, and is still radiant today. Vivien Leigh overtakes Scarlett, takes Mitchell's character, portrays her well, and gives us more to Scarlett than an empty head, greed and flirtatious airs. Leigh makes Scarlett human, and viewers identify with not only the protagonist, but the three supporting roles as well. We see bits of ourselves in Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley and at the same time love and hate them for it. The same goes for the movie. There are mistakes surely, which we correct in our mind, but it adds to the charm of this classic, that it's flawed and loved because of it, just like its heroine, and just like humanity, which Mitchell and Selznick so well portray, and we still embody today.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

The characters are, however, thinly-drawn caricatures trapped in a lingering melodrama.The acting is over-the-top, unconvincing. The interpersonal relationships are soap-opera material at best.Too many people simply assume that, just because a film is an epic LENGTH, it's an actual epic. The wasted sequences of pomp are overwhelmingly unnecessary and yawn-worthy. Nearly detestable.Much like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this film wastes a multitude of your life ( and expectation) on minutae; seems void of competent editing, yet STILL MANAGES TO BE UNINVOLVING!I tried to enjoy it!

Excellent classic film,"There's very little to say about ""Gone With the Wind,"" that hasn't already been said a million times before. Nevertheless, it is excellent, probably one of the best films of all time. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and how she deals with a long-time struggle trying to get the man she loves (Ashley, played by Leslie Howard) to fall in love with her, unaware that the whole time she is actually falling in love with Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the tough-yet-romantic character who she thought would never appeal to her. Vivien Leigh is perfectly cast here, in an Oscar-winning role in this Best Picture of 1939. She makes the character of Scarlett believable and lovable, despite the over-controlling and selfish nature she often possesses. Gable was robbed of an Oscar here, as he plays one of the most engaging, tough, and fun characters ever seen on film, delivering one great line after another (down to his famous ""Frankly, my dear...""). The supporting cast, particularly Oscar-winner Hattie McDaniel as Mammy, is perfect, and really makes the film. It's a long film, over four hours long, yet those four hours fly by as you get caught up in the drama and fascinating story of Scarlett. It's truly a classic and one film movie lovers cannot miss.

Though many auditioned there was only one scarlett and that was Vivien Leigh. Even the part of Rhett Butler could have been played by no one else than Clark Gable. Olivia De haviland as Melony, Leslie Howard as The weak Ashley only added more lustre to this superb movie. How these actors and actresses made a movie that had no official script, directors and producers that were changed regulary is a real credit to all the cast of this movie.I say that this is the greatest movie of all time, for it has romance, drama, a battle of will between the sex's and so much more. Would we all have that fighting spirit that Scarlett had when her beloved south and way of life was destroyed? Could we all say those famous words "" Tomorrow is another day"" and survive.

A truly beautiful film that will never be outdone!,"This film is truly one of the greats!  The fact that it was made so long ago just adds to its beauty.  I don't think that it could have been done better. Even though it lacks many key points of the book, for the time they had it is without a doubt a masterpiece to say the least.  How anyone could not love this film is beyond me.  Vivian Leigh is magnificent and truly deserving of her Best Actress Award.  Scarlett is the only main character of any book I have ever read that did not put her as the herione and everyones favorite character.  She is the character you love and hate.  Love because, well she is the main character and the pretty southern belle that does have her moments.  And yet she hated because, let's face it...she's not very nice.  She does some very terrible things and acts like a brat throughout her life, but it's hard to hold that against her.  If only she would have wised up sooner and realized that Ashley is a wimp and that Rhett is so perfect for her.  Oh well! That is the charm of the film.  This movie earned every award it won.  It was so beautifully made and has me in tears every time I watch it.  This is a must see film and one of the true classics!  Go and watch it right now!  10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A Classic for a Reason,"I saw a show about the writing of this film before I ever even saw it. Besides that, I naturally has heard of it, about it, and praise for it millions of times. It is considered a classic by all. The seeing of the show about the writing made my 'need-to-see' at highest.I was not disappointed. This film is beautiful. Not only is it amazing in it's beauty, but it's amazing in the fact that it really is a pointless film altogether- Yet it is definitely an undisputed classic in my mind forever now. I will probably buy the DVD.It's the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled, selfish, and stuck-up girl in the South who finds herself caught in the middle of the Civil War. She spends her life yearning and doing whatever she has to in order to get whatever she wants. She lies, slaps, and acts like a promiscuous girl throughout- yet she never gives up. The one thing that may save her is Rhett Butler, a bad soul himself who loves her- and may be the best man for her.Vivien Leigh gives one of history's greatest performance as Scarlett. She captures the character completely and does something even more impressive: She makes us feel for her. Then there's the incredible Clark Gable as Rhett, the secretly tormented man. He's brilliant, as usual. Of other particular notice is Olivia de Havilland as Scarlett's one true friend, Melanie. She is easily the most lovable character in the film. Just beautiful, providing an exact image of everything Scarlett could be.Yes, it's amazing that this film is as well-liked as it is. Perhaps, though, it's not so surprising after all. It's a beautiful story about two people who are absolutely horrible, and yet will steal your heart every time. The story goes on for almost four hours, and it seems hopeless at times for Scarlett. Yet she keeps moving on. She never gives up. That's really what the movie is about. To quote: ""Tomorrow is another day!"" A classic, indeed! 9/10 stars!Jay Addison",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"The greatest movie ever, but that's my opinion.","I can remember watching this film sat on the floor next to my mother in the mid sixties needless to say it was her favourite film. Have to say as a 10 year old I can say I liked the music in the soundtrack but being over 3 hours long that was way too much for 10 year old me, but as an adult it became a favourite and decades later it is my favourite film, Gone with the Wind could never be remade because back then even the character actors were blessed with great talent, the whole ensemble from Victor Fleming onwards add a great story the backdrop of the civil war you could maybe think there's no way it could go wrong, eight decades later people are calling for it to be banned, it depicts slavery, it also depicts the end of slavery, it even gave an Oscar to an African American actor for the first time. So I say leave it alone it's a great film that's a part of cinematic history which portrays another darker period in history, all I can say to those who would ban this film is leave it alone it has its place in history just as the slavery depicted in the film has its place in history, so learn from it, that's what history does, it teaches those that come after what happened that's all no morality or this is good or that's bad that's for the people who study or just look back on history, all anyone can do today is learn from it but leave it intact for those that come after you so they can learn.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"From middle to end, a great film","I've never felt so divided about a film before.On the one end I admire its brutal depiction of love and its realities in real (i.e. flawed) people, yet its unnecessarily lengthy beginning combined with arguably poor dialogue at times made it hard to stay focused particularly in the beginning once again. But as the film rolled on, it evolved into a film I began to love. I just wished it could've started sooner and could've been consistently there.Olivia de Havilland and Clark Gable and Butterfly McQueen are perfect in their roles. And there are great moments throughout the rest of the film especially involving Leslie Howard. While I wish there were certain aspects of the film that could be changed, it is the way it is, and it's a damn good film as it progresses.",7.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"Quite Simply, The Best","Of the TEN Greatest Movies of All Time, Past and Future, Gone With The Wind could be considered first among equals. The characters are rich in depth, each has motivations and causes and histories that blend together to make a triumph. A tale of the South masterfully portrayed by Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. Not to mention that it was the very first blockbuster. No movie before this one (or since) has played for so long and had so many come backs and revivals. Gone With The Wind was a pioneer in Film making and It will always be remembered when such films as Lord of The Rings(#12) and Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind(#32) are long forgotten. It is a classic Tale and one the any person can relate to on some level or in some facet. The fact that this masterpiece of a movie isn't sitting at number one is a travesty, its lowly and desecrated place at the middle of the 250 heap is a disgrace and a Insult.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
a movie that still touches the modern audience,"So much fuss around this film made me force myself to watch this 4-hour long - rather, I should use ""short"" - film about American society around the American Civil War.When watching this film I found it very well-paced like Jerry Maguire and Goodfellas, and that's very important.  Any movie over 3 hours can burn someone, but I found Gone With The Wind still keeping me on my couch.It's not a thriller, not an action though it has some action and violent scenes.  This movie is sad, nostalgic and enjoyable.I found this movie has many valid themes that are still important today in society, which makes this film also another one to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The most amazing film ever put on screen,"This is my favorite movie by far. I'm a 22yr. old female and this has been my favorite movie since I was a little girl. Everything that Scarlet goes through and all the growing up she has to do. It's just amazing to see everything that goes on. It's hard for someone to really dislike Scarlet even though she does really stupid things throughout the whole movie. I am such a huge fan of the movie. I know everything there is to know about the movie. Granted the book is a lot better, but it's also over 1,000 pages. Which for some is too much reading, but it's well worth it. It goes into much more detail and explains a lot more. The movie is very true to the book so you aren't missing too much. But there is a lot to be learned in the book it's self, well worth the read. Needless to say this really is the greatest movie ever made. If you haven't seen it go see it. And if you don't want to because it's 3 hours and 55 minutes long, get over it, it's a beautiful movie. The slavery part really sucks you have to realize it's there, it's part of history that cannot be ignored. The the story line isn't all about slavery, it's a love story that can't be missed. So go see the movie everyone will love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Gone With the Wind,"This has to be one of the BEST classic movies i have EVER SEEN. I was one of the types that wouldn't watch old classic movies, but when i watched this one when i was about in my early teens (in my mid 30's now)i couldn't get enough. I have since then watched a handful of classic movies, going from horror to comedies to drama to romance. I will continue to love this movie and would like to be able to enjoy it with my child or children some day. I think this may be the only movie Vivien Leigh has done that i may have watched. I have seen a few with Clark Gable movies, but to me, this one HAS to be my favorite one hands down.Oh how i would have LOVED to have read the book for this movie, maybe one day i will.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
A 4-Hour Chick Flick for Any Movie Fan,"""Gone With the Wind"" is a film about which so much has been written, it made me think ""What could I say about this movie that hasn't been said before?"" Well, in a year that gave us ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Wuthering Heights"", ""Stagecoach"", and ""Ninotchka"", this is the movie that many say is the best film to come from the best year of film. All of the other movies I mentioned here (as well a couple more) were nominated for Best Picture of 1939, and I have seen each of them (except ""Ninotchka""). ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" told a heartfelt tale of an educator and the lives he touched during his tenure at a boys' school. ""Wuthering Heights"" was a sweeping romance with a memorable performance by Sir Laurence Olivier. ""Stagecoach"" had action and thrills under the deft direction of John Ford, while becoming a star-maker for a man known as The Duke. And ""The Wizard of Oz"" is quite possibly the most magical film of all time, immortalizing Judy Garland as the young Dorothy Gale and influencing nearly every fantasy film made ever since. And let us not forget some of the other memorable films released that year, like ""Gunga Din"", ""Beau Geste"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"".So, what is it about ""Gone With the Wind"" that makes it stand above the rest of the best? Was it because it was in color? No. ""The Wizard of Oz"" was also in color (well, mostly). Was it Clark Gable's signature performance as Rhett Butler? Interestingly, despite the fact he was practically the only (and obvious) choice for the role, no. He didn't win Best Actor this time around (it was his third nomination in five years); that honor went to Mr. Chips himself, Robert Donat. What about Victor Fleming's direction? Well, he did take home the Oscar, but he was also one of three men to helm this movie. Was it the script, the sets, the cinematography? Again, all very well done. And, though this may not the first film to that comes to mind, ""Gone With the Wind"" was a ground-breaker in visual effects, as it was one of the first movies to make extensive use of matte paintings for both interior and exterior sets, and to great effect. And let's not forget the ""Burning of Atlanta"" sequence. As many people know, this was done on the old RKO Studios backlot by burning down old sets (Did you know that the final structure shown in this scene was the gate to Kong's lair in ""King Kong""?). With clever editing and visual mixing, the result is frighteningly effective.But enough about the big picture (so to speak). What is it about ""Gone With the Wind"" that makes it stand out? To be sure, it was everything I have mentioned to this point, with one more ingredient thrown in to ""kick it up a notch"". Enter Vivien Leigh. After an exhaustive world-wide search for the right actress to play Scarlett O'Hara, she was the one who won the part. And she was the one took home the Oscar, too. As the conniving, bitchy, manipulative, money-hungry, débutante who wears her heart on her sleeve for the wrong man, Vivien Leigh delivers a performance unlike any ever seen before and few have delivered since. And, as Rhett Butler, Clark Gable gives us a rogue, a scalawag, and a mercenary, while also a gentleman, a romantic, and a doting father. I seriously doubt that any other man could have pulled it off (though Timothy Dalton did try years later on TV -- But that's another story). The end result is a mixture of some of the best on-screen chemistry ever concocted.The supporting cast does a wonderful job here, too. From Olivia de Havilland to Leslie Howard to the first Black Oscar winner, Hattie McDaniel, many of the performances of ""Gone With the Wind"" are both memorable and well-cast, with one or two exceptions. For example, I thought Carroll Nye had the look and attitude of Frank Kennedy (Scarlett's second husband), but I didn't feel his performance was all that convincing. By the way, if you are a fan of the old ""Superman"" TV series, look for George Reeves as one of the Tarleton twins (he's Stuart) at the beginning of the movie. Sure, it's a chick flick. Yes, it's four hours long. But if you call yourself a movie fan, even in passing, then ""Gone With the Wind"" deserves a viewing!",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"

"The wind might be gone, but it still steals the thunder","They don't make pictures like this anymore. There, I've said it. And it's not necessarily a bad thing. The artistic techniques to put a four hour seminal epic like ""Gone with the Wind"" on screen were quite different and limited back in the days, however the inventiveness to tell a great story and choose the right means was disproportionately higher - and it shows.The brainchild of powerful producer David O. Selznick, the filmed version of Margaret Mitchell's best seller does nothing that hasn't been done before, but everything with utmost perfection and teems with high production values every way you look at it. The list of what ""Gone with the Wind"" lifts high above other films just goes on and on: There's of course that great story of the Old South dealing with a generation entangled in the throes of the American Civil War. This however is only the backdrop of one of the greatest romances of all time, which is not presented as sugar-coated, tear-jerking escapism, but as a wild clash of sexes through strong personalities, driven by egotism and vanity, mirroring the downfall of a whole civilization. The narration is shown in lush Technicolor cinematography, at key points composite storybook images are used with layers upon layers of painted images added to the shots in order to exude the required sense of drama and give it a fairy-tale, almost dreamlike quality. Hundreds of costumed extras fight and litter the street of dying men the heroine Scarlett walks through to give just one shining example, Max Steiner's score is grand and epic, and the cast headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is legendary as their sensual tension is deep and intensely felt by the viewer. In short: ""Gone with the Wind"" is a marvel of cinematic brilliance, and more. And to everyone who thinks otherwise: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
The one and only,"Directed by: Victor Fleming mostly, getting the credit, among 4 directors during the amazing extended preproduction, production and post production of the film.Writer: Sidney Howard, credited, was one of 14 writers for this film.A little Hollwoodish, however, an excellent film overall, in many ways, from directing, writing, acting, cinematography, costumes, makeup, music score. Adjusted for inflation, it's still the box office champion, in the history of cinema, exceeding ""Titanic"", 1997 and ""Avatar"", 2009.I actually did not see GWTW until a theatrical re-release in 1998. I was impressed and saw it a second time during that same theatrical re-release. I actually lived near Atlanta from 1988 to 1993, and could have visited CNN Center anytime to see it's perpetual run there.How this film came to be made is a quite a story all by itself. Based on the Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize winning, best selling novel of 1934, of which the rights were purchased for only $50,000.A lot has been written and said about this most famous of all Hollywood films. With a running time just under four hours and one of the largest ensemble casts ever, the film has a huge canvas to paint on.Dramatic, romantic, sentimental and highly entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Epic tale of love set during the Civil War,"This Classic film tells the tale of the life and loves of Scarlett O'Hara (played to perfection by Vivien Leigh), a tough Southern Belle who survives the Civil War, shocks Southern society, and spends years chasing a love of which she can't let go while ignoring the one that is right before her eyes.Based on Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, Gone With the Wind has become one of the most beloved films of all time, the love triangle between Scarlett, Rhett (Clark Gable), and Ashley (Leslie Howard) among the most famed.Scarlett is a character that has captured public imagination; she is the girl we love to hate.  She is selfish, calculating, and shrewd, she is impulsive, passionate, and single-minded in her pursuit of Ashley Wilkes. Despite her so obvious character flaws, the viewer can't help but fall in love with her, just as the men around her do, can't help but cheer her triumphs and empathize with her heartbreaks.All of the characters in this film come alive to the viewer; the kind, sweet Melly who can never find fault with Scarlett; the confused Ashley Wilkes, who loves his wife but can't seem to make it clear to Scarlett; the tough ""scoundrel"" with a heart of gold, Rhett Butler; Mammy who loves her Scarlett while utterly disapproving of her; all of the Southern ladies and gentlemen who bravely face the destruction of their world and try valiently to adjust to the new one.Gone With the Wind is not only the tale of a woman, but the tale of a civilization now gone.

The original blockbuster ?,"I can't think of any film of modern times that would have had as much hype as this did during production. The casting sounds like it owed as much to politics as it did to finding the right people for the parts. It's somewhat surprising that they managed to cast so well bearing in mind what pressure they must have been under.The themes of this film are timeless. Scarlett is in love with Ashley who marries Melanie. Ashley obviously has feelings for Scarlett, but never really returns the love. Set in the civil war Scarlett continues to chase a dream and doesn't even notice what she is missing until it is too late. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are excellent in the leads and are well supported. The photography is fantastic even 60 years on.

It's just the best movie ever -- some fantastic scenery, beautiful costumes, great acting, and haunting, timeless music!Vivien Leigh happens to be my favorite actress and I enjoy seeing her perform in other roles played before and after this memorable one. Obviously I'm not an impartial critic. Seeing her in ""Waterloo Bridge"" is a wonderful treat as she reverts back to her British roots.Also, I do admire Olivia de Havilland for her mature acting ability at so young an age, and she later went on to garner awards in her own right.-- from just one more devoted fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
"After all, tomorrow is another day.","I've seen this film once before, and I have to say I liked it much better this time around. I think that's because the first time I watched it right after reading the book, and there were so many differences that were hard to overlook. It's been a few years though, and approaching it from a cinematic standpoint changes the perspective.I absolutely love the editing, composition, lighting, set design, and color use in this film. I just cannot get over how amazing it is, and it contributes so well to that romanticized Old South feeling, and the depiction of wartime. The overall mood is so strong it's incredible. A lot of my family is from the south, and there's just something about this film that captures a certain feeling/dynamic that is still somewhat present.My one problem with it has always been Vivien Leigh. I just don't think she's Scarlett, no matter what anyone else says—book Scarlett had so much more depth. She's the one thing I cannot forgive in this adaption.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
Historical Accuracy,"On December 20, 1860, South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union, launching the nation into a civil war that ravaged the country for four years. Although the war officially ended in 1865, the conflict in which it stirred would cause much pain and turmoil for many years after, especially for the defeated southern states.In the movie Gone with the Wind, a romanticized version of the old south is portrayed. Many scenes display vibrant colors and extravagant lifestyles led by the people of this civilization. The plot line follows a spoiled girl named Scarlett O'Hara and her struggles during and after the war. It shows how the south was stripped of all of the extravagance and laid to waste.As far as historical accuracy goes, the way the south was portrayed had some truth, but there were also aspects that might have been a little twisted. Throughout the movie, the people of the southern states are made out to be faultless and all of their afflictions were caused by the ""yankees"" of the north. When looking at history, the south was the main instigator of the war. It was only when states began seceding the north got involved, desperate to keep the nation from falling apart.Another aspect that was twisted is the attitude of the slaves towards their enslavement. All of the slaves in the movie seem content with their position. This attitude is obviously not historically accurate. Of course, there were some slaves that were not treated badly by their masters, but not once in the movie did a slave show animosity towards his/her position.Despite some of these inaccuracies, some aspects of the movies did have historical significance. I felt the movie did a good job in conveying how the southerners were mistreated after the war. It was very interesting to get perspective from the characters while they were rebuilding their old home and getting their hands dirty for the first time in their lives. This was really how it was after the war was over. The southerners had everything taken from them, and many of their homes were burned to the ground. They had to start over and forge a new life from the ashes of their old civilization. I found this aspect to be true to history.Watching the movie without taking history into account, I found it to be quite enjoyable. The engaging storyline kept me watching for more, and I thoroughly enjoyed observing Scarlett's transformation in character as the events in her life callous her. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a strong female character, or a film with a deep plot line.",9.0,Anonymous,"History, Romance"
