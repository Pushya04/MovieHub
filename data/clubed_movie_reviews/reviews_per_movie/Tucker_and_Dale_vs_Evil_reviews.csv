"""Oh hidy-ho officer, We've had a doozy of a day""","What a wonderful, light hearted, enjoyable movie, with a great cast and a great story, you'll find yourself in stitches at the scenarios in this movie. How some the characters end up dying is just priceless, and our Tucker and Dale justifying what is going on as logically as they can. I just loved tucker and dale, the actors are just amazing, and seeing Alan in any project is always a welcome delight. A strong recommendation if your looking for a good flick to check out, get some good popcorn in, sit back and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Masterpiece of Horror Comedy,"Eli Craig did a masterful job in presenting the best horror comedy since ""Suck.""Playing on the tried and true ""Flinstones Plot"" of miscommunication that may drive some viewers crazy, Craig brings the gore and the humor with great special effects and wonderful acting. Best of all, of course, the story is solid with an interesting and poignant antagonist development that is extremely impressive.Better still, the laughs aren't cheap and silly.And if you live in the southern United States and hate how ""southern folk"", ""backwoods families"" and ""hillbillies"" are exploited for horror purposes, you'll love this tremendous twist on such a overused and ill-conceived cliché.This is one of the greatest horror comedies ever presented on film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Hidden Treasure,"I saw the trailer to this film online and it seemed like a funny - yet unsustainable premise. I went to see it with friends anyway and I can't remember laughing so hard at a film in years. This movie takes a promising premise and knocks it out of the park. The cast is superb in this send-up of the psycho in the woods genre and the writing and direction take what I feared was an unsustainable premise and they give it surprising energy and humor. This is not Scary Movie crap. This is inventive and fresh and it has a beautiful heart. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are the ""Hillbillies"" in this hilarious tale of prejudice and paranoia and they deliver performances that are grounded and authentic. Tucker and Dale never become plodding stereotypes of ignorant rednecks. They are portrayed with great wit and dignity and the actors never overreach or retreat into the safety and insecurity of broad camp. The cast trusts the writing and the director and it pays off. The script by Morgan Jurgenson and director Eli Craig is tight, smart and has a wonderful heart. These qualities are given life by an above average cast that includes the lovely Katrina Bowden from NBC's 30 Rock. An especially guilty pleasure is the character of Chad, brilliantly played by Jesse Moss who channels some alternate universe version of a sociopathic Tom Cruise as the lead frat-boy. Eli Craig really guided home a winner with this film. The movie sets a course at the beginning and you know where you're headed in the first five minutes-- but Craig's the captain of the ship and this journey is filled with surprises and wonderfully subtle moments that give the film a fun trajectory and a brisk pace. You breezily travel through a fantastic, hilarious and utterly sublime entertainment. Bravo!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not enough publicity for such a great film!,","I can't believe that such an amazing film had so little publicity or distribution - I am so excited that it will finally be released! As an avid horror fan, I had no expectations for Tucker and Dale. I basically watch anything and everything, and seeing as this was low-budget with very little publicity, I underestimated this. It has since become one of my favourite movies ever. Alan Tudyk is fantastic as always, and I had never seen Tyler Labine before but he basically steals the show. While the films it's ripping are pretty foul, T+D still manages to have a lot of heart, and Labine's character is so adorable! This does for The Hills Have Eyes what Shaun did for Dawn Of The Dead, while kicking Zombieland in the privates. Unmissable.This film has instant cult classic written all over it as the standard hillbilly survival horror is turned on its head. Two lovable bumpkins have to fight for their lives when a set of misguided teens think the well meaning duo are out to kill them in Texas Chainsaw / Deliverance style. You can't help but root for the hapless pair but also groan in enjoyable frustration as the teens start to drop dead in lots of extremely gory accidents. A total joy from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Never judge others by their looks in this fun take on redneck horror,"This is one of those rare examples of a funny horror film that actually is funny. Never got a release here in UK which it should have had and so after really good reviews in the DVD mags here, i rented it.What really made it entertaining for me , a lover of films where teens going to meet their end by nasty guys who live in the woods , is that this film turns the whole idea on it's head by having the backwoods guys being caring and really good, and the teens getting the wrong end of the stick by causing all the deaths due to accidents. The two lead performers bounce off each other beautifully with a cracking good script which for a comic send up is so important.The film looks ace and special effects are above standard. This will become a cult film and for all my 60 years of loving slice and dice movies, i can really say this is really worth your time,watch with some beers and enjoy.",,Anonymous,Horror
We have got to hide all of the sharp objects!,"Lol!! This is just too good!! What starts off
as a camping trip for some college kids turns into the weirdest, most unlikely chain of events that results in most of the kids dying
in the most crazy, hilarious ways! To quote the movie,, ""do any of your friends take medication? Cause,, I think they forgot to take it.""Allison and her friends are taking time off from their crazy college schedules to go camping.Tucker and Dale (2 hillbilly, good ole boys) are spending the weekend working on restoring the old cabin that Tucker just bought.Allison falls off a boulder into the lake, knocking herself out in the process. Tucker n Dale are close by in their boat, so they rescue her from drowning,, but from Allison's friends vantage point,, it looks like the hillbillies are abducting their friend,,, and then the hilarity and devestation begins.This is a black comedy,, but it's so freakin' good that everyone should see it!

Best Horror Parody Since SHAUN OF THE DEAD,"Good things come to those who wait, and I've waited for this movie for long enough. I'd wanted to see this movie from the first time I stumbled across the synopsis and learned that Alan Tudyk would be playing one of the title characters. Instant win. I knew there was little chance that this movie would be anything but awesome, and I was proved right when it was released at long last on home video (since I wasn't lucky enough to live in one of the few cities blessed with it's limited release). It's a new spin on the classic horror movie cliché of the deranged hillbillies terrorizing innocent victims in the woods. In this case, Tucker and Dale are a couple of good ol' boys heading out to the West Virginia wilderness to renovate Tucker's new vacation home/cabin in the woods. A handful of college students have also decided to make use of the backwoods for a camping trip, where they mistake the pair of bumbling rednecks as psycho killers. The misunderstanding leads to a series of unfortunate events where the college kids begin accidentally dying off in gruesome fashion, only solidifying their fear in the harmless hillbillies. TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is equal parts comedy and horror movie in a perfect balance of the two genres from director Eli Craig (who hasn't really got much else under his belt, directing-wise). This movie is guaranteed to achieve cult status once word gets around about how awesome this movie is.It's such a simple idea that I'm really surprised it hasn't been done before. It's just a simple 180º twist on the sort of horror we've seen in Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or THE HILLS HAVE EYES. Tucker and Dale are a couple of simpletons played to perfection by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine. They really just want to enjoy a simple vacation of fishing and renovations when the posse of judgmental college kids led by Chad (with his own dark side) arrive and fudge it all up. Alan Tudyk is awesome in pretty much anything I've seen him in. I honestly can't think of a single instance where his character was a weak spot in any film or TV show. He's given the spotlight as one of the title characters for once, and he makes an excellent redneck. Tucker is the more levelheaded, headstrong leader of the duo who's not really interested in the new arrivals and wishes they'd just have kept to themselves. Dale (Labine) is the socially inept doofus who develops a crush on beautiful Allison after rescuing her from a near drowning and essentially setting off the chain of bloody events. He steps into the hero role as he gradually comes out shell to Allison and stands up against Chad and his crew. Katrina Bowden fulfills her basic obligations as the blossoming love interest Allison, a beautiful girl with a hot cheerleader vibe and a heart of gold who's willing to overlook Tucker and Dale's social status. Of the remaining college crew, the only standout is of course Jesse Moss as Chad. The kid is demented and reeks of cheese, but his campiness suits the tone of the movie so you can't complain.In my opinion, this is the best horror movie parody since Edgar Wright's SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It succeeds in all the aspects of a good comedy/horror movie that the SCARY MOVIE franchise (primarily any the sequels) fails at. The jokes in the movie are hilarious, thanks for Tudyk and Labine. And the kills in the movie can be just as gruesome as any mainstream horror film; I'd give examples but, as with any horror/slasher movie, I don't really want to spoil any potential kills. Everything in this movie works great with the exception of the third act. After the characters leave the main cabin in the woods location and arrive at the final conflict in a saw mill, it loses some steam. Maybe because it drops the horror parody vibe I'd been enjoying for the previous hour, but the whole end confrontation felt like a misstep. It doesn't exactly ruin the movie, it just didn't feel like it fit for me. As a whole, I really loved this movie and I expect it'll garner a pretty nice following on DVD/Blu-ray. The filmmakers have done an awesome job here and all I ask is that they enjoy the movie's success without tarnishing its awesomeness with an unnecessary sequel. I don't want to see more TUCKER AND DALE hijinks; their battle with evil was cool enough on it's own.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A must see. Instant cult classic.,"I did not have many expectations when I sat through this gem of a movie. This movie takes the horror/comedy genre to new levels. The plot is fairly simple, Lots of misunderstood situations that take place between Dale and Tucker and their fix-ur-upper vacation home, and some overly critical, unstable college kids. Very original script, good acting (Tucker and Dale are fantastic), and clever direction. How can a brilliant movie like this not make it to the big screen, yet movies like Season of the witch, Skyline, and Gulliver's Travels do. If you want to laugh till milk shoots out your nose, watch this movie. Should be on everyone's must-see list.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very funny, gory, with heart","Really entertaining twist on 'teens in the woods' horror flicks. Lots of laughs and buckets of blood. The actors playing Tucker and Dale are very compelling and believable. Their charm really makes the film and you care about their story.The movie is basically a farce or a comedy of errors with each error resulting in a gruesome death. While the manner of the deaths is so over the top as to be funny, the biggest laughs come from the dialog. ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil"" excels at both physical comedy (the chainsaw scene for example) and verbal (explaining the situation to the police).Great movie.This film had a tremendous audience reaction at the Seattle International Film Festival.

Crowd pleaser at the Fantasy Filmfest in Berlin,"I've just seen this movie at the Fantasy Filmfest in Berlin and was  totally surprised of the high quality. I thought this would be ""just  another"" horror comedy you would forget instantly after leaving the  cinema, but with the fantastic acting of Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine,  the funny story and great effects, it works as well with the backwood  slasher genre as ""Shaun of the Dead"" did with zombies. The crowd in the  cinema went totally crazy about this film, they applauded and cheered  throughout the film and after the first positive reviews by bloggers  the screenings in Munich for example were sold out in just three hours  after starting the pre-selling. Totally recommendable, and I really hopes  this movie makes it to the cinemas worldwide.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Did You See The Way Those Guys Looked At Us?!""...","TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL takes on the typical ""killer hillbillies"" movie by turning the entire sub-genre inside out.

Horror-comedy is back,"Just when horror looks like it's gone completely stale, movies like ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" come out proving there's still more that can be done with the genre. Tucker and Dale are just two country boys who want to live out their dream to own a vacation home. Meanwhile, a group of college kids accidentally mistake them for being hostile which leads to unfortunate results. ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" may sound familiar but ultimately it's not. Instead of being a straight-up slasher flick, the film decides to be bold and through slapstick comedy into the killing which works surprisingly well. The majority of them are foreshadowed, but still never fail to achieve hilarity. Make no mistake ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" isn't the smartest movie on the block but it still packs more originality than most horror movies and more laughs than most comedies out right now.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too Good to Not be Marketed Correctly,"An excellent comedy with terrific horror elements, this was a crowd- pleaser tonight at DIFF, here in Dallas. This is what writing is all about, old-school, when writing actually mattered, over special effects. And there are plenty of those. It is rare that I actually praise an American film, only because we no longer care about writing. It's all about star power without chemistry or talent behind the scenes, just what might make a buck. And, clearly, even clear results do not stop ""the machine"" from producing utter crud. Relativity Media has bought this gem, but apparently has refused to market it ala Bounty Hunter. This is such a funny film that fits into Bromance, Comedy, Horror, maybe even Indie. Did I mention there's chemistry? Talent? Yup. All there. So, get on it, Relativity! This could be incredibly profitable. Wish my blog had more power to get the word out there. Hope this does the trick.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An amusing examination of the ridiculous nature of horror films.,"I'm not really a fan of the horror genre. Mostly, I feel the plots are contrived, the characters are downright idiotic, and the violence is over-the-top. Of course, when I heard about Tucker and Dale vs. Evil years ago, I said, ""pass."" The friend who suggested I see it assured me that it wasn't like all the other horror films. The fact is, it is exactly like all the other horror films, but it is self-aware of this fact. Because the film is self-aware, it recognizes every single horror genre trope and makes fun of it.As time went by, more people suggested I see this film, so I finally caved during a slow weekend at home. Being the self-aware film that it is, the plot is simple and the production values are limited, at best. What really makes the film enjoyable to watch is the fact that the whole premise is practically a ""comedy of errors."" Lack of communication just adds to the hilarity as a bunch of cliché college students find themselves killed off one-by-one by their own bad luck. If I were to compare this to another, well-known horror franchise, this film has the setting of The Evil Dead (1981) with the comedy of Army of Darkness (1992).Unfortunately, because it holds to the tropes of the horror genre, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil doesn't have much to offer other than a funny commentary on the horror genre as a whole. The independent nature of the project and limited budget really show through, even if the comedy is spot on. The main characters of Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) are worth the watch, regardless.An amusing examination of the ridiculous nature of horror films, I give Tucker and Dale vs. Evil 3.0 stars out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Cult Classic Waiting to Happen,"So I was lucky enough to get to see this as my first movie at my first festival ever, the Dallas International Film Festival(DIFF) Honestly, this movie was a genius comedy, parodying classic horror to levels that could be considered even better then the likes of Shaun of the Dead.Truly it is a perfect Indie movie, and the fact that it is only on the festival circuit is a shame. It has the celebrity power of Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine leading the film in a comic tour de force as well as quite a few lesser known young actors acting opposite. Also, the direction of the new, but highly committed director Eli Craig shines as he directs the film he co-wrote and has been trying to get made for 4 years, and that love of the material shines.The humor and jokes just play beautifully with how the characters are made and the deaths always pay off. I was lucky enough to get a Q & A with Craig as well as meet with him afterwords and gain further insight into this movie that I already very much loved. He stated how some of he always saw this film as a comedy, not a horror film or even a parody of horror films, and as such one thing the big studios that wouldn't produce it had a problem with was the humor in the deaths. The fact however is that the way they are produced in the scenes and how the actors react just make each scene perfect.In truth, this film fully deserves a nationwide release. It will likely still gain this Cult Classic level with that as it fits into the mold perfectly just as the likes of Shaun of the Dead did. It would be a shame for this film to end up like Boondock Saints and having to rely on DVD to get around and known as it is just what the movie industry needs.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best Horror Comedy Since Zombieland,"Two friends buy a vacation home together, which is a cabin in the woods. A series of misunderstandings follow, leading a group of college kids to accuse them of being deranged serial killers. What ensues is both hilarious and gory...Let me first point out the great cast: Tyler Labine as Dale, Alan Tudyk (""Dodgeball"" and ""Knight's Tale"") as Tucker. A sexy newcomer named Katrina Bowden as Allison, and Jesse Moss (""Dear Mr. Gacy"") as Chad. The rest of the cast is also great, but these key roles made the whole thing perfect and the comedy a smash.My girlfriend and I saw this at HorrorHound Weekend in Indianapolis, and we loved it. I would say she loved it even more than me, with it keeping her laughing the whole time. That, and she loves wood chippers. Yes, there is a wood chipper, and yes, it does get used. That alone should make you want to see it!The version we saw was a work print, so not all the special effects were in place yet. But the humor is what carries the film -- the whole idea of college kids being the heroes and hillbillies being cannibals... it is taken here and twisted, with no real bad guys at all. (The title is somewhat misleading... at no point did the guys fight ""evil"".)I wish I could write a better review, but I could only do that if I pointed out flaws, and there just are not any I can think of. It was well-paced, funny, bloody, sexy (though there is never any nudity) and somewhat charming. This is really a horror-comedy that I think everyone can get behind.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nice idea, shame about the execution","TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL is a comic horror film with a twist: the villains are actually the good guys, and vice versa. What starts out as a standard 'hillbilly' horror flick, in which a bunch of vacationing teenagers find themselves at the mercy of a couple of murderous rednecks out in the backwoods, soon turns into a broad spoof of the horror genre as a whole.The twist is that the rednecks are the good guys and the inevitably gory slayings that occur are a result of accidents and plain bad luck. This premise gives the film some novelty value, but unfortunately it aims at the lowest common denominator for the most part and the humour is obvious and predictable.It's fair to say that the writing is better than the direction here, because there are some subtle character bits written in amid all the mayhem and destruction. The performances of Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are both decent, as the guys form a good double act which carries them through the rest of the movie. The deaths are very cheesy and the low budget is always more than apparent, but if you're looking for something different then you might just enjoy this.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

You end up really caring about the main characters.And the scary character, when that person is revealed, is pretty dang scary.Funniest thing I've seen since Zombieland, and I laughed so hard through Zombieland I thought I was gonna barf.Do not miss this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Our eyes from the hills,"What if you showed a backwoods-horror movie where city slickers take a wrong turn from the hillbillies point of view? What if they turned out to be basically decent folks who just wanted to go fishing at their vacation home? And, finally, what if it was the hillbillies who had to fend off against a murderous psychopath and got to take the pretty girl home?But of course make it so that our surrogate watchers, a bunch of college kids out in the woods, should presume to know that hillbillies are a bunch of violent inbreds because they're familiar with the same movie lore we are, say Deliverance onwards. Make it so that a man with a chainsaw whizzing above his head recasts the most epochal scene from Texas Chainsaw as accident. Our enjoyment is that we're always placed a little closer, watching for a little longer, to know that there is no horror movie outside what is being imagined.So there you have it; a Two-Thousand Maniacs with misunderstood maniacs. It's a clever idea, and new as far as I know in this field.Now if horror is generally looked down upon, even in cases of solid craftsmanship, I wager it's for how it posits a battle with evil in absolute terms. We know that life is more a complex struggle than Hammer served us. Every horror film that matters has innovated by placing us one step closer to where real horror is assembled. Vampyr posited that it happened because we wanted to. Psycho moved the monster from the swamps to next door, and that was important enough at the time. Night of the Living Dead posited an entire world of insensate havoc but with no malice in the instinctive drive. The Tenant and later Videdrome transferred every visible distortion back in the retina of the mind's eye. In Possession, horror was the visual representation turned inside out from tortured soul.This is just as good in this way. There is no evil outside a series of unfortunate events, we come to understand. There is only circumstance and our built-in notions of what any set of circumstances ought to mean. With film having saturated so deeply the world we know, in a lot of these cases what we claim to know we know from movies.Our loss is that the idea must have seemed so striking and novel to whoever was approached to fund, that the project was rushed ahead before there was a chance to iron it out. So the first joke, a great joke, is played over and over again and wears itself thin. The finale resolves with just sparks flying from a chainsaw fight.The extra layer that was probably tucked in at the last moment, is that the massacre backstory that we understood was just a campfire tale improvised on the spot, and was generic like a Wrong Turn sequel, is supposed to be culled from real life. So there was truth behind the legend, mangled many times over in the telling, that powers the chain of events to replicate it.It makes sense then that one part of the movie, where evil is imagined, always plays out like a movie. Every time he appears on screen, he swirls everything into the narrative he was taught to have sprung from. It's pretty nifty.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than most modern movies,"This comedy slasher is better than most.Two groups of people clash in the woods.One group is two rustic guys who look like backwoods people bought a cabin in the woods. The more intelligent of the two is named Tucker. He's pretty much the straight man in the movie, although a girl in the other group, named Allison, is the straight person in the other group, most of the time.Dale is not exactly ""dumb"", but he's very insecure. He's apparently younger than Tucker, or at least less experienced, and he wants to meet an attractive girl.The second group is a group of college kids. I'd like to say they're atypical of college kids, and they probably aren't ""typical"" of all college kids, but they are ""typical"" of many college kids. In fact, too much so, which does make this movie a very good idea. Just not the best execution. Not the worst by any means, though.Some of those kids are fairly normal in the beginning, but two of them are very sick in the head. One is especially insane. And I'm not sure his prejudices are unique. There is a wave of ignorant prejudice and feeling of superiority actually being taught to college kids.The kids who are sick in the head soon turn all the ""straight"" college kids into believing Tucker and Dale are some kind of movie villains. That's the part that really makes this movie better than most horror movies. Most of the kids begin with a lot less prejudice, and the crazy kid actually brainwashes them, thanks to some very strange mishaps.This is not the best screenplay, but it is nowhere near the worst, and if one compares it to movies prior to about 1970, it is very poorly written, but if one compares it to movies made since about 1990, the bar is so much lower that it stands out as one of the best of modern horror movies.The actors really had some tough roles to play, except for the one playing Tucker, since that was the straight man. They did as well as they could. There have been much worse screenplays, and this one is easily one of the better modern ones, but still subpar to what it should be.The comic timing is off, and that goes towards editing and directing.All in all, though, it is watchable. And unfortunately it is credible to an extent.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Excellent horror/comedy with an emphasis on comedy,"I saw ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" at the new Viennese /slash Filmfestival that is dedicated to all things horror, sci-fi and fantasy. I walked into the movie knowing nothing about it, having read no reviews and thus not expecting too much. What followed completely took me by surprise.The movie plays on the clichéd plot of a group of college kids going camping in the woods and then being killed off one by one by deranged hillbillies - only this time the hillbillies are completely innocent, good-natured people and all the bloody killings that ensue are just unlucky accidents.What sounds like an amusing idea that's most likely to become a joke that well-overstays its welcome for 90 minutes, was turned into an uplifting movie that's genuinely funny from the first minute to the last. Mostly, that's thanks to the great cast: From the wonderful team of Tyler Labine (Dale) and Alan Tudyk (Tucker) all the way to the hero-turned-villain played Jesse Moss these actors have a great chemistry together and perfect comedic timing. The jokes are silly, but never primitive, the splatter is right on time and funny. (Just do yourself a favor and don't spoil it for yourself by watching the trailer.) What's best of all is that this isn't just a parody of any particular horror movie, but a standalone comedy that works without the usual nods and homages to well-known classic.I really hope ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" will get the exposure it deserves in the coming months. It's sure to become a cult classic and will most definitely be compared to horror comedies like ""Shaun Of The Dead"". Go see it, if you get a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Only Very Funny, But Surprisingly Sweet","Imagine a horror movie where all of the young kids who serve as the film's victims die gruesome deaths but where you don't have to feel guilty about enjoying the killings because the kids are the aggressors and are either too stupid or too evil to live anyway.

Balances disturbing and macabre sequences with charm and tenderness,"The perils of the American deep south has been highlighted rather stereotypically in the horror genre since the times of Deliverance, The Texas Chain-Saw Massacre, or The Hills Have Eyes. In these (now classic) films, the slack-jawed ""redneck"" is dumb, feral, inbred, and particularly cannibalistic. But what about the innocuous, middle- American teens that infest the beautiful surroundings that these yokels occupy? Aren't these people inherently evil? This is the premise of this silly, sometimes gory, but affectionate and charming horror/comedy.We are first introduced to the typical slasher film set of teens on summer break (or whatever!), that have ventured into the back-of-beyond to camp in the woods. They stop at a gas station to pick up some beers. Whilst there the camera losses interest in these and cuts to Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine), two ""rednecks"" off to their vacation home in the woods. Dale, who is hapless in the face of the opposite sex, has spotted one of the group Allison (Katrina Bowden), who he has taken a fancy to. Tucker advises that he should go talk to her. Dale approaches the group carrying a scythe, and blunders through some broken sentences. Having concluded that Dale is an evil redneck of the Slasher genre, they speed off. This scene sets the tone for the film.Whilst fishing Tucker and Dale are unwittingly involved in Allison begin knocked out after falling into the lake, and they rescue her and tack her back to their shack. Basically all those genre tropes are deconstructed, and turned on their heads. The visiting teens start to attack Tucker and Dale, whilst Allison learns not to judge a book by its cover. This is the fundamentally basic theme of the film. The teens end up killing themselves in a series of accidents, that could easily be seen as acts of ferocious violence.This is not the greatest film of it's kind, but it absolutely delivers on some funny, disturbing and macabre sequences. It balances this with a great charm and tenderness to its subject and characters. And the simple question of who is the monster of society is highlighted slightly: the monsters are those nasty, rich frat-boy pigs of the American college system (or perhaps in Brett Easton Ellis's world, a member of the Bateman clan).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

You take a pinch of classic mid-80's horror movie, throw in a dash of dark, twisted comedy, and top it off with wonderful characters, and voilà, you have ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"".The story is very good and interesting. You have two ""hill billies"", pardon my expression, but it is what they are called in the movie, Tucker and Dale who are heading into the woods to fix up their newly bought cabin. Then you have a group of college teenagers out in the woods partying and drinking (fairly typical 80's theme right there). Then with the turns of events the groups run into one another. The teenagers thinking that Dale and Tucker are hill billy killers, while Dale and Tucker only want to get Allison back to them. And from there on, things escalate and become hilarious.""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" have just the right amount of gore, blood, sick comedy and funny situations in it to make it all work so well. I was thoroughly entertained from beginning till end. And I must say that this movie is way up there on my list of favorite movies. The way that the people die in the movie is off the charts. I loved those scenes, especially because their deaths were usually self-inflicted, which just added to the absurdity of the movie plot.The cast in the movie was great, especially Dale (played by Tyler Labine) and Tucker (played by Alan Tudyk) were phenomenal. They really brought so much chemistry to the characters and made it an unforgettable movie.If you haven't already seen ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"", then get in gear and do so, because this movie is definitely one you don't want to miss out on. Once in awhile you just stumble upon a cult classic by accident or sheer luck, ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" is one of those movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A gore film with heart,"(65%) A laugh-filled gory horror comedy with a heart of pure solid gold, which is something you don't really get to see too often. The two main lead characters are hugely likable from the very start as the typical inbred hill-billy murderer idea used in so many horror flicks is turned right around on its head with some smart ideas that are very well implemented. The movie may be one joke stretched out for 90 mins, but it tells it well, with some very funny moments that horror fans will love. Anyone sick and tired of black-hearted overly nasty horror, but still want some blood and gore should without doubt give this a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lacks in the most important thing - it's not very funny,"So, usually my personal opinion coincides with the User Rating on IMDb, but this time i really have to disagree. It's somehow a mystery to me, how nearly everybody says this was a great flick with good laughs.Of course, it is meant to be a parody, but the events and actions occurring in the movie were just too unbelievable and ridiculous too feel comfortable whilst watching. Nearly nothing in this film could ever happen like that in real life, it was just too absurd. It's like you are watching it and got to say repeatedly ""Oh yea, of course"", ""Oh come on"". Like in a bad cliché action movie. Or in other words, if there were any laughs, they would have rather been due to the stupidity of the movie. I didn't see the great and original ""funniness"", that so many others may have seen. It was rather dull to me.The same goes for the characters. How can I like them, when they act completely strange and unbelievable? I couldn't identify with any a little bit. I can't like characters who doesn't seem human to me. Of course the characters show human qualities, which are even pointed out in the movie, but in the whole they were pretty awkward, unbelievable and strangely acting. I felt so uncomfortable with them. ""ARENT YOU HUMAN PEOPLE? WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS??"", thats what was on my mind. And that's true for all of the characters occurring in the movie.On top of that, the movie was predictable as hell. The events weren't surprising, nor excited nor anything. Just waited for them too occur like i had been expecting them. There was nothing special about it, expect the thing that, like i had already said a hundred times, the scenes were completely unbelievable. It was just somehow boring.It were just those things that ruined the movie for me. The actors themselves didn't do a bad job, especially the main actors played their awkward roles relatively satisfying. I also liked the idea behind the movie and it definitely had some potential, which sadly wasn't used. For that:5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody and Bloody Hilarious!,"This is seriously one of the funniest comedies ever. I've shown this movie to many friends and everyone's always laughing like hell with tears running from their eyes. This should've been marketed more though, I don't see why this wouldn't have been a huge financial success if more people had known about it. Oh and if (or when!) you decide to watch it, do not watch the trailer under any circumstances! It spoils the movie way too much.Now about the characters. Tucker and Dale are just so damn likable as these two clueless hillbillies. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine act their roles so well and without these two the movie would be a whole less engaging a watch. The script and the writing in this movie is fantastic but Tudyk and Labine take the movie to a whole another level with their fantastic chemistry and impeccable comedic timing. Katrina Bowden is also great playing the more understanding college girl who's trying to defuse the situation. She was also great in Sex Drive (2008), one of my other favorite comedy movies. The other actors are also good and suit their roles well.In its core the movie is based around such a simple idea you have to wonder why this hadn't been done before. The writers clearly love horror movies so it's not so much a parody but a lovingly crafted tribute making fun of the genre's tropes. The movie works its way through the horror movie tropes so well while incorporating them to the larger story. The deaths in this movie are inventive and absolutely hilarious. I don't know if I've ever laughed that hard, I had tears running from my eyes for most of the movie. Amidst all the fun and death there are also some good albeit obvious points about first impressions and stereotypes. Despite all the gore and dying, it's still a surprisingly warmhearted movie.Besides Death at a Funeral (the 2007 British version of course) this is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen and it's a must see for comedy fans. You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Do Not Watch the Trailer!,"This movie was exceptional, no doubt about that. In ""satire"" films such as Shawn of the Dead, Kick-Ass, and Zombieland, I would have to put this second to only Shawn of the dead.It is witty, creatively gory, and downright hilarious at times. The main problem I found with it was that the Redband Trailer revealed basically the entire movie. This movie is a must watch for anyone who enjoys horror and comedies. But I suggest to stay away from the trailer, and enjoy it without any previous knowledge.The acting is surprisingly good, especially from the supporting cast. The pacing is fast, frantic, and fun. There is no shortage of gore and even then, it's more of an Evil Dead 2 type gore that is so over the top it's hilarious.All in all I give this movie 4/5, or on IMDb 8/10. It isn't a classic, I was tempted to give it a 7.5, but I rounded up considering this is the first movie the director has done. Like I stated though, go in and watch it without watching the trailer, the trailer plays out like a condensed version of the movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Why isn't Alan Tudyk a bigger star?,"The central conceit - that the creepy hillbillies are actually the victims and the expendable college student the predators - is clever although it only carries the film so far. The true attraction here grows out of the interactions of the titular characters. Watching their friendly banter, their expression of feelings and the caring big brother / little brother dynamic makes for a compelling buddy comedy. The inclusion of, fortunately mostly cartoonish, gore does kind of reduce the warmth of the piece but it was necessary for the plot. While both Tucker and Dale benefit from excellent characterizations, Alan Tudyk shines in his role as a viewer surrogate much like the characters Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks played in their heydays. In short, there's a little too much slashy-slashy and stuff blowing up but ultimately the well-written and acted bromance elements are well worth watching",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You'll smile and laugh.,"If you're a seasoned viewer of backwoods horror and, even after all that you have seen, can still buy into the idea that not all hillbillies are out to rape you in the ass, gut you like a pig or wear your face like a mask, then Tucker & Dale vs Evil will prove to be one hell of a funny film, an ingenious, very witty and delightfully gory take on all of those movies in which good looking teens wind up suspended from a meat-hook in a dilapidated shack littered with human remains and chicken feathers.Despite looking like inbred psychos, pals Tucker and Dale (Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) are actually a pair of well-meaning, beer-swilling good ol' boys who have at last realised their dream of owning a vacation home in the woods where they can rest their weary bones after a hard day's fishing; to the group of college kids camping nearby, however, they embody everything they have ever learnt about rednecks from countless slasher films—uncouth, uneducated, drooling inbred half-wits in dungarees who more than likely feast on the flesh of city-folk.When the teens decide to go skinny dipping one night (clearly having not paid THAT much attention when watching horror films), their worst fears appear to be justified when they witness one of their number—sexy blonde Allison (Katrina Bowden)—seemingly being abducted by Tucker and Dale in their rowboat. In reality, the pair have just rescued the girl from drowning, and are taking her to their cabin to recuperate, but convinced that they mean to do harm to their friend, the campers decide to fight back with disastrous and bloody results.With such an inspired yet simple set-up, Tucker and Dale could so easily have become a stale one-joke movie, but thanks to likable performances from Tudyk, Labine and Bowden and a consistently amusing and sometimes downright hilarious script that gives affectionate nods towards old genre favourites, takes a neat turn towards the end by introducing a real psycho, and even includes messages about prejudice and self belief, Tucker and Dale is a hugely satisfying, strangely heartwarming horror parody and a refreshing change from all those bloody remakes and sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
When miscommunication kills.,"Hilariously dumb, yet filled with so much heart, this movie might just be a hidden gem. It takes an absurd premise and has fun with it. Two hillbillies on vacation at their cabin are mistaken for killers by a group of college kids. It's just funny how a simple conversation would have prevented so much death. But Tucker and Dale are two of the most lovable idiot hillbillies I've ever seen. And watching the stereotypical frat bros and hot dumb chicks die was so satisfying (maybe too satisfying).However, this movie can be a victim of its own dumbness. In other words, power down that powerful brain of yours, put it in a dark lonely closet, and only then will you enjoy this movie. Some of the college kids play up their stereotypical roles well enough, but some are laughably bad. Some of the jokes require you to buy so many things to go right (or wrong) that if you have trouble buying just one thing, then the joke won't land. But in the end, this movie exceeded my expectations, I was laughing my whole way through, and I just had a really good time with it.Score: 7 out of 10

A fun film with very likable leads,"Humour based around misunderstanding always makes for such a fun film. Usually we just get a scene or two based around the misunderstanding but 'Tucker and Dale vs Evil' manages to stretch the entire run time around it. It's very clever at times but also slightly less clever on occasion it would have to be said. The whole ride is a fun one though without a doubt.The horror/comedy genre is a funny one because you never know what you're going to get. Some go hard on the horror and just use some comedy to pad things out and lighten the tone a little. Others just want to make you laugh as much as possible and the horror is just an added little bonus to structure the story. This is certainly the latter. The films wants to make you laugh first and foremost. That said, some of the gore is pretty darn well done enjoyable to watch.I had a good time with this movie. I didn't always laugh as much as I wanted to but there were at least two very funny moments in the films.

Originality is a good thing!!!,"Although not really that funny in my opinion i gave this flick a higher rating then i usually do because its synopsis alone should garner points for originality. You got two best buddies that i guess in some circles might be known as red necks however they are just two lifelong pals who have decided to go and take a small vacation in their vacation home cabin only to be accidentally misinterpreted to a band of college kids as mountain men/ homicidal killers so to speak. These college kids have obviously seen movies such as Deliverance or any of the Wrong Turn films once too often. After Dale says enough of this * bleep* and stands up to his fears of the opposite sex and actually rescues one of the college kids from drowning Alyson all her friends think he's a backwoods killer and in definite pitches to take out Dale and Tucker they end up taking themselves out one by one including an interesting scene with a wood chipper. this leads Dale at one point to scream out in a frenzy "" whats wrong with these kids??!!""

"Finally, a clever satire on horror conventions","Horror movies live and die by conventions. No genre more willingly rehashes tropes and archetypes, or even entire plots. Perhaps horror fans are so exhilarated by the first-time use of an effective original horror film device they are wont to indulge it numerous times until filmmakers have tapped out every possible riff on said device.This makes horror ripe for satire, yet prior to ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil,"" only the ""Scary Movie"" franchise has tried to exploit it for humorous purposes. Even then, rather than clever, nuanced jabs, the ""Scary Movie"" series goes more over-the-top, inflating any scraps of satire with off-topic pop culture references. It's a bit confounding to be honest, how the horror genre finally has found something that is both homage to horror/comedy and subtly self- deprecating.""Tucker & Dale"" works off the basic premise of a miscommunication based on horror stereotypes: a group of college kids on their way to vacation in some remote woods meet our titular fellas—a pair of honest-to-goodness rednecks—at a rest stop, and take them for a pair of crazies.Well, Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) happen to be on a much-needed vacation at a cabin in the woods. One night out fishing the kids are skinny-dipping and one girl, Allison (Katrina Bowden), sees them and accidentally falls off a rock and unconscious. Her friends mistake Dale's attempt to rescue Allison for an abduction and plot a way to get their friend back.A farce ensues that sees the kids misinterpreting what Tucker and Dale are doing around the cabin as prepping to kill Allison, yet in their attempts to foil them, end up killing each other and consequently fueling their own illusion. Meanwhile, Tucker and Dale start to wonder if they're caught in the middle of a suicide pact. Eventually things become less predictable when the college kid Chad (Jesse Moss) starts taking the revenge game too seriously.Writer/director Eli Craig and spends time acquainting us with Tucker and Dale to the point that we get a nice subplot going with their relationship, but also to make the college kids seems all the more stupid. We laugh at these characters in horror films because they're stupid, but ""Tucker & Dale"" does it with more self-awareness; Craig knows how ridiculous these characters tend to be in horror films too.Tudyk gives his usual grade-A character actor performance, but Labine generates the adoration for this film with his lovably dumb teddy bear routine. He's a character we've seen before in comedy, but he does it with such an honest innocence.""Tucker & Dale"" delivers a handful of predictable moments, but there's a satisfaction in seeing them coming that you don't get in most films, simply because you want it to happen. That's part of the draw with horror films, but the enjoyment for this movie comes in the comedic sense. In terms of satire, you know exactly what Craig is going for and it makes too much sense to not be able to appreciate it.The movie does veer a bit toward the end from its satirical foundation, but by this point the characters have earned enough favor that the story plays out well enough. A more effective horror/comedy twist, however, would have been a nice addition. Craig doesn't manage to take any jabs at horror that seem uniquely genius or insightful, but ""Tucker & Dale"" is also meant to be a product of love for the genre too, not a complete berating.Those who love the silly thrills of horror will likely appreciate ""Tucker & Dale's"" self-aware perspective, and those who love to laugh at the genre will have even more cause to do so.~Steven CThanks for reading!

dumb and dumber go fishing,"I admit, I was afraid to watch this horror/comedy. I'm a horror buff and I can dig comedy too but mostly the combination of both doesn't really work. I had some laughs with the Scary Movie franchise but others like Vampire Suck and Transylmania weren't that laughable. But they came out of the states and their humor isn't my thing. I dig more the British humor like Lesbian Vampire Killers.The director Eli Craig isn't really known for comedies and is more an actor than a director but even then as an actor he isn't really famous in the comedy genre. But what he did here is unbelievable. He even wrote this funny flick himself and directed it. As main leads we have Tyler Labine (Dale) and Alan Tudyk (Tucker) also not known to be funny but they surely know their stuff, Tyler moved on to The Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes and Alan came from I Robot. And what an excellent job they both did here as two hillbillies running into trouble just for being hillbillies.I surely would recommend it to the horror fans even as it is a comedy. It do has some gory moments and a lot of red stuff but it's always funny to see how it happened or what is going on. And the jokes are excellent. It's not just funny faces or a fart here or there this is sublime writing and acting falling together. I laughed from almost the beginning until the end. Maybe the last 3 minutes are a bit predictable but what a good time I had watching it.

A funny spin on a horror staple.,"Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil takes a horror genre staple as turns it on its head. Instead of a family of inbred hillbillies slaughtering (and often eating) some hapless out-of-towners, we get a duo of lovable backwoods guys named Tucker and Dale. They find themselves stereotyped, feared, and utterly bewildered by some visiting college kids. Their attempt to save one of them from drowning is misconstrued as kidnapping, and the kids end up killing themselves in hilarious ways while trying to ""rescue"" their friend.Tucker and Dale really is a funny movie, with a lot of the death scenes being especially comic. Who knew death by wood chipper could be so hilarious?It slows down a bit and loses some of its comic edge as it goes on and starts to resemble a typical horror movie a bit more, but I still highly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing a familiar horror story from a different (and amusing) angle.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Comedy of Errors,"Tucker and Dale vs. EvilTucker and Dale are two good old boys heading up to their cabin in the woods for some vacation time. Tucker has recently bought a fixer-upper Cabin and the two friends want to spend a week working on their ""Vacation Home"" and some fishing. The Cabin looks like something out of Wrong Turn or Evil Dead 2, But Tucker and Dale are not deterred from fixing it up. Pretty soon a group of College kids show up at a nearby camp and immediately wrongly assume Tucker and Dale are psychotic ""Hillbillies"" out to murder them. Considering that the Cabin and property are filled with tools for a Reno, such as Chainsaws and a Woodchipper, it's not long before the comedy and gruesome carnage start to ensue. This was one of funniest and surprising movies that I watched this year. A comedy of errors that results in lots of gory and creative deaths for the dim-witted college kids. What makes this movie special is the relationship between Tucker and Dale. They are two sweet, helpful, and hopelessly clueless guys that get caught up in the disaster that the College kids created. This will be one of those movies I like to watch again and again when nothing else is on.

Teenaged Evil In The Woods,"There have been many horror/slasher spoofs made within the last ten years and some of them have been very good, while a few are, in my opinion, classics (such as 'Planet Terror' and 'Shaun of the Dead'). That doesn't stop 'Tucker & Dale vs Evil' from being fresh, funny, inventive and clever. 'Tucker & Dale vs Evil' even goes a step further as to making the film look like a 'bad rough cut' where even the special effects haven't been applied, the storyboard drawings and production notes appear on screen.Eli Craig's creative thinking is impressive. I like how in the story the roles are switched (as in, the teenagers are the ones playing the evil guys) while the innocent truckers are being attacked. The film definitely pays homage to cult hits like 'Friday the 13th' and 'Cabin Fever' (just to name a few). As a movie, it's actually quite superior to the aforementioned two examples. I also liked the execution especially how the film is deliberately made to look like a B movie.Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine form a hilarious buddy pair on screen.

Good and fun but nothing more than that really.,"This movie has grown out to be a fan favorite and even a bit of a cult classic already. I however was less impressed with it. Yes, it's a good and fun movie but it at the same time is also far from a great or hilarious one.Thing that makes this movie is its originality. It's an horror comedy that is unique with its approach really. The movie plays out like an actual serious horror/slasher, in which a bunch of teenagers end up death, one by one. Only difference is that they are killed due to their own stupidity and prejudices against rednecks. They mistake Tucker & Dale for bloodthirsty serial killers and no matter what Tucker & Dale try to show their friendly nature and good intentions, things only get made worse due to the big misunderstandings between the two different social classes.And this is why I foremost liked this movie. It plays out like a real modern slashers, in which a bunch of teenagers get stuck in the woods somewhere and end up all getting killed off, one by one. It really progresses in the same way as an actual serious slasher and also features all of the clichés and formulaic characters. You could say that ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" is a real spoof of the genre and does a good job at it, while also still being original on its own, despite the presence of all of the familiar clichés.This is also where the movie draws all of its comedy from. It makes the movie fun and tongue-in-cheek but I can't really say that the movie ever becomes an hilarious one. The movie is not well enough written for that and it's lacking a certain edge that allows things to go over-the-top more, like for instance a movie like ""Shaun of the Dead"" did all had in it.It's not to sound like a nitpick but it's just so that the movie isn't as good as it potentially could had become and the fan-boys are drooling a bit too much over it right now. But having said that; I obviously still really liked the movie and also thinks it's a bit of shame that the movie isn't more recognized, by a broader audience.It's definitely a skilfully made movie, also especially when you consider its recourses. This was a low-budget and low-key production, also without any real big names involved. I only wished that they didn't used so many CGI for its gore effects. Seriously, stop doing that horror film-makers out there.

Mildly Amusing Comedy of Errors Horror,"Dale and Tucker is a comedy of errors that see's two harmless hillbilly's mistaken for Deliverance style serial killers by a group of vacuous college students on vacation.Its a rather interesting premise that gradually unfolds as various innocent and often benevolent actions taken by the hillbilly's are misinterpreted by the college kids. The misunderstandings build and then escalate infecting both sides, who come to believe, for different reasons, that the other group is out to get them.The result, predictably, is mayhem. The humour is of the physical kind. Set piece scenarios that lead to bloody, gruesome, if accidental deaths that intentionally pay homage to gruesome murders found in serious horror flicks. Its not terribly believable but its not supposed to be, its slapstick and proud of it.Dale and Tucker tries to emulate films such as Home Alone but with sharp teeth. This film however only ever aspires to the humor found in flicks like Home Alone. Its no where near as creative or clever in its use of slapstick violence. As a result the mounting deaths start to become rather repetitious, unnecessarily bloody and a little dull.That said Tucker and Dale isn't dreadful. Its a nice idea that would have shone with sharper execution (pardon the pun). The key hillbilly leads are very likable and carry their roles convincingly. The students suitably snooty and foolish. So take a look by all means but don't come to this flick with high comedic expectations or you will be disappointed. Six out of ten from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Routine sitcom humor, nicely wrapped in a gory format.","""Tucker and Dale VS Evil"" is basically the long-feature horror movie equivalent of all those pretty lame comedy sitcoms that my mother always watches You know, the ones where every single episode is exactly the same. It goes like this: everything begins with one small and extremely banal misunderstanding, like maybe something that someone has misheard or misinterpreted. Then subsequently, this banal misunderstanding takes on exaggeratedly humongous proportions. People overhear only parts of conversations, draw incorrect conclusions, revert to ancient clichés and suddenly every dialog/monologue is written in an ambiguous style. Admittedly it's rather strange that this derivative and overindulged formula nevertheless resulted in a movie that several hundreds of people have referred to as one of the best horror comedies ever and even upholds a powerful current 7.6/10 score here on IMDb.I'm certainly not claiming that I didn't like ""Tucker and Dale VS Evil"", but I definitely think it's overrated. The basic idea to introduce two particularly sympathetic and downright stereotypical West-Virginian hillbillies and have THEM chased by a group of crazed and overly violent city teenagers (instead of vice versa) is undoubtedly original and close to brilliant. Especially with the revival of backwoods horror recently – there are the remakes of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" but also new popular franchises like ""Wrong Turn"" and many others – there are numerous horror that generated a sort of universal fear of yokels. This makes especially the beginning of the movie very funny. The teenagers know all the urban legends and seen all the backwoods slasher movies, so they're petrified of Tucker and Dale during their first encounter at a remote gas station. They, on the other hand, are completely unaware of their horrific image and just act friendly. Their ignorance versus the close-mindedness of the teenagers results in a few hilarious moments. But then the accumulation of coincidences, unfortunate accidents and misunderstandings becomes just too absurd. Also, the gore in combination with slapstick only works in very small portions. Dumb kids impaling themselves or stupidly blowing their own brains out is not that amusing, in fact. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk give away amiable performances as the titular goody-two-shoes hicks and Katrina Bowden is just too cute as the only tolerant teenager. The rest of the cast forgettable and additional screen-filling.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is how ""hilarious"" is spelled.","I have to admit this is probably the best satire/homage i've ever seen. Treating your source material with so much respect while at the same time taking the crap out of it is just amazing.If you have seen ""Braindead"" or ""Sean of the Dead"" you might have a clue of what is lurking in this one. This movie is basically what ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is all about seen from a hillbilly point of view: A big misunderstanding. And what of a kind! The way the story unfolds is drawing in anybody with a hearth beat and the two main protagonists are just so lovable in their clumsiness its pretty impossible to not fever with them.I seriously doubted any comedy nowadays could make me laugh for something close to 90 minutes through. This one did. There are so many unforgettable scenes, that i keep wondering how Hollywood could come up with movies bare of any at all! The story might drop of a little at the end, but it's dropping of from a height normal flicks can barely dream of.Seriously, if you have just a glimpse of a heart for cheap gore movies, this one will touch all your sensitive spots, you'll giggle with excitement!

Brilliant idea for a short comedy sketch,"The premise of this movie, in which a couple of helpful hillbillies are mistaken by panicked college kids for serial killers, is absolutely brilliant, and I was very excited when I saw the trailer. But alas, the movie itself wasn't really particularly funny, and after about a third of it I got bored and started skipping through looking for funny bits I never found.Once you've got the idea of this movie it doesn't really have any place to go. People will die in predictable ways and the film will offer up all sorts of genre-appropriate clichés. The most interesting idea involves an attempt at conflict resolution, but once again the execution fails a good idea.My feeling is this movie chose a center ground when it would have been better at one of the extremes. Tucker and Dale don't quite seem like real people, but they aren't that broadly drawn either, and the kids are too generic to be interesting. I think the movie either should have gone full Scary Movie, with the silliness ramped up to 11, or it should have made Tucker and Dale feel like genuine backwoods types caught in a bad situation and explored the way we make assumptions about one another. Of those two choices, I'm inclined to prefer the former, but either would be better than the actual movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Movie for comedy and slasher lovers alike!,"I watched this movie expecting an temporary escape for 2hrs but it gave me so much more.The premise is simple, a couple of college kids go camping where a two hill billies moved in and trouble ensues.The cinematography is great, not shying away from any visceral shots, and the lighting set a creepy yet light hearted atmosphere.The writing is brilliant, the main leads appear to be one dimensional at first but as the movie progresses I began to really take a shine to their antics. The characters are funny, but not one note, and the comedy goes in naturally with the gore. None of the jokes feel forced and are funny, with only a couple relying on cheap slap stick and toilet humor.If I were to fault it I would say that some of the action scenes are very outrageous, and one scene just made my palm slap my face with such force my nose nearly cracked (it involves a person trying to work a revolver, derp).All in all it was a great movie, that not only entertained me but also had endearing characters that are hard to find in this genre today.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Abbot and Costello meet Sam Raimi,"What did I think? 3 of 5 stars. Really good for a slapstick comedy about a Tucker and Dale a couple good olé boys in WV (Canada really)who are looking to repair an old 'vacation' cabin Tucker bought. On the way to the cabin they encounter a van full of college that have seen one to many slasher films and think that the duo are 'creepy'. The best moment in the film may take place at the gas station where Dale tries to communicate with the college girls, Tyler Labine as Dale is talked in to trying to talk to the girls by his friend Tucker played by Alan Tudyk. Dale walks up to the girls following a can of liquid courage and unconsciously grabs a scythe with a 7 foot long handle. Tucker's best advise is to 'smile and laugh' which is undermined by Dale's underlying nervousness and low self worth. He walks up to the girls carrying a scythe, dirty and totally awkward. They look at him like he is as crazy as he looks. And it only gets worse as he tries to talk to them laughing and smiling manically which Tyler pulls off perfectly. From there the movie just moves into misunderstanding mode. The movie moves to the main setting of the backwoods cabin (very similar to the Evil Dead cabin) by the lake where the college kids are camping led by the unhinged frat boy Chad (Jesse Moss). He spooks his fellow campers, four men and three women, with a tale of a massacre in those woods 20 years ago. There are plenty of homages in this send up of slasher films of the 80's. Evil Dead, Friday the 13th and Elm Street are the obvious winks. The crux of the movie is that the over-amped and easily persuaded twenty-something college kids are quickly whipped into a frenzy by Chad when Allison falls off a rock at the lake while undressing and they view Tucker and Dale rescue her but in their eyes are kidnapping her. The good Samaritans take her back to their cabin when the kids run off in fear to find Chad. Chad is ready to fight to the death to find Allison who he fancies. He intimidates and recruits the rest from rationality and go after Tucker and Dale which only ends often hilarious examples of 1,000 Ways to Die. The movie lulls a little in the middle act but comes back together for the finale. Very solid movie, the script could have used a little more polishing but the characters are all very entertaining and there are some classic death scenes.

Plays its markers a bit too early,"Tucker and Dale vs Evil has a great premise. What if those crazy backwoods hillbillies - who are probably cannibals - you see in every other horror movie were actually the victims of the film? Now that's pure gold right there.And the early scenes of this film have some really great jokes, stemming from that initial idea. There's an especially great scene involving a chainsaw and a wasp nest, which caused me to crack myself up. If this film could have kept up such quality throughout its entire run-time, we would be talking about a new horror comedy cult classic.Unfortunately all the best jokes are in the initial half of the film. The second half loses a lot of its humour - although it makes up for it a little bit with surprising amounts of heartwarming - and becomes a more straightforward horror slasher film.Not helping the matters is the actual villain of the movie, who's so over the top psycho that it doesn't make any sense that he would be able to function in a normal society. This is a dude who would stand in the corner of a party, openly licking a knife, cackling while he does it. How are these other people friends with him? Sure, it's supposed to be a joke how over the top he is, but it just doesn't make any sense. The film would have worked fine without his psychosis. Just let it be a movie about a huge, colossal misunderstanding. Like the first half of the film.Still, the film has passion and charm behind it. Some of the jokes are really good, as are somewhat surprisingly some of the characters. The villain is terrible, but who knows, you might like how bat guano bonkers he is.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some hillbillies are just like spiders!,"'TUCKER AND DALE VS EVIL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Backwoods hillbillies horror spoof which uses popular B slasher film clichés and gimmicks to turn expectations completely around on the viewer. The look and style of the film is reminiscent to a Bruce Campbell film, or 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD' type flick, but it takes the satire one step further by completely reversing all predicted stereotypes. It entertains with tons of horrorhound gore and enormous laughs but it also teaches a valuable lesson at the same time (as cheesy as that sounds). For that I think it deserves a lot of credit. The film is directed and co-written (along with Morgan Jurgenson) by Eli Craig and stars Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk in the title roles. If you're a fan of the genre this is one you definitely don't want to miss!Tudyk plays Tucker and Labine plays Dale, two well intentioned but socially naive hillbillies in West Virginia. They recently bought a cabin in the middle of the woods to go fishing and vacation at. While enjoying their time at the cabin they cross paths with a group of narrow-minded and extremely superficial college kids. Dale immediately begins crushing on one of the girls, named Allison (Katrina Bowden), but feels to shy and awkward to talk to her. When the two accidentally startle her and she falls into the lake, knocking herself out, they decide to take her back to their cabin until she comes to. Her friends mistakenly think she's been kidnapped and immediately jump to the conclusion that Tucker and Dale are psycho killers so they decide to take it upon themselves to rescue her. One misunderstanding leads to another as the college kids begin attacking the shocked hillbillies and continue to accidentally kill themselves in the process, thus furthering their belief that Tucker and Dale are insane killers after them.The movie is packed with big laughs like I said and you do get the gore as well, it's just that it's almost all accidental deaths (played out in very dark comedic ways). The death scenes are almost reminiscent of a 'FINAL DESTINATION' film, just far more satirical. My favorite part of the film though is the way it plays with people's prejudices and stereotypes. It shows that usually the one's that think others are scary or creepy are usually the flawed ones with much bigger problems and the people that are perceived to be 'freaks' are usually much more mentally stable and well intentioned. The classic analogy comparing social misfits to spiders often works which shows that people who are thought to be frightening and or creepy are much more afraid of you than you are of them. There's so much more discrimination and hate crimes going on in the world than most people even begin to realize and it's most often done with out any awareness to it. That's the message of this film, it's played out in an extremely comedic way but the message gets driven home all the same and with a surprising amount of heart. Tudyk and Labine are great in the leads and the directing and script are topnotch as well. This is a film I very much look forward to seeing again and would be equally excited to see some sort of a sequel revisiting the characters. It's definitely horror comedy done right!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-KU7aWFnDI",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very solid comedy,"This was one of the most entertaining comedies that I have seem before I began my film journey a few month ago. Its very entertaining and is also quite violent, but it never takes itself seriously enough for the violence to have any serious meaning at all. Like violence in one of those Simpsons' horror episodes. This film entertains from beginning to finish.However, do not watch this film expecting some great work of art. This is not a great film, just a very entertaining and, yes, creative one. I would say it is better than 90% of the films out there.

I expected it to be B-rated with bad acting and a somewhat predictable plot. However I was pleasantly surprised! The few detractors are some foul language, goriness, and a very small & quick shot of nudity. The film title has you expecting a certain direction but it doesn't take long to realize the film is going somewhere else which kept the entire thing unpredictable. Except for some of the accidental death scenes being impossible in real life, the story was pretty believable. Though it is slapstick, there is a meaningful plot in there & cute little romance (not to mention the girl playing Allison is absolutely gorgeous). The acting, too surprised me.

"Rednecks, Serial Killers and Beer","Tucker and Dale vs. Evil (2010)*** (out of 4)This horror-comedy is slowly making the rounds but the strong word-of-mouth has already gained it a strong cult following. Rednecks Dale (Tyler Labine) and Tucker (Alan Tudyk) are going to the country to work on their summer house when they run into a group of college kids. After the rednecks save one of them from drowning, the rest of the group thinks that they are serial killers and soon the two sides are doing battle. It seems like every year one or two horror films build up a strong reputation but more often than not I often find myself disappointed. I'm not sure why it is but much too often these type of low-budget films are given all sorts of hype and they usually don't live up to it. TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is the exception because it actually does deliver a good number of laughs and it plays against the horror genre quite well. With that said, I still think the film contains quite a few flaws and it certainly isn't the masterpiece some people are making it out to be. One strong point is certainly the screenplay that is smart enough to know how to make fun of the genre by setting up familiar things that fans are going to pick up on. Just check out a hilarious sequence where Tucker is using a chainsaw on a log and hits a bee hive. He starts swinging the chainsaw like a maniac, ala Leatherface, and this joke really pays off and especially how it eventually ends for one of the teenagers. Another terrific sequence deals with Dale and Tucker thinking that the teens are in a suicide club and that the two rednecks have interrupted them. A lot of the humor is the over-the-top kind and this here includes quite a few bloody death sequences. Most of the deaths happen accidental but this does lead to plenty of the red stuff including one poor soul who runs into a wood chipper. Fans of movies like DEAD ALIVE are going to know the type of humor that this film has to offer even if the end result is several notches below that Peter Jackson classic. Both Labine and Tudyk are extremely good in their roles. The entire redneck genre has been done to death but I thought the two actors handled their parts quite well and managed for them to come across rather fresh. Katrina Bowden plays one of the college girls who ends up on the redneck's side and she too is quite good. There are several problems with the film including the fact that many of the jokes fall flat on their face. Another problem is that even at just 88-minutes the film seems a bit too long. With that said, fans of the genre are still going to want to check this out and especially with the strong performances, sick humor and the gore.",,Anonymous,Horror

So Evil's deciding to mess with Hillbillies huh?,"This film blew me out of the wind. The story, the characters, the acting, the plot, the action, the violence. Oh my god did I just love this film! It's one of those modernized films which will one day become a new classic. It's also a good film example about how to blend in the horror with the comedy. I think that was constructed together well.The story sets on some hill billies getting their vacation house, moving in, having the time of their lives until one day they spot a camper who falls into the water. They save her and help her out while her friends think they're gonna try and kill them. It all gets messy with horror, blood, gore, drama, romance, comedy, chills and thrills that come around thick and fast.I really loved the way this film unraveled itself up. I mean I was just surprised by what I saw because by the year 2010 or maybe 2008, horror directors would have stopped being creative. But this film is in no rush to get things happening on foot.The acting is superb in this film. The hillbillies and campers were realistic and developed well. I felt sorry for the hillbillies as that they didn't even mean to harm the kids while I wanted the kids to die. And what ways these kids died! It was funny to watch because it was really bizarre in how someone dodged, someone got a blade in the face, someone got cut up. It was all in good fun.I also loved how they made it creepy, with the Tucker and Dale's environment and yard looking isolated, gritty and dirty. This made us (the viewers) believe that the hillbillies were something out of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Wrong Turn"". Instead they are really nice and they made me laugh quite a bit. The director also mixes the comedy and creepy aspects in well, giving us a full on look of the atmosphere.Definitely watch it, and if it's a good price, BUY IT!!!! That's what I'm thinking of doing. It's not really scary but more funny than scary and creepy. Most likely one of the best modern horror films I have seen in a long time. Even the best horror-comedy of 2010!

Really Funny and Surprisingly Tender for an R-Rated Horror/Comedy,"Tucker and Dale is so good in many different ways but the first and most noticeable is the very believable friendship between the characters. The movie is deliberately playing into the stereotype that the backwood hillbillies are always the villains and it makes the movie smarter than your average horror movie. But I couldn't help but be taken aback by how sweet Tucker and Dale's bond is. They aren't the sharpest tools in the shed (especially Dale) but you would swear Tudyk and Labine had been hanging out for years. Add in the fact that Allison is well rounded and willing to look past Dale and Tucker's appearance (even to the point where it's a tad unrealistic) and you have some genuinely fun and interesting characterization. Hitting the mark on this aspect will paper over some of the movie's flaws and this part is so exemplary, you would swear this was written by Edgar Wright (Labine/Tudyk reminded me of Pegg and Frost in the best possible way).Of course, if the actors and actresses hadn't held up their end, the writing wouldn't be as evident. I can't credit Tudyk and Labine enough, they both completely sell out as their characters and they both perform admirably. They work well together, and they work well individually, and they had me rolling I was laughing so hard. Katrina Bowden is also great as Allison. She's gorgeous but she's also funny in her own right. She helps sell an unrealistic romance that could have been groan inducing. The other actors and actresses get the job done in their respective parts.Lest you think this is a straight comedy, Tucker and Dale vs Evil packs all the gore you want in a hard R-Rated horror movie. Tucker and Dale aren't directly responsible for the horrible fates that the ""college kids"" all suffer and each of them are maimed or killed in a unique and funny way. Limbs are lost, buckets of blood are sprayed, and one character is even halved (I won't spoil how). If you're a little squeamish, this movie isn't on the level of torture porn but its far from PG-13 material (there are good PG-13 horror movies, but you must go one direction or the other, Tucker and Dale vs Evil isn't one that's up in the air).Most importantly for a horror/comedy, this movie is hilarious from start to finish. Craig and Jurgenson are smart enough writers to know which horror clichés to play with and the movie is packed full of winks and nods to where horror movies usually go. I always appreciate a movie that can effectively include meta humour and this is one of the sharper examples. The material becomes even funnier with the endearing sweetness in the delivery from the cast.The missteps in this movie are small and completely forgivable. Chad becomes a little too over-the-top by the end and although what they decide to do with his character is interesting, it stretches plausibility. I don't know if its how the character is written or Jesse Mosses performance. Some of the kills are better than others but there aren't any that are embarrassingly bad.The cult following this movie has garnered is well deserved. I got shades of Wright/Pegg/Frost from this but this movie stands on its own and deserved to be seen by a wider audience. I would love to see a sequel to this if the could retain the key pieces and find some new things to point fun at.

The storyline surrounds two hillbilly friends who recently purchased a new summer house. Just as they visit it for the first time a group of teens arrive and mysteriously start committing suicide. What can the two friends do to stop them? This movie is directed by Eli Craig (Zombieland) and stars Alan Tudyk (I, Robot), Tyler Labine (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Katrina Bowden (30 Rock) and Jesse Moss (The Uninvited). The storyline for this is brilliant and very well written...like a better Scary Movie. The kill scenes and special effects are very well done. The cast is also very well selected, written and their performances are perfect. This is one of those movies where as soon as it's done you feel ready for a sequel. Overall this is a unique horror movie with enough clever elements to make this a must own. There's a ton of rewatchability. I'd score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"underrated gem of a horror/comedy, how has this not been released yet?","i just had to chime in along with upwelling of support for this hilarious film. if you liked shaun of the dead, zombieland, and/or evil dead 2, this is just as good as any of them - possibly better. heck, if you have any room in your heart for well done black comedy at all, you'll love this. the script and dialogue are non-stop funny once it gets going (and it doesn't drag out the gate either) what's more, the characters (drawn from some of the better young character actors in TV and indie film) exude both chemistry and even a bit of star power, not to mention great comedic timing. it took me ages to figure out where i knew dale from, turns out he was the main sidekick/bro from reaper (which was a good little show but not half as excellent as this movie)anyway it's a crime if this hasn't seen a proper release yet, check it out any way you can. hopefully a cult following will get it bought and finally bring a bit of well- deserved cash & fame to the director and cast...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""I'm feeling...high on prescription medication.""","(601-word review) Yes, I know. My rating is a war crime. How could I!? Well, unpopular-opinion-me has returned. This film was a bit disappointing for me, which goes against the majority's opinion: that it's super hilarious and fantastic. The mild subconscious expectation that it'll be just that, specifically the 'hilarious' part, based on the majority-held opinion, affected my perception more than expected, as this was hardly funny. Possibly. That may not have affected me that much.Regardless, the weakest film I've seen (maybe ever, but in the Top 3 at least) in 2023 goes to this one, 100%: only nine, but still. Its comedy is one of the main aspects, and the ingredients for success are there, yet something went wrong. Besides a scene or two (all thanks to Alan Tudyk), I couldn't extract much amusement.I can see that, potentially, elements of the story are laugh-out-loud, nearing dying material: hillbillies mistaken for killers and how everything that happens conveniently reinforces that, then the ""hilarity"" that ensues. In theory, however. Except, in this case, the execution miserably failed for me.This film's duo (Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) reminded me of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in Hot Fuzz. The characters in both films are similar: Tucker/Nicholas is the smart(er) one who doesn't seem as much of a caricature as Dale/Danny, who's the good-hearted but simple-minded one.And interestingly enough, I didn't find that film super hilarious, either. At least it had Timothy Dalton, whose overall performance/character was the only saving grace, or one of them, as I don't quite remember. There wasn't a comparable element like that in this film.The only thing coming close to it was Alan Tudyk. Unfortunately, he didn't have the writing on his side. He did a great job: the best part, without a doubt. But he still couldn't make up for the writers dropping the ball, and the ball dropped hard.As if that wasn't enough, there was a greater focus on Tyler Labine's character, individually, and with Katrina Bowden's character. There NEEDED to be more of Alan: more of Tucker. I didn't hate the whole thing with Dale and Allison: rather, in actuality, I liked it, especially where it went by the end. But either scrap that entirely and focus more on one tone (chaotic and comedic carnage but better written) or increase Alan Tudyk's screen time. There's no in-between: what the writers were presumably going for, making the film worse by doing.But Jesse Moss' performance was also decent. Chad's characterization allowed him to deliver it in a way rivaling Alan's efficient performance, which was the best, despite his character being more ""lowkey."" At times, Jesse's line delivery reminded me of Patrick Bateman, and more particularly, his voice reminded me of Carlisle Cullen; he even looks similar to Peter Facinelli, especially now.He'll be perfect for playing Carlisle in the Twilight TV series that's in development. Instead of starting with Bella, they can start the show with his early life before turning or right after it, focusing on a prequel aspect and backstory about every Cullen family member, leading up to the present at the end of the first season, ending with Bella's introduction.Boom. Emmy Awards will flow in immediately because that's what anything better than this, complete hogwash, deserves. You're welcome, showrunner/director/writers/crew of the Twilight TV series. I'll like $40 million up-front, in cash, minimum, please.Despite only having a scene or two (more than enough, for sure) that landed, all thanks to Alan Tudyk, America's Funniest Videos (AFV) resembles the pinnacle of humor in comparison.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Funny, Crimson-Soaked Satire That's a Bit on the Light Side","A pair of simple-minded backwoods types run into trouble when their vacation plans overlap with those of a great, big carload of college party animals. It's shallow - no, really shallow - but so are the slasher flicks it's sending up, so par for the course I guess. Problem is, Cabin in the Woods is already more comprehensive, Scream is wittier and Scary Movie is more profane, so there's not a lot of room to find a fresh niche. The titular duo have a good thing going, and the core script-flip of teens doing the terrorizing is fun in concept. There's just so little to it beyond the bare bones that it's hardly a filling meal, so the good laughs and splatter effects can't find enough meat to sink their teeth in. Mercifully short, it gets in and out in under eighty minutes, and even then seems a little bloated.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

I watch a lot of movies and never saw anything like this one before.I don't know how they could have done it better, but it's just not among the very best movies I've ever seen so I couldn't give it a 10.

Did I watch something different to everyone else?,"I have just seen this film and it feels like I've watched something completely different to everyone else. It isn't even that funny, some moments will make you smile to yourself but I didn't find myself laughing out loud at all.The plot for this film did sound like a good idea but it was poorly executed. The film is predictable and just pretty stupid in general. The way some of the people die is mildly amusing due to the fact that it is so over the top to be scary despite all the blood, but again it is predictable. It was obvious which is why I didn't find it that funny, there was no surprise factor.The cast blew hot and cold for me. Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) both done a very good job. They were likable characters, especially Dale, and the silly conversations they had together were probably the scenes I enjoyed the most. Katrina Bowden also adds some charm but the rest of the cast were pretty dull.Overall I was disappointed, it may be worth a one time watch but to call it 'one of the funniest movies ever' is well over the top. Very few laughs and predictable all the way through. Wouldn't recommend.5/10.Watched the trailer again, all the best bits are in there.

You can sit through it and thoroughly enjoy the scenarios, one-liners, and twists. In a way, it's a good example of a balance of concept/writing and production: With some flicks, the writing is so good that you can forgive lousy production.

It's okay,"Recently, I came to like comedy-horror movies. But, you can see right away that in this movie, the comedy wins. It wasn't scary, it was just nasty. The story was quite predictable for me, but still enjoyable. I mean, after the first kill, you just know that, that is all what will be going on in the whole movie. There were a lot of scenes that made me say: ""yeah, that will only happen in a movie"". Mostly I loved Tucker and Dale and their dialog.There is a lot of blood, so if you're one of the fainthearted, be warned. I didn't like the fact that the main characters got away with what happened, I mean they weren't charged or accused of anything when they should have been. That part wasn't well done. I mean, when you make a horror story to seem more real, you should include real parts of the life, too. There were no zombies, no evil spirits or creatures, so why exclude the reality. And that is why I say ""only in a movie!"". Be as it is, I expected more of this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Through a series of freak accidents they start to look more and more guilty. I very much enjoyed the film. It even has a cute love story in it...a bit hard to believe but cute non the less.

Shaun of the Rednecks,"For this type of film (aka quasi-zombie movie):1. The casting and acting really added to this movie. Even the small-role actors were awesome in their spots.

It also helped bring in the funny.The same exact story could have been done with a different set of people and typical horror filming, and it could have been a dud. But, the right combination made this for a quality, humorous, extremely fun movie that I would watch again more than once (which moved it up to a 7 for me...that's not common either).If someone says ""Move over Shaun of the Dead""...they should be slapped.

So Entertaining and Hillarious!,"There are a lot of actors in the movie, but only four who survive long enough to make a difference. Tyler Labine, as Dale, is a pudgy victim of low self-esteem, and Alan Tudyk, as Tucker, is his patient best pal, sometimes exasperated by him in the tradition of Laurel and Hardy. As Allison, herself a farm girl, Katrina Bowden is instinctively sympathetic to Dale. And Jesse Moss plays Chad, the leader of the college kids, who is a ferocious and hateful young man with a lifelong score to settle. The movie gives them not much more to do than fill their simple roles, which they do nicely. It's amusing when Allison tries to broker better communications between the two sides.Students of the Little Movie Glossary may find it funny how carefully ""Tucker and Dale"" works its way through upended cliches.

Tucker and Dale vs Evil (2010),"Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil starts like any other backwoods hillbilly horror movie. A group of beer loving college kids are off to the woods for some partying. On their way they stop at a rural gas station. And here is when it all twists around. The narrative focus leaves this group of clichéd teens and joins a hillbilly duo. These aren't some inbred, stupid, weirdos. Tucker and Dale are smart, loyal, and play off each other with the kind of comrade usually reserved for buddy cop action films. They genuinely care for each other. As events unfold a series of comical misunderstandings leave the teenagers thinking that Dale and Tucker are out to kill them. As they begin to protect themselves, they inadvertently start offing themselves. The film is hilarious in its presentation of these antics, and Dale and Tucker's reactions are simply priceless. We are also treated to a sweet blossoming love story. If the film is guilty of one thing, it's that it pushes its premise too far and it runs out of steam towards the end. Despite this, Dale and Tucker is an original look at the horror genre, and how preconceptions can be harmful, even deadly.

Never would've thought this movie would've been this great.,"I had no expectations going into the movie but I can honestly say I haven't laughed out loud at anything else like I did with this one in a long time. The combo of Alan Tudyk (Tucker) and Tyler Labine (Dale) was as good as it gets. They played their characters without missing a beat.Dale's crush, Ali (Katrina Bowden), played her part pretty well too, but left a little to be desired. All in all I was pleasantly surprised. The rest of the cast was as expected. Shotty, first-time or small-time actors that finally got the chance to play a role with some decent stars in a B-movie that just might get them some publicity.I realize this movie never made it to theaters, but I honestly can't understand why. If the budget was as low as I think, this should have been in theaters for sure. The movie definitely gets a thumbs up for the comedy in it. Tudyk was great just like he is in all of his roles, and Labine never let me down once. I've been a fan of his since ""Reaper"" and I'm just glad to see him working again.I really think that this is one of the better films I've seen so far this year. If you're looking for some comedy and a lot of guts and gore, this is definitely your flick. If you're looking for something with a love story and a happy ending too, you've found it in this one as well. At the end of the day I give this an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A group of teens mistake two backwoods hillbillies for slashers, and one by one fall victim to stupidity.","Over three decades ago, Sean S. Cunningham brought the world Jason Voorhees, the water logged, back woods tromping, machete wielding maniac of the Friday the 13th series. Wearing raggedy clothing, a found hockey mask (in one scene a bag), and only emitting a few grunts here and there, Jason would haunt the grounds of Camp Crystal Lake, dispatching with any horny teen that came within a fifty foot radius of his old watering hole. Jason wasn't bright either, dreadfully mistaking a horny teen for his mother, simply because she wore the same moth infested sweater that she once had. All of these things amount to one of the first ""redneck"" killers, with the most notable attribute being the fact that he was brain dead, literally.For the next thirty or so years, the redneck stereotype would be played upon and upped, with the likes of Deliverance, Silence of the Lambs, and Wrong Turn helping pave the way for what would end up being a tremendously enjoyable stereotype to hack and slash its way into our hearts. What Tucker and Dale vs. Evil does effectively is that it plays just about each and every stereotype, then plays the complete opposite of what we have come to expect after all these years of incest and cannibalism.Tucker and Dale (played by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine respectively) are just a couple of hayseeds from up and over yonder, looking to renovate their newly purchased ""vacation"" home in the woods, when they encounter a group of horny, party hungry college co-eds. Tending to their renovations, their fishing rods, and their PBR, Tucker and Dale keep to themselves until Allison (Katrina Bowden) finds herself in need of help, which quickly becomes misconstrued as a kidnapping. What follows soon after is one misunderstanding after another, with hilarious yet deadly results.As horror/comedies go, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil delivers exactly what one would want from a combination like that, with buckets of blood spilling out just as quickly as the laughs. Dale's fluffy, shy, yet sensitive side dismisses all we have come to understand about the flesh hungry redneck killers of the past, and Tucker's guidance over Dale allows for that pitch perfect ""buddy cop"" feel. All that we supposedly know about rednecks and everything Tucker and Dale show us provides the blood and the laughs, with the laughs begetting the blood and the blood the laughs.As each scene transitions into the next, we slowly begin to see that this is Eli Craigs debut film, but its minor editing flaw is one that we immediately forget about as it only brings us the woes of Tucker and Dale even quicker. With chainsaws, machetes, woodchippers, weaponized sticks, and homemade moonshine making pit stops at every kids untimely demise, we are introduced to even more horror movie clichés, yet clichés that break apart clichés, providing perfectly pitched laughs and gore. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a movie that will repeatedly play in your head after the credits role, causing you to quote the hapless duo even after its short run in theaters is over, and recall the excessive gore well into the next Final Destination release.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Movie,"I did like this movie. The only problem I have is that this movie gave away too much in it's trailer. The trailer ruined all the shock value. I will show it to my friends but I will advise them that the trailer is a spoiler. Just because of that fact the movie was way less enjoyable than what it should have been and what is why I gave it a 7.I'm surprised this move scored higher than ""The Cabin in the Woods."" I know it's trailer is not as appealing but it scores high on the lists for the best horror flicks. From the trailer it doesn't look like a comedy but it is if you in tune with business acts. Most stay at home Dads or Moms my have trouble understanding it's comic appeal.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just not particularly funny...,"While I do know that this is technically a satire of the horror genre, it's just not the funny kind of satire...You might think ""hm, that was clever"" a couple of times during the film, but except for calling out 30+ year old tropes and references from the same time period, the movie doesn't have much to offer.
Most of the scenes are very predictable, and of the group I watched it with no one laughed once.The whole stereotype twist is original, but get's tired after about the 2nd joke.
I'd still always pick Cabin in the Woods instead, from one of the most underrated directors of our time!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great movie,"Going to make this short and sweet.Probably one of the best ""horror"" comedy ever made. A must watch. The story is great and a wonderful flip on horror tropes. The acting is on point.

What a gem of a film!,"I watched this movie, not expecting much. The IMDb ratings were good, but they aren't always on the money. This time, they were and I was happy I spent the time on this gem of a film. First of all the story was great, the acting was perfect. This was the funniest horror movie I have since since, ""Army of Darkness."" The humor was great and it was good to laugh out loud again. Whoever wrote this classic, I commend you, great effort. The title is memorable and after seeing the film it fits perfectly. My hats off to the director, the actors and writer, this is a fabulous work. I gave this a 10 out of 10, because I didn't expect it to be this good.

Surprisingly excellent! Horror at its best!,"What was supposed to be a boring Saturday night turned out to be a welcome surprise. As a huge horror fan, I've been trying to find titles on Netflix (which I recently got), and having heard of this one I decided to give it a go without knowing much of the plot. What a delicious delight!I'm not going to reveal any of the plot, but I highly recommend this one to horror fans. It's the most hilarious horror I have seen in quite some time, and it gleefully bounces off horror clichés to make them wonderfully twisted and so much fun. The cast is pretty great in that they know their purpose, they understand the humor in the screenplay, and they deliver it well.I strongly can't recommend this enough. It reminds me of the recent The Cabin in the Woods, but an even funnier version. It's so satisfying when a horror film comes out and amazes me this much.",,Anonymous,Horror
A great comedy.,"This movie may be low budget but it is without a doubt one of the best horror comedies out there. Tyler Labine did such a good job and I think hes soo funny I wish he was in more movies. The other actors did good too and the story was just so new and original and funny.This movie is about two southern men..tucker and dale..They are your typical southern hillbillies and while at a gass station they scare a group of judgmental college kids. They see the college kids later at his delapidated ""vacation"" home where things start to go bad.Don't watch the trailer before this movie because it does spoil a lot of it. Just watch this movie and trust me you will love it. Horror movie fans or comedy fans will both enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amusing send-up of slasher hillbilly flicks,"RELEASED IN 2010 and written & directed by Eli Craig, ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" is a comedy/horror about genial West Virginian hillbillies Tucker & Dale (Alan Tudyk & Tyler Labine) who visit their newly acquired rundown cabin-in-the-woods wherein they are mistaken as psycho hilljack killers by a group of vacationing college youths.This is a well-done lampoon of flicks like ""Deliverance"" (1972) ""Wrong Turn"" (2003) and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974). Besides being consistently amusing, what works best is that you get to know Tucker and, especially, Dale, as well as the main girl (Katrina Bowden), who's very reminiscent of Christine Taylor (from ""The Brady Bunch Movie""), albeit taller. Freckled cutie Chelan Simmons looks her best clad in daisy dukes throughout. The coniferous woods give away that this was shot in the Great Northwest and not West Virginia, where the events purportedly take place.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 29 minutes and was shot Alberta, Canada (e.g. Cochrane & Bottrel).

Absolutely fantastic...,"How did this not manage to become a franchise? It has to be the best ""spoof"" horror film I've ever seen. Tudyk shows his talent for comedy, as always, and Labine is right there him.Everything about the film is perfect... I don't understand why it was shelved for three years after production. It couldn't have cost all that much to produce. I just don't get Hollywood... they greenlight re-makes and blockbusters that cost so much that they have no way of making the cost back but pass on putting $$ into anything remotely original.They really need to make a second chapter for Dale and Tucker... absolute comedy gold with these guys.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious but stupid hilarious,"Not all being stupid is hilarious but this is stupid. Just like being stupid is funny but some mixed with horror is good or the best. This one is mediocre with the mix. It is like watching Friends with horror added, which is not a great mix. So five stars for adding both together, which makes this film kind of stupid. You either have to be drunk or on dope to think this is the best film. I do not like or enjoy crude or rude dumb films.I gave it a five stars because at least is not actual crude or rude humor. I love horror movies but this humor is stupid to be with a horror movie. The Evil Dead movies are better than this. Those are actually funnier. If the characters act like they are not even graduated from high school kind of intelligence, then they are pretty much stupid, even if they are paid to act that way.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good fun For Genre Fans,"I must admit to being a big slasher fan, though it can be a relentless genre to follow. All but the most hardened fan could stomach everything produced around a monstrous killer stalking a group of babbling teenagers. Not in terms of gore, but quality. Good ideas are often not around and cheesy imitations tend to do the rounds often.There have been attempts to rework the slasher in a comedic sense. Scream probably did it best, but Tucker and Dale vs Evil comes close in quite a special way. It's not a mainstream movie, but this pseudo-parody of 'hillbilly horror' (think Deliverance or Wrong Turn 2) does a good job paying respect to the genre while also poking a lot of fun at it.Sure, not everyone will like it, but you can also pass it off as a very 'stupid' movie. A future cult classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the funniest movies Ive ever seen,"I didn't want to watch it until I found out who the two stars are then I couldn't wait. I wound up laughing pretty much from beginning to end. Absolutely brilliant parody of slasher movies. Something happened in it that was going to cost it two stars because I thought it went too far but it set up one of the funniest gags in the film so they got the stars back. I love both of the leads and it's by far one of the best things either has done. I'm trying not to do spoilers but it's hard because you want to talk about it but it's all funny, well except for one unfunny bit that sets up a hysterical gag. Just know it all works out in the end. The problem is I want a sequel but I'm glad they haven't done one because I;d be terrified it wouldn't measure up. Script, brilliant. Direction, excellent and the cast just knocks it out of the park. I think 90% of what's out there is pure crap and 9% is watchable. Realize that when I say this is a hysterically funny and very original film. It feels good to leave a good review for once.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

hilarious premise,"A group of college friends are going camping in the woods when they encounter two creepy hillbillies. It's beer-loving, affable Dale (Tyler Labine) and Tucker (Alan Tudyk) going to fix up their newly bought vacation cabin. As the young people go night swimming, Allison (Katrina Bowden) hits her head and is rescued by Dale and Tucker. The other friends fear that she had been kidnapped.The premise is a hilarious twist on the traditional hillbilly killer horror. Labine and Tudyk are a funny duo. The switch in point of view is inventive. The first half is near perfect. When Tucker gets taken, the premise breaks down a little. The miscommunication becomes not simply situational but rather willful ignorance. It takes it one small step closer to silly away from the smart writing. On a minor note, the opening should not give away part of the ending. It would be better setup if the college kids are horror fans watching a Texas Chainsaw adjacent movie. That would truly spoof the traditional horror narrative.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Criminally Underrated,"I was enthralled in every second, laughing over and over with amazing performances. Do not miss this.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth seeing,"""Tucker and Dale vs Evil"" is a low budget breath of fresh air. The movie takes the standard ""killer rednecks"" genre and completely twists it around to make the entire enterprise original. Seeing things twisted around results in a lot of humorous and unexpected moments. But the movie remembers it's a B movie, and makes sure to deliver a lot of gory sequences (though no nudity, surprisingly.) The acting all around is very good, with top honors going to the actors who play the title characters.It's a movie well worth seeing, though I have two (minor) quibbles with it. First of all, after a while, the movie seems to be repeating the same joke over and over. Though the joke in question is a fresh and funny joke, towards the end it still feels a little extended. The other objection I had is with the cinematography - the colors often look too washed out when they should have been stronger. Still, those two nitpicks didn't stop me from enjoying the movie.",,Anonymous,Horror

They should have recognized the omen as the policeman explains to them that nothing good can come from that area. Little did they know that they would be soon stocked by college preppies that mysteriously also picked the same words to party and possibly even more.

The Airplane of horror comedies,"I don't really consider this to be a horror comedy but a comedy of horror movies. As a comedy it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I would guess it's even funnier to those who appreciate horror films. I don't consider it a horror comedy because this movie doesn't try to be scary like for example Evil Dead 2, which is one of the few horror films in my opinion that succeeded in being funny and scary at the same time. Tucker and Dale is just straight up laugh until it hurts, with about 4 scenes I still laugh just thinking about them. If you hate horror you might not be able to get past the gore(yes it's gory), but for those who appreciate the genre this is a not to be missed movie, and best viewed with as many friends as you can get to come over.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A mighty fine piece of cinema right there,"For what it is - a lighthearted spoof of a hillbilly horror genre, this film has a surprising amount of depth to it. And I'm not just talking about the comedy aspect. The entire theme of the movie centres just as much around the stereotyping that the ""West Virginia folk"" suffer from, as it does around the preppy college kid trope in horror movies. And it does it in style. Even though some of the deaths seem improbable at best, they send the right message in the context of the story. The Chekhov's gun has fired and it keeps firing throughout the film. The script keeps you jumping from one set of shoes to another until you're left wandering, who the hell is the bad guy here, and if there's a bad guy here at all? This is the essence of the movie in terms of the message and it delivers in that department. It really does. But enough about the boring stuff, lets focus on what's important...Is it funny? Yes. It's funny and original and everything you'd want from a spoof comedy. The references to the hillbilly horror movies are certainly there, and they are presented in such a way that a newcomer to the genre will still find the scenes funny, but a connoisseur will savour the additional layer of gory sweetness as it comes. One. Bloody. Bit. At a time. Delicious!Acting is OK for what it is supposed to represent. It's not believable to the point of immersion, but it doesn't feel like it's supposed to be immersive too. It's just the right balance of acting versus goofery you'd come to expect from a spoof film. Plus some unscripted scenes make the movie that much more entertaining - apparently, in hillbilly country, beer is good for everything ;)In summary, if you're looking for something to watch with your friends over a pizza, you'd have to look far and wide to find something more entertaining (but not stupid) than this. It's funny, energetic, thoughtful, and it will keep you talking for the rest of the evening in that holiday house you just bought with your friends. Just keep your eyes peeled for them pesky college kids! Or things might get a little... bloody!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Review of Tucker and Dale vs Evil,"Title: Tucker and Dale vs Evil
Director: Eli Craig
Genre: Horror Comedy
Streaming Source: Hulu
Star Rating: 5 starstw: blood, murder, alcohol, marijuana, nudity, head injury, burning, torture, destruction of propertyI find it honestly so difficult to write reviews of books and movies that I love. I find it so hard to put just what I love about them into words. This movie is no exception. I am sitting here struggling to find the words to express just how much I love and adore this movie. Everything about this movie is just so perfect in every way. It is truly my comfort movie.I think my favorite thing about this movie is the whole event is just one giant misunderstanding. Trucker and Dale just want to work on their vacation home but a group of college kids have a completely different idea. The antics that follow are just over the top but in the best kind of way. I mean sure, it's probably not great that these teens are dying but it's truly just so ridiculous.Another thing I love about this movie is the friendship between Tucker and Dale. Sure, Tucker is a little hard on Dale when Dale talks about his lack of confidence with women but Tucker only wants what is best for him. They truly have the best friendship.Overall, I simply adore this movie. It's one of my favorites and I suggest everyone take the time to watch it. It does get a little gory and there is a lot of blood but if can get past that, then you are in for a real treat with this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
So Creative!,"This is such a good movie! It is most definitely my favorite comedy horror film. It is likely to defy your expectations. I was endlessly impressed at the creativity of the circumstances and how they painted entirely misleading pictures. I think that even if you don't prefer horror films, you will have a fun time watching this as it isn't all that scary, but sets an undeniably gothic tone. But do* be on the lookout for gore. And if you're in it for the laughs, well, you won't be disappointed! It is an intelligent film with fantabulous writing and directing (and I don't often use the word ""fantabulous""). The only conspicuous flaw, and, even then, it is only my perception of a flaw, is the visual stylings. It lacks saturation and is all too green. If you have yet to see Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious!,"I'm a little late to the party on this one, but my wife and I just saw it on the recommendation of my co-worker and it was so funny! A great send up of films that use hillbillies as villains by using that prejudice as the driver of the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A comedy-horror that is a little light on for both comedy and horror.,"Tucker and Dale are rednecks from the South, bringing all that fact entails to the table. They wear lumberjack shirts with overalls and baseball caps. Dale sports a bushy beard. Both sport vacant expressions much of the time.They are obviously long time best buds, understanding of each other's thoughts and needs and generally delighting in each other's successes in a hetero way...Tucker has just bought a rundown shack in the remote woods. The shack is ramshackle and unkempt with various pieces of shack either missing or in desperate need of replacing. They look at the same way we would look at Diddy's mansion; an opulent paradise. A sign of finally having 'made it'.Into their orbit come 9 'Big City' morons from college for a weekend of drinkin' and fornicatin'. They see the 'dressed down' duo at the local store and immediately think Deliverance - of course even though they want nothing to do with the titular gents they end up setting up camp only metres away in the woods near Tucker's spectacular digs.That night Tucker and Dale are fishing in a dinghy when they spy (so to speak) the young teens taking a dip in their under-garments. When one girl Alison takes a tumble that is not spotted by her swimming chums (and really looking upon her in her undies I am amazed that not one guy was watching her - you know to be sure she was safe 'n' stuff), so in Dale goes to rescue her.Of course now the young 'uns spot the ruckus and immediately assume that Tucker and Dale are up to no good.This sets in motion a chain of events that could best be described as harmless and moderately amusing, but not much more...From this point on the college kids case the shack, positive in the knowledge that the redneck hillbillies inside are doing all sorts of bad things to their friend. The problem is each attempt to make contact to let them know Alison is OK leads to misunderstandings that often end in accidental deaths, (who would have though signs that say ""We have your friend"" could be misinterpreted?). The flip side is that Tucker and Dale start thinking that the college kids are lemmings in a bizarre suicide pact.Every attempt to either save or deliver Alison only makes things worse, and in between these head-scratching coincidences Dale (the big bushy bearded one) and Alison start to learn more about one another.Again your views on the film Tucker and Dale Vs Evil will boil down to what you think of Tucker. And what you think of Dale. The rest of the movie isn't especially clever or original. There are gore scenes, but not scenes an old hand will raise an eyebrow to, let alone a glass. Aside from the undies in the river bit there is no T&A to speak of, and there isn't much in the way of obvious jokes. So ultimately if you think Tucker and Dale are likable and can ignore the series of coincidences and instead think 'gee that's unfortunate' at appropriate times you might enjoy this.I sorta did, but I won't be watching it again.Final Rating - 5.5 / 10. A light horror comedy, and by that I mean it is both light on for horror and comedy.",,Anonymous,Horror
I liked it,"I'm late to the party but I've heard so much about this movie, I just had to watch it. And I'm glad I did. The movie subverted most expectations and used the classical horror movie tropes quite well. It was entertaining to see how a misunderstanding could lead to such mayhem. Definitely worth watching even if it doesn't change your world view or anything profoundly insightful. Alan Tudyk is fabulous as always and the characterization he brings to Tucker is endearing and heartfelt. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and feel that it was worth my time watching it. You should enjoy it too especially if you like those traditional slasher style horror movies. A great romp in the woods. Bring the popcorn!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It happens,"You could argue that the ""sh"" is missing, but then again it works like it is too. And things happen of course ... but not like they happen in the movie that is. But that's why it's a movie. And still the writers have put quite a bit of thought into this and it is more then coherent. Well as much as a movie with a crazy premise (as seen here) can be of course.After seeing Alan Tyduk in Firefly, I've seen him in two comedies. Apart from this also in the ""Death at a Funeral"" (the UK version that is). And he is genuinely funny. And he fits really good in this one too. The comedy almost never feels forced either (which is a big deal with movies that have a ""high concept"" as this one). Watch it and be entertained",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This deserves to be a cult classic,"Finally - an actually, legitimately original twist on a horror premise (the ""cabin in the woods""), but it's a hilarious and charming comedy instead.If you've seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre or any movie where hicks kill a bunch of teenagers, you gotta watch this. Unlike anything else made in the last 20 years, this actually subverts expectations, and it's hilarious... And again, very original in how it does its thing.And the cast is killer, especially the two ""hillbillies"" and a certain ""college kid"" that by the end of the movie is a legit Two Face-like villain right outta Batman. Seriously, this is hilarious!I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope they make a sequel.Because this is the kind of movie that didn't mess anything up.

The title is daft.,"Amongst the recent spate of horror comedies, this one is a cut above most, including the overrated crap such as ""Zombieland"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", though not quite as good as the Cuban-Spanish ""Juan of the Dead"". Unlike ""proper"" comedies, such as any Sascha Baron Cohen or Monty Python film (i.e. generally referring to UK comedies), which are funny/comedic from start to finish, TADVE falls more into the formulaic/commercial U.S. category, despite its original premise. What I mean is that the first half is quite funny, while the second half sees a marked drop in gag quality, with too much repetition, the inclusion of very obvious cliché gags, TADVE even becoming slightly sentimental on occasion (which is why this isn't a ""proper"" i.e. all-out comedy, which is how all comedies should be made).It was obvious early on that the movie's rather shaky premise would run into trouble eventually. Don't get me wrong - the premise is great, but it relies too much on comedy-of-errors humour. There are only so many accidental situations and coincidences you can utilize as plot-devices until the well simply dries up and the same absurd shtick isn't as funny anymore. The law of diminishing returns applies here.I am not quite sure why anybody would include a spoiler in the movie's title! ""Vs. Evil"" is a bloody giveaway. Sure, it gets people flocking to see the movie (the dumber viewers, who need everything spelled out in the title), but the surprise factor is out the window. Not everybody watches trailers and reads the story lines in advance. I am quite annoyed with the movie's title, as it gives no-one (apart from morons: those lucky avatards!) the slightest chance of being surprised by the role-reversal premise.Best moment: ""Don't you know those things (mobile phones) won't work here?!"" 8/10 for the first, 5/10 for the second half.",,Anonymous,Horror

So many dumb moments like the cop not drawing his weapon on two guys dragging half a body around...that's just lazy. No excuse for that. There was even a scene where tucker fell over RIGHT BESIDE the college kids (when rescuing the dog) and no one hear or noticed him like a FOOT AWAY? Again, just LAZY filmmaking. The trivia section says the dvd had a feature that played the movie from the perspective of the kids...

"a much needed, outrageously funny and heart-warming look at slasher movies (NOT Scream)","Sometimes a movie has to be made just to be a proper counter to so much that's come before it. I'm almost surprised this film hasn't existed before (not to say there haven't been critical analyses of horror conventions in horror comedies going back years, Student Bodies and of course the first couple of Scream movies come as good examples). But with this and Cabin in the Woods, it's hard to ever *really* go back to the way slasher movies used to be, the kind like Mother's Day or something where you got a bunch of hicks who go after seemingly helpless teens/twenty-somethings in the woods. Because here, not only are the roles reversed - the couple of hicks who have a cabin (and many sharp objects) who are suddenly the target of paranoid and freaked-out college kids - but it goes through a deconstruction of certain tropes in general.In a way it almost goes into romantic comedy territory in small bursts, as Dale (Tyler Labine, a much needed boost after drek like Good Ol' Fashioned Orgy) saves a young girl named Allison from drowning who was part of the college pack, and, being a genuinely friendly and nice guy (if not the best at approaching them, as we see early on), gets closer to her... well, that is until the other college kids, who think he and Tucker (the always splendid Alan Tudyk) have kidnapped her in their creepy cabin, which in reality is Tucker's summer home he's remodeling. More to the point, the whole film functions in its satire like a big but sincere Looney Tunes cartoon about mis-communication. In fact, I'd love it if this was shown in intro to communications classes in colleges, aside from its entertainment value, since it goes aways to show how we as a people mess up how we relate to one another through ALL pre- conceived notions.This isn't to say all hicks are pleasant and just want a couple of beers in a fishing boat, and not all college kids are arrogant and over-reactive morons. What Eli Craig and Morgan Jurgenson do so well with their script, and the subsequent direction, is keep the comedic pace so strong through so much of the film - at least the first two thirds before some revelations come forth - with a sort of 'checklist' as to the things that could happen. I kept thinking 'where could they go from here?' with how crazy it gets with the kills, which to one side are the maniac murders of Deliverance-folk and to the other side as the psychotic goals of a bunch of kids with a suicide pact(!) And yet with all of the beautiful set- ups and pay-offs of the gags, or the randomness of the VERY bloody violence (I appreciated that, and it really made it gut-bustingly funny, just for how long they would show things), it's still believable core characters that keep it going.I loved seeing Tucker and Dale as an on-screen buddy team, though it's hard to see this going past this one movie (maybe Tucker and Dale's Chainsaw Massacre is up next?) Tudyk and Labine drive their friendship to the audience right from the start, and their humor is much more natural than what one would expect even from a more broad parody. If anything the broadest characters are the dumb sheeple-like college kids following one super-deranged kid in a polo t-shirt with some backwoods- hick murder issues. While this doesn't mean the film wont' sometimes go into some of the territory its making fun of, that is characters doing stupid things when they should know better, in context it still works and is never less than a full blown crowd-pleaser.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The funniest best movie I have seen in a long time.,"This movie is truly the funniest best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only are Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine amazing. The whole movie really flowed well, it felt smooth not like this part then this part and now this part. The pacing was good.The writing was excellent, so many absolutely hilarious lines I need to watch it again and again. The setting was good. I was afraid it would be too gory and it is gory but it felt just the right amount and it was mixed in with funny. There were many emotions.Alan Tudyk is brilliant. He is an amazing character actor and I love watching him and seeing someone new he creates. Tyler Labine I have been noticing for a while. I love the heart he puts into his characters.I think what I loved the most from this movie is how much it made me laugh and how little it grossed me out. Perfect Halloween movie but not for kids because of all the deaths.Eli Craig I look forward to seeing more movies by you. Morgan Jurgenson awesome lines too many funny ones to remember. Alan and Ty thank you so much for a great movie. College kids way to go! I left the movie feeling fully satisfied and happy that the movie was better than I even hoped for.

Evil Dead meets Shaun of the Dead meets Wrong Turn!,"I never really bothered writing a review for a movie, but since this movie left me laughing still, with a wide grin on my face and wanting more, I guess I'll have to write down some of my impressions.First of all, never judge a book by its cover. Never ever. You might miss out on something that will give you a great time. In that way, I didn't know what to expect from this movie, so I just sat down to watch it, and after maybe five minutes I knew this was gonna be a great movie. Although I first thought it might be just another B-movie crappy comedy, it turned out that this movie is better than 90% of all movies I have ever seen. It simply got it all - gore, guts, glory, the laughs, the chicks, the guy you want to hate and see him bleed, and the likable heroes. The heroes of this movie are Tucker and Dale, two best friends who bought a cabin in the woods, where they want to spent their vacation fishing and enjoying themselves drinking beer and doing nothing. And then some crazy college kids have to come and ruin all. Spoiled college kids who just run around screaming, and killing themselves. Well, you'll have to figure it out for yourself anyway. Don't wanna spoil the fun.The movie is not just something for fans of B-movie horror movies and comedies, fans of the Evil Dead trilogy or stupid teenage horror movies. No, this is a movie that all fans of good entertainment can enjoy, and probably WILL enjoy. There wasn't a single boring moment during the whole movie. And there are not many movies than can keep you interested all the time. Just check it out and enjoy yourself.

Great comedy/horror movie.,"I was looking through Flixster's list of movies out on DVD and saw this movie and knew immediately that I would enjoy it. Comedies these days, in my opinion, are not funny at all. The reason being, it's the same jokes over and over. You got your teen comedies in the vein of American Pie, Superbad, etc., etc. You've got your Romantic Comedies, truthfully they just aren't funny because it's the same stories over and over. Tucker and Dale vs Evil was a breath of fresh air. Similar to Shaun of the Dead, Tucker and Dale are a couple of friends thrown into a potentially dangerous situation and make you laugh about it the entire time. I say it's a comedy horror because there is some gore but it's not a scary movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Other movies wish they were this awesome.,"I watched the trailer for Tucker & Dale vs Evil and immediately knew that I had to watch it. (An enthusiastic recommendation from a friend didn't hurt, either.)The set-up is typical for any slasher film: A group of sexy college kids are heading out into the woods to camp, drink, smoke, get naked, and just be generally debaucherous. They get a scare along the way, however, when they run into two deranged hillbillies at a convenience store.And that's where the typical slasher film ends and Tucker & Dale begins.This movie is gory, funny, and original, putting a spin on the conventional slasher film. Tudyk and Labine never miss a beat as the tragically (and hilariously) confused Tucker and Dale, and it's damn near impossible to tear your eyes away from Katrina Bowden (as the ""damsel in distress,"" Allison).Do yourself a favor and watch this movie AT LEAST once. You'll thank yourself later.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Great Movie Kept Hidden Until Now...,"I was one of the few UK residents fortunate enough to be able to see this movie as it stayed hidden away from the public only popping up at certain festivals and in certain European countries. Now (and thankfully) it's finally getting a release I find myself both over-joyed and a little bit sad.I'm overjoyed because if any movie deserves to be seen by the WHOLE movie going public then Tucker and Dale is certainly it. But I'm also sad because I found it thrilling that this movie was one of those I could ask friends ""Have you seen Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil? No? Oh you REALLY need to see it!!"" It felt like it was my job to make the world aware of just how good it really is. So now (and again, I say, quite rightly so) it's getting a release, albeit a limited one, no longer can I act like I discovered this film! The reason I feel the way I do about this film is because it's one of the few movies to come along in the last 5 years that is both well written and well-acted. And as well as those two great points it also has the bonus of being a very clever movie. The title characters are played with such great enthusiasm by Labine and Tudyk that it rubs off on the rest of the cast and you can see everyone is having the time of their lives.I'll admit that this film won't go down in the halls of fame but it will get Director Eli Craig the recognition he deserves. Now that Edgar Wright seems to have gone quiet it's time for a new kid on the block and Craig could be just that man. His direction is bordering on greatness and, given the opportunity, he could (and should) go on to great things.If I'm forced to say anything negative about this movie then my only criticism would be that at times some of the gags feel a little forced. Maybe that's down to the script writers or maybe it was down to the delivery by the cast. Either way the plus points of Tucker and Dale more than make up for these little faults.Please, I beg of you, turn this little underground movie into the sleeper hit it so rightly deserves to be!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Laughter and likability continues all throughout the movie, right until the very end.It's carried by strong acting by Tucker and Dale is perfection, which play a quintessential cult classic hillbillies role. The star of the movie is by far Dale, his amazing down to earth kindness, his witty dry humor, and his heroic villain persona - turn an otherwise terrible movie, into something special.Based on Dales performance alone, makes this movie more than watchable.

I personally loved the characters Tucker and Dale, and Dale's evil counterpart was very scary from the beginning, very young actor with a lot of potential. The cinematography was great, camera rolls, pans, tilts, everything was there, even never before seen POV's over the trees, i suppose they've used Stilts to achieve this, i really recommend this film for everyone looking to have a big time laugh, the film is absolutely enjoyable and may be in the memory for decades, i hope.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not horror/comedy movie but thriller/comedy,"Very funny, gory, with heart
Really entertaining twist on 'teens in the woods' horror flicks. Lots of laughs and buckets of blood. The actors playing Tucker and Dale are very compelling and believable. Their charm really makes the film and you care about their story.The movie is basically a farce or a comedy of errors with each error resulting in a gruesome death. While the manner of the deaths is so over the top as to be funny, the biggest laughs come from the dialog. ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil"" excels at both physical comedy (the chainsaw scene for example) and verbal (explaining the situation to the police).Great movie!This film had a tremendous audience reaction at the Seattle International Film Festival.

Wonderfully smart and witty,"I have been on an epic journey to find a companion piece for one of my favorite horror/comedies for years, a search that has been tormented with poorly made and abysmally acted b-rate flicks that could torment the soul with their mediocrity and poor cinematography.Since seeing Behind The Mask: The Rise Of Leslie Vernon I have fallen in love with the black humor style that doesn't quite make one think of movies like Very Bad Things so much as a very dramatic Monty Python sketch. Worse still is trying to find one that is smartly written and has acting that at the very least can be considered on par with a sci-fi original movie. Tucker and Dale VS. Evil far exceeds the bill.Lets not get crazy here and say the movie is packed with award winning actors or special effects but for a cast consisting of mostly unknowns (sans the titular Tucker and Dale of course) the level of acting far exceeds expectations. Not only is it better than one would expect it gets better the closer to the end one travels, compare the scene early in at the gas station with the hunt at the end and you will see a particular inhaler-using characters' acting grow leaps and bounds, in fact this early salvo of college co-ed banter is quickly dismissed as possibly a test shot when you compare the kids to what they will become a mere 30 minutes later.The humor is relentless and insanely funny, the use of villain shots, for Dale particularly, is interspersed beautifully throughout. At times one could imagine that if you knew nothing of the soft hearted hillbillys you would certainly think they where on a vendetta to murder you. I grew so attached to Dale that I actually wished he could be protected from having to witness the senseless, and extremely funny, violence around him.Combine an evening of Behind The Mask with some Tucker and Dale VS Evil and you will laugh your ass off, and maybe think a bit differently when looking at the bad guy in any classic horror movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The hillbillies rescue her and take her back to the cabin, and the other kids think they kidnapped her. Hilarious complications and situations result and abound.

Attention people who like to laugh,"Tucker & Dale vs Evil is the Shaun of the Dead of slasher flicks like Halloween or Friday the 13th. Even if you don't like those movies, this one will make you laugh as long as you don't mind a lot of gore. It turns the slasher genre upside-down in ways you won't expect that will keep you laughing throughout. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk bring the comedy and sympathy as the leads who fall victim to a series of unfortunate events. You should go see this movie.

"""What we have here, is a failure to communicate...""","How many times do we go out of our way to avoid ""that type of person""? Whether that ""type"" is someone we feel is threatening, dangerous, or just somebody we think would just ruin our day? I know I have.I'm not proud to admit it, but I've often created entire lives for people from just one glance, and assured myself that my imagination has threaded their personalities to a tee. So much so, that I feel satisfied not even confirming my suspicions; affirmations become by products of my delusions. Sometimes, I won't even allow myself the possibility of surprise. All from just a glance.Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil is a horror movie at a glance, but given the opportunity, it may surprise its viewers, revealing itself as a heartfelt fable at its hill-billy core. In this film, the horror genre is more of a paradigm, used to tell a deeper and more insightful tale compared to most contemporary horror films.Like most horror films nowadays, it begins with a young cast of teenagers, en route to escape the civilized world and embark on a camping trip filled with sex, drugs, and everything else college kids are expected to do. All of the token victims are present, accounted for, (the alpha male, the one black kid, the ditsy blonde with big boobs etc.) and seemingly placed upon the slab, practically begging a villain for killin'.Then, there's Tucker and Dale.The innocent group of college kids immediately type-cast the duo as two lunatic hillbillies straight out of a horror movie, poisoned from dime-a-dozen Hollywood clichés! They're instantly threatened by the pair and agree to stay far away from them through the remainder of their vacation.Meanwhile, there's Tucker and Dale.Tucker and Dale would like nothing better to do then fix up their new vacation home, which happens to look like it came from the set of an Evil Dead remake. The two characters are good ol' boys, a bit cliché, again at a glance, but have the tendency to grow on the viewer quicker than one can pop the top of a Pabst Blue Ribbon. Tucker is the grounded center of the two and the voice of reason, leaving Dale as the lovable comic relief.I have to say, Tyler Labine as Dale really steals the show. His portrayal of the moronic oaf constantly reminds the viewer that amongst all the blood and guts, this film has a big soft gooey heart on the inside. His character is the medium that best delivers all the sincerity of this film home, and another quality that sets this movie apart from the rest.Honorable mention goes to, of course, Alan Tudyk, a very underrated ""hey, it's that guy"" actor. His comedic delivery was never in question, personally, however. Don't agree? Check out ""Death at a Funeral"" and not the one with Chris Rock! The original! ""Death at a Funeral"" has Alan Tudyk constantly delivering comedic blows.Things really begin to turn a darker corner when Tucker and Dale rescue one of the college kids from nearly drowning. As Tucker and Dale are merely trying to do the right thing, the rest of the collegians think that the two hillbillies are kidnapping their friend, because that's what hillbillies do right? Kidnap young girls, take them back to shady cabins in the middle of nowhere, and skin them alive! Right?""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" succeeds in addressing a major concern in modern America, miscommunication! Personally, I really felt as if Eli Craig, the director and co-writer, was commenting on our fears and our lethargy, as Americans, concerning how we perceive ""strangers"" or people we do not know. According to Craig, and I would have to agree, we would rather allow our imaginations and context misrepresent ""strangers"" than assemble the responsibility required to get to know them. It's just easier to dismiss ""them"" as simply someone that is similar to somebody we have met in the past or somebody we do would not have pleasure in knowing.There's a conversation in the beginning of the movie between two characters about the owners of a dirty pick-up (who happen to be Tucker and Dale). One character says, commenting on the vehicle, ""We're in hillbilly country, now, boys! Squeal like a pig! Sooo-weeee!""In response to this statement, a young girl says, ""Chad, just because they're not in your fraternity doesn't mean their freaks"".""Well, actually it does Allison,"" says Chad. ""You're either Omega Beta or your a freak"".I think that exchange sums up the series of misunderstanding that plagues the group of college students during the entire film. The college characters were quick to assume and judge based upon surface details. I feel that Eli Craig was cautioning those who are quick to make snappy assumptions based upon only what the eye can see.Whether or not ""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" will teach you the significance of getting to know you're fellow man, it will certainly entertain. The film is a blast from fade in to fade out and full of fun, to boot. I highly recommend this title for anyone wanting a break from your typical horror movie slasher.""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" certainly spins a healthy alternative to the excessively worn Slasher sub-genre of horror and even leaves something for the audience to critically think about after the credits roll.Believe it or not, there is even evidence of Rom-Com formula in this movie, so it is definitely couple approved. Now when was the last time a horror movie had all of the above? For all of my fellow gore-hounds, don't expect any Fulci or Jackson splatter, not even on the levels of ""Shaun of the Dead"". This film is tame by those standards, but the ""money-shots"" do exist. Woodchipper = Awesome!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tucker and Dale Vs. Awesomeness,"Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil is one of those movies in which it seems like you either like it or hate it. I do think they should have promoted this movie more, because it deserved it. This was a very engrossing, entertaining little movie. Yes, it could be forgettable for some, but in my mind, I will try not to forget.This movie is about two hill billy friends named Tucker and Dale who have just rented a cabin for the summers. They try to have the best summer ever. But one day when they go fishing, they see these college students skinny dipping. One college girl slips off a rock and bangs her head. Dale swims to the rescue is saves her. They bring her back to the cabin, which I should mention is in the woods. The college kids however think they are kidnapping her, so they go out and try to kill the two dumb hill billies and save their friend.This was a very fun and entertaining movie, as I said. The moral of the story is quite obvious. I loved the different types of coincidences there are in this movie. They make funny of most horror movies. This movie has intentional bad, over the top acting which you can not get over. A well executed, well established comedy movie. Most people won't give this a chance because they think it is dumb or that it looks like your usual, terrible, wannabe movie. Yet, it isn't. It is a fun, campy comedy.

A horrifically funny horror comedy,"It's not all about The Cabin In The Woods. 2 years previously, this under-appreciated horror comedy with what might be an even smarter premise came out and it deserves just as much attention. Tucker And Dale Vs. Evil centres on 2 red necks who a group of teens assume are murderers. When they rescue one of them, the teenagers think they're villains and then when the teens start trying to attack them they keep having accidents and a series of horribly unfortunate misunderstandings occur. This time, the victims are the villains. It's such a clever idea it's surprising no-one attempted it before. It feels a little slight, so this reduces its impact since in terms of scale it's a pretty small movie. Also, it's ludicrous and can repeat itself a bit too much, but don't let that put you off. On Netflix UK's awful horror film selection, there thankfully is a genuinely good horror film aside from Carrie and one or 2 other things. TADVE is great fun for horror fans, and certainly a lot more fun than watching many horror films.The film offers plenty of goofy, gory thrills and can be suspenseful, although always in a light hearted way. Despite the endlessly relaxed tone there are plenty of moderately scary moments. It's also incredibly funny, and the laughs don't really stop flowing even if certain jokes are reused more than they should be. It's original and highly clever, and while it's a film that relies on coincidences, it's so much fun you just don't care. This is a pretty gory movie, but it's not mean spirited at all. The most unexpected surprise is that the film has some nice messages about self esteem, and there's a genuinely touching romance in the centre of the film. I certainly wasn't expecting that at all, and that's why it comes so highly recommended. It may have buckets of blood, but it never feels mean spirited. It's a very fun horror comedy which deserves more attention than it gets. Seriously, give this one a look.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A horror/comedy about a big misunderstand and it really really works,"This movie is most definitely a movie that should have been marketed right even if it's low budget. It's a low budget movie done right, just about everyone of the elements in this movie works. The mix of comedic and horror is blended just right. I like how the generic creepy hillbillies is the heroes this time around, well sort of. The bonding aspect of the movie is another good thing about this movie, it just seemed like they accomplished a certain tasks in a funny manner together in a way where it seemed like the characters connect with each other. In another words it's a kickass bromance flick with comedy and horror. And like I said just about every element in this movie works. I especially liked how it made fun of the stereotypical hillbilly horror flicks and the cliché way it's perceived in most films and sort of made a homage of it and it's really funny. The plot in this is about two friendly hillbillies that get targeted by bunch of college students because of a big misunderstanding. I liked this hillbilly duo a lot in this movie and would look forward to seeing them work together on other projects. The moral of this movie is don't be judgmental cause it can lead to stupidity. Anyways the way it makes fun of the generic hillbilly horror movies is actually cleverly done and well crafted. To the point while watching you can't help but anxiously wait for the next punchline to come cause it really hits the spot.

However, it does not take long at all to turn into the comedy it truly is.What a fresh take on putting a lot of horror movie cliché's to such comedic use! There are a lot of laugh out very loud moments throughout, and both Tyler Labine & Alan Tudyk do not disappoint!The rest of the cast (at least 2 of which are also main characters) does a wonderful job rounding out the whole experience. ""College kids go on a camping trip in the woods"" gets revitalized in the telling of this tale!It also does follow plenty of other previously tried and true formulas, and again, turns them on their ear - from hillbillies, spooky settings, isolation, and even romance. If you've seen your share (or at least heard about) many previous horror movie scenario's, you will find plenty to laugh at as all are taken and twisted into great comedy.Again, watch this movie....and have yourself a Doozy of a day!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Heartwarming Comedy Horror...,"I watched this movie for one reason and one reason only, because the copy i had was a work print. I find the movie making process fascinating and watching a movie before the effects are added is quite entertaining in itself. But despite being completely unfinished sfx wise, i couldn't of loved this absolute gem of a movie anymore. It's gore, comedy and heartwarming all in one.The basis of the movie is college kids camping in the back woods and mistakenly thinking that two lovable holidaying hillbillies (Tucker and Dale) are psychotic axe wielding killers (stereotyping). And of course are out to get them.After saving one of the kids from drowning and taking her back to their holiday home (shack) comedy and gore ensues. As Tucker and Dale wait for the college kids to come collect their friend, the college kids are convinced she's been kidnapped and will be killed. The situation leads to a series of bizarre and hilarious events, with poor old Tucker and Dale totally oblivious to what is going on.This movie is a comedy must, if you like laughing watch this.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious Horror Comedy,"When I first watched this movie I had no idea what it was about going into it, and I'm really glad that I did. This movie hits the ground running right away setting the tone for the perfect mix of comedy and horror.Without giving up too much about the plot, the scenarios the main characters keep finding themselves in are just comedy gold.However, if you're looking for a movie that will actually scare you, this isn't quite the movie. After finishing the movie I'd have to say this is 80% comedy and 20% horror.If you're looking for a good laugh and can handle a bit of gore, this movie will be up your alley.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Tucker & Dale Vs Evil,"A bit of a breath of fresh air is this in a low budget and yet well produced comedy horror that gives Død Snø and the likes a run for their money. Tucker & Dale Vs Evil follows two redneck hillbillies- Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) who head into the woods in the Appellation Mountains so that they can drink some beers, do some fishing and fix up a worn down cabin to turn it into the holiday home of their dreams.At the same time a group of preppy college kids are on a camping trip into the same woods also to have a good time. After a couple of run ins with the hillbillies, they assume that they must be your stereotypical inbred manic chainsaw wielding killers right out of Deliverance or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So when one of the kids Allison (Katrina Bowden) is rescued from drowning by the hillbillies, prejudice and paranoia reign supreme with the others mistaking it as her being hauled away in a kidnapping attempt. So they embark on a mission to rescue her from her saviours with hilarious consequences.Despite the premise of the movie being based on one long running joke of a massive misunderstanding, the story remains fresh and the scenes extremely funny for the majority. I'm not aware of any other movie that has done this type of role reversal with hillbillies in this type of scenario and managed to blend in the right amount of comedy with horror and gore. In fact across all the genres, it is not often that you get to see the perspective of the 'bad guys' (far from it in this film).The best moments come from the writing as we follow the bickering between Tucker and Dale as a bromance emerges on screen. Both Tudyk (aka Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball) and Labine impress making the characters extremely likable and charming so that by the end you really do care what happens to them. Bowden plays her part solidly as well and definitely brings some eye candy to the film! Most of these types of films tend to lose their drama element but this keeps the anticipation and as I said, you end up really caring about what is going to happen to the characters. However, the only major fault that I can pick out is that despite all this, it does begin to fade as a spectacle in the last 15 minutes as they focus a bit too much on the back story and tying up loose ends when what they were doing up to that point was more than enough in my books.It's usually hard to combine the right amount of comedy and horror without creating a somewhat tacky result so credit must go to the new guy on the block- director and co-writer Eli Craig. If you are looking for a unique comedy horror that has a chance of hitting cult status/topping Shaun of the Dead then you need look no further than this.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice change,I was not expecting a lot and normally don't like comedy horror. I don't think they go together. But I was pleasantly surprised I thought this was pretty good. People who say they are turning it off after ten minutes are missing the point. It is taking the Mick out of the 80s slasher and does it pretty darn well. Yes it's a little silly in places yes it's daft in others but it's a comedy horror after all. The chemistry is there between the two characters and the collage kids are suppose to be stupid and annoying. Give it a try with an open mind and just enjoy something a little different for a change.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A minor work of genius and a definite keeper for the collection,"There is no genre so loathsome or guaranteed to make me roll my eyes and change channels than the American horror/comedy. The last work of any value here was probably the original _Re-Animator_ (tt0089885) with the prize tag-team of Stuart Gordon and Jeffrey Combs.I reluctantly gave this flick a chance, it was on late night teevee and there was nothing else whatsoever on offer, and I expected the absolute rock bottom worst - sophomoric, predictable tripe a la _Scary Movie_.What I got was _Scary Movie_'s absolute polar opposite - a slick, clever and thigh-slappingly, hysterically funny splatter fest. T&D vs. Evil takes the conventional ""stupid teenagers head to the woods and run into hillbilly serial killers"" slasher theme and turns it completely on its head. I won't say any more. This is one of those films where the less you know the better. Very, very highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolute gem!,"It's not often I write reviews but this movie is an under appreciated gem! Hilariously funny, novel take on the serial killer horror sub-genre, and fantastic characters. The final act left something to be desired hence the 8/10 but up to that point I was in hysterics. A must watch for fans of gory comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Surprised,"I decided to see this title expecting maybe a laugh or 2 and not much more. It turned out that I laughed through most of it. Alan Tudyk & Tyler Labine do a great job as Tucker and Dale, playing the hillbilly ""heroes"" They work well together and this chemistry absolutely adds to the fun in this film. The beautiful Katrina Bowden who plays Allison had me laughing with her anti-climatic, level-headed character no matter how much horror and mayhem is going on around her. Lastly Jesse Moss who plays Chad had me giggling and simultaneously rolling my eyes at his over-acting as the self-proclaimed ""leader"" of the band of college kids. Corny, campy fun from beginning to end. I definitely would recommend this to people that are willing to not take anything about this movie seriously.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazingly Funny!,"I LOVED this film. I really did! This has to be one of the funniest films I have seen in ages - well, the first 45 minutes of it, anyway. After that, although the film was still great, the humour became a little darker as the plot {???!!} took shape. I've got to admit that by this time I had absolutely no idea where this was going or how it could all end....However, I wasn't disappointed with the ending - as is so often the case with these sort of films. All too often, with a film like this, we are left hanging at the end with most of it unexplained. But here all the strings of the plot were drawn together neatly and I'm pleased to say that there were no questions left unanswered.Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk were amazing and even though I'd never even heard of either of them before this I am now a fan.And for those of you who (like me!!) hate gory horror I can truthfully say that all though it WAS gory, it was so incredibly funny that the horror didn't matter at all. Suffice to say that my 'scary cushion' (for over my eyes) was not used once! So all in all a great night's entertainment and definitely one to watch with friends.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

An horror comedy/parody that works,"'Tucker & Dale vs Evil' is a really good satire of the hillbilly subgenre of horror films. In this subgenre, we often find ourselves with psycho, often inbred, serial-killing rednecks chasing young people in the woods (i.e..: 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'). In 'Tucker & Dale', the title characters are actually good guys on a vacation, who are targeted by young college kids who mistake them as stereotypical psychos.The premise works just like one would expect after thinking it over. Very funny, full of references to the subgenre, death scenes that really pay off, but its quality starts dropping after a while. It needs to rely too much on comedy-of-errors and coincidences, plot devices that end up being recycled/repeated to the point of getting tired. By the time it ends, it got too repetitive to work as well as it did near its beginning.Yet, despite its predictable unsustainability, the final product is so well executed it takes a long while for the quality drop; the main duo, Alan Tudyk (Tucker) and Tyler Labine (Dale), are excellent and one of the mains reasons this happens, being both very likable and funny as the straight-mans.The character of Chad (Jesse Moss; a sociopath proper boy), though a reasonable poking at a few horror clichés, is one of the weakest points of the film. Likewise, the romantic subplot between Dale and Allison (Katrina Bowden), while quite likable and even funny, tended to get a bit too sentimental in the latter portion of the film.Rather than an all-out parody, like the 'Scary Movie' franchise, 'Tucker & Dale vs Evil' bets on actual tale-telling. The premise predictably loses some power later in the film, but it still delivers nicely in a fun and satisfying way.Another complaint I have is the spoiler in the title.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Great Treat for Horror Fans,"Not many films manage your expectations quite like Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. This 2010 offering turned the horror genre on its head with its hilarious POV gag and career-defining performances from Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine. Sure, it's campy. It's silly. It's kind of predictable. But the scenes themselves - especially the horror-filled elements - keep the audience in on the joke the whole time. There is also a softer side to the film; what it means to be misunderstood, the pitfalls and pigeonholes of a class system, and the quaint but unattainable dreams of rural Americans just struggling to get by.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I am gonna say that if you were a fan of movies like Army of Darkness, Shawn of the Dead, and movies along that genre, you will absolutely be floored by this movie, it made me laugh hard, and cheer, which is something I haven't done while watching a movie in quite a while.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun and entertaining genre film,"It's time for an indie movie review! What do you get when you mix classic gore/slasher elements with a comedy? Usually something pretty godawful and not worth mentioning here or anywhere else. However, sometimes, the slasher/comedy combo can be pulled off competently. Please note that all of the ""Scary movie"" entries are complete and utter failures and I have no idea how they made 4 of the damned things, the first one wasn't even that funny.Fortunately I am glad to report that Tucker & Dale is a success story for slasher/comedy combos. Now admittedly I am getting to this movie a bit late, it was making the indie circuit about this time last year. However, indie films are a little quirky in when and where they're released (reference similar issues I had with Boondock Saints II). But happy days are here and I found this little gem amongst a rather large pile of dross whilst wandering through the cavernous expanse of the interblag...blag.....blag.....blag (this joke would probably be a lot funnier if I had audio, but I refuse to let you people hear my actual voice, sounds terrible over a mic).So what makes Tucker & Dale a success? If I had to pin it on any single element of the production, it would be that the story at its core is quite simple: a single misunderstanding explodes completely out of proportion. There's no sleight of hand and no fancy tricks, just stupid people making assumptions based on fear. Now there's plenty of gore, but the way it ends up happening is actually pretty inventive and I won't spoil anything, but I think its good to see classic slapstick reapplied to the horror genre. God knows it needs an overhaul in the creativity department these days.So anyhow, good fun romp, see it if you can. It will likely be available on netflix in the coming months.Peace out everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Bloody and a little cussy, but outrageous fun","I got wind of this movie from searching comedies IMDb top 1000 from 1995 onward. Something about the reviews impressed me more than usual. So glad I took a look. Very funny. I noticed some comments referring to the trailers. I hope the trailers didn't spoil the first scene were Dale is trying to make it with the college girl. That would be a shame. That's about the funniest movie scene I've ever seen. Better than anything from Woody Allen's early days. All you need to know is what's going on and a still picture from the perspective/view of the college girl. That should be in a movie poster, but not in a trailer. I don't think what I've said is a spoiler because it just tells you that it's very funny. Now that you know, maybe you won't die laughing and miss the rest of the movie. Otherwise... I enjoyed the romance. Did not enjoy the gore, but I suppose most people would consider it faky. Didn't like the foul language, but it wasn't pervasive. Like the synopsis says, this movie is a great twist on the worn out horror movie so often featuring inbred, chainsaw wielding hillbillies. Maybe it would have been more popular if they had named it something like ""College Kids Gone Wild"" instead of featuring the downtrodden hillbillies. Whether or not the fault was marketing, it's a downright shame this here movie was overlooked.In case it helps, other comedies I enjoy... Just Like Heaven (2005), Blazing Saddles (1974), Mars Attacks! (1996), Anchorman (2004) up until near the end, Caddyshack (1980), Dumb & Dumber (1994), Idiocracy (2006), Intolerable Cruelty (2003), Men in Black (1997).

Great Movie,Tucker and Dale vs Evil was a great movie. I loved the way the story was told from the perspective of Tucker and Dale. This made it quite funny how things started happening to them and they couldn't figure out why. Made it more of a comedy horror then a scary movie. In my opinion that is a lot more entertaining. The effects in it were well done especially for an indie movie. I'm surprised that it hasn't made more money then it did with it being so well done and loved by fans. I'd say the movie is a similar sort of genre as the British film Shaun of the Dead. You knew something was going to happen but not the way that this unfolded. A must see movie if you like comedy mixed with blood and guts. Although the very end was a little disappointing how it all turned out. Otherwise a very good film.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I was expecting much actually thought that I wouldn't even finish watching it. But to my surprise this was a pretty good movie. It's basically a spoof on teenagers vs hillbillies in woods. But Tucker and Dale are two good natured that so bright buddies going to their fixer-upper vocation home when encounter some spoiled and judgemental college students camping in the same area. During the two groups first encounter the college kids assume that Tucker and Dale are the stereotypical redneck serial killers.

The couple of rednecks (played beautifully by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) who are just wanting to get away on vacation in their cabin in the woods. But comes along the college kids looking to party out in the woods and believes they are not who they seem. That is when the chaos ensues, believing the rednecks to be in-bred hillbilly killers.

I have re-watched this film numerous times and still find it as funny as the first time. If you are not into gore and blood you will not much enjoy the film much, but I do know people who are against death/gore/violence and have stated that this film was very clever and hilarious.

Funny if slightly overrated horror/comedy,"Heading out to the woods, a group of college kids think the actions of a pair of lonely hillbillies is the work of deranged killers and tries to fend off their attacks to the complete befuddlement of the two guys.While there's a lot to like about this one, there's still a couple of overwhelming flaws here that does hinder this one somewhat. One of the biggest is the fact that this one tends to go overboard in trying to set-up the mistake about what they're doing to the point of total overkill and excess. While a lot of this is due to the completely unrealistic attempts to persuade the others that they're indeed psycho killers based on a back-story that's utterly ridiculous in it's own right, that's still no excuse for the excessive amount of time this one spends trying to hammer home the fact that the kids are wrong and jumping to conclusions about their intentions by utilizing some of the weirdest and most contrived scenarios to backfire at just the right moment to appear otherwise that they're right all along, and eventually this gets a little old as anyone with half a clue about anything makes the continuous mistakes about this. Otherwise, this here is a lot of fun with the fact that as a comedy this tends to get a lot right. The main point about this one is the rather naive business surrounding their good intentioned past that makes for a slew of incredibly hilarious situations here that manage to build quite a healthy backdrop here for the continuous mistakes to come forth. It builds them almost like a farce in the sense of each scenario seemingly fine in their viewpoint yet taken to a darker tone on their side, and the results nearly always hit their mark here with pretty hilarious scenes constantly involved. The darker tone they appropriate to it tends to allow this the sense of some pretty suspenseful moments from time-to-time as there's a lot of rather fine slasher moments here from the encounter at the lake to the first assault on the shack and finally the finale at the abandoned mine which is quite a bit fun with some rather tense moments, a dark revelation that comes to pass and plenty of action to really end this one on a positive note. Otherwise, it's really just the one flaw that keeps this down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Revenge of the hillbillies ...,"Good horror-comedies are a rare find. It's not that there aren't many out there (""Cabin in the Woods,"" ""Tremors,"" and ""American Werewolf in London"" come to mind), it's just that there aren't many horror-comedies to choose from, period. Very likely it's not an easy exercise for filmmakers to balance comedy with scares/gore in a compelling way.""Tucker and Dale"" is one of the better ones that turns the backwoods/hillbilly/Texas Chainsaw formula on its head to hilarious results.

Epic deaths in hilarious fashion,"I really enjoy this movie, is it a classic? No. But it does have some laugh out moments. I really like Tyler Labine from Reaper, he's funny without even trying. Tudyk does a great job as well as the supporting cast. Some of the death scenes are absolutely hilarious, the wood chipper, LOL. My only complaint is it really drags to an ending.

This vacation sucks.,"I absolutely love Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. This was one of those films that I thought I probably wouldn't like, but in the end I couldn't get enough. Eli Craig came up with one of the most original horror comedy concepts, and put it to the screen in perfection.The whole cast was great, but it was Tyler Labine, and Alan Tudyk's portrayal of the two misunderstood hillbillies mistaken for backwoods serial killers that really make the movie. The jokes are silly but hilarious, it's fast paced and doesn't drag along, and the overall movie is just completely enjoyable.If you haven't seen this film before, I would highly recommend checking it out, because it's one movie you definitely won't forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clever and fun!,"I wasn't sure what to expect by the title or synopsis, but it was a great surprise and nifty take on the typical ""teens in peril in the woods"" genre.Completely original idea even as it closely follows the specific tropes associated with this type of film.The characters are perfectly cast and I enjoyed the vulnerability and nuance of the leads, particularly Dale.The twist at the end would lead one to believe a sequel could be considered, but most movies of this nature contain some hint of that element.I would recommend this film for the crafty script, the well-acted characters and the element of horror with an ironic twist.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you liked Shaun of The Dead or Hot Fuzz you need to watch this.,"I was at my local blockbuster(movie rental service) when i was first recommended this movie, i passed it by because it was an unknown and how much i regret that.I was reminded when i was browsing LOVEFiLM on the xbox that it might be worth a watch. This comedy horror is up there with the classic Shaun of The Dead.Its starts slowly building the characters and bringing the story together. This passed me by at first but looking back it was a really effective at giving you detail on the characters. The movie doesn't get really hilarious until about half way through but after that point you just don't stop laughing at how the movie unfolds. The one-liners are hilarious.The whole concept is genius and the director/co-writer deserves recognition in making sure this movie has gotten out after numerous blocks. It really deserved a theatre release. Im writing this review in hope someone will decide to watch it because it really is worth your time if you enjoyed other similar films like Shaun of the Dead it wont disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

If you go down to the woods today be sure for a big surprise!,"If truth be told, I didn't think that I was going to like Tucker & Dale Vs Evil. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that it looked like a dumb and forced horror comedy in the vein of Scary Movie. However, I had heard a lot of positive reviews so I thought that I'd give it a go. The opening was a little lame and then we get introduced to some truly horrendous characters who are obviously played for laughs. I was beginning to lose faith, right up until Tucker and Dale were introduced.For some reason I thought that the film was about two dumb redneck psychopaths killing some teens. However, what makes the film so clever, unique and funny is that it's not about that at all. Instead it's about two lovable rednecks who get themselves into a lot of farcical situations by mistake. You could hardly call it a slasher film. It's more like a horror romcom with a feel good ending to die for.I laughed throughout Tucker and Dale. It reminded me of Hatchet, only this is far better and funnier, and I really like Hatchet for the record! I watched this on my own and found myself laughing out loud and quite hard too! It reminded me of Miranda sometimes in how everything builds from one misunderstanding to another. The plot is really stupid, but the film knows that and it plays with it in a very clever way offering plenty of sly nods to horror fans who are all too familiar with these types of plots.What makes the film though is it's brilliant characters. You can't help but fall in love with Dale who's so kind and self-depreciating. He's completely different to Tucker who's louder and more amoral, but this makes their relationship that much sweeter. I also loved Allison, the slasher character who normally stays as the drop-dead-gorgeous girl at the back and gets killed quite early on, who turns out to be a sweet and very likable main girl. The rest of the college kids are disposable but purposefully so, apart from the hugely dislikeable psychopath, Chad.Most of all though Tucker and Dale is just bloody good fun to watch. It's a great film to watch with some friends round. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it does take itself seriously enough to give us an endlessly witty and intelligent screenplay, lovable characters and just an all-round good quality film. Some scenes are also really heartfelt which I wasn't expecting. I also loved the infectiously feel good ending which left me grinning ear to ear. This film was such a wonderful surprise to me. I was really expecting to dislike it, but now it's probably one of my favourite horror-comedies. Give it a chance. Only the most stone-hearted person with no sense of humour could hate this.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Absolute laugh riot,"As a fan of horror films I tend not to watch 'comedy' horrors, as they tend not to be either funny or scary . The Scary Movie franchise being the main offender.Tucker and Dale, on the other hand, is the exception to the rule!It's a kind of throwback to the days of Friday The 13th. Kids out camping in the woods, a couple of local rednecks scaring them and then everything gets out of hand, and someone gets chopped in half. That kind of thing. The difference with this film is that Tucker and Dale, whilst being the 'rednecks' we expect to appear in these kind of films, are actually just 2 nice guys who are doing some repairs to a cabin one of them owns. In a chain of misunderstandings the gang of kids suspect that Tucker and Dale have kidnapped and murdered their friend. The truth is however that the girl fell and was drowning when Tucker and Dale rescued her and took her to safety.The rest of the film is the kids' attempt to kill Tucker and Dale whilst attempting to rescue their friend. But the kids are as inept at killing as the guys are of explaining themselves.It's a great film, lots of laughs and a couple of gross out moments. I was pleasantly surprised and I suspect anyone else who watches this will be too.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Surprisingly Fun,"It's a horror movie, but not quite, with a lot of humor and a little bit of heart. That is the easiest way for me to describe Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. It's a delightfully fun take on a backwoods redneck slasher movietold from the perspective of two rednecks, who want to do nothing more, than to fix up their new summer cabin and do some fishing. Unfortunately, this plan is disturbed by a group of college kids armed with nothing but alcohol and their own fears. What ensues is a laugh out loud gorishly twisted take on slasher movies. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine play the characters of Tucker and Dale respectively and the viewer is absorbed into their simple lives of beer and fishing. Tudyk continues to impress me with all the many different roles and comedic characters he has adopted in his career. It is a very gory movie, but done in such a playful way it is hard not to laugh. For any fans of the horror genre, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a fun time that prods at other slasher flicks based on stupid college kids go into the woods.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun Horror/Comedy That Plays with Troupes,"This film was one that I blinded checked out while I was working at Family Video. At that time I would randomly take home films that were coming out to see if I could find diamonds in the rough. I know after that first viewing I enjoyed it, but then the more I heard about it, the more I wanted to give it a second viewing. I checked this out at the time with my girlfriend during October as I thought it would be a fun film as she's still fairly new to the genre. There has now been a third viewing for the Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Challenge Series for the 2010s. The synopsis is affable hillbillies Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) are on vacation at their dilapidated cabin when they're mistaken for murderers by a group of preppy college students.We begin with a film crew going into a building. We learn that it is an active crime scene and the cameraman is scared. The reporter mocks him, but then they're attacked by someone with half of their face burned. We then cut to the past to see what led us here.We follow a group of college students as they head for the wilderness of West Virginia for a camping trip. The guys are all in a fraternity together and led by Chad (Jesse Moss). The problem with him is that he thinks he's better than everyone. His girlfriend is there, Allison (Katrina Bowden). His frat brothers along are Jason (Brandon Jay McLaren), Chuck (Travis Nelson), Todd (Alex Arsenault) and Mitch (Adam Beauchesne). Also along are Naomi (Christie Laing) and Chloe (Chelan Simmons).On their drive, they almost collide with a truck that belongs to two rednecks with the driver being Dale and the heavier one is Tucker. We see that they are actually fairly intelligent and actually Tucker is kind of genius because he remembers everything he hears. They're on their way to a cabin they just purchased as their vacation home.Both groups meet up at the store and the college kids think these two country folk are creepy. Tucker falls for Allison immediately as she's the most beautiful girl he's ever seen. He tries to talk to her, but fumbles over his words. This infuriates Chad who goes off and they leave. The Sheriff (Philip Granger) pulls over the duo and he doesn't like the looks of the two. He tells them they should go back home.Chad actually hates rednecks and tells the group the story of a massacre that occurred where they are in the past. Tucker and Dale arrive at their cabin and go about fixing it up. That night they go fishing in the same lake the college students go skinny dipping. The two see them and spook Allison. This causes her to fall off a rock and she hits her head, knocking her out. The rest of her group sees them taking her and think they're kidnapping the unconscious woman.They then attempt to save her, but they're quite unlucky and start to kill themselves in some pretty crazy ways. Chad and the surviving members though think it is Tucker and Dale killing them. They want revenge and to save Allison. It appears though there's more to this story than what Chad shared, plus there's a side to it that he has no idea about either.Now if you've read reviews I've wrote in the past, you know that I'm not always the biggest fan of horror comedies. Looking back on what I originally wrote, I've definitely changed quite a bit, because I really like this one actually. It has such an interesting concept and how things play out is great.Something that I want to point out is the changing of roles here. Chad and the frat brothers think they're better because they're in college and they just have that 'bro' feel to them. That's not new. What is interesting though is that Tucker is actually a genius and both he and Dale are really nice guys. They're not actually trying to hurt them, which you don't normally see in films like this. The movie really is playing on the hixploitation sub-genre. It is also funny that Allison is going to school to be a therapist because she feels like a lot of problems are caused by a lack of communication, which is exactly what is happening here. This definitely adds to comedy.I want to shift to the effects next so I can talk about the deaths. Some of them are hilarious to me and just how seeing things from both sides, you can understand why there's fear. If either side would just communicate, a lot of things could be avoided. This includes falling into a wood chipper or impaling themselves on a spear. The thing is, I know there's CGI here, but it is blended so well with the practical effects. It definitely looks real and the film is shot in way that definitely helps for sure.Moving next the pacing, this movie has a runtime of 89 minutes and it is perfect. We get that cold open to this before shifting to meeting our characters. It doesn't waste any time to show to show that the college kids fear and hate the rednecks, even though there's no reason to. It is playing with stereotypes and I'm sure movies like Deliverance. People start to die afterwards and the comedy is throughout. Something interesting though is that the comedy really doesn't hurt this film for me. I think because Chad is so evil, it really makes you wonder if the heroes will be able to defeat him. The irony is that he thinks Tucker and Dale are the ones who are pure evil. The ending also works for me, even though it is a bit sappy. I still like it though.As for the acting, I actually think it is great. I became a fan of Labine after this one and would watch most everything he was in because of it. He's an awkward, big, lovable teddy bear around Allison and it's adorable. Tudyk is solid in his performance. He's just a solid actor. I fell in love with Bowden after seeing here her. She's beautiful and her performance was solid. Moss does really well at being a jerk as well. It grows into straight evil the more we learn about him which works. I thought the rest of the cast rounded this film out for what was needed. It was also fun seeing Simmons who has done a few movies in the genre.Now with that said, I liked this the first time I saw and I like it even more after this second viewing. Being that this is comedy, it still actually works as a horror film. There's an interesting concept that we see played out in films like Wrong Turn or Deliverance and playing with the troupes. The acting is really good across the board and I think the pacing is solid as well. The effects were good with a blend of CGI and practical. The soundtrack really didn't stand out to me. It does fit for what is needed though. If you're looking for a horror comedy, this is definitely on my short list of recommendations. Overall I'd say this is a good movie for sure.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Glad I find this movie.,"This movie is really very enjoyable with a great funny plot. Allison, Chad, Chloe, Chuck, Jason, Naomi, Todd, Mitch and Mike are going camping in West Virginia. While at a gas station, they encounter Tucker and Dale, two well-meaning hillbillies who have just bought the vacation home of their dreams: a run-down lakefront cabin, deep in the woods. On Tucker's advice, Dale tries to talk to Allison, but because of his inferiority complex and appearance, he only scares her and her friends.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Irony in Horror,"Tucker and Dale vs Evil is by far the most ironic horror movie in this current century. Similar to movies like the Scary Movie series, we see Alan Tudyk as Tucker, and Tyler Labine as Dale, two hillbillies who give a great laugh along with an interesting story.
The story everyone in the film knows of is the Memorial Day Weekend Massacre, when a group of Hillbillies brutally murdered clueless college teenagers in the woods for their pure entertainment. It's a story that haunts many, especially those who lost someone in it. Enter Tucker and Dale, two average Hillbillies who simply drink beer and want to renovate the cabin in the woods (yes a film reference) they bought for a summer home. Follow suit comes along a group of stupid teenagers who see them renovating the land with many potential murder weapons that weren't meant to be murder weapons. Being clueless, stupid, and straight up pretentious, they decide they must defeat their ""dangerous"" foes for the greater good. This leads to a series of ridiculous deaths that are head scratchers, but simply too funny not to laugh at.
Aspects of this film that make you enjoy it most is the plot itself, along with fun dialogue and great characters. As described earlier, the plot leaves you with a fun story that integrates horror movie aspects without having any actual horror in it. You see references from movies like Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw, and many more. It creates a sense of respect from the Director Eli Craig, who's known to be an avid Horror movie genre fan. Along with the plot comes great dialogue, which is delivered almost effortlessly by the main characters of the film. Speaking of main characters, we have four great characters: Tucker (played by Alan Tudyk), Dale (played by Tyler Labine), Alison (played by Katrina Bowden), and finally, Chad (played by Jesse Moss). These four are supported with other characters who are great at playing roles of stupid college kids, which helps find the balance of the cast in the end.
A movie with a low budget that simply wanted to pay homage to many other horror films by creating a plot so stupid, that it's great. Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a film to watch with good friends and have a great laugh at without actually getting scared, but also being able to acknowledge the fun in it. It is a film you will likely enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Surprisingly great stuff!,"It's best to approach Tucker and Dale vs. Evil on a whim. Having previously watched horrors like Wrong Turn and The Hills Have Eyes will add significant satire. Tucker (Tudyk) and Dale (Labine) are your average red-necks; harmless on the inside even if a little intimidating on the outside. They're on vacation at their new 'cabin in the woods'. Travelling in their proximity is a group of college kids who think Tucker and Dale mean them harm. The key message here is to not judge a book by its cover. The preppy youngsters attack the hillbilly duo because they think they're attacking them. The events that unfold thereafter mock all serious gore films. It's genuinely funny, sporting the look of a horror and the feel of a comedy. The freak accidents threatening to kill off all the preps will have you in stitches, whilst Tucker and Dale are blissfully (or stupidly) unaware of how bad things are getting.

We ain't got the regular here,"I had the pleasure of seeing this on demand using the Xbox Live: Zune Marketplace. Some independent films, that aren't going or are going to very limited theaters, release their films on demand to outlets like Zune, DirecTV, and Pay-Per View to try and get more money before the DVD comes out. I've seen numerous films on Zune like Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, Red State, and many others. It's a very nice privilege to see something you can't in theaters.I praise this new on demand feature because many of the independent films I've seen off of it deserve to have a wide release, but don't get one. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is truly a great, fresh look at comedy/horror as it parodies cabin style horror films like Cabin Fever, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It does it with a good sense of gore and a good sense of humor. Both combinations duplicated a lot in modern horror, but many fail to succeed.The plot: Tucker (Tudyk) and Dale (Levine) are two backwoods-hillbillies that are as simple as can be. They buy their ""dreamhouse"" in the middle of the woods, which is just a beaten up shack. They are satisfied, and want to fix the house up to fulfill their long time dream.Meanwhile, a group of College kids travel up to the same woods to drink, party, and skinny-dip in a swamp in the middle of the night. Tucker and Dale go swimming late at night when they see a girl, in her bra and underwear, about to jump into swampy water. Because girls love to strip down to nothing in the middle of the woods to go skinny-dipping. Seeing Tucker and Dale surprises her and she falls backwards hitting her head.Tucker and Dale rescue her, and try to alert the group of kids by saying ""We got your friend"" which only achieves scaring the kids and having them run for the hills. The remainder is a series of misunderstandings with the hillbillies looking like serial killers, and the College kids trying to rescue their friend. The misunderstandings aren't very far-fetched, and they almost have a Final Destination appearance to them of people unintentionally dying.Being that this film is sort of the first of its kind, it doesn't have a formula and had to be designed by screenwriters Eli Craig and Morgan Jurgenson. It works. The combinations of gore, humor, and scares are all put into very fair and balanced doses. The film is never cocky, and is always fast-paced and entertaining.Independent horror films will more than likely dominate the growing market. Modern horror films aren't going anywhere but back to the past, and even some former limited release films like Paranormal Activity are being blown out of proportion with sequels and budget-increases. Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is as innocent as its title characters - but they continue to deliver edgy laughs and scares.Starring: Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine. Directed by: Eli Craig.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A funny horror parody,"Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a horror-comedy that quickly developing a cult following and there is good reason as it takes on and subvert the clichés of the slasher genre and twists them into something new.Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) are two hillibillies who have just brought a vacation home in the mountains of West Virginia and go there to fix it up, despite not seeing the strange iconography in the house. A group of college kids also go to the mountains to go camp and they imminently distrust the hillibiillies and through a series of misunderstanding think they are slasher killers, especially after they save one of them, Ally (Katrina Bowden). Most of the students want to go to the police, but their Chad (Jesse Moss) has a deep-seeded hatred towards hilibillies and wants to go war with the pair.Tucker and Dale vs. Evil two main jokes, it is a series of misunderstanding and role reverses: but it does both of them very well. It is clear the filmmakers have a lot of knowledge of the horror genre and wanted to parody the genre. The role reversal was very well handled, that it was the college kid that was psycho-killer and the hillibillies are the protagonists. Tucker and Dale are made out to be likable guys and the college kids are actually aware of the situation and want to do the logical thing: go away and get the police but are led array by someone with serious psychological issues.There are many different types of humour through the film. Besides from the satire and parody of the horror genre there is also plenty of violence slapstick as people start dying in very fun ways and there were also a lot of good dialogue and verbal jokes (my personal favourite involved a gun).Tudyk and Labine have shown themselves to be capable actors in previous roles and they had great chemistry together. They did feel like there were friends for years and were likable enough presence on screen. Bowden and Moss were decent enough in their roles, but the rest of the college kids were bad: my theory was that it was deliberate so that the film can play on the fact slashers have bad actors but the teens in this film act more realistically.At 86 minutes the running time is very short, even for a horror film. Director Eli Craig does a great job at moving the film forward, making sure there is no fat and keeps a scene of fun throughout, even when the film is not being a horror or comedy film, i.e. the final climax.Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a fun film as a comedy but truly shines as a parody of the horror/slasher genre. Horror fans and people with a slightly darker sense but there is plenty for people to enjoy because of the comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Slasher Comedy!,"This is one of the best Slasher/Horror Comedy ever made. All of the three elements are of a constant environment in this amazing movie.The story is of Tucker and Dale who go onto enjoy their vacation home which they recently bought. Meanwhile, a group of college kids is doing their adventure things near the vacation home. The story is basically a misunderstanding between the two groups and the byproduct is this funny movie.All of the characters are funny, memorable, and true to their instincts.

"Honestly, surprisingly fantastic","At first glance it may seem unappealing. It's obviously a sort of black comedy that's a satire of a horror film. Been there, done that. But, good God is this better than the usual ""scary movie"" trope. It completely turns the genre of horror on its head. When you expect to see the usual you see the opposite. This is satire at it's peak. Each usual trope played to the max and the general theme of horror movies reversed. It seems to be such an underrated film. It's funny in a non-campy way. It's gory in a sense that only plays to the satire. It's romantic in a way that fits the message and theme of the movie while still adhearing to the overplayed saterical element of it. It will make you root for the underdog in ways that so many movies have done before, but in a way that feels fresh and new. In my opinion, horror fans will love it, comedy fans will love it, and fans of things like cards against humanity will love it. This is dark, saterical humour at its finest. Never laughed so much at dumb college kids dying. A must watch. Period.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
a hoot,Rarely do I laugh like a hyena. Or at such ridiculous material. I think my young adult children thought I was losing it. They have yet to watch this film. Snobs. This kooky film is outrageous. It is mad cap and zany (the two most vile words ever in reviews because it so often refers to silly Brit sex comedies). But I relent and use these words to describe this slasher/camper/redneck romp. The characters are human cartoons and the predicaments and the consequences are hilarious.There is no point in describing the plot.

Force of Evil,"An unfortunate series of accidents leads to a group of college kids (who have seen 'Deliverance' one too many times) assuming that a couple of friendly hillbillies are psychotic murderers in this hilarious horror film that wittily subverts the 'backwoods brutality' subgenre. The film even begins, as one would expect, with the college kids in focus, scared out of their wits as the two hillbillies stare at them as they briefly drive by. Soon afterwards though, we are treated to the hillbillies' perspective and they remain empathetic throughout, especially as dead bodies pile up around them, completely oblivious to the fact that the college students think that they are serial killers. The fun diminishes somewhat as the pair realise that the college kids have a vendetta against them, but even so, the film remains interesting to watch as the brats essentially create their own downfalls, with their paranoia and instinctive distrust leading to their demise. Occasionally the film falls into cliché, but there is something deliciously postmodern to the way the film daringly swims against genre expectations. The movie also manages to address some issues revolving around confidence and misunderstandings based on unfair assumptions and the title characters are fleshed out in incredible depth for such a short (under 90 minute) feature with both Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine great in the roles.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

And, yes, though in this film they are not the focal point, you still get some nice young sexy hard-bodies to suit the formula.Prepare to laugh out loud, there is tons of gore, and it will just surprise you over and over, even if you end up finding the *surprise* ending a little too neat (I didn't mind it).

"""Hillbillies"" vs. ""College Kids"": Let the battle begin!","What a hilarious film! I don't remember to laugh so much for a long time! TUCKER&DALE VS.EVIL is an amazing horror comedy that completely messes up with all clichés of the average horror film. I mean, the typical formula of ""group of college kids + woods + cabin in the woods + one or two hillbillies = horror film"" is totally messed up in this film, but in a very intelligent and funny way.Through the entire film we see both sides, ""the hillbillies"", TUCKER and DALE, and ""the college kids"" and that's what make it funnier, because we see how they are both mistaken about each other (""college kids"" think TUCKER and DALE are two homicidal freaks and they think the same about the kids when in fact nobody is a psycho killer well, nobody, except one But I won't spoil that). It's in this mood of bad misunderstandings and incredible (I would say hilariously absurd!) accidents that will occur the first deaths of college kids, and increase even more the animosity between them. Only ALLISON, a girl that was saved by the hillbillies from one of those accidents, will understand they're all mistaken, but it's too late and she can't do anything to stop the killing rushIt's really an awesome comedy with a very good argument (and script) making fun of horror films (mostly the ones in the same genre of Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE), but as told, in a very humorous and intelligent way. The comical scenes are always based in the weird accidents and also in the DALE's character which is very naïf and insecure. All the characters are well built and are important to the plot.Beside all the fun and the jokes this movie also has two ""serious messages"", both related to DALE's character: 1- You should never judge anyone by his/her appearance. 2- We should always believe in ourselves and fight for what we want. That is the ""serious part"" of the film but for me what is really great in this movie is its humor.So, if you want a good laugh and see some gore too (it also has some nice blood scenes) you got to give it a try. I bet you won't be disappointed! (After watch the trailer my expectation about this movie was high but it was absolutely fulfilled). I score it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Fun, Original, and Absolutely Entertaining Horror Comedy","Although at times it can be rather childish, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil does slapstick right for a change, and is able to balance its gruesome parts with a helpful dose of awkward humor and a surprising amount of heart. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine steal the show as the titular characters Tucker and Dale, and both play their impressively silly dialogue with such ease that hasn't been seen in a comedy in quite some time. The film is paced surprisingly well, and though the humor is a few times more easy to cringe at than earn a laugh, it is still in good fun and provides nostalgia for when this type of comedy earned its roots. The script is wildly original for a comedy, concidering most nowadays are remakes, sequels, or are simply unfunny and bland. It bears on familiar themes, such as slapstick and underdog like scenarios, but it reaches different places with them and provides for one of the more easily entertaining comedies in quite some time.
My Rating: 9.25/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Playing with the slasher genre for laughs,"Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) are a couple of good friends who buy themselves a rundown cabin by a lake in the West Virginia mountains for holiday home where they can go fishing. At a gas station they meet up with bunch of rude obnoxious college kids whose ideas of country people come from watching too much Deliverance or Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The college kids flee in panic after misunderstanding Dale's clumsy attempt at a friendly greeting. Misunderstandings continue when Tucker and Dale come across the college kids skinny dipping in the lake by their cabin while they are out fishing. One girl, Alison (Katrina Bowden), is startled when she sees them and slips on a rock and bangs her head. Dale rescues her from drowning but when they attempt to alert to the accident the other college kids they flee in panic, believing their friend has been captured. Unaware of this Tucker and Dale return to cabin with Alison to tend to her injuriesThe following day while Alison realises how they have misjudged the situation and gets friendly with Dale, her friends are outside planning to rescue her spurred on by her hillbilly hating boyfriend Chad (Jesse Moss). This leads to a series of hilarious gory fatal accidents caused by stupidity and panic. Tucker and Dale just can't seem to stop these idiots killing themselves.This is film is a lot of fun. It is definitely playing with tropes of the backwoods slasher genre, where the college kids are so conditioned by prejudices based on ideas of country people from these slasher films that they behave like they are in one and cause their own deaths by reactions based on their biased assumptions. It is a great piece of black comedy and that is down to believable performances from Tudyk and Labine as well a really funny script.Rating 7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The impeccable comic timing of all the actors especially the two leading men are pure hilarious and will make you fall from your seats like crazy and the screenplays deserves all the credit.

Absolute Classic,"I thought this would just be another dumb teens-in-the-woods comedy but, boy was I wrong.This is a ""College Kids"" in-the-woods comedy. Who knew there was a difference!?Apparently the writers of this film did. I have not laughed this hard, genuinely, at a film since the early 2000's (and i'm watching this in 2025)Comedies just don't do it for me and so I stopped watching them because they don't make me laugh anymore.The surprise of a lifetime here. The perfectly delivered dialogue from every cast member, the physical comedy to go along with it. Impeccable timing, editing, camera angles and just everything.The story truly crescendo's nearly from start to finish. And yes, there is more than enough intensity, blood and gore to make this a horror, but absolutely slays as a horror/comedy.This is a damn near perfect film. It touches on so many things about social prejudices and insecurities. Has a ""love story"", and even a token haunted-history which comes to light in screamingly hysterical fashion.Tyler Labine is held in pretty well regard today as being cleverly diverse. But nobody does it better than Alan Tudyk. This guy is a chameleon, like Gary Oldman. He can play any part and play it well. Easily one of the most overlooked and underrated actors of our time.The entire crew of ""college kids"" are bombastically hillarious. Their delivery of the dialogue as well as physical acting and facial expressions are truly the remedy here.I honestly want to say thank you to everyone involved in making this film. This is a true gem and I wish to God there were more like it, but that's what makes this so special. Isn't it?Like I said, a damn near perfect film.There's a tiny lag before we get to the ending, but i honestly think they're giving the audience a chance to catch their breath.The big realisation at/near the end is done perfectly, and truly puts on display the moral compass of the film.Had me in tears.Entertainment Value 10/10
Overall Rating 9/10This should be studied as to how to do it right. And with a cast of early 20-something kids I wasn't too familiar with, I was pleasenty surpised.Looking at the movie poster I would never have expected it to be this good.

"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll recoil in disgust and then laugh anyway.","Thoroughly compelling, well paced, thoughtful and pertinent piece of horror-comedy (post-horror?) that deftly sends up horror tropes and is the most satisfying bout of script flipping since Shrek.Sort of like Final Destination but without a supernatural element. There is a macabre majesty in how unfortunate circumstances turn a group of people that otherwise would have no inclination to harm a fly against each other in class fueled sectarian carnage.Don't think this is just a horror parody or some sort of comedic pastiche of horror like Shaun of the Dead or The Scouts guide to zombies or Zombeavers, this is the real deal. The comic tone only intensifies the brutality in a movie about prejudice without being sanctimonious and with a genuine heart at its core.My only issues with this movie are that line ""I worked on a farm, it was either work or get out"" which rubbed me the wrong way for some reason and how they don't give enough character flaws to the more rural characters beyond maybe some lacking people skills.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I was expecting something bad,"When I was browsing through Netflix with my brother and we came across this movie, my only reason for watching it was because I thought it was going to be so bad we were going to get a kick out of it. I thought it was going to be too cheesy, I thought the humor was going to be dumb, and I thought I was going to have typical bad horror movie tropes.However, I was COMPLETELY WRONG.The main characters are extremely lovable, the acting (for the main cast) is actually good, the writing is clever, the ending was really sweet and heartwarming, I laughed a LOT watching it, and every horror movie trope ever is completely turned on it's head. There were even plot twists I didn't see coming, and the villain is actually more believable than most I've seen.My favorite aspect was the relationship between the two main characters. I thought they had great chemistry and the scenes focusing on their friendship were just so sweet and made me more invested in the movie than I could have ever expected.Basically, this movie took me completely by surprise.Though there are some obviously low-budget parts, and some of the minor characters acting isn't the best, and a lot of things that happen are really ridiculous, I can look past these issues and say this movie pleasantly surprised me. I only wish it were more popular, because I think a lot of people would really enjoy it. :)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a wildly funny mix of blood, gore, and a surprising amount of heart","Spending the weekend at the lake camping, drinking, and skinning dipping in the lake, what could possibly go wrong? A lot, unfortunately, as demonstrated in many horror entities such as 'Friday the 13th' and 'Cabin Fever'. When tackling on the horror genre, it seems that the lake house or a cabin in the woods is never a safe place of teenagers, young adults, or even grown man party at. This horror-comedy hybrid sets another example, only with a slightly smarter and heartfelt approach. You ever heard the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover""? Well, this gore-filled comedy takes the inspiring concept and turns it right on his head with this genre- bending farce showcasing a hilarious conflict between a group of college kids and a duo of bearded country men who are just out for a weekend of fishing. Whereas the former are typically the good guys and the latter are usually the bad guys, this film makes a daring task to take that clichéd and gives it a twist. This movie follows a group of college students who drive out to the country and spend their weekend at the lake, the same lake country hillbillies Tucker (played by Alan Dudyk) and Dale (played by Tyler Labine) happen to be camping at. Upon meeting them at a gas station, the gang immediately comes creeped out by them and flees. Later that night, at the lake, one of the girls Allison (played by Katrina Bowden) suffers a head injury and falls into the water. When Tucker and Dale drag her to their cabin to nurse her, her friends grow incredible suspicious (and judgemental) and wage war on the hillbillies. What ensues instead is a comical, but deadly turn for the worst.In today's age, too many people are top quick to judge for the appearance of others. The issue lies within the core of the plot here, which offers an absurd, yet hilarious testament on the consequences of misjudging others for what is seen on the outside than what is on the inside. And director Eli Craig is the mastermind behind reeling in this inspiring phenomenon with a funny, tongue-in- cheek twist. The movie follows a familiar cliché with a young college age kids battling against some middle-aged country boys who they believe are just your average psychopaths hungry for blood, only both sides of the moral compass are swapped between the two groups. The film introduces the two eponymous characters as stereotypical southerners with big beards and lightly sets up their background, while leaving most of the college characters rendered in simple figures. From there on, it is not long before the story escalates into a gut-busting bloodbath, and that is where most of the laughs are perpetrated. When tension between the two sides rise, so does the body count, not because these kids make the stupid decisions known in slasher movies but simply because they are just too amateur to defend themselves without being overly clumsy. Like films such as 'Shaun of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', the film uproots its goofy humor through an excess of blood and gore to showcase the violent, albeit hilarious deaths of the characters. And to fuel up the intellect tank, there is a smart message about thinking before you judge others upon first glance and learning to stand up for yourself, both of which are nicely offered in the midst of the carnage and laughter. Eli Craig proves he knows how to give a film a strong heart without neglecting his duty for reel in some good laughs. Not many comedies, particularly the ones mating with the horror genre, accomplish that feat.Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a wildly funny mix of blood, gore, and surprising amount of heart in the midst of its outrageous gruesome hilarity. It is a funny good time that proves movies can be uproot plenty of laughter through stupidity while flourishing an intellectual touch to the mix. Comedy fans will be satisfied, while gore lovers will be ecstatic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The acting is top-notch, specially Dale as portrayed by Tyler Labine.I don't want to get too much into the story, but when the villain(s?) are made clear, it's actually scary, and the ending was honestly quite riveting, with a perfect, sweet last shot that left me more than satisfied - and still laughing as the credits rolled.Totally recommended if you want a great bonafide comedy that's both smart and a laugh riot.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome Giggle Fest,"Very witty, yet able to invoke the lowest forms of primal laughter. At first I thought it was just a parody of the scary movie genre, but it turned out to be so much more. We laughed so hard, so many great twists and Puns. This needs to promoted to a must watch film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic horror set-up with a comedy twist!,"Tucker and Dale are just two guys who can't wait to get down to their new vacation home in the woods and just kick back with a few beers and do a little fishing. They had no idea that a group of young college kids were also heading to the same area to have a little fun of their own. That is one way this movie could be teased, another would be, A group of college friends stocked with beer, weed and bad ideas head out to the woods, where a couple of hillbillies are not too happy about their property being trespassed on. Either way you look at it, this vacation is going to be a mess.Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a movie about perception. The director/writer Eli Craig has crafted a modern look at the oft copied slasher film formula and added a bit of life into a dying genre. Instead of showing us the events through the eyes of the victims, Craig turns the camera around and gives us a look through the eyes of the so called ""killers"". The college kids will jump to conclusions and make assumptions about Tucker and Dale and through a few misunderstandings will think Tucker and Dale are vicious murderers. On the flip side the duo will make some assumptions about the ""college kids"" of their own which will ultimately land them in deeper trouble.Leading the cast are Tyler Labine as Dale and Alan Tudyk as Tucker. Both just ooze comedy right into this chaotic few days in the woods. Both are just stellar and I don't think this movie would have been possible without either one. Tudyk has had an already long career in both comedy and serious roles. He has starred in both the TV show Firefly and its movie counterpart Serenity. He has lended his voice to animated features such as Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen and Big Hero 6. He has also played the villain in the Jackie Robinson movie, 42. Point being that even with such an impressive resume, this may be Tudyk's best performance to date. Labine, while less well known really steals the heart in this movie. He plays such a great big dumb lovable oaf, with a heart of gold. I will be looking for him in future releases for sure. The rest of the cast is rounded out by your basic slasher cast. A diverse group of kids from all different backgrounds, and while not as fleshed out as Tucker or Dale, they still play an important role in filling out the normal tropes.The comedy in this movie does not just come from the constant identity mix ups, but also from the writing. The movie seems to get funnier and funnier every time I see it. You will catch things you missed the first time, you will learn the funny little quirks of some of the characters that you can't wait to pop back up again. Writers Craig and Morgan Jurgenson have not only found a new way to tell a classic story, they have created a real full movie here, not just a gimmick and a good cast.I have watched Tucker and Dale vs. Evil 3 times now and each time with a different group of people. Each time i have thought that there may be someone of the group who may not like the movie, but I pressed on anyway to try to get as many people to see this movie as possible. Every person I have watched this movie with has loved it. Not once has someone said they either did not like it or down right hated it. The laughs are constant and the pacing keeps you into the movie, even once the original gimmick wears off. Tucker and Dale is truly a movie that I think everyone can find some enjoyment in, and that is a very difficult task to accomplish. So next time you and your friends can't decide on something to watch, give Tucker and Dale a try. I guarantee you wont be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun twist and lesson in the danger of stereotypes,"Fun movie to watch when you want a ""wth just happened rewind that"" movie. Lost some momentum towards the end of would give it a 10. Plus bit confused with the connection of the old newspaper at end. But well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprised,"I have started to watch this movie about 5 times and I just couldn't get over teens-on-a-road-trip cheese factor, even though I heard good things about it. Yesterday I tried it again and got all the way through it! I'm glad I gave it another chance! Excellent movie! Very, very funny with great cinematography and special effects. The acting was great once you realize the characters' significance to the story. Excellent and very quotable one liners that really help make the movie. I just watched it (all the way through) for the 3rd time!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Must see horror comedy,"This might not come to be a cult classic, but it is definitely one of the best horror comedies I have ever seen. The only problem for me is the terrible acting skills demonstrated by the guy how plays the antagonist. The supporting cast is also somewhat lame, but everything else is good.And even despite the above mentioned shortcomings, this turned out to be an exceptionally good horror comedy, probably due to the exceptionally good script and great sense of humor. There are no cheap laughs or over-the-top antics. The outrageously grim and silly situations come naturally and it all makes sense in a weird and funny way which is also refreshingly creative.I can't wait to see what these guys cook up next.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A real Gem,"If you want special effects, lazer blasts,monsters, fast cars and sexy girls.....this hilarious movie is not for you. If you want a laugh a minute, funny one liners, excellent comic moments and a little ""horror"" moments. Then look no further. When I first saw this with my wife, we just laughed our butts off. Set in West Virginia, the old hillbilly/college weirdos in the woods setting. With a big turn around...you have the usual college kids woods flashback to a previous back woods story....But this outing has two ordinary guys Tucker and Dale heading off to their very own broken down cabin for a vacation, drink beer, fish and fixing up their cabin. Then enter the college kids, who take it that our two guys are killing hillbillies and set out to do the nasty first with hilarious results. That's the plot, all I will say is this.....wood-chipper.... I never get sick of watching this movie, acting,dialogue,action,comedy,and total misunderstanding abound are fabulous. The writers hit pure genius with this one....thanks to all for pure entertainment, laughs and enjoyment.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
funniest send-up of a genre i've seen since airplane!,"i saw the trailer for this movie online - at first, thought ""what is this?"" - watched the trailer again and laughed so hard, i started crying. at that point, i knew that the idea of seeing alan tudyk playing a hillbilly in a send-up of all the slasher films based on the concept of ""deliverance""-esque type guys vs. suburban kids away for a weekend was going to be worth the watch. i mention alan tudyk because i have a special place in my heart for him after ""firefly"" and ""serenity"".i was so right. *everyone* in this film was good if not great. tucker and dale played off each other perfectly; the actors' chemistry was incredible, and they should consider working together on other films. there were several scenes where i laughed so hard, i missed dialogue. the only thing that prevents me from scoring it higher than 8/10 is that about 3/4 of the way through, the movie dragged a bit for me - there was about 10 minutes where the movie lost a bit of momentum, and i was no longer fully in the movie. once past that, the movie went right back to the same tempo and it finished as strong as it started.",,Anonymous,Horror
Zombieland it isn't,"I've been wanting to see this horror/comedy for a while now and after reading several great reviews for the film even more so but now that I've seen the film I'm pretty disappointed. I was expecting to laugh out loud and though there was some laughter it was too far apart from each other that there was too many gaps with no laughter at all and like Shaun Of The Dead before it the gore and action is the best and most entertaining elements of the film and both I considered overrated because in the end it's not first rate comedy and is more silly, fun and likable in a B-movie sense than being truly tears coming down your face funny. The characters and performances of course are disposable but it seems like they had a ball making this movie and the heart of the movie is of course Tucker and Dale because without them this movie wouldn't work completely but for what it is it was a ball and it's a great film to watch with your friends while drinking some beer but to me it needed better writing and timing of the jokes and references because the jokes just wasn't consistent to me and sure they had a hilarious concept on their hands but the way they delivered it wasn't effective and to be honest they are just a tad too late in the game to deliver this concept to movie theaters because they have a lot of movies with this type of theme out there for this movie to compete against and stand out from, it wasn't a total failure but unfortunately it wasn't a total success either. Overall unless your in high school and below you will probably won't find this funny and if you do probably in the back of your head your thinking that this film is all too familiar and just not fresh anymore but it's all in good fun.

"Tucker & Dale vs Evil : Oh hidy ho officer, we've had a doozy of a day.","Tucker & Dale vs Evil : Oh hidy ho officer, we've had a doozy of a day.Tucker & Dale vs Evil is an entertaining horror comedy staring Alan Tudyk (Firefly / Dodgeball) and Tyler Labine (Reaper) as a hapless hillbilly dual that cross paths with a group of American teenagers on a camping trip with comically disastrous results. The story unfolds as Tucker and Dale inadvertently kidnap one of the teenage girls, setting off a series of misunderstandings between the two groups.The jokes are sharp, surprising and smart. The gore is relentless and blackly brilliant, paying homage to cult horror films of the slasher sub genre, such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. The acting, by some of the teenagers is questionable, especially from Jesse Moss (Final destination 3); however, they all look beautiful and fit their stereotypical characters well. The story and plot is solid, fun and original. Ultimately the films merits are overshadowed by flawless performances from Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine as the lovable Tucker and Dale. The chemistry between the two charms and captivates the viewer from beginning to end. The only negative I should point out is the trailer, in three minutes they manage to reveal important story plot points, the top gags and most of the ending, leaving very little to speculation. Skip the trailer and go straight to the movie.The film was made in 2010 and has had limited screenings through 2011, primarily at independent cinemas, film festivals and special events. It is being release on DVD on 26th September 2011. There are already active talks of a sequel.",,Anonymous,Horror
A comedy that makes me laugh a lot .............,"I have to admit this is probably the best satire/homage i've ever seen. Treating your source material with so much respect while at the same time taking the crap out of it is just amazing.If you have seen ""Braindead"" or ""Sean of the Dead"" you might have a clue of what is lurking in this one. This movie is basically what ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is all about seen from a hillbilly point of view: A big misunderstanding. And what of a kind! The way the story unfolds is drawing in anybody with a hearth beat and the two main protagonists are just so lovable in their clumsiness its pretty impossible to not fever with them.I seriously doubted any comedy nowadays could make me laugh for something close to 90 minutes through. This one did. There are so many unforgettable scenes, that i keep wondering how Hollywood could come up with movies bare of any at all! The story might drop of a little at the end, but it's dropping of from a height normal flicks can barely dream of.",,Anonymous,Horror
A comedy gone wrong is a horror to watch.,"But this one was actually funny. This had a little bit of this and a little bit of that and it all came together fine. The movie is a parody of ideas of the typical cult horror movies. The hillbillies, the teenage group, the woods and the spooky cabin.The downside of the movie is the acting, apart from characters Tucker (Alan) and Dale(Tyler) all the other characters were barely acceptable. The pace of the movie was good so it will keep you interested.To enjoy this movie I would advise not to think too much just watch it laugh when you are supposed to, be scared when you fell like although there is no horror in this. If you try too hard to do either of them you will be disappointed. So just sit back and enjoy.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Squeal like pigs, college kids!","Surprisingly enjoyable silly horror comedy with nods to classics like Evil Dead and Texas Chain Saw Massacre. When college kids meet hillbillies in the woods, chaos ensues.But these college kids aren't your average bunch of slasher fodder. And these hillbillies aren't trying to rape or kill anybody.In fact Tucker and Dale are the nicest characters on offer and all genre clichés are flipped, reversed and mocked in this gory but funny film.Sexist but sweet, the film clocks in at under an hour and a half but still manages to slightly outstay its welcome come the inevitable final showdown.Alan Tudyk is reliable as ever, but the real star is Tyler Labine as Dale. The teens are adequate, but the actresses and female characters are severely short changed, with the exception of Katrina Bowden as Allison who at least gets some good scenes before being relegated to damsel in distress status.Nevertheless it's fun and quite clever and does something original with the tired hillbilly, cabin in the woods, teen slasher sub-genres.",,Anonymous,Horror
Hillbillies in a Haunted House,"Call me crazy, call me corny... but I have fallen head over heels for this exuberant little bluegrass comedy thriller.Two endearingly dumb hick hillbillies, Dale (Tyler Labine) and Tucker (Alan Tudyk) are happily settling in for a vacation at their ramshackle cabin in the woods when their bliss is disrupted by the arrival of a carload of mindless college kids.During a late-night fishing excursion, the beer-loving buddies witness a swimming party and rescue one of the girls from drowning, taking her back to their cabin to recover.While Tucker spends his day working in the woods, Dale devotes every moment to humbly caring for their unexpected guest. Nice, pretty, intelligent and bland Allison (Katrina Bowdan) quickly loses her initial fear of her bearded, beer-bellied Bear of a captor as she discovers him to be awkwardly shy, gentle, sweet-natured and seriously cute. In turn, the self-negating Dale is overwhelmed by the unexpected acceptance and warmth of this unattainable dream person. The two develop an unlikely friendship and cozily settle down to await the return of her friends.This is not how Allison's friends perceive the situation. They have been frightened by tales of bloodthirsty killers in the area and are certain that Allison has been captured by savage rednecks. In their zeal to rescue her, they each rush to the attack - and accidentally cause their own violent, bloody deaths in the best Friday THE 13th manner.TUCKER AND DALE vs. EVIL, like the classic ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948), is that rarity: a Horror-Comedy that honors the genre and works on every level. It can be seen as the Laurel and Hardy version of such rustic thrillers as DELIVERANCE and THE Texas CHAINSAW CHAINSAW MASSACRE. In this case the humor is restrained and character- oriented, and all physical comedy stems directly from the situation.The film's admirable achievement is that it maintains a buoyant sense of humor without ever mocking or compromising genre conventions. The point of view of the two groups of characters determines the alternating shifts of tone. The good OK' boys and their open-minded girl friend see the story as a rustic romantic comedy whereas the shallow college kids exist in a generic slasher-flick dimension, played straight with menacing music and every edge-of-seat beat in place. Whenever the two worlds happen to meet, the resulting absurdity twists the standard blood'n'guts ""Kills"" as a dynamic unity of shock and laughter. The deft balancing of this sharp contrast is the key to TUCKER AND DALE's success.Central to the movie's charm are the appealing performances of the three leads; especially big -- and big-hearted -- Tyler Labine, whose personal warmth and good-humor make this a splatter with soul.Add to this a genuinely warm and moving story of love and friendship between characters we come to care for, and you have a one-of-a-kind indie winner to treasure and remember.",,Anonymous,Horror
