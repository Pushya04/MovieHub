Keeps You Guessing,"This surprised me. A thriller on a plane that has you thinking you know all the answers (because we're such expert movie watches), then flips it. Yes, it's a contrived subplot. And the reasoning behind this terrorist act is goofy, BUT...it is a lot of fun. It interweaves a really elaborate set-up that you have to focus on to understand.Also, for people who think they're sophisticated in camera motion. Think about that space. The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees without a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with the movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't see or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.Julianne Moore is great, as always. Neeson is perfect for this role, but one has to wonder how this behemoth of a guy fits in a airplane bathroom.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly entertaining,"I never was a huge fan of Liam Neeson's action flicks, but I went to see this because of the good reviews. This movie is a very suspenseful and a great ""Whodunnit"" movie. It it's share of action scenes, but it never went too over the top. Even if you don't like Liam Neeson, this movie is worth seeing and is a guaranteed good time. Lot's of twists and suspicious characters leave you guessing and most likely wrong. Lot's of on the edge-of- your-seat scenes because of how well it was made and has a silent and lonely feel to it which helps you understand everything going on. Overall, this movie is a great thriller without being packed full of action.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent plane-bound murder mystery,"NON-STOP is another movie featuring Liam Neeson in his newfound 'hard man' role following on from the success of TAKEN. This time around, he's a boozy Air Marshall working a routine flight who suddenly finds himself caught up in a murder mystery involving ransom demands and some high-octane action. Pretty soon it's a race against the clock to stop the murderer from committing any more crimes.I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, given the middling reviews; after all, Neeson's last film UNKNOWN was a disappointment. The good news is that NON-STOP is a lot better, a film that holds it together for the most part. The main thing is that it keeps you watching throughout with nary a slow moment in sight. Neeson is on strong form as the grumpy antihero and I particularly liked his brutal treatment of the suspects - no nice-guy pussyfooting around here, just blunt force when needed. Inevitably the scriptwriters throw in a few fight scenes to keep action fans happy and they all work very well. The script is tight and focused and kept realistic as possible, only becoming over the top in a few moments.The film isn't perfect, but the problems tend to be minor. I could have done without the SHERLOCK-copying on-screen texts, and I could have also done without the disappointing Julianne Moore once more forced down our throats in a role she really isn't suited for. In fact, not many of the supporting cast are that great, apart from maybe Linus Roache. Still, this is a film which is all about the plot and for the most part it works; I know I enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A GREAT ENTERTAINING MYSTERY THRILLER,"Liam Neeson is an action legend in his own right & has made some of the most entertaining Action Thriller's of the about the last ten years, we've had Neeson vs wolves in the snowy wilderness survival Thriller The Grey & we've had his iconic kidnap & revenge Taken Trilogy & his memory loss Mystery with Unknown & his troubled grizzled Detective Crime Thriller, A Walk Among The Tombstones & his Survive the night chase Thriller, Run All Night, all excellent Neeson flicks. So it's definitely safe to say that Neeson is an action Hero legend just a later in life ageing action hero but already he's one of the greats in my opinion & i just totally enjoy his films as he takes out plenty of villains & saves the day, he makes high class slick, big budget action Thriller's that are a perfect night time watch as a ""Popcorn"" flick.Non-stop is a smart & stylish suspenseful Murder Mystery Thriller with some good action scenes but it's mainly in the Thriller genre just like Neesons other Mystery Thriller flick ""Unknown"" with the same Director (Jaume Collet-Serra) who obviously has a great working relationship with the ageing action star as they've made so far four films together with Unknown, Non-stop, Run All Night & The Commuter.
Here Neeson plays another troubled & rugged type of character with a very sad backstory as an Air Marshall named Bill Mark who gets thrown right into a deadly mystery aboard his flight with a terrorist messaging him about a passenger with die every twenty minutes if his demands are not met. Neeson does give such a good paranoid & frustrated performance & has created one of his best characters in my opinion.The suspense is high & very claustrophobic as our hero is stuck on the plane wondering up & down the aisles & looking at the passenger's wondering who it is.
I liked the quiet & lonely night time atmosphere. This is a smart Mystery & an exciting one too & it has a nice night time feel to it & a slick look & a great supporting cast with an excellent Julianne Moore in a good solid role here with some nice character depth & back story as Jen, a passenger who helps our hero & we have an off duty New York Cop named Austin played by Corey Stoll & he's a good character here too & there's also solid performances from Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker, Michelle Dokery & Lupita Nyong'O.
Non-stop is a fun popcorn Thriller that keeps you guessing & wondering who is doing this & why? How many terrorists? It's a clever story & also frustrating as Neeson's Character is constantly being look at as the terrorist himself as things keep happening & pointing directly at him by the clever terrorist.
Just an enjoyable Neeson thriller & he's so good at them.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining,The movie have a way to approach the airplane disaster in different way and that was pretty good. The play with the killer and liam neeson were pretty entertaining and we wonder until the end who is behind all of that. And the twist at the end can let us very surprised by the name of the killer.

Non-stop thrills and suspense!,"This is an action-thriller starring Liam Neeson as U.S. Air Marshal Bill Marks who, while boarding a flight to London, receives text messages from an unknown assailant, threatening that if he doesn't transfer $150 million to an account, a fatality will occur on the plane every 20 minutes unless Marks complies with the money request.The film starts off with some intrigue, showing Marks depressed, consuming alcohol and having a couple of run-ins with some passengers before he boards the plane, already giving the audience the impression that Marks is a disturbed person and making us eager to know what his background story is. Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) sits next to Marks on the plane, whose background story is also a mystery until later on in the film, providing us with another interesting subplot.However, the main plot and action come almost immediately after the plane takes to the air when Marks starts receiving the threatening text messages. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse as Marks attempt to find the perpetrator and, when the casualties start to mount, it becomes a thrilling roller-coaster ride.The screenwriter team wrote an exhilarating story that really captures the audience attention from start to finish and Jaume Collet-Serra directed a solid plot that kept the movie's pace going strong, leaving no room with unnecessary fillers that tends to drag the story. There are a few camp and corny moments here and there, but the acting was realistic and believable enough to keep the movie dramatic and engaging.Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the unpredictable outcomes. Highly recommended.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great ""Edge-Of-Your-Seat"" Film","I saw an advanced screening of this movie yesterday, and I was absolutely blown away. I had hoped it would be a fun thrill-ride, but I did not expect it to be as exciting and involved as it was.My favorite part of this movie, was the fact that it takes a plot that is implausible, and makes it as plausible as possible. You can definitely tell that the writers did their research on air marshals, airplane mechanics, etc. There was not one moment in this film that I was bored, and it was filled to the brim with twists, and turns.There definitely is a lot that went into this movie, and even though it'll have you thinking more deeply about the security of airlines, most of all it's just a really, really fun ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop,"When I first saw previews for this I called it ""Taken Plane."" After seeing it, it is everything but that. Excellent script that keeps you guessing and trying to figure out ""who dun it."" Liam Neeson does a great job and keeps you rooting for him the entire film. He gets a great supporting cast as well. Top notch performance by Corey Stoll as the NYPD detective passenger on the plane as well. The only downside to this film was that when the film started it almost seemed like the first 2-4 minutes were cut and just dropped you right into the film. A little confusing but nothing extreme to take away from the rest of the film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Engaging until the last minute,"""Non-stop"" stands as the most captivating film I've ever encountered. This Airplane-Crime-Mystery-Thriller concept instantly intrigues. The movie commences impressively and maintains its promise through the initial half-hour aboard the plane. While it stumbles slightly afterward, it remains a high-octane thriller that outpaces most in recent years. The escalating conflicts faced by the Marshal inject excitement, particularly during the riveting 20-minute game that keeps you on the edge of your seat.As conflicts intensify, the exhilarating pursuit to identify the criminal unfolds, accompanied by a palpable sense of risk and the ticking clock. The possible hijacking adds to the stimulating atmosphere. Although the film could have explored certain aspects further, its breakneck pace prevents exhaustive coverage. Despite some minor flaws, the frequent pulse-quickening moments make it a thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile experience.As an admirer of engaging Crime Thrillers, ""Non-stop"" pleasantly surprised me, defying expectations given its airplane / hijack setting. Alongside ""Sully,"" it ranks among my top airplane-themed movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Totally unrealistic yet pretty good.,Geez this movie is suspenseful. Who would have thought that a movie set solely on a plane could be so entertaining. It keeps you guessing the whole way as to who dunnit. Honestly the one person who is behaving strangely is Liam Neeson's character. He is a seriously angry man and should not be allowed to have a gun or a badge. The whole time you cannot help but think how unrealistic it all is. Normal people would never get into this situation.Aside from the ridiculousness of the whole concept I'm not sure the ending needed to be so deep and political. I wish it stayed totally action and didn't try to be all deep and intellectual. Luckily that was a very small part of the movie. Overall though pretty good.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Terrific aerial  thriller by Spanish director Jaume Collet Serra and full of action, suspense and tension","Nail-biting and astounding thriller stunningly directed by the Spanish director Jaume Collet -Serra . Outstanding action movie plenty of thrills , suspense , intrigue , twists and turns . An excellent whodunit deals with an air marshal (Liam Neeson) springs into action during a transatlantic flight (the airplane used in the film is a Boeing 767-300) after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account . After several e-mails , only to discover that someone has taken on his account and that no one , not even the crew , believes him . With the help of a young flight attendant (Michelle Dockery) and a likable passenger (Julianne Moore) he sets out to prove who he is . He confronts enemies in order to find out the true killer , but someone is still after him and is forced to take up violent means to discover them . He takes the law on his own hands and acting as a desperate person . The hijacking was just the beginning .This exciting film contains suspense , thrills , noisy action, shootouts , violent fights and plot twits . From start to final the frantic action and fast movement is unstopped . The motion picture is only set on two scenarios : the airport and mostly plane . However this doesn't make boring it , as the movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and thriller lovers . The aircraft is clearly fictional, a type is never referred to during the course of the film , whilst it appears to be the size of a Boeing 767-400, the cabin interior, door operation & arrangement and flight deck layout do not match this type of aircraft. The set for the plane was built very slightly larger than a standard commercial airliner to accommodate Neeson's 6'4"" height for filming and roughly 200 extras were cast , all of them stayed throughout filming . The runtime movie is overlong : two hours and some but isn't slow-moving and is amount amusing for suspense and intrigue . Liam Neeson is top-notch as a drunken and discredited air marshal ; Liam Neeson has propelled many an action thriller to big box office numbers, as Unknown , Taken 2 and this Non-stop . Accompany efficiently to starring two nice actresses as Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery . There are many suspects , all support cast formed by good secondaries such as Scoot McNairy , Corey Stoll , Jon Abrahams , Nate Parker , Jason Butler , Linus Roache , Shea Whigham , Anson Mount and Lupita Nyong'o who in her next film would win an Academy Award .Colorful cinematography by cameraman Flavio Martinez Labiano using Steadicam and with majority locations from plane interior . The musician John Ottman creates a stirring , rousing soundtrack fitting to frenetic action . Lavishly produced including spectacular scenes by the successful American producer Joel Silver . The flick was compellingly directed by Jaume Collet-Serra . Collet is an expert director of terror movies as ¨Orphan¨, ¨House of wax¨ and for TV , ¨The river¨ , and of course his greatest hit was ¨Unknown¨ also with Liam Neeson and similar artistic team as cameraman Flavio Laviano , musician John Ottman and producer Joel Silver . Rating : Better than average, well worth seeing . The picture will appeal to explosive action fans .",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-sense,"Much of the tension in Non-Stop trades off the likability of its star, Liam Neeson. It's a conceit frequently used by Alfred Hitchcock, from Henry Fonda to Anthony Perkins. Jaume Collet-Serra's film doesn't mine the dark psychological depths of Hitch's best output, but it's a lean and sometimes amusingly mean thriller.What starts as a high concept mid-90s straight-to-video plot – a passenger will be bumped off every 20 minutes unless Air Marshall Bill Marks (Neeson) arranges for $150m to be transferred to the perp's account – soon becomes a nail-biting, disbelief-suspending whodunit (or who's-doing-it). The film is elevated above the ordinary by Neeson's depiction of the boozy, grief-stricken Marks: there are moments when we truly share the passengers' distrust of the man apparently going mad in their midst.Marks communicates with the hijacker via text message. Here, Collet-Serra comes up with a nifty way of presenting these conversations through graphics overlaid on the screen, negating the usual tension-killing cut to a tiny cellphone screen. Incidentally, the bad guy/gal must win the award for fastest thumbs in the English-speaking world.Superior character actors like Linus Roache and Scoot McNairy provide decent support, although recent Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o is wasted as a gasping air stewardess. And is there any reason for Julianne Moore to be in this movie? Well, there's always a reason for Julianne Moore to be on the screen. But her character isn't really any more than an extra suspect and an excuse for some agonisingly cheesy and unconvincing flirtation. I guess one could argue she adds ""heart"" to the movie – except this is a movie which is most fun when it's at its most heartless.The dialogue is lousy; the look is advert glossy; the CGI is poor; the performances are hugely variable; the action is brief and messy; the plot is preposterous (especially the final third). All in all, like Collet-Serra's and Neeson's previous outing, the Frantic-esque Unknown, this is an efficient and enjoyable thriller which will never be lauded as a classic, and never really attempts to make any sense, but further cements its star as the go-to guy for solid, ruffled, old school rough 'n' tumble.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Much Better Than I Expected,"When I first saw the trailer, I thought it would just be another generic action movie. However, I found myself to be enjoying the movie and was entertained.Non-Stop stars Liam Neeson as air marshall Bill Marks. The journey starts out as any other until he gets a text from an unknown person which says that he will kill one person every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a bank account.As the movie progresses, the stakes get higher and things just keep getting worse for Liam Neeson's character. If you haven't watched the trailer, there is a twist which would have made some scenes much better. In my opinion, don't think they should have shown that in the trailer.Along the way, there are some sweet action scenes and plenty of moments to keep you guessing. You will have to suspend a lot of disbelief though, some of the events that happened were timed so perfectly and seemed just lucky to even occur the way it did.The final third of the movie, although very entertaining, felt a bit weaker than the rest of the movie. Mainly because of the reasons of the villains -didn't really like reason. Apart from that, I enjoyed the action, the story and the ending. Plenty of action to keep you entertained and a decent story.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The air above,"With a title like Non-Stop you expect non stop action but this is more a thriller with periodical action scenes to keep the beats going. After all Liam Neeson is in his 60s and cannot keep on fighting all through the film.Neeson is an air marshal with personal problems and a fondness for drink. As the flight takes off he receives a series of text messages asking for millions of dollars to be deposited in a bank account or someone will die every 20 minutes.The texts are popped on screen in the style of the TV series 'Sherlock' which is a blessing for the viewer.Neeson now has to find the person making the threats, suspect all passengers and even the fight crew. On the other hand his warnings are not taken seriously and 20 minutes into the first threat the first person dies.The movie is far fetched and convoluted. The reveal is difficult to fathom but it is an enjoyable film as Neeson desperately tries to find the villain while he increasingly looks like he is losing it and attracts suspicion himself.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop was one exciting plane thriller!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were watching this for the first time and we both were thrilled by it. Liam Neeson plays someone taking a flight from London. The only other player we recognized was Julianne Moore and not much is learned about her during most of the narrative except she takes a lot of flights and was coming from a trying day. Oh, and she observes most of the action when Liam talks to the crew on board when the crises happens. Plenty of twists happen when trying to guess which passenger is responsible for some threatening comments on Neeson's tablet so that was a plus. In other words, it was riveting throughout! Really, all I'll say now is I and my friend highly recommend Non-Stop!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Kept Me Interested - For About An Hour,"The most unfortunate thing about ""Non-Stop"" is that it's 1:46 long. That last :46 was just too much for me. Seriously - I was enjoying this for the most part for the first hour or so, and then it just lost me. Not that I didn't understand it - it just stopped interesting me. Too much that was happening just wasn't making enough sense. Sure, I get that in an action movie you sometimes have to suspend your disbelief - but I was being asked to suspend too much disbelief.First was the rather - shall we say - convoluted plan that the bad guys had hatched. The story revolves around a plan to extort $150 million from an airline - or someone - and a threat to kill one passenger every twenty minutes unless the money is paid. Or the plane is going to be blown up. Or it's going to be blown up anyway regardless I guess. Whatever. This plot depended on so many little details going absolutely right. It depended on things happening to the split second. Or, if it didn't depend on that, still so many things happened right on the split second that it was bewildering. Like the twenty minute thing. Liam Neeson's Agent Marks could literally set his watch by this timing. The deaths happen literally at the 20 minute mark - not 20 minutes and 30 seconds, or 19 minutes and 45 seconds, but literally at 20 minutes - even though there was no way the plotters could have possibly controlled everything that needed to happen so precisely. And how did these guys plan to escape anyway? Sure they had parachutes. So they were going to jump into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean? (This was a flight from the US to London.) What would they do then? And how did they set up all these bank accounts - hundreds of them apparently - all around the world? What? And how did they know that Agent Marks was going to be on this specific flight? Because a lot of their plan seemed to revolve around their knowledge of some of the troubled personal details of his life. And - if his superiors trusted him so little that they wouldn't believe him when a crisis on a flight came up and would readily accept that he was actually a suspect, why was he still an air marshall in the first place? It was all mind-boggling.And it worked for a while. Convoluted? Unbelievable? To the point of ridiculousness? Sure it was, but I could hang in for about an hour in the hope that some sense would be made of this. But it never was. After about an hour I just started thinking how long it was taking this movie to end. Which is never a good sign.There were things I liked about it. Liam Neeson was pretty good. Generally speaking I like Liam Neeson. He worked in the role of Marks - the air marshall dealing with a lot of personal demons. Julianne Moore was pretty good as Marks' seatmate on the plane - the one passenger he seemed able to trust and so he brings her into the circle and she starts to help him get control of the situation. I appreciated the fact that no one decided to introduce a romance between these two. That would have made me roll my eyes a lot sooner than I did. I appreciated the fact that the only Muslim on board the plane was a good guy. I did wonder about his medical knowledge. He identified himself as a molecular neuroscientist or something. Why? Why not just call him a doctor? There seemed no particular reason to make him a molecular neuroscientist if he was going to be providing medical care. But at least he wasn't one of the bad guys.This worked for a while. There was just too much going on that made the whole story implausible. (5/10)",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining in Spite of Some Really Ridiculous Action Scenes,"This film begins with an air marshal by the name of ""Bill Marks"" (Liam Neeson) going through a rather difficult time in his life but cannot seem to get his superiors to give him the necessary time to deal with his issues. That being said, upon boarding a flight from New York to London, he is sent a text stating that one of the passengers will die within 20 minutes unless $150 million is deposited into a numbered account. Since it's a federal crime to engage an air marshal on his secure line, Bill immediately realizes the seriousness of this action but cannot the other air marshal on board named ""Jack Hammond"" (Anson Mount) to do likewise. Further complicating matters is the fact that Bill ends up killing Jack at exactly the 20-minute mark in the lavatory. From that point on, nobody knows whether Bill has gone insane and intends to kill everybody or if there is someone else on board with that same goal. Meanwhile, every 20 minute or so another passenger ends up dead--with Bill being the closest person at the time. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an entertaining movie by and large in spite of some of the rather ridiculous action scenes. But such is the movie industry these days. In any case, I liked both the overall mystery and the performance of Liam Neeson and I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Decent Thriller,"I recently saw ""Non-Stop"" a couple of days ago and I personally enjoyed it. It's not just a copy and paste of ""Taken"" like some people seem to believe. It was unique, creative, and a good deal of fun. But is it as good as other movie thrillers? No, but that's not really a bad thing. It may not be as suspenseful as other great thrillers like ""Perfect Blue"" or ""Rear Window"" but it is just as entertaining. ""Non-Stop"" had a few pretty silly moments and it did drag on a little longer than it really needed to, but it still did its best to keep from losing focus and keep the audience entertained. Is it an absolutely amazing movie? No. Is it a well done movie? Yes. Is it Oscar worthy? No and I don't think it's really meant to be. It's a decent thriller film that does prove to be a great time at the movies. The story is good, the action is good, most of the characters are forgettable but likable, and Liam Neeson is, well, Liam Neeson.

"Starts off promisingly, but loses its way and let down completely by a mess of a last third","'Non-Stop' did have potential. With an intriguing premise, and great actors like Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore, what could go wrong? Sadly, while 'Non-Stop' did do some things right it also did a lot of things wrong as well. One of those films where a good but not great film turned into a mediocre and disappointingly uneven one in the last third.The film does look great, the cinematography is slick and often adds to the atmosphere created, the lighting is moody and neither garish or drab, the special effects are good and don't overload the film in quantity and the confined location is well-chosen and creates a genuine sense of claustrophobia, a feeling maintained for two thirds of the film. The score is also suitably moody, not sounding too obvious or manipulative.Neeson is a very strong, commanding and appropriately stoic presence, and doesn't lag too much at all in the more action-oriented parts. 'Non-Stop' is atmospherically directed too, and the film is quite good and watchable for two thirds of the duration, the pace takes its time but didn't feel too draggy and there was plenty of suspense and tension with great use of misdirection.However, the rest of the cast don't make much of an impression. Moore does do her best and she isn't bad but her character didn't feel needed to the story and added little. Chemistry with Neeson was bland. Of the supporting cast, the best performance came from Linus Roache, but his role is not big enough to shine properly. The rest consist of either talented actors who have nothing to do (Michelle Dockery and especially the completely wasted Lupita Nyong'o) or those who overplay or underplay (didn't buy the villains' performances for a second).'Non-Stop' is most let down by a mess of a last third. Not that the film was perfect up to then, because it wasn't, with a less than stellar supporting cast, the film lacking some momentum in the second half onwards and a patchy script. The last third really underwhelms in nearly every way, it is here where the film particularly loses momentum, the dialogue is particularly hammy (that speech in particular) and it goes overboard in implausibility and lack of credibility, while the final solution is underdeveloped, overplayed and incoherently convoluted.All in all, promising start and not bad for two thirds of it but the last third really let things down. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent airplane film!,"I loved flying. Before. Now I hate it. It is more dangerous then first thought. It is not the planes, they are safer now then before. It is the people. Flying public has changed. And I do not like it, plus I do not like some of the pilots. Some of them I do not trust.Do you think it was a coincidence that LH 370 was lost on the same day when this film opened in Vietnam? At the right point of crossing from Malayisan into Vietnamise airspace? I do not think it was a coincidence. Unfortenatelly, in this case Hollywood*s power showed itself to be fatal to some 200 plus passengers of a doomed flight. Such a pity! Planes were designed to connect people and make them love each other. Over the years they became deadly weapons.As far as the film goes, it is a very entertaining airplane film, acting is excellent, Liam Neeson has become a great star.

Everyone is suspicious to the main character and to the spectator.This is a perfect thriller, with a pretty good story line, unlike most action movies.*** Not a spoiler but : It looked like they were looking for a way to end this movie quickly which made the ending a little bit rubbish. Since the ending was quick, the movie is still great in general and I would recommend it as a great suspense.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

legit hi-concept film that (mostly) works,"A hi-concept script generally refers to a story so outrageous that even the writer doesn't believe it. The intent is to bamboozle and mystify the viewer so thoroughly that the attention is held for the duration. This film checks all the boxes. There are literally moments here, lots of them, when you cannot believe you are still watching. Yet if you stick it out to the very end, you may feel slightly bemused, possibly even entertained.

Liam Neeson is perfect,"I admit to watching all of the post-Taken Liam Neeson films. It's quite a sensational career pivot that many others have since tried and failed to achieve. Neeson has the ability to elevate any movie he is in effortlessly and carries all these films like the true legend he is. He didn't need to make these movies, but we are all better for him having this late career resurgence.Non-Stop is one of my favourites of these films that isn't Taken. The supporting cast are excellent from the co-pilot, to the arrogant passenger who keeps getting in Neeson's way.It's also, understandably, a film critics have to hedge their bets on for a review so they're all mostly 5/10. There are a lot of flaws and plot holes and things that make absolutely no sense, but it's carried off with such commitment that it is more charming than frustrating.I highly recommend - you will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Non-Stop may not be as relentless as its title suggests, but it is undeniably entertaining.","I despise the title of this film. Automatically brings out connotations of blandness and genericness, kind of like a Straight-To-DVD low budget action film starring Bruce Willis or Nicholas Cage. However, the Neeson and Collet-Serra combination is a winning formula as this is yet another fun ride. A damaged Air Marshal is trapped in a murderous mystery where he must transfer $150 million to a bank account. If he doesn't, a passenger will meet their demise every 20 minutes until he does so. All of this happens on board a long plane journey. It works, it works so well. Very reminiscent to 'Flightplan', but far more focussed on the characters. Like with any mystery, the list of suspects need to be developed to a point where the final reveal shocks you. Given the small runtime, I believe the character developments were adequate. Their backstories and motives are naturally revealed. It's not a case of our protagonist interviewing each one in turn, he instead provokes them and addresses the passengers as one entity. Sure there are times where he questions individuals, which is necessary to identify possible suspects, but that cannot be avoided. I appreciate the small details in these characters. Moore's vulnerability is shown as she explains why she sits on the window seat, our Air Marshal's troubled past is revealed which questions the authenticity of his actions. It's very twisty, full of turns and a meticulously thought out narrative. The final reveal and motives are slightly blurred and unmemorable, although I was still on the edge of my seat...even after my fifth viewing! The claustrophobic environment adds to the suspense and tension. Liam Neeson still thrives on his rejuvenated action career. I did roll my eyes at the end where he was saving the little girl, makes his character arc far too predictable. Non-Stop is not going to fly away as a classic thriller, but it lands with such confidence that it's hard not to enjoy this.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"One of the best hijacking films, and one of the very good ones of Liam Neeson. Intelligent plot, great acting, lots of suspense!","Hijacking movie. One of the best hijacking films and one of Liam Neeson's very good ones. Neeson, a federal police officer in charge of international flight safety, begins receiving in-flight messages from an anonymous terrorist that if they don't give him $150 million, he'll start killing one passenger every 20 minutes. Neeson is desperately trying to track down who he is, while several of the other passengers are beginning to believe that he is hijacking himself and this information is also leaked out of the plane. The real hijackers had it all planned it in detail to blame Neeson for that. A unique hijacking thriller, with excellent performances and plenty of suspense throughout the film without tiring at all. Excellent work overall. It's recommended to everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Boring beginning, good middle, poor ending","This movie ran the gambit going from slow, to entertaining, to laughable. By the end, the viewer is certain that the writers fell into the common Hollywood trap of writing and selling the script before figuring out an ending.The first twenty minutes or so were terribly slow (we were falling asleep in the theater).After about 20 minutes, it picked up into a decent combination of an action and mystery movie (i.e., a who-dun-it with violence). When watching, one has to work pretty hard to suspend disbelief, and not think too hard about the characters' motivations.The movie does pretty well up until about the last 15 minutes. At that point, it becomes clear that the writers (John W. Richardson and Christopher Roach) lacked a vision of how to end their story. The characters' reactions and comments become so unfathomable that your thinking ""nobody would ever do/say that"". I was left questioning of whether any of the characters were paying attention to what had just happened. The characters' comments during the epilogue make it clear that either the movie was shot out-of order or the ending was not rewritten to reflect changes in the script.I only knocked off a point for the poor ending. It did not degenerate into a speech about saving the rain forest (kudos of you get that reference) but it left a lot to be desired.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A poor attempt at thrilling,"Liam Neeson has single handily created a new career path for ageing actors to go into action movies. Non-Stop is a kind of action thriller but with a mystery thrown in there too, it can't quite make it's mind up which of the three it truly wants to be though. It all revolves around an air marshal (Neeson) who is on a routine flight from New York to London; the flight soon turns ugly though. The story is basically about a mysterious passenger threatening to kill other passengers unless they get the money they want, if not then someone will go every 20 minutes. Of course Liam Neeson's character isn't going to just take his seat and watch as everyone dies, no he is going to go kind of crazy and try to save everyone but also find out who is behind this sinister plot.The film for me is a poor one, easy to watch yes but lacks in any decent substance, you certainly can turn your brain off for over 100 minutes though. The movie tries to be smart and that is where it fails, it tries to thrill and also fails and although the quest to finding who is behind the plot is exciting, it never quite is matched by anything else. Liam Neeson goes full on with the action in the style most recently some have become accustomed too, it never goes over the top and that I can respect it for but the plot is no great one. I very much disliked the ending which is so sort of stupid even that it brings this from being a pretty mediocre film to being just plain poor and below-par.Liam Neeson is actually not bad in his role, he kind of mumbles a lot and isn't given the best lines it has to be said but nevertheless the action scenes he does are well choreographed and done well from Neeson himself too. Julianne Moore makes a random appearance as a fellow passenger and is the person sitting next to Neeson as the plot unfolds so of course she is dragged into the story too. The most random appearances have to go to Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyong'o who just seem to dawdle an awful lot and really didn't even need to be in the plot; in fact most characters are pointless in this.Jaume Collet-Serra directs and he doesn't do much to make this good, you know the script isn't half bad in terms of how the story plays out but Collet-Serra doesn't bring the story to life enough and it ends up too dull in certain ways. The thrilling parts of the movie (the thrills that are good that is) are usually scenes that contain the score from John Ottman who does a good job of at least trying to make us pumped up or want to know more about the mystery, the film can never quite grab you enough to really make you interested though so you're left kind of hanging as the ending comes up.Overall a pretty dire movie actually, it's nowhere near awful of course and I would even recommend it to those who enjoy a good if not basic thrill. Fans of Liam Neeson you may also enjoy this, if I had to recommend one of Neeson's recent travels into action movies this would not be the one I would say although moments of this can show you that Neeson really can fight pretty well on the big screen.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop suspense & thrill!,"We all thought (at least, most of us)that this was 'just-another Liam Neeson movie'. AND, I justtt realized that in fact, it is. But that doesn't stop it from being good! GREAT, in fact! Especially since I went in with not-really much expectations. Thought it was just another 'Taken'-type flick, that I might just feel averagely about it.THIS IS REALLY A SUSPENSEFUL THRILLER! Keeps you intrigued, doesn't deter from the plot even with various elements in the movie! It's not just an action movie, folks! Suspense, twists, emotional stuff, realization - all those happen! There's Liam's bad-ass action scenes, also, of course! (One scene is really great, pretty awesome, towards the end) But this is surprisingly good!

A Pleasant Surprise,"On entering the movie theater it must be said that I was in the exact same mindset as the other 400 sitting alongside me; ""Just another blockbuster - i'm only here cos its got Liam Neeson in it"", and while the lead protagonist was the star of the show (giving his best big- screen performance since Taken), the true genius of the film chose not to rely on the star-studded cast (including Oscar-nominee Julianne Moore) but came down to the crafty nature in which the plot was unraveled, utilizing ambiguity and unpredictability to the greatest effect. Leaving no stone unturned, the audience are Neeson's ally for the whole journey, knowing just as much as he does and shitting themselves with panic of much a similar capacity.No film is without its flaws however and Non-Stop is no exception, with a repetitive screenplay that throws in several cringe-worthy one-liners, it could be argued that the script is the main factor holding the cast back from unleashing their full potential. But they do with it what they can, and once you get over the unrealistic (yet utterly thrilling) action sequences, you might just see the picture for what it really is: a smart, white-knuckled roller coaster ride that keeps audience members hanging off the edge of their seat for the whole of the thrilling experience - Non-Stop Entertainment!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pass the Popcorn! review,"Who else saw the trailer for Non-Stop and thought, ""oh dear, here's another movie that will make me feel ashamed when I go buy the tickets for it, I'll probably give it a low grade and write a negative review about it – what a waste of time and money!""? I hope it wasn't just me. I mean, an action movie, set on a plane, and the main character is played by Liam Neeson. Not my kind of movie, to be honest. I just couldn't understand what Julianne Moore was doing in the movies, as she's a good actress. Well, it turns out Non-Stop is actually a good movie that managed to keep me interested all the way. I was never bored and some scenes and twists even surprised me. My apologies to the movie makers for my jumping to conclusions!In Non-Stop, Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, a U. S. Federal Air Marshal, and a divorced alcoholic who doesn't like flying. On the flight from New York to London, he meets Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), who asks him about his private life in order to relieve the fear he feels while the plane is taking off. While over the Atlantic, Bill receives a message on his secure phone from an unknown person who threatens to kill one person every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a bank account. Bill asks the other air marshal on the plane, Jack Hammond (Anson Mount), for help, but they get into a fight and to save himself Bill kills Jack – at the 20 minutes mark.Why did I presume this would be a bad movie? Well, first of all, it's an action movie. More often than not, little effort is put in creating an interesting and original story to accompany the action scenes in an action movie, and you get a Steven Seagal movie – which means a boring collage of shootouts, explosions and deaths. Fortunately, Non-Stop didn't make this mistake: its story isn't original, but it's entertaining and gripping, and the non-action scenes aren't just tedious fillers – you can actually enjoy the movie as a whole, as it doesn't rely exclusively on action. Of course, there are some cheesy and silly scenes, but they don't ruin the overall enjoyment this movie provides; they just temporarily relieve the tension in the scene.In action movies, acting can be bad, because who cares about the actors as long as there's guns and fire and car chases and bad guys dying? Again, Non-Stop avoided this trap gracefully. Liam Neeson is good, most of the time, Julianne Moore is great in every scene, and none of the other supporting characters feels unnecessary or acts bad. The only disappointment may be represented by the villain, who, when finally discovered, doesn't really have time to leave an intimidating impression, and whose motives are kind of silly and unbelievable. It would almost have been better had he remained faceless throughout the movie, but this wouldn't have made much sense. Overall, Non-Stop is a good action movie whose flaws are easy to ignore, and I'd recommend it for a Friday evening with friends.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No Pit stop,"Which kinda would be difficult since this plays in midair. Liam Neeson would obviously never have guessed he'd become an action hero this late in his career, but Taken did push him into things like this. There was also The Grey which felt a bit like The Thing from Carpenter but with different kinds of beasts. The question this raises is: Is Liam Neeson a beast himself (well the character he's playing)? Depending on your view on things, this may be interesting.We get a few clichés, though I have to admit, I did not see one of the things coming. The guessing game is not a bad one, even though it does stretch the logic bit a little. But the movie is fast paced and has a thrilling edge to it, so it won't bore you. A nice thriller that does everything it is expected to do. More than good entertainment value. Nothing less, nothing (much) more",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
great film,one of the better films of the last few years with a very good cast of Liam Neeson and Julian Moore who are some of the best actors around i was glad to see this film as it was a change from a no story driven action flick with people blowing up for no reason with this very good film which is certainly not over the top and is set on a plane which i think is good as you have to keep asking your self how did he kill him/her. the plot bases around a air marshal [ Liam Neeson ] on a plane and suddenly he receives a text message from a mysterious person who tells him that if there isn't a lot of money put into a bank account he will kill someone every 20 minutes,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Plane Has Been Taken,"Liam Neeson continues to bear his straightforward action star talents that was famed by Taken. This time it takes place on a plane and unsurprisingly he has to beat up some bad guys there. We're always fine by it, but Non-Stop is the one that it's hard to take seriously. It does have a great setup, but ends up making silly tricks through the third act. It's not a bad thing, in fact the film takes plenty of clever choices to bring out its tension, even if the revelations of the mystery have gone absurd. Non-Stop is the kind of simple action film that pushes the limit of its ridiculous and by that, it's fun.Before all the twists and turns, there is this intellectual intro. The camera focuses on every passenger assuming that one of them could be the suspect. We don't have any knowledge about the characters until they entered the plane. What's smart in this case is the beans are allowed to be spilled when they exactly needed to. It's a shame that their answers turn out to be the silliest things you would get in any basic thriller. But the tension is inevitably effective. The direction just keeps the bad things happening in the oddest ways possible to make it feel so surreal.Even the characters are a lot smarter at the first half. The passengers having awareness on the situation gives a secondary conflict for Bill Marks to deal with. How the problems are solved are either too easy or something that are senseless. Despite of that, the ride is quite fun, even if it also inappropriately includes humor in some critical moments. The acting helps to brim up the suspense. In every action Liam Neeson makes, it always have to be interesting. He's also backed up with actors who gives a lot personality to point fingers at him.Non-Stop would have been as smart as its setup, it just couldn't regress from the standard action movie storyline. And there, it ends with a silly bang. Although silly, it's undeniably enjoyable which lead to instant forgiveness for its twists, because definitely its only ambition is to excite and it succeeds by being creative to its thrills. It still leaves a couple of holes in the end, but then no one seem to matter. The ride already provides enough tension and energy to make things worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Gimme A Break,"Liam Neeson is one of my favorites. I like almost any picture he is in. He's believable and has an expressive face that makes you root for him no matter what the circumstance. But ""Non-Stop"" must be his weakest and most preposterous feature and it makes you wonder what was he thinking to accept a part in this crappy movie.The premise is extremely far-fetched and as the picture progresses so do the ridiculous plot devices, until the lame and surreal ending - but that was just the icing on the cake for me.

Great thriller/mystery movie,"""Pure non-stop action"" is what seems to be the main motif to Liam Neeson's movies now. This was certainly marketed and perceived by most people as such. I beg to differ with this one.The acting is above-par with what you would see in the average popcorn action flick. The title itself certainly indicates that this is an action movie that never stop moving, which is true, but it has less to do with non-stop action. This movie is all about mystery.It is a cleverer movie than Taken, albeit Neeson plays a very similar role. However the suspense and questioning of all the passengers on board makes this movie more akin to Flightplan. It is the basis of being trapped with no means out and being the only person onboard who is convinced of what is truly happening.The action in the movie is certainly worth the watch, having close quarters fighting that makes for very interesting fighting styles in the enclosed spaces. Neeson also appears larger than ever with his 6'4"" frame towering over everyone on the plane.A very solid movie with great twists and turns that is slightly better than the Neeson flicks he's been typecast in since Batman Begins & Taken.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quite a surprise here...,"""Non-Stop"" didn't really have me lured in by the synopsis alone, and the fact that this was a thriller set on an airplane and starring Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore, didn't really win me over either. But still I decided to give the movie a go.And now that I have seen it, I can honestly say that ""Non-Stop"" turned out to be exciting and thrilling non-stop. The movie starts out great and picks up pace, quickly becoming a roller-coaster thrill ride. The movie director, Jaume Collet-Serra, actually managed to put together quite a story here and a well-directed movie.All throughout the entire movie you have no idea who is the person responsible, and you are constantly sitting there wondering just whom amongst the passengers or crew is the culprit, or if it is not actually air marshal Bill Marks himself. The movie leaves you totally in the dark, having you guessing and speculating, which actually was a good thing. And once the veil is lifted and it was revealed, it was done with an intricate touch that left the unveiling fulfilling and exciting.The acting in the movie was actually quite good, and despite the fact that the entire movie does take place inside an airplane turned out not to be a hindrance to the movie itself.If you enjoy a thrilling movie that keeps you guessing and works your nerves and thrills, then ""Non-Stop"" is well worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fast paced thriller in the skies,"I hate when a film is badly advertised. It's one of those things that can kill a decent movie or even bury a great movie. Because of Taken when someone sees Liam Neeson kick ass all over the place the first thing they think is this is going to be an action movie. So when the ads for Non-Stop first came out I thought it might be Taken on a plane. I was wrong but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Actually in this one case, the bad advertising doesn't harm the film too much.Neeson plays a rough, drunk of a US marshal on a non stop flight to London. When he gets a text that if $150 million dollars aren't placed in a bank account in twenty minutes after the flight takes off, a passenger will die. Then the clock resets until the money is paid. That's when the audience and Neeson go on the hunt to figure out who is doing this. But with this kind of movie the why doesn't really matter. And as usual, the why is explained in a speech given by the villain during the finale.I had my doubts about the film. The thought of Taken on a plane was pretty cool. Especially when the trailer ended with that zero gravity shot of Nesson with gun in hand. The film is directed by Jaume Collet- Serra who teamed up with Neeson for the dreadful Unknown. When I heard he was the director I thought twice about Non-Stop.The film moves at a quick pace, with the entire audience trying to figure out who is doing it. The thriller aspect is in high gear. A few moments I was on the edge of my seat. Nesson is perfect in this role. He's tough, grizzled and at times emotional. We all know the man can act. It's nice he brings some of that acting after he's killed bad guys and yelling at people. The supporting cast does their job with what they have. Jullianne Moore brings a bit of humanity to her role. It seems as if all these passengers have a back story, some which get explained by them and other by Neeson after some digging.This is one of those thrillers where the clues are given to you to figure out who has done in the first few moments but the filmmakers realize they want you for the full ride. There's not much action other than two fights, one which is a pretty impressive hand to hand brawl in a bathroom. And of course there is the chaotic finale with has a few explosions and some shots fired. As long as there isn't too much deep thinking the film goes for the swift ride with some thrills. It's in the vein of Passenger 57 and Snakes on a Plane.For the most part Neeson more than makes up for the awful Unknown with this thriller that has a decent premise, some okay supporting characters and Neeson being pretty awesome he usually is. I haven't seen The Grey but of his action films I would put this third or fourth behind that and Taken. I walked out of the theater with a grin on my face quoting Key & Peele, ""Liam Neesons is my sh...!"". That must be a good thing.Quick Review: Non-Stop is a fast moving thriller with Liam Neeson doing what he does best. The thrills are quick and enjoyable. There is a decent hand to hand fight and a fun final action scene. Other than being advertised wrong, this film is fun for a good 90 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Arockin and arolling on the cannonball express,I like the new tough Liam Neeson who has been thumping his way through action movies since Taken. He has some appeal for this middle aged viewer who struggles to relate to the younger action heroes. In Non-Stop he once again plays the hard bitten divorced Dad figure who faces a personal and career crisis as he attempts to stop a hijacking onboard a transatlantic jet. Julianne Moore plays an attractive but vulnerable woman he sits next to on the plane. These two are beginning to remind me a bit of previous star pairings like Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn but updated for the modern age.

"A thrilling, yet somewhat absurd action film","When an action film offers an interesting premise along with Liam Neeson as the leading man, one expects nothing short of an exciting and enjoyable experience, and Non-Stop does prove satisfying, even if somewhat nonsensical. In large part, the audience is exposed to great levels of unpredictability and very mysterious circumstances, as an air marshal attempts to save his fellow passengers on a trans-Atlantic flight from a terrorist attack. The film is gripping and thrilling throughout, with plenty of tense moments maintaining the feeling of suspense, however it certainly deserved a much more clever final act, rather than concluding as a conventional action film. Although Liam Neeson does again perform well in a leading action role, one cannot help but argue that the rest of the cast, which included such notable names as Julianne Moore, should have been utilized far better. Overall, Non-Stop comes across as an enthralling action film with a rather ludicrous storyline, which is initially well-developed but unfortunately seems to lack a fitting end.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

When you leave, you feel comfortably and gladly reacquainted with the ground and head up, ready for a fresh new look on things. That's what Non-Stop makes you do. A movie about holding the audience on a string over a volcano. It cleans your mind and gives you a fresh start seemingly. That's what February movies should do, and what the best ones do.

Good straight suspense,"This is straight from the heart of Hollywood because no film industry on the planet comes better than Hollywood in making action suspense movies.

The guy is suddenly on a rescue mission and the suspense starts to build around the bad guy who is mysterious. I have always liked Liam Neeson's style, serious, mature with an elegant face and to the point on his job. In this movie he delivers that job straight.You know the movie from some point in the film (not initially) and some twists do turn the movie every minute. The bad part is, the background of the lead character was less built, his emotions were not precisely shown; well here he (Neeson) is not that kind of a guy either and then an average & predictable ending.On and on, the suspense works fairly but the movie does not relate to its title, Liam Neeson's acting is again good and lastly its good 106 minutes if you don't have better choices in the shelf for now.6/10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Perfect pizza movie: some ham, plenty of cheese, needs a beer but enjoyable at the time..","Bish. Bash. Bosh. Kaboom. Bang. Get down, motherfuThat's Non-Stop. Don't gripe, don't bitch about it. If you want something cerebral, mind-spinning or morally and emotionally challenging, why not take a punt on Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac Volumes I & II? Predictably, far fewer cinemas offered me a chance of the latter, so mindless, fun Non-Stop it was! Non-Stop sees Liam Neeson escape Legoland and team up with his Unknown director, Jaume Collet-Serra, for the second time (their third outing, Run All Night, is already in post production) in another action thriller romp with guns, suspense and heroics aplenty.Air marshall Bill Marks (Neeson) receives a text on his secure phone while on a transatlantic flight demanding a ransom of $150 million be deposited in an off-shore account within twenty minutes. Failure to deliver will result in the death of a passenger. Marks contacts his superiors but, viewing him as damaged goods, nobody believes him. Nobody, that is, except for air hostess Nancy (Michelle Dockery) and even she isn't quite sure.Non-Stop begins like a 1970s disaster flick (think The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno) with a mini tour of the principal players including Marks' fellow passengers Jen (Julianne Moore), Tom, (Scoot McNairy), Zack (Nate Parker) and Nancy's colleague, Gwen (Lupita Nyong'o, fresh from her Oscar-winning turn in 12 Years a Slave) so that you know the villain has to be amongst them somewhere.There are plenty of plot holes in Non-Stop, it's almost as unrealistic as Denzel Washington flying a plane upside down in Flight, and Collet-Serra cannot resist swimming in cheese in the final act, but for the most part there is enough tension and intrigue to keep the viewer alert and guessing. It is almost everything you want from a thriller with plenty or excitement in the confines of a small aircraft and, even though you know everything is going to be just peachy in the end, it's a ride of bumpy thrills that won't put you off your pizza.Neeson has convincingly picked up the baton dropped by Harrison Ford and proves yet again to be an everyman hero and pretty good eye-candy to boot. There's nothing here to write home about performance wise and though you can evidently take the girl out of Downton Abbey, I'm not convinced you'll ever take Downton Abbey out of Michelle Dockery but she gets away with it here. As for Moore, she's providing the ham to go with the cheese.No, Non-Stop isn't very believable but it is a most(ly) enjoyable romp for a Friday night after a week of brain ache.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Really great action movie,"I've just seen this movie after winning tickets for the ""avant-premiere"" here in Montreal, and I can tell you that it's worth it!!! Action from the beginning to the end, great special effects and outstanding cast!! Being a fan of Neeson since Schindler's list, I think it's one of his best!! The story is awesome as well, telling us about the past of the main character and his self-control of the situation. Neeson, even at almost 62, is in great shape and the producers had really the good idea to cast him. If you see this movie in a plane, you better fasten your seat belt!

He is up in the air with only a few hours left before the plane starts plummeting towards the water. Is it the NYC cop? The gruff business man? The two lovers sitting behind him?To some extent, you feel like you are watching another version of the board game CLUE.

That's very tragic and I think it's sweet that he's obviously so heartbroken, I am glad that I have no idea how much it must hurt to lose someone who is the center of your world like that.The movie is great and you get what you expect and what the trailer promises.

It's only entertainment,"There's a whole sub-genre of movies based around trouble in an airliner - think of the four ""Airport"" films of the 1970s, the two ""Airplane"" comedies of the 1980s, the action- thrillers ""Passenger 57"" (1992) and ""Flightplan"" (2005), the real life account of ""United 93"" (2006) or even the hilarious ""Snakes On A Plane"" (2006). So don't expect anything too original from ""Non-Stop"", set almost entirely on a flight from New York to London on the fictional airline Aqualantic.At the centre of the action is air marshal Bill Marks who - like the pilot in ""Flight"" - has a past fuelled by alcohol. What give ""Non-Stop"" an element of class is that Marks is played by Liam Neeson who is a serious actor - brilliant in the eponymous roles of ""Michael Collins"" and ""Schindler's List"" but latterly turning to action roles (the two ""Taken"" movies""). Julianne Moore is also around as one of the suspect passenger to add a little gravitas.As entertainment, this is a fun enough film. At the time, the tension is maintained and the twists keep coming but, on reflection, little of the narrative makes much sense - but, if it did, air travel would be less safe, so let's enjoy the ride.",,Anonymous,Mystery

High-octane suspense film aboard a transatlantic flight,"Liam Neeson stars with unsubtle drive in this high-octane suspense film about a possible high-jacking aboard a transatlantic flight. Although the film doesn't have much to offer in terms of afterthought, and will probably pass you by like a plane overhead, it maintains an incredible tension for its entire running time, inviting you to non-stop (sic) puzzles and perils and playing on your entire emotional register. Director Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan, Unknown) finds a vein of realism in an otherwise unlikely situation; he's concerned with how real people would think and act in a situation like this, and this is why Non-Stop works so well, because the entire effect of the film is putting the audience in the same situation as the people on this plane. Liam Neeson may be about to typecast himself (Taken, Unknown, Taken 2, etc.), but he's one of those performers who seem more authentic the more extreme the situation is, which incidentally is ideal for this part.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Did its job perfectly,"The point of 99.99% of all (primarily) action movies is to keep the viewer entertained, at the edge of his/her seat and keep them guessing.

My friends and I had no complaints with the script, except for literally two lines, which came off as a tad cheesy, but that's nothing. A definite must see movie, especially if you love action themed movies. Without a doubt, this movie lands in my top 3 favorite action movies of all time...until now, of course. If you watch/have watched this movie and (have) liked it, a similar movie which I would also recommend is Source Code.

"Non-Stop could have been a great movie, if not for its rather disappointing end.","With Liam Neeson soaring high as a legitimate action hero and gradually intense plot, Non-Stop could have been great, but the asinine final act undermines its thrilling build up. The movie boasts many talented cast, its cinematography dances around in such tight space, and it produces a sense of inescapable situation well. For most part, the story holds together, weaving seemingly impossible feats of crime above the sky, only to falls later with far-fetch conclusion, perhaps inspired by older Samuel L. Jackson's movie of the same premise.Concept of being trapped and threatened mid-flight is used in an intriguing fashion. Tension escalates nicely and in familiar small inescapable space, the struggle will be relatable to the audience. Characters are introduced swiftly with skillful editing, its cast does good job on keeping the exhilaration going. At most times, the movie ventures into psychological thriller realm, connecting riddle after riddle. In contrast of more action heavy movies Liam Neeson has done in recent years or what the poster may suggest, the action takes a backseat in exchange of more intellectual coping of the characters in the predicament.Liam Neeson as Bill Marks, moves and acts with necessary vigor, he's a good action hero with reliance on mental fortitude instead of muscle strength alone. Julianne Moore does well as Jen Summers, an unlucky passenger who's caught up in Bill's unyielding search of the culprit. She looks very natural, quite a charming innocent bystander, yet peculiarly frantic enough at some times to arouse suspicion. The rest is decent, including rising star Lupita Nyong'o, they ensure a colorful personalities among the characters as they portray quite believable reactions, up to a point.The director gives good perspective in confined rooms. Camera angle shows restriction, but still enough for the scenes to be enjoyable without feeling too clustered. At more ardent sequences the camera even makes continuous shot of the event, which is pretty impressive considering things can get hectic. Little details, such as floating HUD of cellphones or display of the surveillance cameras provide easy viewing for the audience, without having a protagonist narrates everything clumsily.Its main problem is its ending. As the movie progresses with elaborate schemes, you'd be most likely invested in the story, thus hoping for a clever fascinating conclusion. Sadly, it is not so. The movies somewhat loses fuel in the end, even resorting to absurd plot twist as fume. This is a very hackneyed solution, one which decreases the excitement from the build up significantly.

This film won't be winning any Oscars, and it isn't a remarkably original premise but, for a movie of its kind, it was fantastic. I have watched a couple other movies like this, where people are dying/disappearing on a plane and the protagonist must find them before they kill/kidnap someone again. They were all very dull and forgettable. This movie had twists I did not expect, an interesting conclusion, and it had consistent action, even through the mystery aspect.There are better movies in theaters today, but if you really want to see a mystery-thriller-action movie that takes place in a plane, you have very specific desires, all of which will be entirely satisfied by this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The initial premise for this film is very clever but ultimately the twist fails to deliver and seems a little far from practical within the Universe the film creates. While I can quite easily forgive Liam Neeson taking on another middle aged man dealing with personal issues. These roles are clearly the best way for him to vent his own anger for the awful personal bereavement he himself has experienced, and why not, he plays these roles so well. Less forgiving is the film ultimately failing to deliver on the premise it sets up so well. That said, the film is never boring. The writing cleverly points and re points to the possible killer, even though I was pretty sure I knew who it would turn out to be early on and I wasn't wrong.The supporting actors do a great job too, this is an enjoyable romp, nothing more.

Decent thriller 2/3 of the time turns into a bad action film,"Liam Neeson is a talented actor who has been known to give his characters an additional boost. So it was with this film, his character was down to earth with his complications, which was a big plus for the film.However, while the thriller part of the film lasted for approximately 2/3 of the film and its plot was rather good, there were a few holes in the plot that caused it to be 7/10 thriller.The real problem is with the way the film progressed towards the end. It recycled all the bad clichés of action films and in fact ruined the film. Any sort of realism that had ruled the thriller part of the film was thrown into the garbage bin. Quite frankly, it felt as if screenwriter got fired and was replaced by someone whose task was to copy ideas from popular action films. As a result the remaining plot started to resemble Swiss cheese (holes in every direction) and the role of the main character could have been played by Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren or any of the other action stars who cannot act.In that respect I left the theater A) laughing at the stupidity of the plot B) disappointed at the waste of money/time.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The usual suspects,"This is one of those things, tolerable to watch because it moves fast, mind-numbing to think about, but the trick here is that you either make it taut enough so that we don't mind, or so ridiculous that minding makes you feel like a sourpuss. Con Air.The main idea is promising; an air marshal gets mysterious texts by someone on board the flight who demands money wired to an account or passengers start dying. They bangle this, because they try to shoehorn the idea that our guy may be the hijacker, and a loud subtext about absolute authority in the skies that has gone haywire and may be itself to blame, so they have the protagonist act like an out-of-control fool who can think of no subtler way of searching passengers than to have the whole cabin put their hands up!This isn't a complaint about realism, no one has time for that. Someone might do that, another not. It's about the potential way you'd like to see something unfold.

The twist is that the mystery culprit is making it look as if Marks is the actual extortionist and may even be making Marks carry out some of the killings for him.""Non-Stop"" works well enough within the limited confines of both the setting and the hostages-held-for-ransom genre of which it is a part.

Despite minor letdowns here and there, it never seemed to matter much because from start to end, the movie just flows with suspense that keeps your mind fixed on the mystery itself.The unique premise in its own is the strong foundation of this film. With the idea of a mystery killer in the middle of a flight high up in the air, all that needs to be done is to translate that to the screen, and it will be thrilling. The good news is, the production team did just that, and it succeeds where it needs to be. Every minute from when the culprit sends the first message, you just can't take your eyes off the screen, and you just can't help the feeling that in an enclosed space like this, and the killer is seeing our hero's every move and could possibly kill him at any moment. That feeling is what we pay this film for. They keep you guessing, and they keep you worried for the sake of our protagonist.Some characters were pretty likable, while most of the cast portray them brilliantly. And you just can't hate Liam Neeson. He has that brilliance and charisma on screen, that you just want to root for him at every moment. The comedy gives some necessary laughs in between tenseful moments, and the drama of some of the characters gives for a more meaningful story.

The Best of Jaume Collet-Serra,"The collaboration between Liam Neeson and the director Jaume Collet- Serra spans three movies : ""Unknown""(2011), ""Non-Stop""(2014) and ""Run All Night""(2015). Having seen all of them, I can certainly say that ""Non-Stop"" was the most enjoyable, at least to me. Although the plot is a bit generic, during the film some characters are given more depth and some twists happen.Liam Neeson is Bill Marks, a ex-NYPD cop turned into a US Air Marshall. With an haunted past, Bill is a sour man who refugees himself in alcohol to continue living his life.All the film takes place on a plane travelling for New York to London. When the plane is crossing the Atlantic, Bill receives a text message from an unknown passenger who threatens to kill one passenger at every 20 minutes if 150 Million Dollars are not wired to an account. Bill will do anything that it takes to protect his fellow passengers.As I remarked above, the plot is a bit generic. However, the ensemble cast is very solid, turning this movie into something more personal than the usual action flick. Liam Neeson reprises the role he has been doing for the last couple of years : The Badass. Although and despite other movies, in this one his character is given depth and real emotions. Julianne Moore is quite god as Jen Summers, a passenger with a troubled past; Scott McNairy is also very solid portraying the deceiving character of Tom Bowen; Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyong'o are remarkable as the two flight attendants; Nate Parker is a bit of a comic relief as Zack White; Jason Butler Harner was truly a revelation, as I had never seen him in other feature, as Kyle Rice.The scenes are directed very cleanly and Collet-Serra strengthens the thriller with close-up shots and very well directed action scenes which happen on very closed spaces, almost claustrophobic (30 minutes in and will be astonished by one of those scenes). The soundtrack also provides the movie some more intensity.In the end, ""Non-Stop"" is an excellent action movie with twists and turns and an amazing cast. I was quite surprised with it, never thinking it would so good.Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good action sequences marred by poor motivations,"The title NONSTOP alerts the viewer that on this flight you need to put your brain on automatic pilot.John Richardson and Christopher Roach wrote this incredibly hackneyed screenplay whereby plane flight-allergic air marshall Bill Marks - contrastingly convincingly played by Liam Neeson - goes on an NY-London flight as air marshall. Whoe there! He has been fired from the force, how could he get into the aircraft with a pistol? Or has he been fired? Flight captain Linus Roache and eye candy stewardess Michelle Dockery seem to recognize and accept him readily enough. One curiosity that had my antennae up: from the start Marks has had shady characters approach him with questions and dope. It the start of NONSTOP BS.The fact is that the entire system, including TV and computer networks at airports and in the aircraft, is against him and publicly blackballs his good name as if he could not sue them.Another incoherent detail: Julianne Moore, a great thespian, is given a rather marginal role as the woman Marks trusts implicitly after she witnesses his fear of flying and patiently pats his paws.Marks admits, however, that he has taken drugs and that he needs money. Alas, he is not the sole dirty copper on this flight: there is another whose first action is to offer a barbiturate to poor Marks, who has recently had his daughter ""taken"" (remember TAKEN 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?) by leucemia and, seemingly in answer to his prayers - even if he says nothing religious or remotely God-fearing in the entire flick - suddenly he gets a cool $150 million in his bank account.The Roach who wrote the script is partnered by Linus Roache as the too trusting and affable flight captain who ends up poisoned: with so many roaches you have to expect rubbish, and that is what the waywardly motivated characters bring to the movie... in spades. It amounts to insult to any median intelligence - which is a pity coz the fight sequences are well choreographed and shot.Besides the CGI, the single best thing about this flick is the immensely beautiful Michelle Dockery. Neeson performs credibly enough, but it was the elegant Dockery of the exquisite facial features and delightful legs that I wanted to see again and again, complete with her lovely British accent.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I watched this movie because of him and even though he doesn't beat his best performances, Liam Neeson is absolutely convincing as cold-hearted human wreck and sorrow-ridden air Marshall. It's sad that his character isn't more developed in this movie as we never get to know whom he was talking to on the telephone in the beginning for example.The story itself is nothing new but could have been more convincing. The movie starts in a great way when the alcoholic chain smoking air Marshall gets text messages via a secure network on a flight from New York City to London, England. An unknown criminal announces that every twenty minutes a passenger will die if the air Marshall won't send 150 million dollars to an untraceable Swiss bank account.After an initial suspense, the story gets a little bit ridiculous when the first victims die. The first murder could have never been planned that way by the terrorists. The second murder isn't well explained either and even the third murder feels random even though it makes more sense than the first two. These are not the only plot holes in here. At that point, the story is running in circles, though. People are dying every twenty minutes, all characters are judging too quickly and the air Marshall loses control all the time. After a promising start, one just waits for something spectacular to happen but there is nothing more to this.Of course, we will get the so-called twist in the end and know who is behind the hijackings and killings. The solution though feels half- hearted and isn't really credible. It somehow doesn't make much sense to me. For me, this moment was a little letdown and the twist is (almost) more of a deus ex machina thing than anything out-thought.What else is there to say? Liam Neeson's acting is good and some secondary actors are doing a solid job as well but the characters represent too many stereotypes. It's the same for the story that feels as if one had already watched a similar movie before.The action scenes, special effects and the soundtrack are well done. The numerous text messages on screen get quite annoying and how could anyone write that fast as it's the case in the movie anyway?In the end, fans of Liam Neeson should watch this movie without a doubt. Anyone else will get a tension filled action-thriller without any big surprises. It's an entertaining movie to watch but also the kind of film that you will have forgotten in a few months. It's nothing truly impressive but still a good average effort. Instead of showing more or less convincing Hollywood cinema, I'm asking myself why the North American and European cinemas are not showing us more memorable and poignant films from Asia, Europe or South America.I was hesitating between six and seven points for this movie. The film is not overtly original but it's entertaining and it has Liam Neeson in it. Still, I was expecting more than this and that's why I went for the lower rating. Actually, 6,5 out of ten points would have been the perfect rating for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining, but nothing you haven't seen before","I don't know what it is about airplanes in movies, but their backdrop always seem to add to the tension and sense of enclosement that the viewer feels, regardless of the source material's quality. Luckily, Non-Stop contains a rock solid script reinforced by some good acting, which ultimately delivers an entertaining movie throughout.I'm a fan of the action/mystery movies, despite the many mediocre films that unfortunately plague this otherwise interesting genre. Non-Stop was a film that kept me engaged from start to finish, and after the first 20 minutes or so, rarely lets up as the mystery unfolds before the viewer's eyes. In short, this movie centers around a misguided air marshall who is thrown into a rather precarious situation when he receives a text message from an alleged passenger threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes if 150 million dollars isn't transported to a specified bank account. Sound familiar? It should, as this general synopsys has been beaten almost to death over the years. What separates this movie from the rest is a series of intertwined mysteries that occur as the plane takes flight over the Atlantic ocean. This film really does keep you guessing throughout as to whom the ""bad guys"" may actually be, as well as what their intentions really are. It's always refreshing when you are unable to guess who the perpetrator may be in the first 30 minutes of the film, and I would venture to guess many won't have a clue until they reach the third act of the movie. The red herring literary device is used throughout the script to good effect, misleading the viewer many times before the mystery is finally discovered. This, along with some solid acting from Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore, are what makes this film shine.Now to the negatives. While I found Neeson's character interesting, I felt the part was a bit overzealous in certain situations that detracted from the overall credibility of the story. Certain scenes have Neeson's character beating the crap out of seemingly innocent passengers, and while the situation was certainly grave, I would find it hard to believe an air marshall, an alcoholic, grieving one at that, would be flipping people around aboard a commercial airliner like Steven Seagal. It is part action flick though, so perhaps im judging too hard here. Another issue I had with this film revolves around some holes in the overall plot. As you watch, certain parts of the mystery will begin to make sense, but some portions are completely left either unexplained or become irrelevant, which certainly detracts from the whole experience. Lastly, while the acting was solid, there are by no means any Academy Award winning performances. Liam Neeson seems to have settled right in as an action hero in recent years, and parts of this film have a very Taken-esque feel to it without the more intriguing setting or plot. Julianne Moore is solid, but her character is unfortunately pretty forgettable. The supporting cast performances range from good to below average.The plot certainly isn't anything new or riveting, but that doesn't mean it wasn't executed well despite this. As I said before, the fact that it takes place on an airplane in flight adds to the excitement of the film, despite the plot holes and relatively mediocre characters involved in the film. I didn't find myself seriously engaged with any of the characters involved, yet I still enjoyed the film. The mystery factor really carries this film and is by far the strong suit of the script. The writers did a good job keeping me guessing and on my toes, and I give them immense credit for taking what should be a rather mediocre film and making it quite exciting at times. Non-Stop certainly isn't one for the ages, yet it delivers solid entertainment nonetheless. I'd recommend this movie for fans of the genre, and give it a solid 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Please..no more!,"Who doesn't love a good action film? Great effects, some white-knuckle, adrenalin fueled mission against the clock with fantastic fight scenes and cracking one liners. This is not the case with Non-Stop. I honestly feel that after wasting the last 106 minutes watching this run of the mill, cheesy, completely unoriginal ""action-thriller"" that someone has to stand up and say ""Enough""! This film received an average score of 7.2 from approx 40k voters! Really?? How? The characters were completely miscast, Julianne Moore (can be great) was utterly pointless as the supporting star and Neeson..well, he is now a parody of himself and is managing to De-value his worth as a lead with every crock of crap he releases. At least Mr Neeson is predictable - Non stop is probably even worse than any of the others on his downward trajectory since Taken. The story is just ridiculous, impossibly daft. The supporting cast is crazily off, effects and fight scenes were nothing special at all and the entire film felt like it had been hurried through, hastily edited and thrown together at the last minute. My advice is Avoid. I guarantee that you will find something better to watch instead of this joke. A $50 million budget for this! I guess the world is crazy.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Misleading title, but fun nonetheless.","Alcoholic Federal Air Marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is flying across the Atlantic when he receives a text message on his phone: someone on the plane is threatening to kill a passenger every twenty minutes unless $150m is transferred to a specified off-shore account. Working against the clock, Bill desperately tries to figure out who is behind the threat, but as he pieces the clues together it slowly becomes apparent that he has been set-up to take the fall.The success of hard-hitting thriller Taken (2008) transformed respected thespian Liam Neeson into an unlikely Hollywood action hero. With a title like Non-Stop, one might reasonably expect this particular Neeson vehicle to be a thrill-a-minute, stunt-packed, white-knuckle ride from start to finish—but it isn't: it is, for the most part, a mystery, and only really kicks into action mode during the final act.While this might understandably upset those expecting more in the way of spectacular adrenaline-fuelled excitement, I found Non-Stop to be an enjoyable suspense film, albeit one riddled with plot-holes big enough to fly a passenger jet through. For the best possible experience, I advise stowing your brain in the overhead compartment before watching; before you know it you'll have arrived at the end credits refreshed and entertained.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Somewhat over-hyped thriller,"I became a Liam Neeson fan when he started his new turn as an action hero in the excellent thriller, Taken. But I think this newest entry in his recent action roles is more routine and by the numbers than what some of the enthusiastic response is giving it credit for. It is a ""bog standard"" action thriller aboard an airplane, and to me, it seemed a bit too goofy in places and overly contrived. It's not terrible by any means, but nothing special. I hope to see more interesting movies in this genre from Neeson in the future, because I still haven't seen any of his other action movies rise to the level of ""Taken"" yet.As far as special effects and set design, the movie is strong in those departments. I think the movie is actually best in its first 3rd, there is a nice style and atmosphere built up, and the movie seems quite promising at that point. Then it slowly goes downhill at an increasing rate from there. By the time the ending rolled around I found it to have become very silly and a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Liam Neeson........on a plane!!!,"'Non-Stop' is yet another action vehicle for Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra, having previously worked together in 'Unknown'. Entertaining and thrilling, but this flight is a long one.1. For the most part, the movie has a mysterious and intriguing setup. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sucked in at the beginning. The plot involves former cop and now 'Federal Air-Marshall' Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) as he reluctantly performs his duty overseeing a red-eye flight from New York to London. He soon begins to receive random and threatening text messages from a mysterious terrorist who just may be one of the passengers on board. I honestly thought the plot might have been straight forward, but it ends up being more intricate and I was pleasantly surprised.2. As interesting of a mystery this film is, it turns into more of a thriller not long after. When the unknown figure lives up to his threats, the tension begins to build as Liam Neeson races against the clock to find the killer. However, all good things must come to an end. For a movie that has a great beginning and middle, the twist that is revealed in the last third is heavily underwhelming. The film plays to it's advantage as a suspenseful thriller, but looses all momentum when it delves into the generic action realm at the end. It feels like studio interference to the original script.3. If there is one saving grace, it is Liam Neeson himself. For an actor who has jumped into action films in recent years, Neeson is still a theatrically trained actor and he delvers an exceptional performance no matter what he stars in. Julianne Moore, Corey Stoll and Michelle Dokery round out the cast. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o also appears, but she is completely misused in her role. This film was on the brink of being something more than what it was, but it all comes down to wasted potential. I personally enjoy thrillers, but I was disappointed to say the least.Even though the movie lost a lot of points for the climax, It was still an entertaining flick. If you're a fan of Liam Neeson, then no matter the flaws, this would still be on your watch-list.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Liam Neeson's action career is non-stop....and I love it,"This is pretty much what we've come to expect from Liam Neeson these days - a gruff, jaded, middle-aged man with a colored past is begrudgingly thrown into a catastrophic situation in which he can trust no one, and he must transform into the gritty action hero that we have all come to know and love. I seriously never tire of watching Liam Neeson in these roles (I get unabashedly giddy every time a new ""Taken"" is announced), and he certainly does not disappoint in ""Non-Stop."" The writers did an amazing job with a story in which you are constantly questioning who the actual villain is, which at more than one point they lead you to believe might even be Neeson himself, and you can never quite shake that shadow of doubt.The supporting cast is just as much a part of this movie's appeal, with Julianne Moore (as her usual charming self), Michelle Dockery, and Corey Stoll sporadically muscling their way to the forefront, all the while casting doubt on their own motives. My only strike against it (and it might just be my mood today, because it's not a make-or-break kind of complaint) is that it doesn't truly reach a climax of epic proportions like it seems to build up to - but that's understandable because the entire movie takes place inside an airplane, so you can't exactly build up much larger than that. All in all, though, a very enjoyable little action flick, a nice way to spend a Saturday evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
good thriller,"You can't go wrong with a Liam Neeson film, for the most part. In non- stop, he plays this down on his luck air marshal who is on this transatlantic flight he gets called on to ride. He doesn't really like to fly, odd for someone with this job. Anyhow, there was something that had happened to him and gave him a bad reputation. He's drinking, kind of a loner, down on his luck.On board the flight he starts getting text messages that people will start getting killed unless he pays ransom. Then all sorts of crazy stuff starts happening, and the movie ratchets up the suspense. you are never really sure who is good vs bad, or why this event is even really happening.Then you figure it out, and Liam Neeson gets to flex his tough guy skin again, like in Taken or some of his other recent films. Julianne Moore plays this quirky lady passenger, yep, again, Femme mysterieuse and maybe she's too weird for some reason?The suspense was good, the acting was pretty good, and the film moves quickly.

A constantly thrilling film,"This film is about a US air marshal who has to save a plane from terrorists who threaten to kill one person on the plane every twenty minutes.""Non stop"" is very aptly titled because it does deliver thrills non stop.

Solid Action Thriller,"Non-stop opens with the slow-motion slosh of Bill's whiskey bottle. Eyes bleary and bloodshot, he touches a snapshot of a young girl, then gruffly makes his way through security to the terminal. As passengers for the New York-to-London flight wait to board, he watches them with the suspicion required for the job, but also with the cynicism of a miserable man surrounded by people happier than him. Bill makes vague small talk with his neighbor, Jen (Julianne Moore), and the only thing either reveals is they both fly often. As he white-knuckles through takeoff, he explains to her, ""Some things, you never get used to.""Once the plane reaches cruising altitude, Bill receives anonymous text messages, which Collet-Serra visualizes as floating bubbles, like comic- book word balloons (unintentional foreshadowing for the silly finale, perhaps). The texter makes the standard demands: $150 million, or someone dies every 20 minutes. When Bill's supervisors on the ground learn the account for the ransom bears his name, his character and motives are called into question, although the audience will stand steadfast alongside him, for the most part.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than expected,"Since Taken, Neeson was revealed to be quite the blackhorse, perfect in the gritty action/thriller genre.

An in-flight entertainer.,"If you're in the mood for an action-thriller but don't want to re-watch any of your favorites, this is certainly an option. It has the classic elements of the genre and decent performances by the cast. As the trailer suggests it's about an air marshal (with issues) who receives threats from a passenger on board a flight, can't trust anyone and due to his poor 'bed-side manners' nobody trusts him.However, don't expect too much in terms of dialogues, and the plot builds up to a rather lame ending, lots of loopholes and purely run-of-the-mill, but if you're in the mood (or on a long and boring flight) entertaining nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop fun!,"The flight thriller ""Non-Stop"" sure has its turbulent silliness and unauthenticated features, but it still aired out its downright thrilling popcorn entertainment. Liam Neeson stars as Air Marshall Bill Marks who is pretty much a marked man in a transatlantic flight. There is an anonymous passenger on board who threatens to start killing the passengers if a large sum of money is not deposited into an account. Marks then pilots into action to save the day. Sure, you could call this flick ""Taken on a Plane"", but somehow this one worked for me. Director Jaume Collet-Sera steered the movie with intensity which kept me on the edge of my seat; so que Sera, Sera. The script sure had its flaws, but who cares; this is not a movie that flies on dialogue. Neeson was tough as nails as Marks. A underutilized Julianne Moore flies coach in this one with a supporting role as a female passenger who inadvertently gets caught up in the action; sure one always wants more from Moore, but it seems like she was just flying high and having fun with this role. "" Non-Stop"" is not a showstopper of a flick, but it won't give you much of a red eye of boredom. So hop on this cinematic flight and have fun with it. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Frustrating second half,"I really really liked the first half of ""Non-Stop"" because it was an interesting thriller with a lot of twists and turns that weren't very predictable. I've casually start watching it and I was impressed. Then the second half kicked in. In contrast with the unpredictable first half everything becomes more uninspired and dull. But the worst part is the finale itself: rushed and plot braking. Indeed the motivations of the characters are trivial in some cases, non-sense in others and the most important one is incomprehensible because the writer/s didn't know how to handle it and they choose to make a character say fast multiple words in a Eminem fashion so that the viewers maybe didn't notice that those words made no sense as a cohesive speech. For these reasons if the first half the movie was a solid 8, it became only a 6/6.5 after that second half. It's a pity because with a little more attention to the plot and the finale (that felt like suddenly cut) it could have been a very good thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I enjoyed it but US bigots won't,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was really good, the suspense was fine with me. It wasn't the best movie in the world, but from the negative reviews you can see many bigots watched and took offence at a Muslim not being the bad guy. An American was the bad guy, and they couldn't handle that. That makes this movie anti-American apparently. Whereas, when people from other countries are bad guys in other movies, it isn't considered anti- those countries by blind bigots. If a Muslim is the bad guy it's just normal and natural apparently (even though most of the crimes committed in America are done so by Americans). In y country when someone is the same background as me and committing a terrorist offence, I don't take it personally but you can see here that other people do.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ticking Time Bomb on a Plane,"Beginning with ""Taken"" in 2008, Liam Neeson has really been going to town with his yearly action films which really hit the spot among movie fans. There had been no more projects of ""Schindler's List"" level, but his latest movies had been more shallow fun and excitement for the audiences to enjoy than for the critics. With the title alone, this latest film of his, ""Non-Stop"" follows that same successful trend.This action-thriller is set in the claustrophobic confines of a passenger airplane in a trans-Atlantic flight. Bill Marks is a US Marshall. Mid-flight he begins to receive text messages in a secure line, demanding that he should get $150M deposited in a certain bank account, or else a passenger will be killed every twenty minutes until the demand is met.Because of Marks' gruff demeanor and rough ways, everyone thinks he is the hijacker! This inaccurate impression of Marks is likewise spreading beyond the confines of the plane in the news media. But Marks still had to keep his wits about him as he tries to figures out who among his co- passengers is the real culprit as the timer of a ticking time bomb is quickly running out.Liam Neeson really has flawed hero characters like Bill Marks down pat. He has the dramatic skills and the action skills to pull this off creditably and believably. This guy is really on a roll. He is incredibly busy for an actor his age (he turns 62 this year), having six more films in the works for this year and the next, including ""Taken 3"".Playing his gallery of suspects among the passengers are Julianne Moore (a lady who wanted to take the window seat beside Marks), Nate Parker (a military guy), Scoot McNairy (a school teacher), Corey Stoll (a NYC cop), Omar Metwally (a Muslim neuro-scientist). The two stewardesses were played by Michelle Dockery and surprisingly, Lupita Nyong'o (who just won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for ""12 Years a Slave"").You may need to suspend disbelief and not think too hard about the events as they transpire. You are bound to find a plot hole or two if you look too hard. Some behaviors of the passengers, and even of Marks himself, felt very unrealistic, given the situation. Actually, hearing the entire motivation behind the whole complex plot verbalized may be a downer for some people.Overall though, the situation presented was very exciting. The suspense kept you at the edge of your seats. That is the most important in a film like this, and ""Non-Stop"" achieves just that. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good Thriller With Dependable Liam Neeson,"Non Stop is an action-thriller movie starring the ever-dependable Liam Neeson in a role very similar to Taken as in a one-man show. And Liam Neeson hardly disappoints howsoever improbable and absurd the movie plot might seems. Non Stop deals with an officer played by Liam Neeson trying to find a suspected terrorist in an airplane without creating any panic or suspicion.Cast wise, Liam Neeson is perfect for the role. The fact that he is still able to carry an entire movie solely on his shoulder is testament of his immense talent. His role is very similar from performance perspective to the Taken series. He is ably supported by the support case.The movie positives clearly lies in Liam Neeson, storyline and the ability to engage the audience till the very end, where the climax works as a negative aspect of the movie.

And this one was so full of plot holes, a Swiss cheese would look solid.It's one thing to leave certain questions about the plot up to the audience, but sadly, I don't think that's why the film is confusing and has open questions.

When a Stranger Texts,"Entertaining but requires a strong suspension of disbelief. Liam Neeson is great but isn't he always? They do a pretty good job with the red herrings, even if I guessed it a little earlier than I was probably supposed to. Well, I figured this person had something to do with it, whether they were THE bad guy or just an accomplice. But they did keep me guessing at least about whether they were in it alone or not. The motive behind all of it seemed a little forced, as well. I got the feeling the writers wanted to get far more political with it than they were allowed to. I'm willing to bet there was an earlier draft that was much whinier and soapboxier. What's in the finished product is nothing to get worked up over, though. It's a decent time-killer. For those wondering, the poster shot of Neeson leaping through the air firing his gun on the plane actually does occur in the movie. It's the timing of when it occurs that is the most priceless part. Oh, and since when are flattops back in style? Nate Parker looked like Theo Huxtable in this.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tonight I liked it,"I've seen ""Non-Stop"" twice now. The first time was in the theater when it first came out. The second time was tonight on Netflix. The first time I saw it I didn't like it. I can't exactly remember what I didn't like about but I remember not liking it at all. Tonight, however, I got a big kick out of ""Non-Stop"". It's a entertaining disaster movie. I'm not a fan of Liam Neeson but he does a nice job in this movie. It's a totally ridiculous movie but Neeson plays it very straight and he has more than a handful of good moments. Neeson supporting cast is also very good. I put off re-watching ""Non-Stop"" for quite a while now. Shame on me. I shouldn't be such a snob.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As good as Taken!!!!!!!,"You usually know what you're gonna get from a Liam Neeson movie. And that is an action-packed adventure that keeps your attention throughout. What I like about his movies is three-fold: He kicks large amounts of ass, he keeps you intrigued, and the fact that they are typically under two hours. Non-Stop is no different; just like Taken the action takes place within twenty minutes from the start, and things snowball from there. Non-Stop does a good job of throwing curve balls to keep you guessing until the very end. Sure, it's not perfect, but it is one of those movies that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration. I say it is as good as Taken, with a better story, but with a little less hand-to-hand combat. Definitely a must see. Thank you!",,Anonymous,Mystery
A simple suspense-thriller that set in the altitude.,"It was an entertaining thriller set in a small surrounded area. I mean the whole movie takes place on a plane while it was flying above the ocean between two continents. As we know it was shot in a studio as much possible limited budget. Very well made movie with good support from the cast. Earlier I believed it was like the British movie 'Panic Button', except the limited passengers. If you had seen that, you would thought similar way. Anyway, it was lots better than that, except the pace.Since the movie 'Taken' most of the Liam Neeson movie's were similar type. At least all his characters were portrayed close to each others and in this movie it was not spared. Of course, there have been lots of changes made. He played as an alcoholic air marshal in this. On his duty while his plane carrying hundreds of passengers to London from New York, he gets hinted that a man on board trying to threaten the safe journey. On the midway, over Atlantic ocean he's clueless, but must find him before everything he said turn into reality. So the game begins between the good and bad. Whether the plane safely lands its destination is the movie's finale.''I always kind of liked flying, six hours in one seat and nobody can get to you.''The suspense was better than I expected. It puts the viewers to engage in solving the puzzle. So the entertainment was promised till the twist come into play. Once the it explains its mystery that was carried all the way, at that moment I felt it was not cleverly done. Slightly not a satisfied solution for curiosity it created. Because it was simple and predictable once you come to know the truth. Especially the bad guys were weak in strength to handle the good guy. Julianne Moore role was looked kind of comedy to me. I would have not agreed to do that if I was her. Anyway the story asked for pawns to draw a confusion graph while narrating the main plot. A nice mystery movie, starts well, developed well in the middle, but did not end in similar fashion. To me the conclusion could have been a better, otherwise it would have not been an acceptable action-thriller.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-stop entertainment,"(60%) An intense thrill ride that hooks you in and doesn't let go until the very final reel. It must be said that this accomplishes all that it set out to do, and is very entertaining without being overblown or too dumb. Neeson has adapted into this fine popcorn entertainer and here he's playing a role not far off ""Into the grey"". The way that it suggests that almost anyone could be the killer is its biggest strength as paranoia looms over everyone until almost the very end, and that in itself is a decent trick to pull off. It's very much a movie that's well worth a look, and is a rock-solid rental or a matinée cinema ticket, but maybe not a full price as it's good, but not brilliant.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Vidiot Reviews,"Non-StopThe easiest way to tell if there is an air marshal on your flight is to yell out: Bomb!A better way, as the air-terrorist in this thriller finds, is to start killing crewmembers.An alcoholic air marshal (Liam Neeson) aboard a non-stop flight across the Atlantic receives a text from a passenger stating that he will kill someone every 20 minutes until he gets $150M.Determined to neutralize the mysterious threat, the marshal starts targeting suspicious passengers and interrogating them.But when evidence comes to light that the marshal may be the terrorist, passengers (Julianne Moore, Jason Butler Harner) and crew (Michelle Dockery, Lupita Nyong'o) panic.An intriguing concept with a tragic lead and tons of close-combat sequences, Non-Stop seems poised to please.Unfortunately, the game's perpetrator isn't as earth shattering as hoped and the acting can be flighty.By the way, more dead passengers, means more elbow room.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

False reviews again.,"Firstly with this movie, the reason I didn't score this full marks was because some of, not much of, the acting lacked execution with certain actors and also parts of the movie lacked in terms of realism. I'd also want some further expansion on some of the characters backgrounds.Secondly, this movie still was underrated. Not only with the very strong and smiled performance of Neeson but also the movie is highly entertaining throughout and gripping enough with Neeson's character and the tension built up.I was disappointed in many reviews, because although partly fair with some negative points made, the movie deserved better. All the central focus of the story takes place on an airplane yet regardless, they made good use out of the space and the mysterious twists in the storyline kept me gripped on the outcome.All in all, another gem from Liam Neeson and another film that will be unfairly considered as one to miss.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
9/11 Overkill,"""I'm not hijacking this plane. I'm trying to save it!""Despite its shoddy CGI shots of a bogus jetliner plunging earthward with two fighter jets flanking it, the film qualifies as an extremely preposterous but thoroughly entertaining airborne mystery- thriller.At 61-years of age, rugged Liam Neeson stars as troubled U.S. Air Marshal William Marks. Not only has Marks survived the death of his cancer-ridden, adolescent daughter, but he has also experienced a devastating divorce along with the loss of his 25-year job as a New York City Police Department detective. Meantime, the unshaven Marks has deteriorated into a guilt- ridden, nicotine-addicted, alcoholic plagued by memories of his grim past.When he starts getting text messages in flight to the effect that someone is going to start killing people aboard the plane every 20 minutes, his day couldn't get much worse. Except it could. And does.For whatever reason, this plane never feels cramped and the tight spaces only come into play with the aforementioned lavatory fight scene, and even that seems like the most spacious airplane restroom of all-time. Even the multiple drop-dead deadlines aren't really played for full effect, and the decent supporting cast isn't given much to do, save for looking suspiciously at Neeson.You may need to suspend disbelief and not think too hard about the events as they transpire. You are bound to find a plot hole or two if you look too hard. Some behaviors of the passengers, and even of Marks himself, felt very unrealistic, given the situation. Actually, hearing the entire motivation behind the whole complex plot verbalized may be a downer for some people.The screenwriter team wrote an exhilarating story that really captures the audience attention from start to finish and Jaume Collet-Serra directed a solid plot that kept the movie's pace going strong, leaving no room with unnecessary fillers that tends to drag the story. There are a few camp and corny moments here and there, but the acting was realistic and believable enough to keep the movie dramatic and engaging.Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the unpredictable outcomes. This is one of Liam Neeson's better thriller films, coming 2nd to his original Taken film. For these reasons Non-Stop gets a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I felt the director could have made the film and characters more tense to keep you on the edge of your seat a little more and perhaps the parameters weren't fully explored on what could have been an amazing film.However, in saying all that it is definitely worth watching and definitely not a waste of your money or time. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"This fun, yet absurd, thriller is definitely worth a watch.","I first saw the trailer for Non-Stop while looking on the internet. I had never heard about it, but it starred Liam Neeson, so, in my mind, it was a pretty good incentive to watch the trailer. So I saw it, and I got super excited. It looked really intense, and that's exactly what I was hoping for walking in. So, did this movie satisfy? I'd say yeah. The movie satisfied pretty well. In Non-Stop, Liam Neeson plays an air marshal, who's taking a flight to London. On this flight, he gets a message from someone in a disclosed network, saying that that person will kill someone in the plane every twenty minutes. And then, lots of suspenseful happenings ensue. I use the word ""suspenseful"" for good reason, because this movie has exactly that. Non-Stop does a great job instilling tension throughout the movie, always leaving you guessing throughout. You never feel at ease throughout the movie, and the movie does well capitalizing on that. I also give props to Liam Neeson in this movie. He does splendid being an awesome, albeit broken, character. And I don't mean broken as a bad thing. I mean broken as he has struggles in his life, and he clearly shows it in the movie. Everyone, as a whole, does good in this movie, like Julianne Moore, but Liam Neeson is the real star. While there aren't many throw downs in this movie, the action is still exciting to watch. You feel every hit, every gunshot, every slice (yes, slice); it's all intense. Despite all this, there are a couple of things that bog the movie down from greatness. First is your suspension of disbelief with this movie. There is a lot in this movie that just seems unrealistic. There's no possible way for this guy to kill someone on this plan every twenty minutes exactly. I saw this movie with my dad, and even he joked about it. He said the message should've been, ""I will kill somebody on this plane every twenty-ish minutes."" Things like that kind of take me out of the movie. Also, there's nothing really that memorable about this movie. Sure, it builds tension well, but there's no scene that really stands out. I have a feeling that this movie will be easily forgotten in the future. Overall, this movie was good. It wasn't quite the ""hijacking thriller"" I was hoping for, but it was pretty darn close. Do you have to see this movie right now? No. But I would suggest you see it, because it is an enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Well, the script is not fresh, with several moments seen in other so-called plane action/disaster movies, and unreal scenes, but thanks to various awards nominees Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore and director Jaume Collet-Serra, the intensity is maintained and the course of events is not annoying or yawning to follow. Pity only that talented character actors Lupita Nyong'o and Corey Stoll had unimportant roles to play. The ending could have been more interesting (= less predictable), but as I did not guess the person of the offender and his motives, I can't complain :)Do not seek profundity, sit and enjoy the pace and performances!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""And, in an unbelievable twist...""","Liam Neeson doesn't really act anymore--he performs, and that's not the same thing, particularly when he's constantly engaged in brawls (edited for maximum impact) or giving faux-impassioned speeches of the 'you have to trust me' variety. Screenwriters John W. Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle invariably understand if you call an action movie ""Non-Stop"" it better have non-stop action, and this one does. Neeson plays a distraught, withdrawn, alcoholic U.S. Air Marshal on a flight from New York to London who discovers there's a hijacker aboard the plane--one who is cleverly mounting an airtight case against Neeson as a purveyor of justice. Despite an overly-familiar feel to the scenario, the rampant suspicion and paranoia of the piece easily gnaws at the viewer, aided and abetted by the shameless director, Jaume Collet-Serra, and the scenarists, who even give us a good-natured New York cop with a busted nose and a frightened child clutching a symbolic ribbon of hope! The plot-holes and glaring implausibilities predictably stack up, yet the intensity of the disparate personalities in this confined space high in the air works the audience over smoothly until we are putty in the filmmakers' hands. Julianne Moore is a pithy, salt-of-the-earth type who makes a good drinking buddy for Neeson (no romantic sparks), while our hero makes enough snap assessments so right on the money that he doesn't even have any explaining to do at the finale. He and the audience both come out smiling. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Red Herring on a Plane,"Hack director Jaume Collet-Serra's red herring film about a mystery passenger on a commercial flight who wants money or he/she is going to kill someone every 20 minutes and only a drunkard air marshal played by Neeson can save everyone on board. Everything you need to know about Neeson's barely one dimensional character is in the first scene of the movie. He stares despondently at a bottle of whiskey, so the man's an alcoholic. He stares into further despondency at a picture of a little girl, obviously his daughter - who's obviously a link to why he's staring into that bottle of whiskey. Top notch writing. This is also one of those films that writes itself into a corner. Every character could be or couldn't be the maniac pulling the strings and the resolution comes at no surprise, because it literally could be anyone. They could have filmed thirty different endings - each ending changing the villain and personal motivation and the preceding events wouldn't have to change a single frame and the outcome would be exactly the same. Neeson gets worked up and huffy and puffy and punches a few people, but other than that, barely anything of interest happens.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop,"Bada$$....The word thats become synonymous with Liam Neeson since his unpredictable action hero turn in 2008 with the now cult favorite ""Taken"". I often ask myself how Neeson arrived at this status but that kind of ruins a bit of the fun for me if I over think it.The action hero is a bit of an endangered species in todays Hollywood. I mean, action films are still getting made but there aren't many good ones and if there are some solid action films being made, we aren't seeing the same one actor appear in them and that is what has separated Neeson from the rest. When you think about it, Neeson and Tom Cruise (50 years old himself) are the only consistent ""action heroes"" that are constantly churning out action films that are actually quite entertaining (except for Jack Reacher...take a mulligan on that one Tom).Non-Stop is the perfect cure for the post-Oscars theater blues as for the most part during the first month or two after awards season we are treated to a major garbage-fest. Non-Stop has that familiar Liam Neeson ""Taken"" feel to it and it keeps us alert and entertained throughout the whole ride. These films are not only good for us to watch Neeson kick a$$, but these films also serve as opportunities for somewhat unknown actors to showcase their skills and get their faces out there (Corey Stoll from ""House of Cards"", Scoot McNairy (12 Years a Slave, Killing them Softly, and Lupita N'Yongo fresh off her Oscar win in ""Slave""). These actors are hoping to use films like these as a jump start and to hopefully go from unknown to not necessarily star but at least get to the point of being recognized as ""that guy from that thing"".Julianne Moore was kind of pointless here. She is (was?) a star and a 4- time Oscar nominee but her role could have been played by an unknown. It was almost distracting seeing someone of her caliber just kind of randomly thrown in this role as she wasn't even promoted with the film. You just see her and it's like, ""Oh crap, that's Julianne Moore I didn't know she was in this"". Then again, would knowing she was in it beforehand make you want to see a movie like ""Non-Stop"" even more?...probably not.What makes Neeson so great in these roles, besides his a$$ kicking prowess and the fact that he is bound to have a classic ""corny"" action line (""Your arrogance offends me"" from Taken is still my all time favorite action line), is that he knows how to utilize his voice and facial expressions to make these characters who seem unstoppable also display a sense of vulnerability and inner turmoil that makes us care about them.In the end, Non-Stop"" doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a fun movie that entertains from start to finish and that alone warrants the ticket price.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Claustrophobic action Hitchcock would have appreciated,"I am very surprised that Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 thriller North by Northwest doesn't get mentioned in reviews of Non-Stop. Here Liam Neeson plays a character whose situation is as maddening as that of Cary Grant in the Hitchcock classic. He is unexpectedly framed and treated by the world at large as a suspect for serious crimes. For most of the film, the protagonist of both films tries to sweat it out but has no clue whatsoever as to who is framing him and for what possible reason. Main difference between the films is that Neeson sweats in the confined but familiar environment of a transatlantic jet. No escape through the corn field this time! North by Northwest wasn't marketed as an action film, but by 1959 standards it was pretty much non-stop action. It is the mystery and the accompanying suspense that makes the film in both cases. True motives of the villains in the Hitchcock film have always seemed somewhat nonsensical to me, but who ever cared? In Non-Stop the point is who is pulling the strings, not really the why. I see the film as a refreshing twist in the already familiar hijack formula, well written and acted, and the fact that the plot is not that plausible is a relief for all of us frequent fliers!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Definition of Blah,"I am a huge Liam Neeson fan so I can't believe I am about to write this, but this film was the very definition of blah.There isn't much in the way of plot, the ""whodunnit"" moments are cheesy (you know, the camera focuses on someone's face, the person looks about in an intense manner...could he or she be the villain?), and the climax is a major letdown.I think the film got better than average reviews from some because it touches on an issue that is relevant and of interest to many (security)...though the way in which this is done is lackluster and not deserving of anything above a 5/10. (I would have ranked it lower, but hey, it's Liam Neeson.)The dialogue was mediocre, events and reactions weren't believable, and what little romance is in the film was obviously injected as a matter of formula (but without thoughtful placement, these scenes fall flat).

One of the best action thrillers of all time!,"Non-Stop is a thriller about air marshal, Bill Marks(Liam Neeson). Marks receives a series of threatening text messages while on board a British Atlantic flight, ordering him to transfer $150 million into an unknown account. If the ex-air marshal fails to do the needful, a passenger will die, every 20 minutes. What's even more perplexing for Marks is that, the criminal is one of the passengers. Now, it is up to Bill Marks with the help of a few of his fellow passengers like, Jen Summers(Julianne Moore) & Dr. Fahim Nasir(Omar Metwally), a couple of the cabin crew like, Nancy(Michelle Dockery) & Gwen(Lupita Nyong'o) & fellow air marshal, Jack Hammond(Anson Mount), to help him find the culprit before it is too late.This movie was action packed & thrilling, at the same time. It had me on the edge of my seat almost all the time! The makers keep you guessing as to who the culprit is. Bill Marks cannot trust anyone, not even himself. The action & the thrills are divided equally. The performances is what spearheads the entire film. Liam Neeson best known for his action roles in Batman Begins & the Taken franchise, is flawless, yet again, as retired air marshal, Bill Marks. Julianne Moore is outstanding as Jen Summers. Scott McNairy is brilliant as Tom Bowen. Michelle Dockery is spectacular as Nancy. Nate Parker is effective as Zack White. Corey Stroll is great as Austin Reilly. Lupita Nyong'o is impressive as Gwen. Omar Metwally is good as Dr. Fahim Nasir. Jason Butler Harner is mind blowing as Kyle Rice. Linus Roache is effective as David McMillan. Anson Mount is great as Jack Hammond. Quinn McColgan shines as Becca. The supporting characters are effective as well. If I had to pick one flaw then that would be that the ending was kind of predictable. Other than that, Non-Stop is flawless from start to finish.

On the flight he receives a disturbing text that tells him, ""I'll kill someone every 20 minutes"" if Bill doesn't do what the person says. While trying everything to find the person who's sending him these messages, the passengers, crew and his boss start to think he's hijacking the plane. Even Bill starts to question himself. So with no one to trust and everyone against him, he must try to stop this anonymous character in this crowded plane.With a plot like this, how can you not be somewhat interested? The movie keeps your attention and you really want to know what's going to happen. This movie's atmosphere is uncomfortable, which it's supposed to be. The wide angle lens is appropriate and makes the confined space even more real. The script is terrific! It's a perfect example of a movie where, once you watch it, you want to watch it again. All the pieces of the puzzle come together. There are reasons and evidence that lead you to the outcome without giving it away. That's a sign of a great mystery.The acting in this film is fantastic and all the actors like Julianne Moore as Jen Summers, who had to act in these claustrophobic sets, do an impressive job portraying their roles. I enjoy Liam Neeson and fully appreciate his acting skills in this film. He shows why he continues to be a top rated star.My favorite scene is when Bill thinks he's found and stopped the terrorist. For a moment Bill is relieved it's over. Then he hears his phone bing an incoming text and the music gets your heart racing.The moral is, ""Honesty is the best policy."" The passengers and crew are against him because Bill's hiding the truth. As humans we automatically think the worse if we have to piece a situation together. Bill finally realizes that.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 12 to 18-year-olds. There is smoking and intense moments that are not intended for kids. This is a investing and spine tingling film that is worth checking out.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST Film Critic For more reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Liam does it again,"Really, is there anything better than a tear jerking Liam Neeson action film? Maybe one starring Jason Statham? This is the legacy of Jerry Bruckheimer, who gifted to us all the unforgettable Armageddon (and we love him for it), and another reminder Hollywood has just gotten better at packaging celluloid sentimentalism with heroic atonement. So good that, even though we pick them apart with relentless critical abandon and expose them for the unrepentant saccharine clichés they are, in the end, deep down, we find ourselves rooting for Liam and suspending disbelief as he embodies the protective father, alcoholic failure and terrorist ass kicker all at once. Only Taken is better (perhaps the best of the genre) and I for one am looking forward to Non-Stop Too, bitches. Curious side-note: tonight I watched Non-Stop for the second time, and it only took 3 Scotch Ales to thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did the first time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than expected.,"But then again, last 15 minutes pretty much ruined all the suspension the movie did patiently build straw by straw. Would be 8 star movie. Right now can't give over 6.

A very non-stop movie!,"This film is a mystery, action, and thriller genre that takes place on an airplane. Bill as the main actor who works as U.S. federal water marshal is terrorized, and the terrorists are also around in the aircraft. And the film is focused on revealing the identity of criminals terrorizing the safety of passengers on planes that fly from New York City to London.The terrorist sent a short message to Bill with the message that Bill immediately send money worth $150 million to him and if it did not do so someone would die every 20 minutes. The film is full of puzzles, while watching this film, I keep trying to find out who the culprit is because everyone looks suspicious and what will happen in the next scene. In each scene, I was treated to a camera glare at certain people who could make me think, ""lest he is the culprit."" But it's unpredictable, people who look fine are actually bad people in the film.The story of this film managed to make me tense, but my curiosity paid off because in the end everything was clearly presented. Bill in all his wise ways finally managed to save the plane and land safely. I'm sure everyone who watches this film won't regret it, ten out of ten!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop action,Another decent Liam Neeson action movie worth checking out. This time he is on a plane kicking ass.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pleasantly Surprised,"I went into the movie expecting the same generic action film that might as well be straight to DVD. i was intrigued by the premise so i gave it a go and Im glad i did. I will admit the first 10 minutes or so gave me some bad vibes, it was quite slow and boring but once we were on the plane all was good. I felt the suspense throughout the film and found myself trying to guess who the bad guy was which led to me second guessing myself quite a bit. what i liked about it is it wasn't a paint by numbers story, there were a couple of twists and turns i wasn't expecting at all. Is it an award winner...No but if your sat at home order in a pizza have a few beers and you can just sit back, relax and enjoy the film for what it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Definitely worth a watch,"Enjoyed this one quite a bit, it managed to be more than just your straight action film and I liked trying to figure out whodunit from a whole plane load of potential suspects, for a while I even thought Liam Neeson was guilty. Plenty of red herrings throughout to misled you and an exciting (if implausible) closing scene.Liam Neeson plays a familiar role, his stock action hero guy. This could easily be his 'Taken' character actually, just as an air marshal pursuing a hijacker on a non-stop flight from New York to London. It doesn't matter though he does a good job with a decent amount of action considering the limited space, including a hand-to-hand fight in the tiny airplane bathroom.Great secondary cast here too including Michelle Dockery & Lupita Nyong'o as flight attendants, Julianne Moore as mysterious woman and Anson Mount as suspect #15. 1/20/16",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Every 20 minutes, someone will die... unless I don't feel like it.","Liam Neeson was good in this film. Sadly, however, he was one of the only few good things in this film. The premise is interesting enough, and the film has its moments, but these are few and far between.First and foremost, this movie is one of the most boring things I've seen in a while. It's slow to start, slow throughout and somehow manages to feel slow in the supposedly fast-paced action sequence at the end. People talk a lot in this movie, but seldom do they have much to say.In this film, Liam Neeson (I've already forgotten the name of every character in this film) walks up and down a plane, trying to stop a murderer who kills someone every 20 minutes, all while contacting Neeson on his smartphone. The logo of said smartphone has also escaped my mind, however I am fairly sure it stayed there longer than the names of the characters, due to it having more close-ups than any other character in the film. After a while, this no longer happens, because the plot feels like doing something different now.The acting is solid, for the most part. No memorable performances here though, except from Liam Neeson, for being Liam Neeson... again.The film takes place during a flight between New York and London, and after watching this, you'll feel like you've done so in real time, but gone nowhere.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Overall OK,"I've seen reviews on this film talking about how it was a very good action movie. I have to agree that the movie was good but personally wasn't AS good as some people are saying it is. The storyline had a interesting concept but over a period of time become boring due to how repetitive it was. Neeson is an amazing actor, however going off the storyline again it seems that his character always has the same background. It was very noticeable in this film that Collet- Serra dumbed down the character developed of Neeson and the supports because of its similarity to other movies.Stepping back from that the movie visually and for action contents, it was very well done. With the small set of an air plane Collet-Serra and Labiano were able to get some really beautiful angles. The action in the movie was intense and was well performed, again amazing for the tight spaces of the set.Would recommend this movie to others to view, but keep you're expectations low and understand it's a very typical Liam Neeson film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An OK thriller flick.,"Another movie with Liam Neeson as the though guy. He is like the epitome of older tough guys. :pThis movie starts out like any other movie based on a plane. But then the plot kicks in. It slowly, and I mean really slowly, builds up and manages to keep you interested for the most part. I didn't have a clue where the plot was going and that was a good thing. Unfortunately, the interest it had created in me started to fade away about halfway through, maybe a bit more. And the end result was really disappointing. It was a real bummer because initially the movie was looking really good.Acting is pretty good. Liam Neeson does what he does best. Julianne Moore and the other cast was pretty good. There was this really cool scene where it is just one LONG shot and Liam Neeson is searching for the villain. I love nicely executed long shots.Overall, an OK thriller flick, with LIAM NEESON.6.5 (0.5 for Liam Neeson :p )",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Great Thrill Ride,"This is not a a very believable movie. There are a thousand things that you can nitpick about the plot, but at the end of the movie I had to look back and say, I really enjoyed that. It's almost non-stop suspense, and I will give the writers this nod, I had no idea who the bad guy was until he's revealed at the very end.The only reason I watched this movie was that I have become such a fan of the Liam Neeson thriller, I like millions of others became hooked with Taken. When you look at other action stars, say Jason Statham, for instance, he looks like a bad ass. Liam Neeson looks, and has the mannerisms of an everyman, so when he goes into full bad ass mode it's such a wonderful surprise, even when you know it's coming.This long and the short of it is, this movie is worth your time and I think you'll enjoy it. If you liked Taken, there is an even better chance that you will like it, make no mistake, this is not as good a movie as taken, but it is worth a watch, IMHO",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing Movie!,"I have to say, I was expecting this movie to be an all out Action movie. I don't usually enjoy Thrillers but this was absolutely amazing. I loved every second of it. Liam Neeson is a very convincing character and his characters background adds to the story. It was a brilliant movie, however it wasn't the absolute best. The storyline in the movie is pretty good and very gripping. I'd say this is a Thriller/Mystery film with some Action, which overall makes this a pretty interesting movie. I have to say it wasn't the most realistic movie ever made but it was pretty close. I've never seen any Liam Neeson movies before this, but this movie makes me want to watch more of his movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as 'Non-Stop' as the title would suggest,"Just returned from seeing the new thriller 'Non-Stop' starring Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore.There are films which you definitely have to see in the cinema and some which can easily wait till they arrive on Sky or TV. This film, I'm afraid, comes under the latter.Liam Neeson stars as US Federal Air Marshal Bill Marks who, on a flight to London, starts receiving texts from someone on board threatening to kill passengers unless millions of dollars are paid into a specific account. When, in a roundabout way, the texter makes good their threats Bill has to do all he can to find out who it is and protect the other passengers.The title describes the flight they are on more than the action in the movie, as it was surprisingly sparse. There were though some good moments and some clever visual effects, especially as the text messages being received are displayed on screen.Following his success as an action hero in Taken and it's sequel, Liam Neeson does a good job in this movie too however the action is not as gripping as one would hope. The resolution and discovery of who the 'texter' is a bit of an anti-climax actually and it doesn't leave the viewer leaving the cinema still thinking 'WOW, I didn't see that coming' as a good whodunnit/thriller should, it actually made me think 'Oh really, is that it?' Unfortunately the story makes little sense especially when the texter's identity and motives come to light.There are a couple of good fight scenes and Liam Neeson has taken the role of 'action-hero' pretty well.In all Non-Stop isn't non-stop action or a clever whodunnit style thriller either, having said that it isn't a total bore either.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How many times can someone hi-jack a plane...,"... and still make it entertaining?Don't get me wrong, it's classic Liam Neeson. The same character he basically plays in every movie. Basically, he's mad about something, he has a weapon (gun, lightsaber, or just his fists, etc.) and he's going to push people around until he gets what he wants!! Sometimes people may even need to die if they get in his way. He's gonna make them pay!!The only thing I found a bit different about this movie was the 'guess who'. Guess who his friends are, who are his enemies, and who is trying to blow up the plane!RECOMMENDATION: If you are looking for a decent action movie - Liam Neeson style - you should know what you're getting yourself into. I'd proabaly suggest watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fine buildup, then the story has to crash-land somehow","The good thing with action movies is that I am not expecting too much. My curiosity was adequately titillated, less than for Snakes on a Plane, but Non-Stop is definitely not in the 'tongue in cheek' category. On the one hand Liam Neeson is really good at being dead serious for 100min and on the other hand straight all thrills/no pun action is a difficult plane to land.The buildup is really good, you fasten your seat-belt and get into the story smooth and nice. But it is a really long stretch for your average suspension of disbelief. And Liam Neeson's character gradually loses its aura once we get the full swing from his heavy back-story to the clear situation in the plane. He is travelling business class and should really concentrate on suspects monitoring him here. Instead we get a man on the loose that is more a pawn in a malicious plan than the guy in charge.As an action movie it is not quite satisfying because we are kept wondering where the threat is coming from for too long, and we don't even want to believe in the various paranoid bursts. When the hijacker comes forward there only remains space for full throttle action, or as they say in the cockpit apply TOGA power: Take-off/Go Around. So we go around with a lame exposition of the hijacker's motive before routine action brings it all to a close.I wanted to watch a simple and effective action movie but Non-Stop only exists thanks to Liam Neeson (and Julianne Moore). Suspense and action are really poor and there is not real effort to make it consistent. Unfortunately it is more about the viewer being hijacked. I will check Unknown though for it can only be slightly better.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Film Authority review of Non-Stop,"Liam Neeson has become a happy center for many a genre thriller, including Taken 1 and 2, Unknown and now Non-Stop, a traditional suspense drama which loses its head somewhat after a taut first hour.Neeson plays Bill Marks, a Belfast-born air Marshall whose trip from New York to London turns into a nightmare. A series of text messages from an unknown opponent promise to kill and passenger every twenty minutes until 150 million dollars are put into a secure account. With the help of fellow passenger Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), Bill tries to work out whereabouts on the plane the messages are coming from, questioning and occasionally beating up his fellow passengers as he races against time. Non-Stop's poster image, of Neeson firing his gun inside a diving plane, suggests much more action than Jaume Collet-Sera's thriller delivers, but the first couple of acts have plenty of tension in an old-fashioned who-dunnit style. Things get pretty silly once the mystery is solved, but Neeson and Moore both giving a convincing account of their characters. Non-Stop isn't a classic, but a reasonable time-passer for those who enjoy seeing a big movie star in a typically ludicrous scenario; when a newsreader mentions 'unbelievable plot twists', it's hard to imagine the audience not agreeing.The Film Authority",,Anonymous,Mystery

I Hate Flying Too!,"Saw Non-Stop starring Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Nate Parker, and Lupita Nyong'o at AMC Theatres Monday Night! I hate flying just like Air Marshal ""Bill Marks"" played by Neeson, and haven't flown since 2005, but the movie had a great sense of suspenseful mystery where he had to figure out which passenger(s) were behind the conspiracy of plotting to high-jack an international trans-Atlantic flight to London, United Kingdom against him. There was plenty of action in this 107 minute thriller of a film and I was satisfied with the film overall.Ever since 9/11, there have been high alerts here in the United States and abroad when it comes to flying the not so friendly skies, so to speak. I'm not sure if the motivation of the real hijackers in this movie, who apparently served in the U.S. Military during Operation Enduring Freedom as depicted in the film, was $150 Million OR the sense that their service in the war was taken for granted. I'm guessing it was a bit of both and by setting-up ""Marks"" was their revenge against an ungrateful nation, which in the end ultimately backfired!I also liked the scene where ""Marks"" helped the little girl on the plane, ""Becca"" played by Quinn McColgan face her fears of flying. As I mentioned, never liked flying, but had to do it when I was in the U.S. Navy! It sucked! I give the film an 8/10 and if you like action thriller movies with a twist of suspenseful mystery, this is your film to see!

A non-stop thriller with non-sense story,Non-Stop undeniably succeeds to give a bumpy ride for audience. It has an interesting premise that would make people guess and curious on what happens at the end while actually it ends disappointingly. The ending of the film ruins the tension they had built from beginning and added a non-sense moment in it. Also the hijacking purpose is quite silly and not explained clearly. Luckily there's Liam Neeson who more or less has secured this action flick for not falling into a disaster even though Bill Marks' character seems having similar personality with Bryan Mills' in Taken. Overall Non-Stop is good enough as entertainment and the thrilling thing quite works but don't expect smart storyline could come from this movie cause it will disappoint you.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Disappointing, lack of depth and bad effects","The acting , the plot and the special effects are all very average. I was expecting a lot more from this film and was expecting more depth in the story line but it was all a bit silly in the end. There isn't any cliff hanger moments or big twists in the movie.Some of the parts are just not well though out, like the fact he kills the first guy and they said someone would die in 20 mins. How did they know the other agent would react that way and pull his gun out ? Then the fact they use a Muslim as a possible target but it turns out he is a nice guy, even better a doctor that tries saving people, amazing haha.I do love cheesy action films and am big into the 80s films but you can't make 80s films now, when I watch an 80s film with no substance it doesn't matter because other factors in the film made up for them, but this film didn't really have a saving grace and there's no excuse for poor special effects in this day and age.It's probably worth a watch but if you're into plane hijacking films then passenger 57 or executive decision are much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Thriller as fast as its title!,"Liam Neeson, the guy whom I first remember seeing in Schindler's List, then as Qui Gon Jinn in Star Wars Episode I and later on as Ra's Al Ghul in Batman Begins and recently from a dozen other memes tagged with ""I don't who you are but I will find you and kill you"" . Liam has had the best of both worlds, Award-centric movies as well as mindless action movies. But thanks to 2008′s Taken, Liam has had a major face-lift, from a talented actor who could convincingly portray Oskar Schindler to a guy who could utter any dialogue with an unmatching intimidation that would make any guy pee in his pants. Don't believe me? Watch this!So in Non-Stop, Liam Neeson plays an alcoholic, jerk of an Air Marshall on a flight where things starts to go down the spiral. He gets a text on his encrypted networked phone where someone says that he'll be killing off passengers every 20 minutes unless he gets 'his' 150 Million dollars transferred and there on the nonstop action starts. Things are set in motion where people starts getting killed and keeps, you as well as, Liam guessing the 'whodunnit'. Its thrilling and manages to be a real nail-biter till the last 15 minutes or so but you gotta suspend your disbelief a lot. On paper the plot seems perfect and as for the screenwriters advantage it works well, but on film and as an audience you gotta admit that it might not end up exactly as its planned out to be. The world never works that perfectly where someone plans something and it goes exactly like that. Example? Passengers getting killed at every exact 20 minutes and every other covariant works out perfectly well and thats exactly what the facet is here.Liam Neeson is obviously bad-ass in this and he sports the same menacing attitude from his previous action movies but it works well. There were elements of vulnerability but when you've got a script that moves as fast as a plane that flies 500 miles per hour, there's little room for character building such as that. You have to admit he carries the plot on his shoulder and does keep you entertained. As for the supporting cast there's that guy who played Thomas Wayne from Batman Begins, Anson Mount whom I was sure looked a lot like Jim Caviezel, Julianne Moore as the annoying passenger who just wanna sit beside Liam Neeson and a couple of other familiar faces thrown around all for the question of doubt. As soon as you see one familiar face you start guessing ""Oh this guy, he's the one"" because thats how Hollywood works ain't it?Considering its from Jaume Collet-Serra who previously gave us Unknown and the immensely entertaining Orphan, you know Non-Stop will be more than just watchable. As I said Non-Stop works out well till the end and you ARE definitely entertained for the movies' 90 plus minutes and thats when the mystery gets revealed and you go from suspensive mode to MEH. Especially when you find out who and why its done. For what its worth I did enjoy the tense moments and you kinda root for Liam Neeson as each step that gets him closer to solving the mystery gets thwarted by the 'man who plans'. Is this a movie that rockets him to more badassery? Yes and as evidently a Taken 3 is in the works as we speak. Though, for me give me The Grey 2 anytime.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Reasonable action thriller,"I can't believe people saying this film was silly and unbelievable. Have you seen the other movies Liam Neeson did lately? :) Anyway, the story of an air marshal who has to fight against unknown mastermind criminals that are on the plane with him, manipulating people and devices to reach their goals is not as far fetched as decried by many commenters. As any blockbuster movie it does require suspension of disbelief.Liam Neeson plays OK. It is probably a movie fashioned in order for him to star in it, so no problems there. A lot of other actors that we can recognize, mostly from TV, as supporting roles and Julianne Moore in the first role in ages in which she is not completely obnoxious. Yes, there are plot holes. Especially since the quantum of knowledge of the terrorist party was immense in order to pull everything off. But one can overlook them. The tension is maintained well, but it could have been an order of magnitude more just by pressing in the social element. Instead we has Neeson be the primadona for the entire film.Overall, a decent action thriller, with more thriller than action, which feels good to me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The usual Hi jacking movie with very little spice,"Non- stop was my pick for a weekend movie night because of Liam Neeson . I have always loved his style and genre of movie and that is why even though it was quite evident from the trailer that this was a usual hi-jack movie, I still wanted to watch it.The movie goes in a steady flow keeping it interesting but not enough to call it an edge of a seat thriller. The director tries to divert our attention to various characters to maintain the suspense element which necessarily does not work in the right direction as per my view. It is a bit jerky in terms of plot build upThe movie has all the usual elements that we see in a hi jacking movie, dead pilot, Distressed passengers, survival measures, and eventually lives of people falling into the hands of one man. But then we have seen so many such hostage and hi jacking movies that I don't think anything is left to surprise us but still yes non-stop has its moments , even though with the usual and predictable tacticsI was not a fan of the ending because to me it seemed like a quick wrap up and not a smooth transition like you would expect. The logics used in the end was kind of pointless and incomplete and despite a not so there ending I would still say that for a Liam Neeson fan this still works may be not In great lengthThe movie has the usual plots and circumstances tried and tested almost in every other hi jacking movie but still it is kind of watch-able and serves good enough for Liam Neeson fans even though the plot clearly required work.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great film! (A no-spoiler review),"SPOILER FREE.I'm a fan of Liam Neeson, but I won't let my opinion interfere with this review. I would give this film an 8/10. I like films that have action and a unique plot. In this case, Non Stop had both. It was a thriller, and it delivered a good thriller. The plot was constantly unravelling, throwing us new information. Since the plot was so ""mysterious"" I was constantly on the edge of my seat - trying to guess who the criminals were. It was definitely worth seeing because of its chilling music, atmosphere and insane plot (it really had a great plot). The film also had a very thriller feel, with jump scares and constant suspense. The plot was always surprising you, in a good way. I give it an 8/10. Not a 9 because there wasn't constant action, but at the same time, action isn't what a thriller is about. I didn't give it a 10 because no film - nothing is perfect. Since I'm used to films with lots of action, I removed a point, but I'm sure most people would give it a 9. Overall, a great film that kept me on the edge of my seat.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mystery Action Thriller, with great mystery, small action and cheap thrills.","Liam Neeson has become a very marketable action movie superstar since the hit action thriller Taken. So whenever a movie trailer shows Liam Neeson beating up bad guys, people immediately anticipate its release. Non Stop may seem like a great mystery action thriller, but overall it's an entertaining yet disappointing film as a whole.Non Stop has very simple plot; An air marshal receives random text messages and lives are threatened. Only problem is, after every twenty minutes, a passenger is killed, unless, $150 million dollars is transferred to an account off shore. That's basically it, but what keeps the film going is the classic ""Who done it?"" formula.The film does a great job at building tension, but it fails to hold it throughout the film, and the pacing just doesn't balance well. At some moments the film begins racing at 100 km/h, and then suddenly it slows down to 5 and goes into autopilot. There's also only three action sequences, with the first one placed late within the first act, and the last two in the final act. The end fight will come off as underwhelming, but at least it was there. The acting was fine, but some of the cast were heavily underused.All in all, Non Stop is an entertaining but sadly, flawed, disappointing and forgettable film. If you took the tense bits of Die Hard, added all of the boring bits of Under Siege, throw in the plot of Unknown and have the setting in the plane, this would probably be the outcome. Non Stop isn't a must see, and I'd prefer to rent it on a rainy day.6.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This One Has Literally No-Where-To-Go,"If You Don't Bring Your High Expectations to this Confined Thriller it Can Pass as a Popcorn Entertainment with Some Suspense and a Few Thrills. The Clichéd Characters are the Weakest Element Although the Distracting Cell Phone Messages, Central to the Plot, are Never Ever Going to Be Exciting in a Movie, No Matter how Cleverly or Unintrusively Displayed.Liam Neeson is in His Generic Role as a Troubled (or retired) Ex-Lawman Type with Martial Arts Skills to Match His Dysfunctional Demeanor (should I take a drink or get the Bad Guys) as He is Still in Mourning for His 8 Year Old Daughter that Died of Cancer 9 Years Ago.Also, the One-Set Movie Rarely is a Good Thing, Either on Terra Firma or at 30,000 Feet. Movies Can't Move when there is No Place to Go. To Add to the Director's Vision of a Claustrophobic Atmosphere, the Action is Literally Reduced to an Airliner's Restroom. We have Gone to a Place where a Fight Scene can be Set No Smaller.Overall, it is Worth a Watch for the Easily Amused and the Non-Discerning Types that Turn Their Critical Dial to Zero and Just Sit Back and Enjoy.

That there are too many people giving this a rating above 5 shows how desperate people have become to get a barely watchable movie. In short, someone creates a situation on the flight which is not even close to possible. And the air marshal must take control of the situation and figure out the who done it.Neesom sleepwalks through the role he's played 10,000 times before and is just cashing on on the ""Taken"" series of movies. Every cliché you've ever seen is tossed into this film. Every politically correct red herring is tossed in and is so phony in nature to be embarrassing and thoroughly predictable. And the set up and scheme... airports don't exist like this anywhere. Nor do news reporters get information within 2 minutes.The script devolves into something so stupid that it is not to be believed. When you think that the story line couldn't be stupider and more far-fetched, it takes the script one notch lower. Facts are irrelevant. Implausibility - no big deal, just keep plodding ahead.Woe is the state of our undemanding movie goers, most of whom must never have flown a plane before.

Glad when non-stop stopped!,"I don't know at what age a film star decides that he's too old to be an action hero. Obviously nobody is brave enough to give Stallone & Schwarzenegger the bad news but I would hope that Mr Neeson doesn't produce a 'Non-stop 2"" or three or four! I personally would like to See him in something other than another 'Unknown' or 'taken' type picture. Don't get me wrong, he starred in my favourite film (Schindler's List) & I enjoyed 'Kinsey' & 'Michael Collins' but that was ten years or more ago. If you saw the trailer for this movie prior to viewing the film then you already know the plot. All that is left is to guess whodunit. The movie is set entirely in an air plane cabin except the opening & closing credits. The end of the film is quite tense but I was disappointed with this effort overall.",,Anonymous,Mystery
nice action movie,"In similar style to taken 1 and 2 this movie is a non stop action featuring Liam Neeson as the films hero. Overall it was very exciting and kept you guessing right up to the end. Most of the acting was on par with this style of movie, Liam Neeson gave the strongest performance. The story itself was very cliché (e.g plane, terrorists, bomb, hero saves the day) but as far as typical action/thrillers go this one holds your attention throughout. It was a relief/refreshing to see that for once the terrorist in the film wasn't Arabic or eastern European. The main downside to the film was the ending which was very poorly acted and extremely cheesy. Still if you are looking for a film with intense action, a minimal story line and Liam Neeson kicking ass, then this is the movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Neeson kicking butt, once again! 6/10","Review: This is a average ""Who Dunnit"" type of movie about a flight Marshall (Liam Neeson) trying to work out who is hijacking a flight that he is on. I must admit, I didn't have a clue who was the baddie, which brought intensity to the film and it was well shot by the director. The only problem is that the storyline was a bit weak and the passengers became annoying after a while. Everyone was too busy playing detective, except for helping Neeson trying to stop everyone getting killed. Anyway, some of the action scenes were quite good and the expulsions were impressive, but the ending was really corny and it lacked a sense of depth. Average!Round-Up: If you've watched Neeson in the latter part of his career kicking butt, then you won't be disappointed with this movie. At 61, he has shown that it's not only the young ones that can pull off some fancy Kung fu moves in a airplane toilet. Julianne Moore wasn't that amazing in the film. I was expecting her role to have a bit more to do with the plot, but she just turned out to be an average passenger. Anyway, it's definitely the suspense that keeps this movie going, along with the coolness of Neeson who keeps the passengers in check.Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $200millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there action/thriller movies about a airplane Marshall trying to find out who is hijacking a plane. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Should be counted among the best movies of this genre.,"The movie begins with an average paced build up. The keen eyes of an air marshal looking for potential threats. Eventually, a threat reveals itself and one thing leads to another. I do not want to include any spoilers therefore I will sum up to say that the movie does not include any cliché moments that have recently started to appear on a regular basis in recent action thrillers.All the events condense beautifully into a final stand off as expected, and though it seemed very obvious from the beginning that Liam Neeson would save the day, you walk away glad that he did manage to do it.You will not see who the real villain is until who he/she is. Any person who mildly enjoys action thrillers will not regret watching this movie. Just go in with an open mind and not expect the movie of the century.No outstanding acting noticed by either by Lupita, Liam or Julianne Moore. However, It still qualifies as a good movie in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Liam Neeson doing what he does best,"""We're midway across the Atlantic. How do you kill someone in a crowded plane and get away with it?""That is the same question I asked myself before going into this new Neeson thriller. The premise sounded a bit silly, but the trailer had me at Liam Neeson. I will watch any action film he stars in nowadays. Neeson plays a very similar character in every one of these films (Taken, Unknown, The Grey) and they simply should've made a franchise with all these movies similar to what they did with James Bond or Mission Impossible so people will stop complaining he plays the same role (and at least this time there is an excuse for his Irish accent). Non-Stop is a fun mindless action film as long as you don't stop and analyze the plot. For the most part it really worked for me because Neeson delivers and keeps your mind off some of the plot holes, but once the final act arrives there is not much he can do to save this film. The final ten minutes are a huge let down and it almost ruined all the fun I was having during the rest of the movie. I still enjoyed this film more than Neeson's previous collaboration with director, Jaume Collet-Serra, Unknown. The cast is strong enough to carry this film past all the plot holes, and I'd rather see Neeson in a mindless action thriller over pretty much any film that has been released this year.Non-Stop is John Richardson and Christopher Roach's first film screenplay which stars Liam Neeson as Bill Marks, an air marshall who is going through a depressive and alcoholic stage. What appears to be a routine flight from New York to London ends up being a nightmare for Bill as he begins receiving threatening messages on his secure phone line. The message states that a passenger will die every 20 minutes unless 150 million dollars are transferred to a specific bank account. Bill decides to talk to the other air marshall, Hammond (Anson Mount), who tries to calm him down by telling him it has to be a prank. When 20 minutes go by, Bill realizes this is no prank and with very few people on the plane he can trust he has to enlist the help of the flight attendant, Nancy (Michelle Dockery) and the person sitting next to him on the plane, Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), to help him locate who the terrorist might be.The premise might be a bit silly, but for the most part I was still enjoying this thriller thanks to the interesting cast. The action scenes were also entertaining and for a movie that takes place almost entirely in a plane it was engaging. If you aren't demanding a film with logic, you might enjoy this mindless action film as much as I did. It's a shame that Lupita Nyong'o didn't get a heavier role because she proved in 12 Years a Slave to be a very talented actress. In this film she doesn't get to do much, but it's OK because we get to see Liam Neeson doing what he does best for most part of this film. The way its audience receives the weak final reveal at the end is probably what makes the difference in this action thriller. It is very far fetched, but as I mentioned above, it is much better than most January or February releases. I enjoyed this film because despite it not making any sense it was still an engaging and fun ride. The truth of the matter is that Neeson is the one that holds this film together and doesn't allow it to crash.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A good thriller/mystery/action movie.,"Not that much happens during some of the movie when it comes to action. But the parts of the movie that does not contain much action builds the background of the characters, the story, it creates mysteries, thickens the plot and makes the movie more interesting in my opinion.I found that all the casting and actors were somewhere between good and great, the sound and visual effects were good, and the script was mostly great. My mind was mostly occupied with the action and plot, so I missed some physical impossibilities a couple of times, but I blame that on how engaging the plot and the action was... ;-)If you like action movies where an intelligent story is as important as the action, I believe that you will like this movie even if there are a couple of mistakes in it that you can spot without much expertise.If you need an action movie to have action, action, and (almost) only action with little to no plot in it, then you might not like this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mafia the Movie,"When it comes to action, this film really lives up to its title. The action is indeed non-stop. While the film is not without flaws and plotholes, it's got enough spirit and thrill to make up for it. (However, there is one genuinely sweet moment that was unnecessarily turned into a comic relief moment) I came in with my expectations high and left thinking the film was better than I thought it would be. Just imagine how much better this would have been if I had come in with my expectations low. There's twists and turns at every moment, some details that you have to really have to pay attention to the film to notice, (and you will be rewarded for doing so) and some bait-and-switch moments that will surprise you. The whole film feels like a game of mafia set on an airplane. A game in which the audience is constantly fooled. You will not be dissapointed if you see this film.

Above Average: 6.0,"For whatever reason, Liam Neeson has decided to make himself a new action star. Since this decision was made, most of the actioners he's been in have been, at best, slightly above-average. NonStop, from the director of Unknown (another Liam Neeson action film), is no exception. The setup is actually a fairly interesting one. Neeson, an Air Marshal, boards a flight on which someone will die every twenty minutes unless he gives the unknown perpetrator $150 million. The claustrophobia that comes with the setting works well for this type of film, and there are no fewer than fifteen passengers that are presented as potential terrorists. People begin to drop without any apparent cause, the absurdity of the plot growing in direct proportion to the body count. Though the atmosphere is impeccable, the revelation of the cause and reason of the killings is just... stupid. There's really no other word for it.

Good Entertainment Value,"As confirmed Liam Neeson fans, I settled down to watch this film as an off-chance discovery whilst channel surfing and with only the very short television synopsis to guide me.There are so many aeroplane disaster films out there, that coming up with a unique and interesting storyline was always going to be difficult.Having said that, I was uncertain about the identity of the 'baddie', until the big reveal close to the end of the film, which was all to the good and which raised the points rating.The main thing in which I was a little disappointed, was that when the motive for the crime was eventually revealed, it just didn't seem very plausible, which meant that what started out as a good solid plot, with strong characters, turned into a rather weakened affair, with no obvious sense of purpose.'Non-Stop' still offered good entertainment value and I didn't need to think too hard about it!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Non-Stop Suspense,"Liam Neeson in the movie 'Non Stop' has played the role of a father, a hunter and a cop well, as expected from a successful and experienced action star. Unlike his most of the films, Neeson(Bill) in the movie is more fallible than usual. He is not especially clever or resourceful, just honest. He fights well but not invincibly, but tries to do his best when needed. Although it is hard to swallow that he is an air marshal being an alcohol addict, but it is convincing given the depression in the past because of the death of his young daughter and the downward spiral of his life.Most of the film takes place on a flight from New York to London. Midway Bill starts getting text saying passengers will die regularly unless he convinces the agencies to pay $150 million into an account - which turns out to be his own. Basically Bill was being set up as a desperate hijacker. From this point, Bill has to face both agencies and passengers on the plane itself, as he is now being considered as the hijacker. The sequence of deaths on the plane also troubles Bill as he is unable to convince rest of the passengers.The story keeps the suspense till the end keeping the interest of the audience and gluing them to the screens. The suspicion also varies over different persons on the plane as the time passes and different twists and turns appear, confusing Bill and building a thrilling ending.The revelation of who is behind this is a kind of a spoiler, but it has an exciting ending.

It's hard to make an action movie stand out nowadays but this one does so with the fear, suspense, and most of all...desperately wanting to know who is up to what. The movie keeps you guessing.

Non-Stop just as the title advocates is strictly an around-the-clock action packed thriller movie.,"Would be a pleasure if you check my former noobish criticisms here - http://iamalekhya.blogspot.in/Non-Stop just as the title advocates is strictly an around-the-clock action packed thriller movie.Liam Neeson crews up with the Unknown director, Jaume Collet Serra. I am a huge fan of his action thrillers like Taken series, Unknown, The Grey, The A-team etc. He is in his sixties now but he looks great as always.The movie is set on a plane from New York City to London, when the protagonist being a former NPYD and a current Air Marshall gets coercions on his secured line about transferring $150 million in a bank account or a person deceases every 20 minutes. As time goes by, we get to more about his life and chain of increasingly improbable plot twists.It's truly a rock-hard plot as it is purely innovative and I haven't seen a story in the recent whiles. The opening minutes are firm as the director introduces us to the main characters that we will be spending the majority of our period with including Julianne Moore who was keen and a hostile traveler. The show goes pretty fine as it keeps the audience guessing till the pre-climax where we have some unforeseen twists and turns which was fairly bare. Though I enjoyed the climax but could have been more exciting like the total plot. The action is really incredible especially the climax gun shot.Acting – Neeson as Bill Marks is one of the greatest reasons for such a great victory of the film. He plays a role of bothered man who gets himself in such a situation. He verifies that he is indeed a great performer and an excellent action hero. Moore is more or less okay in her own way. The backup cast has done a pleasant job.Director – He has done a terrific job by generating a silence, nervous atmosphere throughout the whole flick. He preserved the movie's pace; leaving no room with needless plasters that tends to slog the story. There are a few plot holes here and there, but the stout performances relief a lot to keep the movie intense and attractive.Music – Marvelous Exertion! Flawless Soundtrack for such a movie!Largely a great 1 hour 46 mins journey filled with great suspense, thrill, action, tragedy and few gags. It was overall a fascinating experience with the strong acts creating it a must watch for all action- thriller lovers :)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Suspense is just the right amount!,"Yet another must watch: An early release in 2014 finally has come out on Blu -Ray.NON-STOP starring Liam Neeson is an action/thriller based on an ordinary day in the life of Air Marshall Bill Marks. On a routine transatlantic trip Agent Marks receives a series of mysterious text messages. Text messages that claim that there will be a death every 20 minutes onboard the aircraft until 150 million dollars is transferred to an unknown bank account. The identity of the sender in unknown. The Air Marshal is certain that the sender is onboard. The only viable clue he has is that sender of the text messages has access to a mobile phone. Everyone onboard is suspect!Unlike his hit thriller blockbuster TAKEN this mission does not unfold comfortably. The Neeson we see who is very much in control and always with a plan in his famous thrillers struggles onboard. This alone makes NON-STOP even more intriguing. I kept telling myself that one will not expect anything less from a Neeson movie and one would not have expected the change in dynamic in the flow of the plot. Phenomenally written the plot in NON-STOP isn't rocket science, in fact the movie on its own is plain and simple. It's how the flow of suspense and thrills is concocted and put on screen that I find whimsical.Many movies have been attempted in the confined space of a make believe aircraft. The closest successful parallel that I can draw is to Jodie Fosters FLIGHTPLAN. Starting his career in the Movie scene of Hollywood with HOUSE OF WAX (2005) Spanish Director Jaume Collet-Sera has since been climbing out from the bottom of the barrel leaving the mediocre horror flick behind. He has only become better over time. His first collaboration with Liam Neeson in UNKNOWN was a massive hit and likewise this too will follow? What Sera and Neeson did in UNKNOWN was spectacular and similarly this (NON-STOP) mystery keep building up from the moment Neeson first appears on screen. It is safe to say that Neeson has safely established himself as the go to action/thriller guy since the mega hit TAKEN and he executes this one with great detail; as much detail as the screenplay allows him to.Indeed there are flaws. As always is the case the scales tend to tip in the positive and the flaws can be overlooked if the damage isn't that obvious. Maybe Juliane Moore's agent felt that she needed work. The 53 year old redhead looks absolutely ravishing but her presence in the movie on the whole is quite questionable since she literally contributed nothing coming from Hollywood royalty. I for one enjoyed seeing her on screen but I kept expecting more. A lesson to be learnt for all female leads is to never star besides Neeson in an action/thriller because Neeson will over power you at every turn.I reviewed it; now you decide!TITLE: NON-STOP DIRECTED BY: JUAME COLLET-SERA STARRING: LIAM NEESON & JULIANNE MOORE RATED: PG13 RATING: 07/10 RUNTIME: 106 MINUTES",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I will not say if it will end in a good way or in a bad way, i will just leave you to watch it, and get thrilled by its scenes and ideas. a great mixture of thriller, suspense, intelligent tweaks, good story, and great casting.

The director knew how to attract the audience to this movie, i just watched it thrilled, and with pleasure. i didn't felt bore, and all the tweaks and the actions intelligently make sense.

Non-stop Suspense,"I was looking forward to this since the first trailer was released,Liam Neeson started his action movie career off with taken and non-stop is good but it's no takenPlot outline: (Neeson) Bill Marks is a rough and scruff air Marshall who is sick of his job until on A flight from New York to London he receives mysterious texts off someone who demands a ludicrous amount of money.Marks has 20 mins or someone dies and the clock is reset.The film starts off as a very slow and develops Liam Neeson's character out as a man who is like any other person he's has his own personal problems and Neeson holds the film together with his character whereas Julianne Moore character is a nice but needless character to the film.The story feels like a shameful taken 3: on plane rip-off but Neeson manages to break out the Bryan Mills character who we seen before in the less successful and silly sequel taken 2.The acting is great but be warned the story is pretty simple but with a fair amount of plot holes but if you get over the heighten reality of the premise who might just enjoy this.Taken was great for it action sequences which non-stop lack which helps by replace it with suspense and you start guessing who's behind it all.I was on the edge of my seat for practical the whole film.The films climax isn't bad but once we get the ultimate reveal who was behind hijacking its comes off weak and silly but if you like Taken,Unknown or the Grey this just might keep you entertained because despite the flaws and silliness I still enjoyed it,worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I for one love wasting time watching dumb movies like this!,"'NON-STOP': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)61-year-old Liam Neeson stars in another B action film, in this one he's an alcoholic air marshal dealing with a plane being held hostage (for a 150 million dollar ransom) by a mysterious text messaging criminal. The former Academy Award nominee is also joined in the movie by another former Oscar nominee Julianne Moore and recent winner Lupita Nyong'o! The supporting cast also includes Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker, Corey Stoll, Michelle Dockery, Anson Mount, Shea Whigham and Linus Roache. It was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed Neeson in the 2011 action thriller 'UNKNOWN') and written by John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle. I found the flick to be fun while I was watching it but ultimately forgettable.Neeson plays Bill Marks, an ex-cop who's now an alcoholic U.S. federal air marshal. He recently lost his job as a police officer, had his wife leave him and lost his eight-year-old daughter to cancer. So he of course drinks a lot to cope. The story takes place aboard Aqualantic Flight 10, a flight from New York to London. We learn Marks is also afraid of flight takeoffs as he explains this to the friendly passenger sitting next to him, named Jen Summers (Moore). Things really get exciting for Marks when he starts getting text messages from a mysterious stranger who's watching him. The texter threatens to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless Marks can have $150 million delivered to a special bank account. Things become even more complicated when it turns out the account belongs to the air marshal.Neeson is once again exceptional in the lead action hero role, he's of course above films like this but it's still a lot of fun to watch him. Moore and Nyong'o are of course above material like this too, so is the director, but their talent makes it so much more entertaining. It's the type of movie that I know I'll forget most of within a year or two; like I'll probably forget who the bad guys are and how it ends but that doesn't mean it's still not worth watching. A good time is a good time regardless of whether it's high quality entertainment or not and I for one love wasting time watching dumb movies like this.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diBy263FaHs",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Someone on this flight is threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes...',"Jaume Collet-Serra directs a story and screenplay by John W. Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle and makes the audience cringe at the concept of long airplane flights. The pace of the story is harrowing and even if at the ending we are left with the feeling 'I should have figured this out', the action and the acting is first rate and the film proves to be a fine summer evening diversion.Bill Marks (Liam Neeson), a former cop now an Air Marshall dealing with his daughter's death by drinking, even as he prepares to board a flight that needs his expertise as a law enforcer. Suspicious things begin to happen when there is an argument over a window seat Zack (Nate Parker) and the inquisitive Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), an encounter with a frightened child (Quinn McColgan), a co-dependent relationship between Marks and a stewardess (Michelle Dockery), etc. While on the flight from New York to London, Marks gets a text telling him that unless 150 million dollars is transferred to an offshore account, someone will die every 20 minutes. Everyone becomes a suspect, Marks is called a terrorist, people begin dying in a string of strange occurrences, and ultimately, with craft and cunning and employing the aid of the passengers, Marks finds the truth in the situation.Supporting actors who offer fine support include Scoot McNairy, Linus Roache, Anson Mount, Corey Stoll, Omar Metwally among others.

Movies have been made before emphasizing the digital communication realm in which we, as a consumer based society, live in. But this one accurately reflected it.I wasn't expected the mystery hand to be dealt in this movie, but it was so issued, very calculated and well planned. It really does leave the audience wondering ""who"" it is.The acting is good, not necessarily great, but one has to remember the dramatic tension of this movie. It really is a murder mystery of sorts.My only complaint was the ending. I'm not going to leave spoilers, but in traditional Hollywood fashion, good guy wins, bad guy looses.This movie really had a chance here to divert from the traditional storyline and give the audience a little more, whether it was a further storyline of the hero or better yet a scenario in which the bad buy escapes. I feel like that is an idea largely left untapped; in which the bad guy actually escapes or at the very least leaves the audiences in apprehension - bc everyone is used to the same old boring fairytale ending of good guy walks away scott clean.Other than that, worth watching, if you are in the mood for a quickie suspense film that gets you off in your employers utility closet.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than the advertised plot would make you think,"The acting was well done and the set was realistic. Much more to the plot than advertisement for the film would make you think. Very creative plot and lots of good suspense. Majority of the film is set on the inside of a large jet. That was very well done. Special effects for aircraft in flight and plot related trauma was very well done. The use of technical working of smart phones, text messages and aircraft networks was well conceived including the editors method of letting us follow along. Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery were very beautiful and Lian Neeson, Scoot McNairy and Nate Parker did an excellent job acting.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awesome Suspenseful Thriller on a Airplane,"Bill Marks is a Federal Air Marshal. He literally flies for a living.""I hate flying"" - Bill Marks
Today Marks is on a routine flight from New York to London, when he receives text messages threatening to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless $150 million is deposited into a bank account.""We're midway across the Atlantic. How do you kill someone in a crowded plane and get away with it?"" - David McMillan
There are 150 passengers on this plane. Everyone is a suspect. In a race against time, Marks has no choice but to play this deadly game of cat and mouse.I like this movie. It is a very clever and suspenseful thriller. On a airplane crossing the Atlantic Ocean. There is no back up, there is no where to hide, no where to go.The story builds a complex setup full of twists and turns that kept me wondering and guessing. Oh and of course Liam Neeson is awesome as Marks, he totally makes this movie happen. Really a fun and entertaining whodunnit popcorn movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
High Flying Thrills and Spills with Liam Neeson,"Watching ""Non-Stop"" reminds you once more why Liam Neeson has become an indispensable face of this genre. The film chronicles Neeson's character, air marshal Bill Marks, as he attempts to save a transatlantic flight riddled with terrorist threats. Yes, it's him again; the savior, on a plane, amidst a tension-filled plot. While Neeson's comfort in these roles is undeniable, ""Non-Stop"" evokes a sense of déjà vu.The film does a commendable job creating tension in a confined space. The cramped airplane cabin, rising suspicions, and the ambiguity of who's friend or foe genuinely elevate the stress levels. However, as the story progresses, it's disappointing to see how filled it is with clichés and how superficial the character development feels. Characters other than Neeson seem to fade into the background, feeling more like extras than substantial parts of the story.Director Jaume Collet-Serra's efforts to ramp up the tension are appreciated, but the film sometimes overflows with logical flaws and overly convenient solutions. These moments provoke ""really?"" reactions, momentarily pulling you out of the suspense.The presence of a quality supporting cast, including Julianne Moore, is a plus for the film. Moore's performance contributes to the story, and her interactions with Neeson keep the engagement alive throughout the viewing. However, having such a talented cast without a more compelling story feels like a missed opportunity.""Non-Stop"" could be a good pick for those seeking a high dose of thrill and entertainment. Fans of Liam Neeson will enjoy seeing his heroic acts on screen once again. However, for those expecting a more original story and character development, the film might not fully satisfy. My rating is 7/10; the film successfully delivers on suspense and action but falls short in offering anything new in terms of storytelling. Still, not a bad score for a Liam Neeson film, right?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop Tedium,"2014, what are you doing to me?! I normally feel like a positive person, but you have given very little to get excited about at the movies. Unfortunately Liam Neeson's latest uber-serious thriller, Non-Stop, is the next in line of bad action movies this year. It's a shame, because I was excited about this one. I love a good airplane nail-biter (Red Eye, United 93, the plane sequence in World War Z), but no one seems to be trying very hard here and it shows. Non-Stop is a soap-opera level suspense film about a troubled air marshal aboard a hijacked plane, in which he is a suspect. As you can see, the guys making this film aren't terribly interested in making a unique movie, but even worse they don't make an intriguing one. Every ""twist"" is seen from a mile away with the movie becoming abrasively preachy towards the end. The obnoxious style makes it feels like a film student just learned how to use his after-effects computer program. The music is over-bearing, not allowing the story to do any of the emotional weightlifting. If young guys made this movie, then it's forgivable to have these frantic choices; otherwise these decisions just come off as ineffective and pretentious. There is a decent action scene or two here and there, and some of the mystery works, but the cheap thrills rarely pay off emotionally and are too steeped in convolutedness to really work. The only thing ""non-stop"" here is the tedium. If you must see an action movie in theatres this week, see ""Robocop"", but skip this.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Distracting but ultimately full of holes, laughable and forgettable","Air Marshall Bill Marks is a troubled man – an alcoholic, an underachiever as a parent, cop and man, and really just has little going for him. Assigned to a direct flight to London, Marks settles in but within a few hours of the flight taking off he gets a message on the closed network that one of the passengers will die n 20 minutes if he does not arrange for a substantial amount of money to be transferred to a bank account. With time ticking down, Marks tries to figure out what is going on, but when the first death comes he finds himself isolated in the air in a high-stakes game where he can trust nobody.Although this film got pretty bad reviews I still wanted to see it since I figured that in fairness it is probably going to deliver at the low level I was expecting from it. In this regard it is actually quite watchable for someone who was recovering from a minor operation and just looking to have something to distract. The plot is as nonsensical as it sounds; I really wondered how they were going to make it all work, but the answer is that they don't. The writers seem to hope that you will not think forward or backwards in any situation and just focus on the moment, whatever is happening. This level of belief suspension is too much to ask though and the plot holes and narrative nonsense does come thick and fast at times, really just hoping you don't care enough to kick back against it.And in fairness I didn't care – which is not a glowing recommendation but nothing about it all made me care one bit. What remains from there are lots of professionally mounted moments of tension, with Neeson doing his new tough guy thing and the closed location doing its bit to add to the tension. It works at a very low level but I would be lying if I said I wasn't at least slightly entertained by bits of it. The problem is that it is a big deal film with a big cast and presence, and it is not unreasonable to hope that it would have been better. Ultimately though it is undone by its own lack of interest in the plot – it is only ever about the tension of the moment and the writing is roundly poor, from plot points to specific dialogue. It distracts at a very low level but ultimately it is full of holes, laughable and forgettable.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Worth one watch, but has very little re-watch value","It's a vaguely entertaining movie. It shows a little bit of character development and self-realization of Neeson's character, but it's very minor. It did keep me guessing about the antagonist, but I find this far from an excellent film. I fell asleep on it several times, and after I finally finished it, I deleted it immediately. I have no desire (at ALL) to watch it again, and it is hard for me to recommend it to people. It wasn't horrible, but it was far from great.Apparently this review was too short, but I really don't have much else to say about this movie.

He receives a text message saying one person will die every 20-minutes unless $150-million is deposited into an offshore account.

Susprisingly good,"Surprisingly, Non-Stop turns out to be much better than expected. Sure, the movie isn't the philosophical one and the plot on which the movie relies on is nothing original but it's rather well packaged : the direction is pretty good, the cast does the job, the scenario is pretty dynamic thanks to the regular twists, and the search for the bad guy's identity and the way our US Marshall is going to find out quickly set off the viewer's curiosity. The only disappointing aspect is precisely that the final twist and the justifications of this plane hijack are really far-fetched, something more rational would have clearly been beneficial.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not For Anyone Who Is Expecting More Than A Fun Movie,"If you've seen Taken or Unknown, you know the kind of movie that this is going to be. And if you're okay with that, you will enjoy this. If you expect more, then prepare to be disappointed. I wanted something fun and interesting, and I got it.Liam Neeson gives a good performance playing a character whose story isn't really original, but somehow makes it pretty interesting. The story itself can be interesting too, if you let the occasional movie cliché slip by every now and then. I actually expected more cheesy scenes, but there were nowhere near as many as I thought. It will keep you guessing throughout, but I would say it is kind of possible to figure out the gist of what's going on, so don't go patting yourself on the back thinking you're a genius if you do. Also, there's not as much ""action"" in this as some might want. It's more filled with tension and twists that make you think a little. I enjoyed that, and I think it works here. I also personally kind of liked the visual style. It can be plain at times, but little things like the way they display the text messages on screen I really liked.As I said before, if you're a fan of Neeson's films like Taken, check this one out and enjoy it. If you expect this to absolutely change your outlook on cinema, don't watch it. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's a fun popcorn flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent movie,"I believe this is THE movie or the beginning of this year. Liam Neeson continues to impress and amaze on the big screen. His initial blockbuster it was Taken, and this surpasses it. Taken 2 was fairly weak and this made it look terrible. Non Stop, lone Sutvivor, Cpt Phillips, and Amercian Hustle are the best movies to come out recently. Overall I give this movie a solid 9.0. I would recommend it to ages 12+. It is superb and exhibits acts of heroism, yet suspense. Tis movie is mind twisting, action packed, and requires thoughtfulness and wits to figure out who did it. Was it the Marshall, or was it his passengers?",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Okay but not as good as I hoped,"Generally speaking I like Liam Neeson so when a movie comes out with him in it I generally get it without too many questions asked. It has been a somewhat varied experience. This one is somewhere in the middle of the range I would say. I did indeed have higher hopes for it.The basic story is quite good but I never really felt very thrilled about the implementation and I more often than not felt frustrated by the various jerks not believing Bill and Bill's clumsy attempt at convincing people that he was a good guy not to mention controlling the passages. For being an air marshal Bill did not seem to be very good at it. I known he was supposed to be a former drunk but still It is still a decent enough movie though which rolls on at a reasonably decent pace. I never really felt compelled to pick up my tablet and start to read something while waiting for the boring parts to pass as have happened with a few other movies. Well, at least not very often. It is not really an action movie though and the scene at the poster is pretty much the only high-octane action scene in the entire movie which was also a bit disappointing. Sure, there are some quite good fights between Bill and various other characters but I would still put this movie more in the thriller genre than in the action one.The media jerks and the way people seemed to control things outside, or rather not control things, the plane was also really frustrating. I would really have sued the arses of those media dicks afterwards given how they downright slandered both Bill and air marshals in general without any real proof. What happened with innocent until proved guilty. Oh, yeah right, I forgot, that has no meaning to todays media people.Sadly enough the thriller part never got that thrilling either. I feel this is due to the rather clumsy way that Bill went about things most of the time. He never really gave a professional appearance. This goes for the cop that happened to be on the plane as well by the way. I felt he was really behaving just like some scared member of a mob rather than a trained professional. When the villain was finally exposed and the reasons for the events where explained. Well, let us just say that I went ""meh"" at that point. On the good side Liam Neeson did make a rather good performance given the kind of script he had to work with.On the whole it is an okay movie though which is worthwhile to watch but, as I wrote, I had my hopes set a notch higher.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Don't Believe the Hype, It's a Stinker","7.2? The fix is in, folks. This stinker deserves a 5.9 and no higher.'Non-Stop' sort of sucked. It completely missed the mark on almost every level. The characters were poorly developed, especially Liam's, the story was dumb and recycled from four different 'Die Hard' movies and, worst of all, the villain was so clichéd and ambiguous that he might as well not have been in the film at all. To be honest, at this point, I can't even remember who the real villain was. In fact, that's the best way I can think of to sum up 'Non-Stop' with one word. The entire thing is utterly FORGETTABLE. The most intelligent decision you can make right now is to simply forget this film even exists. Move on, and better luck with your next inclination.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Liam Nesson made this role his own displaying grit and determination,"Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Non-Stop.

Completely held to ransom by a series of anonymous texts, Leeson is slowly being framed for the hijacking of a transatlantic flight from USA to London. As always with these films it boils down to a basic whodunit, and I made several guesses along the way, some were correct but mainly I got it wrong. This was a good film, well written and sensitively cast with a good cross section of people on the plane. The plot was believable as were the effects.

Its less obvious who the bad people are on the plane. There is good chemistry between the leading actors Moore and Neeson.The movie does have some violent scenes but is not very violent by today's standards with no nudity.

Another excellent action thriller with Liam Neeson,"Starring- Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Nate Parker, Scoot McNairy, Michelle Dockery, and Lupita Nyong'oNon-Stop 7.5/10- Action movie+Liam Neeson= Awesome film. Everyone should enjoy Non-Stop. The trailer makes you believe it is just a decent action movie, but it is much more than that. Mystery movies are truly an unappreciated genre in film and Non-Stop is the closest thing you can to a solid mystery movie nowadays. It is not in the Murder on the Orient Express territory, but it is a great ""who done it"" type of film with action legend Liam Neeson at the helm.Part of the reason Non-Stop looks so appealing to everyone is that we have all seen Liam Neeson in this type of role before. He has no clue whats going on, but he is smart, and can beat the crap out of anyone. This is without a doubt Liam Neeson's bread and butter movie. He could have carry this movie if he had to, but thankfully the movie actually brought other good components to the table other than an A-list lead actor.Aside from the movie Flightplan, no other films have really taken place entirely on an airplane and the setting alone is a breathe of fresh air. Now to the plot, you know from the trailer that there will be a few twists and turns, but still the presentation of these twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat despite the fact that you knew it was coming. You really have no idea who the person sending him the texts is going to be. You think you have it figured out, but then the director knew you would think that and eliminate that option and keep you guessing. No one in the theater knew it was going to be who it was, not even me.The screenwriters must have known while they were writing the movie that Liam Neeson was going to be the lead role because they wrote in all of the advantages that Liam Neeson gives a film. Liam Neeson plays a federal air marshal who is just doing his job. Then, suddenly he has to spring into action after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfer $150 million into an off-shore account. The premise of this ""who done it"" thriller alone is an impressive, bold idea that everyone loves and has definitely paid off. Liam Neeson no doubt gave a great performance Agent Bill Marks and after seeing this movie you will definitely agree that no one could have done a better job.Best action movie out right now.

A unique story that was thrilling and engaging.,"Not much was expected from a thriller on a plane (Snakes On a Plane come to mind anyone?) but this was surprisingly suspenseful and full of mystery. Marks (Liam Neeson) gets suspicious of everyone and the audience along with him. We do not understand the full situation and are kept along with Marks as he progresses through different situations.The action scenes were really well planned and put together. It really was non-stop, and things just kept happening while the minds of the audience are reeling to find the culprit.The acting was also superb. Liam Neeson has a knack for action and thrillers. Though there was this one point around the climax where I thought he was overdoing it a bit, but I guess that might have just been his character as he gets more desperate to find the criminal. Julianne Moore was great as well, but I feel that her character was a bit shallow. Last but not least, Michelle Dockery was fantastic, (I am kind of biased towards her as I love Downton Abbey) her facial expressions and her delivery were just spot on.A few things I did not like: One, Liam Neeson's character seems to be able to defy the force of being sucked out of an aeroplane.

"Surprisingly, more than just 'Taken (in the air)'","Okay, I, like many, enjoyed Liam Neeson's film 'Taken.' And, like many, I thought the sequel was a little bit of a let-down/cash-in. Therefore, my hopes weren't that high for 'Non Stop' – a film where, from all trailers and promotional material, Neeson basically plays the same aging tough guy, albeit now he's an air marshal trying to stop a terrorist highjacking/blackmail plot.Perhaps that's the secret to enjoying this film, i.e. don't expect too much, because, as it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised (and very entertained). Yes, Neeson's character isn't that different to how he acted in Taken, however, the story is executed in a different enough way to make it not feel like a cheap rip-off of the Taken franchise.It's sort of a 'whodunnit' on a plane. One of the passengers is texting Neeson, threatening to kill a passenger every so often unless his (monetary) demands are met. This means that there are plenty of 'red herrings' to constantly throw the audience off the scent.Naturally, with any sort of film like this, there are some moments where you have to suspend your disbelief and accept that – sometimes – things just happen to move the plot forward in the right direction.So, don't think too hard about the (few) minor plot holes, just enjoy the pretty tense ride as Neeson proves that, once again, you don't have to be 'expendable' to be an older statesman of the action genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Thrilling ride with messy resolution,"Non-Stop is, without a doubt, one of the most thrilling movies of the year. Starring modern action hero Liam Neeson, we get a tale of suspense and suspicious thinking (a la Filghtplan). Neeson plays an air Marshal that drowns himself in alcohol in order to surpass the death of his young child and the consequent divorce. While on duty he receives a text message from an anonymous source saying that unless 150 million dollars is transfered to an off shore account, a passenger will be killed every 30 minutes. From then on, Bill Marks (Neeson) will have to work to keep the passengers safe as well as cope with the fact that all evidence points to him being the culprit.Liam Neeson shows once again why he's at the top of his game when he does action. Of course he can do great roles in other genres, but here he handles the role very well and I would say you could not find a better lead for the film. Names such as Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery and Corey Stoll make for a solid supporting cast and the roles are also brilliantly portrayed. As for the plot and direction, my only complaint can only be the conclusion. All the set-up that leads to the climax is done to a great extent leaving the audience guessing what's gonna happen. Personally I managed to guess the villain (sort of), but I won't go any further here. I'll just say I didn't appreciate the motive.Other than the messy resolution, Non-Stop offers a great story filled with thrills and that will certainly please action enthusiasts.

This time around, he's an alcoholic, aerophobic Federal Air Marshal haunted by the past, whose job is to quietly protect flight passengers and ensure that they land safely. The film takes place on an international flight from New York to London.As usual with many thrillers in the past, the audiences were 'invited' to play guessing games as the film progresses...who's the real hijacker? What actually happened? What's going to happen? How the next victim going to be killed? Who's the next victim? What will our main hero do next? This film is in many ways similar to Taken, another brilliant action thriller with Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA agent trying to rescue his daughter, but less violent and more suspense. the film does raise a few questions on flight security, the various precautions and measures taken against terrorism since 9/11.Yes, the film has too many contrivances (However, Within the film's context, some of the contrivances work well though)...Sure, the plot is flawed and cliché-ridden...but it's sure one hell of a ride! Who cares when Liam Neeson is here to kick ass? This is one of those guilty pleasure movies, the ones that aren't great but we love for some reason.Rating: 8/10 (Sorry, I enjoyed it very much) http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/02/movie-review-non-stop.html",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great film that makes you feel part of the story!,"""Non-Stop"" is an action/thriller film about Bill Marks, an air marshal on a non-stop transatlantic flight from New York to London. Midway over the Atlantic Ocean, Marks receives a series of threatening text messages from an unidentified source claiming that unless $150 million are transferred to an off-shore account, a passenger will die every 20 minutes. As the body count starts to rise, Marks is forced to spring into action to find the perpetrator, save the passengers and clean his name.The movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and stars Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery, Lupita Nyong'o and Scoot McNairy. The script is written by John W. Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle.Jaume Collet-Serra did a great job regarding the film's direction, keeping the tension throughout the whole film and presenting each character in a way that makes you suspect of their true intentions, even with Marks. The screenplay by Richardson, Roach and Engle takes the premise of a plane hijacking and adds many unexpected twists to it, which results in a great story that manages to keep your attention from beginning to end.Liam Neeson gives an incredible performance as Bill Marks, the U.S. federal air marshal caught in the hijacking. Neeson is able to show the melancholic nature of his character as well as his tough part when he's required to take matters into his own hands, showing what makes him one of the greatest action stars of our time.The movie manages to make you feel immersed in the story, like if the theater was the plane and you were sitting in one of the plane's seats instead of the theater seat.All this elements make ""Non-Stop"" a great film, a movie that provides non-stop action and thrills to its audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A surprisingly good flight undone by its bumpy landing.,"Non-Stop - the latest installment in Liam Neeson's ongoing career renaissance as a geriatric action hero - is an odd beast. Its premise and trailer hint at a ridiculous, campy story, one that can enjoyed with very little concern for logic or reality. What's surprising about Non-Stop is that its first half actually shows great promise as a solid, rather serious action thriller, particularly with director Jaume Collet-Serra ladling heaps of tension into the narrative. Ironically, it's when the film veers irretrievably into ridiculous, campy territory that it crashes and burns.Bill Marks (Neeson), a federal air marshal, settles himself in for a transatlantic flight. With a well-trained eye, he scopes out his fellow passengers in first class, including his chatty neighbour Jen (Julianne Moore), but doesn't spot anything amiss - until, that is, he receives an ominous text message demanding a wire transfer of US$150 million into an off-shore account. Failure to comply, he is informed, will result in someone on the plane dying every twenty minutes.A bit of an outrageous premise, it's true, but Collet-Serra actually manages to make it work - kind of. The film's first hour unfolds with tension and tiny twists aplenty, as Bill races against time to trace the source of the threatening messages but keeps coming up empty. The first death is a stroke of story-telling genius, just as it's actually possible to see the metaphorical noose tightening around Bill's own neck as he comes under suspicion for causing rather than trying to stop the mayhem on the plane. Red herrings are liberally baked into the film's plot, to the extent that audiences - and Bill - will be rather effectively kept guessing about the culprit for quite a while.There's even much to enjoy in the complicated dynamics among the passengers on the plane; they range in response from belligerent (Corey Stoll's rage-filled cop) to terrified (Scoot McNairy's Tom Bowen), from helpful (Nate Parker's Zack White and Omar Metwally's Doctor Nasir) to antagonistic (Anson Mount as Bill's colleague, Jack Hammond). Given his troubled backstory, Bill has a bit of a prickly relationship with flight attendant Nancy (Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery). It all adds welcome tension, drama and even comedy to the flight, and contributes red herrings galore to the plot, as Bill struggles to determine who he can trust.But surprisingly good things must come to an end, and so it is for Non-Stop. The film's final act sees it degenerate from fairly well-plotted thriller to nonsensical mile-high melodrama. The entire plot in which Bill is ensnared - so tautly fascinating at the start - winds up making very little sense, whether in emotional or psychological terms. The grand, crazy opera of it all is only exacerbated by the outrageously action-packed denouement: this is where the film was clearly headed all along, with fisticuffs, gunplay and explosions the order of the day, but it actually feels sillier because of what came before.The cast is, broadly, very good. Neeson actually doesn't phone it in, just looks grim and determined as he always does in this little sub- genre of films he's built up around himself. Moore is at least a hundred times too good for this material, and so lends her character considerable empathy - and a hint of suspicion too, since it's hard to imagine an actress of her calibre and stature signing on to this film if she didn't have something meatier to do. Dockery radiates uptight tension, a Lady Mary of the sky, and Nyong'o - so arresting in 12 Years A Slave - is essentially a filler character as another flight attendant who flits around in the background looking worried all the time.On the whole, Non-Stop is enjoyable, particularly in its gripping, tense first half. It's surprisingly rich and well-executed, as Bill struggles to make sense of an apparently routine job gone quite badly wrong. But the film struggles to become a more coherent whole, especially when it plunges into overblown action territory. That's where, one suspects, it was always intended to reside, but this is a descent that winds up feeling like a letdown, especially in contrast with its smoother take- off and flight.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Non-Stop Breath Taking Action All The Way,"Watched this movie last night and boy was I blown away by it. Storywise, full of suspense moments just the way I like it. I find the plot of the movie for one was very creative and kind of new but in the end, after a few twists and turns, it ended up being predictable as usual with these hijacking terrorist films but it was still great to watchLiam Neeson is really good at playing in these types of action role characters thats been given to him. He has that menacing aged but still dangerous looks on him. Julian Moore on the other was a bit of let down since she didn't get as much screen time as I'd hope but the chemistry she has with Neeson pays off really well just like in their previous movie together Chloe. They rest of the cast were well picked. The tension building throughout the movie was what made it great and breath taking right to the edge of your seatsTo all Liam Neeson and action movie fans, this is a must see film for you guys. You will clearly not be disappointed",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Liam Neeson's latest action-thriller is Non-Stop awesomeness!!! Read on to find out why this is probably the best film of the year so far!!!,"This is one rocking movie and Liam Neeson once again proves why when it comes to tense, gritty, grounded action, he's the best man for the job. With a resume including Oscar winning material such as Schindler's List and not to forget the fact that he's trained Batman, Obi Wan, The A-Team, Darth Vader and he is both Aslan and Zeus, in short, Liam Neeson is just one awesome dude!Unlike Jason Statham, Arnie, Stallone and the other usual action suspects, Neeson brings a certain vulnerable quality to his roles, makes them human, believable, which of course just pulls you in as the viewer. His first real foray into the world of action was Taken. A one-man army type story we've seen from Luc Besson many a time before (The Transporter series, the much underrated Kiss of The Dragon etc). The movie was a huge success thanks to Neeson's poignant performance. I saw the movie shortly after the passing of Neeson's wife, Natasha Richardson, which made his desperation in the movie seem all the more real. It was a huge success and is still one of my favourite action movies. Neeson followed up Taken with the pretty great Unknown, Taken 2, The Grey and now Non-Stop.Non-Stop may even be better than Taken. It's a close call, but it's at least as good as Taken was.Neeson plays Bill Marks, a troubled U.S. federal air marshal on board what should be a normal flight like any other. He soon starts receiving sinister messages on his phones encrypted air marshal instant messaging service with demands that 150 million dollars be transferred to an offshore account or a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes until the demands are met. The threat proves to be a real one and it becomes a race against time for Bill to try and identify the killer. 149 passengers, 149 suspects!This is a fantastic film. The tension grips you from the moment the text messages start rolling in and it doesn't relent until the movie reaches its satisfying close. A super tense, edge of your seat, whodunit thriller, which keeps you guessing right to the end.The action is tight and well choreographed but it's the drama which keeps you hooked. I especially loved how besides Neeson's character, there are several other fleshed out and important characters which made proceedings that much more real. Julianne Moore is of course pretty great as always. My only gripe was that I wish the fantastic Lupita Nyong'o from 12 Years a Slave had a more substantial role.The film ends with a bang on a very satisfying note and left me wanting to watch it again. There were no lulls or slow moments, once the momentum picks up, the movie just keeps going.Wristwatch fans should also be kept happy, look out for a nice close up shot of a Patek Philippe. If you know what model it is, please write in to us!I can't wait for this to come out on Blu-ray!Highly recommended, an excellent thriller, catch it on the big screen while you can!Rating 10 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Suspend too much reality to make this movie work,"I had hoped the movie would be more than it actually was. In order for the movie to come together, there were a couple of assumptions that had to be true in order for the movie to come together.While not central to the plot, it just seemed a little far-fetched that there would be a Federal Air Marshal who is afraid of flying. The trust between Mary and the Air Marshal also had no basis for it to be that deep. I micro-biologist who is summoned as a medical doctor. Even the end, landing in Iceland, the timing simply doesn't work with them landing in enough daylight that it's mid-morning.On a more critical level, the collective group behavior is unbelievably blasé, with hours unfolding and three dead bodies collecting before they band together, rise up, and demand answers from a visibly disturbed, abusive drunk Air Marshal. The Air Marshal alone, his actions appear to be borderline unprofessional from the beginning, and that undermines the ability of the audience to ever develop any compassion for him. He appears to be just as bad as the bad guy, and how does a movie work when there is no good vs. bad?The action is exciting. The general premise is interesting. And as long as the viewer suspends belief in basic human behaviors, the interactions become believable, and this movie begins to work. But for Non-Stop, that's a big leap of faith.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
We have a very enjoyable thriller over here!,"Non-Stop is a very pleasurable action thriller.Another one of those movies that I just liked immediately after it began. Some movies are like that, some, very few movies.As long as you don't expect another Taken, (this is thriller-material) you will probably have a very good time. Sure, there are some plot holes, I did not notice any during the movie, but have had them pointed out, but we (well you) should all stop focusing so damn much on plot holes. As long and they are not right in your face, and/or really poorly explained away, they don't matter.Liam Neeson is good, as he always is. the movie is kind of tense, and pretty exciting.

Non stop rubbish,"What a pity to see acting talent like Neeson and Moore wasted on this nonsensical plot.
For starters, almost the entire film is spent inside the aircraft, and before that, for a few minutes, inside an airport, making it an almost unbearably claustrophobic film. As if that were not unpleasant enough, Moore disappears from the screen for long periods, almost as if she leaves the plane, only to return to speak a few pointless lines to Neeson. She is not even seen mingling with other passengers, she does not appear in passenger group shots, but, rather, moves suspiciously around the toilet area, near the air hostesses and cockpit, and she contributes ZERO to the plot, apart from what appears to be a sudden blossoming of unexpected love for Neeson in the movie's last frames.Neeson, usually a highly reliable actor, is apathetic and never comes into his own in this flick - but then, he is not helped by a script that variously makes him a hero or a vlllain, and where passengers facing bomb and other threats actually have the luxury of watching TV and learning that Neeson is a psychopath cop, as if personal data like that were conveyed over TV, especially when there are hundreds of lives at risk in an aircraft under attack from a villain who is anything but credible or menacing, and who, for no apparent reason, actually saves Neeson from passenger lynching at one point.There is another, NYPD cop on board, but he is just as dumb and gullible as the would-be robbers/criminals, and tenderfoot as the little girl who reminds Neeson of his own dead daughter. So schmaltzy...The final straw in terms of credibility is the bomb that explodes and yet the plane is able to land with everyone apparently unscathed. I could have kicked myself for watching this NON-STOP rubbish to the end.Best avoided. Gets 1 star because I can't zero it.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great Plane Movie!,"Just watched the movie... Can say that the best plane movie in recent years... Liam Neeson is simply superb... A high-flying and intriguing Hitchcock style thriller on steroids. A first-class, edge of your seat thrill-machine that's laced with suspense, tension, action and so many twist and turns that will keep you guessing right to the end. A tremendously entertaining, wickedly original, explosively tense and adrenaline-charged roller-coaster... Liam Neeson is at it again in yet another enjoyable, disposable French-produced action flick in which a hapless, dishevelled guy with big personal problems is forced by circumstance to jump, run, growl and shoot people - often all at the same time.

Pretty much what you are expecting when seeing the trailer.,"From seeing the trailers this looked like it would be another great Liam Neeson action flick and it was just that. There were not that many surprises I found, to this film, other than that Lupita Nyong'o has a small role in this and it was nice to see her in this after seeing her win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar at the Academy Awards on March 2nd, 2014. Liam Neeson was of course great, and the rest of the cast really shined and worked to make this film as believable as it wanted you to. I will also say that this film was very intense and had my heart racing while watching the 3rd act played out. If you are a fan of the Taken films and are just a fan of Neeson in general, you won't be disappointed in the least.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Though the acting is fine, the script is a lame, lame soup made of clichés, stereotypes, overly politically-correctness-Islam-appeasement and a few liters of syrup for the oh SO predictable ending. My boyfriend guessed about 95% of the script in the first 7 minutes of the movie.Oh and the Action | Mystery | Thriller tags should be corrected to drama"", because the action was 2 minutes of fight/murder/plane-flying scenes, the mystery was not such mystery and there was boredom sobbing instead of thrills.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Most accurately titled movie in a long time,"Non-stop probably pulled them in as an action movie starring action stud Liam Neeson. And it delivers action in spades. At least it had me on the edge of my seat.But it's miles above the average actioner. In fact, I'd call it a conspiracy thriller of the kind Hollywood knew how to make in the late 60s and early 70s until Jaws came along (Or Star Wars, if you prefer) and brainless popcorn wiped away the best 10 years in movie-making history.OK, maybe the resolution is a little too ''Mannix: Epilogue."" But everything that came before it is so much fun, who really cares.And is it just me, or does Julianne Moore look smokin' hot even when she's stressed out about a bomb on the plane. In fact, I submit she looks even hotter.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best since Taken,"Went yesterday and really enjoyed it, as did my brother. If you haven't seen the trailer already, I suggest you don't watch it. I feel it gave too much away with the plot twist: you will know what I mean after you have watched the film Lots of plot twists (there is only 1 major one in the trailer). Really kept me thinking ""Who is it?"". And it was interesting to see a struggling Neeson (as in alcohol and breaking the rules despite being the air marshal!). As others have said, there are a few plot holes, but the main and important thing is that the film was really enjoyable. Neeson's best since Taken. If you liked Taken you will like this, along with the other Neeson films (although not as good as this or Taken) For those saying it was Anti-American (one saying all Muslims are terrorists), seriously you are blinded by news coverage and stereotypes. The majority of Muslims, sorry for my extreme generalizing, but ""black people"" in general are not terrorists. Yes, the terrorists we hear about on the news do are often black or foreign-to-the-US, but that doesn't mean every single person who is black or foreign is a terrorist. Perhaps the reason they didn't make the terrorists black was to avoid offense and stereotyping terrorists. Maybe this is just a film made for ENTERTAINMENT not a political message. The doctor who was giving help throughout the film was originally a suspect of Neeson's, but after questioning him, seeing his phone and him being a doctor meant that Neeson trusted him. Plus Neeson needed his help as being one of the perhaps only doctors on the plane. Plot holes: yes there were a few things overlooked but it is still a very enjoyable film and that should be what matters, not little things that make no difference (like the temperature as someone said in a different review)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fly Hard,"Well, that was forgettable fun. Liam Neeson as a sort of Gaelic-accented Bruce Willis, forced to hunt down a hijacker on a trans-Atlantic flight.I don't quite buy Neeson as an action hero. He's too a bit too portly these days, looking much more like he rather solve any problems by sitting down and having a good natter over a pint of Guinness, rather than go gallivanting around like a mad thing.He does put on a good show in this movie though. After boarding a plane, he starts getting text message threatening the lives of various passengers and crew, and has to gradually eliminate various suspects, often in a rather gung-ho fashion. He's not helped by everyone who should be helping thinking he's off his rocker.The movie switches from psychological drama to much more of an action film as it nears the end, and the final scenes are well handled and wind up events well.It a reasonably good action flick.

Non-Stop is amazing,"Drama? Suspense? Entertaining? Fun filled? Action? Mystery? It's hard to describe ""Non-Stop"" because it's all of these!

He is getting black mailed to move $150 million to an off shore account. If he doesn't someone on the plan will die every 20 minutes. The movie was estimated to make $ 50,000,000. It was shown on over 300 screens in the United States opening week. Nonstop is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. Jaume also was the director of Unknown (2011), Orphan (2009), and House of Wax (2005).

"While Neeson is good, this one doesn't fly","Ever since Taken took the box office by storm back in 2008 its aging star Liam Neeson has become somewhat of an action master appearing in films such as The A Team, Taken 2, Unknown, The Grey (which by the way is a seriously underrated gem) and now in Jaume Collet-Serra's thriller Non-Stop in which his presence alone saves this particular plane from a dreadful plunge into the deep dark oceans of movie badness.Non-Stop is one of those thrillers than remains quite preposterous the whole way through, a suspension of disbelief well and truly required if you are to enjoy it's over the top aeroplane goodies. A suspension of disbelief is made all the more possible thanks to Neeson whose role as alcoholic Air Marshall Bill Marks is enough to earn this movie an extra star. Neeson can do gruff, he can do wisecracks and he can do menacing and his on form here from the get-go. By now Neeson can do these type of roles in his sleep though and it's a little disappointing that an actor with obvious talent would continue to sell himself to these type of movies especially a movie such a this with no real redeeming features bar the man himself.I can guarantee annoyance levels will reach a near unbearable level about 30 minutes into Non-Stop when Bill's phone continues to ""ding ding"" with a message received tone, that is up FAR too loud. Annoyance is then ramped up with a continual reading of text messages displayed all over the screen in a shaky unfocused manner. These unfavourable decisions by the movie makers are not helped by a supporting cast either underused (Scott McNairy, Lupita Nyong'o who sports a hairdo not too far distant from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air) or overused (Julianne Moore, in another one of her ""needed the pay check"" roles) and the story working here hinges on what needed to be a perfect landing of an ending but instead we get a bumpy finish with a horrible last act and a severely underwhelming reveal of just who is behind all of this nasty threat business.The more you think about Non-Stop the more it will frustrate you with his myriad plot holes and incredibly daft decision making skills by its participants and while Neeson is once more a solid centre to an otherwise crumbling film there is no denying that Non-Stop is a flight you regret taking and an experience not dissimilar to flying economy class with a crying baby situated behind you as your next seat neighbour falls asleep on your shoulder.2 blue ribbons out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A watchable two star action flick with one of the stupidest plots in recent memory,"Liam Neeson, playing a haunted Air Marshall, starts receiving texts saying someone will be killed every 20 minutes until he transfers several hundred million dollars to an off shore account. In a very bad-ass manner, he tries to uncover the murderer and save the plane. Count me in! Liam Neeson is a great actor and manages to make being understated cool, while the premise, although preposterous, is claustrophobic and thrilling. As well as loving action films I also love mysteries so this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. And one of the most disappointing. If you saw this, do you actually remember any of it? Like, anything at all? I barely remember it and I only saw it a few months ago. A little worrying. Although this is a 2 star movie, it's not something I totally hated watching and I moderately enjoyed in some ways. Liam Neeson owns the film and brings grit and a tiny bit of emotion to a silly story. Lupita Nyong'o and Julianne Moore are both underused, but still good. It does have plenty of exciting moments, the direction is competent and it's an action film emphasizing tension over mindless thrills for once.So, it's a watchable movie and moderately exciting. But no enough. The film is style over substance but there's nothing wrong with that. But it can't decide on murder mystery or action thriller. It veers between the 2 in a very irritating manner. Although there are thrills, a lot of the time they don't go far enough and as the film goes on and it switches to brutal beat em up mode, it loses the sense of tension and claustrophobia it had at first. The primary thing that lets it down is the screenplay. This has a plot so stupid it's makes Snakes On A Plane look like a documentary. OK, so blockbusters are about suspension of disbelief but this takes action movie ridiculousness to a whole new level. But not in a good way like Fast & Furious. The plot doesn't make any kind of sense, and the plan of the main villain would have been impossible to pull off. This is total and utter rubbish in terms of storytelling and it is possible to pull off a plane set action film, but this would have worked better on a train. A ludicrous, although not totally unforgivable disappointment. Silly.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Taken on a plane with a mysterious tone,"Taken on a Plane, or Non-stop, is an action thriller that stars the Liam Neeson as Bill, an Air Marshal, on a international flight. It's not as action packed, but the who done it feel is well played and surprised me. Neeson kills his role again and it's no surprise either. It's like his agent is trying to find him roles like this constantly because Neeson is a superb action star and always brings his best to every role he gets. The supporting cast was alright, but Lupita Nyong'o was disappointing. I hope she is much in 12 Years a Slave (I haven't seen it yet). I loved the little girl and Julianna Moore in the movie. They are the high points in the supporting cast. There are actually touching moments in the movie, like when Neeson talks about his daughter, that got me choked up. All in all, this a must see.

Lacking in Too Many Areas,"I really could not in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone. There is little that is truly thrilling or suspenseful in what happens in this film, and it drags on to a whodunnit conclusion that you will probably not have guessed. But at that point you won't think ""Wow now I see how it was done!"" because like much of the rest of the film it is put together in a ham fisted way. Non-Stop is really not articulated well, and even it's final message is slapped over the top of your head in a clumsy way. Is there anything good to report? Well I can say that the use of text messages on screen was done in a relatively innovative way. Liam Neeson plays alcoholic and solitary Air Marshall Bill Marks very well. Marks haggard tired appearance unfortunately reflected my own growing tiredness as the film dragged on to a conclusion that was not able to save it.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Liam Neeson, Please Don't Stop","This film left me leaving the theater in a complete sweat because of all the intensity from the get-go. Even simple things such as a character taking a breath will force you to question their motives and it is basically a 100 minute roller coaster ride. Liam Neeson has reassured the public here again that he is both an action and drama star with a bit of comedy flair. The movie shouldn't be written off as a dumb and forgettable action flick because it's the complete opposite, there is a lot of entertaining action but is also a top ranking film when it comes to it's characters who all have multiple emotional layers to them, even ones in minor roles. This is then able to drag you into the scenario which will not let go until the very end. The story is actually very smart throughout, without making you feel as the script was trying to cheat or make plot holes. Personally, the cinematography was quite impressive mostly because of the constricted space allowed and also the dark complexion given to the picture. I am shocked to say that this is most likely the best film of 2014 so far that contains a twist that is not at all clichéd which is a breath of fresh air.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Turn your brain off and enjoy the ride,"Non-Stop pits Liam Neeson in yet another race against time, fight for your life drama and it pays off. This is just the type of film you'd expect to see in Feburary/March. It is fun, light and action packed. Liam Neeson plays a down on his luck ex-cop turned Air Marshall who is framed by terrorist and sets out to clear his name all while on a flight in mid-air, over the Atlantic Ocean. The film really does an excellent job of showing us just enough to raise suspicions for just about every character on the plane, including Neeson's character. This is a wild ride of a film and it comes as a real surprise considering this time of the year is dumping grounds for studios. Neeson, still bolstering off of the success of the Taken series and other films such as The Grey, really doesn't let his fan base down here. He plays a mean, surly, cigarette smoking badass and he does so with enough charisma that we don't really mind seeing him do the same thing over and over again. A nice addition to Neeson's performance is Julianne Moore. Moore isn't Oscar-caliber here (obviously) but she does just enough to keep the film going. The rest of the cast has typical action movie one liners that are corny and cheesy but for a film like this, it works beautifully.The story progresses as a Hitchcock film with a Luc Besson-esque twist, utilizing its one area setting to create some massive tension in every scene. Overall, this is a fun movie that you can watch and just enjoy thoroughly. Do yourself a favor and give this one a shot.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Entertaining, makes you stay fixed to the screen.","Probably not the best plot, or not even a perfect crew of actors besides Liam Neeson, but the good point of the movie is none of those, but the thrill it gives you on certain moments. It leaves you to keep trying to think and guess who is the responsible behind the scenes, but it keeps you around, with no clue at all, and that is what will make you with your eyes fixed to the screen, because you want to know who is behind all this. What also got my attention was that in certain moments, everything change, and all my guesses were wrong and it backs to 0. A very interesting movie, but if you are looking for an action movie or a movie with a shooting scene, that is not your movie, this is the kind of movie, the involves terrorism and stays with the thriller type.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Non-Stop"" Thrills","I was wanting to see Non-Stop in theaters for a really long time, but I never got around to seeing it. Eventually I just forgot about it, and after that I saw how it came out on DVD and remembered how much I wanted to see it. I rented it before buying it, to make sure I liked it. I sure as heck did. I was on the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie. This is only because it was so original and fun to watch. One thing that goes along with the originality is the group of text bubbles that appear when a text is sent between Liam Neeson and the killer. Instead of having to look very hard at the screen of the phone and missing some of the text message, you could easily read all of the texts at the fast pace of the movie. Jaume Collet-Serra and the writers did such a good job putting this movie together that the 106 minutes just flew by. One of the main things that makes this a good mystery is that there aren't any flaws. As I looked back several times throughout the movie, I never noticed any goofs. There probably are, but I just didn't notice them. Well, maybe one or two, now that I think about it. But it was still an awesome mystery movie, and is up there with Neeson's other mystery/action movies, such as Taken. Another thing I like about the movie is that the plot is so original. I know I already said the movie was original, but I didn't say the plot was. I have never seen a plot or main idea like the one in Non-Stop. I never knew what to expect because of that, and that also helped the rating for me. There were several other things that kept the movie interesting for me, though. For example, the acting. With stars such as Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, and Scoot McNairy, I had no doubt that the acting was going to be awesome. I was right. The acting is amazing, and the emotions displayed and the lines of the actors came together perfectly. The dialogue was another great thing about this movie, because cheesy lines were completely non- existent. For example, instead of saying ""I didn't do it,"" the character would say something that delved into whether or not they did it, including stuff like evidence and honesty (whether they are being honest or not, if that makes sense). That also made Non-Stop a fun movie. The music was sort of in the background, and you could not hear it that much, but it kind of went along with the rhythm of the story if you listen really closely. Another thing that made this movie awesome is the setting. Being on a plane full of innocent (most of them) passengers, small rooms and fight scenes really made Non-Stop a thrilling movie. In fact, that is another thing that made this movie original; it was on a plane. That is really all I have to say about Non- Stop. I hope you found this review helpful. Check out some of my other reviews. See ya!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non stop - tension and thrill all the time aka non stop,"Finally a real action movie! Liam is currently turned into the first action hero of Hollywood. (Sry Statham). After Takena which is to me great action movie, took a slightly inferior sequel, and, in my opinion, this is a full Non-stop hit. Introduction to the story about ten minutes and then an hour and a half of tension, fear, paranoia, reversals and, most importantly, totally unpredictable. The film may have some little mistakes, but it is action, and this is easily ignored. Interestingly, filmed because the action happens 95% of the time on the plane. I put him in rankings Rambo and Die Hard. Thank you, Liam, for showing people and other filmmaking teams who to make a proper action movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Thrill has not even fallen for a moment, the director is always doing these kinds of movies and really mastering it

Well it has Liam Neeson kicking ass and taking names,"This is one of those ridiculous thriller/action flick that gets even more ridiculous as it progresses. However it has Liam Neeson kicking ass and taking names. So I was in, and Neeson basically carries this movie. However this was one of those movies that seemed to just make stuff up as it goes when it comes to the plot. It's a serious toned movie that gets wacky with it's ridiculousness one too many times. Not once did I go ""wow that was actually quite clever"". However it's still a decent entertaining flick. Not really all that good, but still quite watchable thanks to Neeson. Oh and the climax was really dumb.5.9/10",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intense thriller full of intense moments of pure shock and suspicion,"Jaume Collet-Serra's Non-Stop was intense thriller full of intense moments of pure shock and suspicion. From the moment the movie started it's fairly obviously that the cast for the movie has been chosen almost perfectly. We are introduced to a broken Bill Marks, portrayed by the one and only Liam Neeson, who portrayed almost perfectly a broken man. Neeson does a good job in this to give off a personality of someone who has been through a lot, someone wise. Along with Neeson's strong performance we have Julian Moore's accompanying and powerful performance complimenting Neeson's investigation, she adds on to the more emotional side throughout the intense flight. Non-stop takes place on an international flight, an Air Marshall named Bill Marks boards the plane and begins to receive messages from an unknown person. The individual begins threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes if $150 million dollars are not transferred to an account. As intense scenes begin to unfold the struggle of an investigation to find the unknown individual seems to be pointing to Bill as the plane hijacker. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing what really happens next, it takes pretty good writing to be unpredictable.What really brought together the movie was Richardson and Roach's brilliant script. Throughout the whole movie I sat there trying to guess who was the bad guy, it was like everyone on the plane was in the wrong place at the wrong time and just made everyone look extremely guilty. It was almost like a clue version of investigation but on a plane. Anyone could be the individual even those who seemed completely trustworthy could suddenly look extremely suspicious. On top of this, watching the mastermind that carefully planned out the hijacking so Bill (Neeson) would appear as the real hijacker was brilliantly suspenseful. The brilliant script was accompanied by beautiful cinematography. Throughout the movie we witness very small details within the vast of action and shock, accompanied by close-ups of those witnessing in terror. At one point it seems like the whole plane is just going to crash and just for a moment it slows down and takes a look at the only child in the movie illustrating sheer terror in her eyes. It gave it not only a very intense feel but a more dramatic feel to the events occurring rather than having a bunch of clash of intense action scenes filled with mindless passengers with no reaction but screaming. When I began watching the film I was expecting another action filled thriller full of explosions and intense scares, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the movie was complimented pretty often by moments of pure connection. You can actually understand peoples despair and their motivations for what they do. Instead of placing the pasts of people out there blatantly and out of place, we see their real persona bleed through still giving us room for suspicion of who they are but yet more of an idea of what kind of person they are.If you are looking for a movie that keeps you guessing, surprised, and shocked throughout the movie then look no further. I would even go as far as saying that this was one of the greatest movies of 2014. Not a completely mindless action film but rather one that actually requires you to pay attention to understand to everything is going on. It was a brilliant film and now after seeing the film I re-watched the film and noticed amount of details surrounding the plot put into this amazing movie. Non-Stop is a perfect example of what thrillers should be.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredulous,"Non-Stop has Liam Neeson ('Taken') in a tailor-made role for him. Neeson has starred in a number of action films of late and has a steady popular following. His appeal is what I call the Neeson effect: presence, a crumbling resonant voice, and more than a capable action hero.In Non-Stop he plays a world weary U.S. Air Marshall. The plane he is on, to London, has someone perpetuating text messages attempting to nab millions of dollars. The threatening messages are sent to the air Marshall's mobile phone. He springs to action in an Agatha Christie style plot.There is a build-up of suspense and suspicion and there is Julianne Moore as a feisty and friendly passenger, but is she trustworthy.This movie hinges on paranoia, suspicion and intensity, and it doesn't quite come together. Unhinging camera work signifies something's amiss, but we still doubt the story's credibility.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lots Of Action,I really enjoyed this movie. This is definitely one of my favorite Liam Nesson movies. Like most Liam Nesson movies it was very action packed and there were a lot of fighting scenes in this movie. The setting of this movie is a transatlantic jetliner bound for London. And this movie takes advantage of the setting because of the small setting we get to learn a lot of information about all of the passengers on the plane and we get to watch them develop as characters the movie makes you identify characters. It will make you figure out who the good guys and the bad guys are. Liam Nesson did a great job portraying a Air Marshal. And throughout the movie you are on the edge of your seat trying to guess what will happen this whole movie will keep you guessing. And overall it is one of my favorite action movies I did not see much wrong with it except for some scenes that lacked realism. This movie was definitely one of the most epic movies I have ever seen.,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Quite a ride,"A very enjoyable movie. Bill, an air marshal, seems to have been set up as the bad guy, and no matter how he tries, things got worse for him. On a Federally restricted phone network, text messages gives him threats that a person will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is wired, and it turns out wired to his bank account. And the body count adds up. The text messages suggest they are coming from inside the plane, as they know what he is doing. The second air marshal on the flight seems to be the dirty one, with cocaine smuggled in his briefcase. Add that to the heavy handed approaches Bill uses to try and find out who is sending the text messages, it is not the way to get people on your side. And there are enough twists and turns to keep one guessing as the tempo and the threats to the passengers increase. But no matter how bad it is made to look for Bill, he still has a single minded determination to protect the plane and the passengers. But how when the authorities have already decided he is the hijacker doing it for the money? And a reputation as an alcoholic doesn't help his case.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie.,"I enjoyed the movie. It's been quite a while since I've been capable of watching an entire movie from start to finish without giving in to boredom.

Puzzle action yet real.,"Just finish watching this movie.For me myself I like this movie. Good story line, best acting by Liam Neeson (starting following his movies after watching Taken).I called this movie as Puzzle action real movies.Puzzle Why I say puzzle. because it take us to wonder who the real bad guy is from 150 people on the plane. how the writer perfectly make a bad guy that can manipulate people into their bad side (willingly or not).Real Action Real action because it's not like stereotype Hollywood action movies, where the good guys can still stand after get shot, blown, thrown outside 2nd or 3rd floor, still can run after hit by a car etc. Real in a way that it use logic not merely action shoot bomb win. how the bomb procedure to down at 8000ft, no shooting the glass that ended up the body of the plane wreck in half but can still landing, people hit by the metal when the body of the plane wreck, etc. For me as an ordinary people all the events happened on the movies still can be regarded as logic.For me myself, I like this movies. because it makes us think, not just sit and see a lot of gun shot and boom everywhere. I like how the writer create the good guys, yet he's having problem with alcohol, family etc. and what makes me like it more that, no kissing or bed scene like almost every other Hollywood movies.I don't know what else to say rather than two thumbs up for Liam Neeson, The writer, all the cast and the director.

Very Liam Neeson-ish!,"Non-Stop features Liam Neeson as Bill Marks, a Federal Air Marshal, who is alone-some and disturbed. Marks boards a plane traveling from New York to London and mid-way through, he receives a message that says 'Going to kill in every 20 minutes unless $150 million are not transferred in to his account'.Turns out, the account is in Marks name and this is a big setup to crash the plane and stand mark, the US Air Marshall responsible. From there on, the suspense starts to unravel. The ending about the motives of the hijackers isn't that intriguing as much as the other half of the movie.The movie is shot quite wonderfully and the acting is very good.

A Liam Neeson thriller with lots of suspense and a clunky ending,"The movie did well on delivering what it aimed to give the audience. It gave thrills, suspense, and mystery. The acting was done well though some of the characters lacked chemistry and line delivery struggled at points. The writing was good and the story had some originality to it. The real problem is with the ending which, like an airplane crashing, dive bombs from a high level of action and suspense to an unsatisfactory and empty ending. A good movie with a bumpy landing for an ending is an enjoyable movie that the whole family can enjoy! I am rating Non-Stop a 6 because the story and characters are engaging and it definitely adds suspense for the viewer!

"Twists and turns, until the very end !","There have been quite a few movies based on planes, and this was definitely one of the better ones. As a man who has been classified as a paranoid alcoholic myself, I felt very strongly for the character Liam Neeson was portraying. The confusion and paranoia was evident throughout the movie, as the minutes ticked by, and more people died. Right up to the very end, you didn't know how it was going to turn out. Considering the whole movie was set on a plane, the director, actors, and script were all excellent in giving us a mystery, as to who or what was involved. It reminded me in a funny way of a film noir, or cold war thriller, the paranoia was very real and intense and the enemy was unseen and mysterious.I gave this movie a nine, for very close to perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good one,"I like Neeson, always have. He is a good, very dependable actor, who's had bad movies, but never by his fault. After great dramas, like The Schindler's list, Nell, Michael Collins and a variety of good thrillers, he is really becoming an action star, from Star Wars, across Taken, to Non-stop and it really suits him.Julianne Moore was also good. Her character was a bit redundant, but still good enough. There was no forced romance and it suited me just fine, because the focus was on the manhunt, the action.This is a really good suspense movie. It has enough of everything action, mystery, heartfelt moments. A lot of good supporting characters.

Non-Stop: A preposterous 90s throwback that offers thrills aplenty.,"People seem to have forgotten how to review films like these nowadays and whereas many would chastise this film for being a big dumb action movie, Non-Stop is a throwback to the 90s thriller. Liam Neeson's nearly unthinkable career transformation into a major action star (the most surprising since Leslie Nielsen turned Comedy icon with Airplane!) continues and the results are silly but vastly enjoyable. For a good majority of the duration, this hijack Thriller plays out like a Marple whodunnit meets Air Force One, before descending into chaos (albeit not jarringly so).If you come in craving a realistic story of hijacking, you will leave frowning but the fact is that Non-Stop fulfils its requirements as a genre movie. Neeson once more anchors the film, handling the tidbits of action (a well staged toilet cubicle scrap in particular) and suspense with professional verve. The supporting cast, though some are wasted, also lend their full commitment and it all concludes to a ridiculously good night at the movies. Even when the mystery is revealed and logic has gone out the window, you are not dispirited because the entertainment value persists.This is not classic cinema but it is well made, gripping, fun, boasting a selection of standout moments. It lacks the ruthlessness of Taken and the ideological underpinnings of The Grey but it matches Collet-Serra's last film Unknown and outdoes the (at times) haphazard Taken 2. You'll leave entertained and remembering that zero-G gunshot- which has internet meme written all over it, ironic really as this is a 90s flick through and through.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Free Flights for Everyone!,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hollywood is a true believer in the theory that imitation is the greatest form of flattery. The constant attempts to capture the same lightning bolt in the same bottle would be kind of funny, if not so frustrating for us movie-goers. Liam Neeson's surprise hit with 2008's Taken spawned not just a Taken sequel, but now two movies from director Jaume Collet-Serra - this one and the disappointing Unknown. Oh well, it's easy money for Neeson and it's not the worst early year release.It's been 20 years since Liam Neeson's Oscar nominated performance in Schindler's List. Rather than a great actor, he might best be described as a familiar screen presence ... a guy we can somehow relate to most of the time. Well, at least until he unleashes his particular set of skills ... this time in an airplane lavatory! The set up for this thriller is quite promising. Neeson plays an alcoholic US Air Marshal looking and sounding quite beaten down by life in the first few minutes. Once on his flight, he receives a text informing him that someone onboard will be killed every 20 minutes until $150 million is transferred into his account. It's a combination hijacking, extortion, whodunnit murder mystery and blackmail story. Unfortunately the three first time screenwriters (one of whom ""wrote"" for the WWE) botch every possible twist and turn. With a plane full of suspects, we play right along with Neeson as he begins the process. We've enjoyed the claustrophobic approach to movie thrillers before in such movies as Flight, Air Force One, Flightplan and even Phone Booth.For whatever reason, this plane never feels cramped and the tight spaces only come into play with the aforementioned lavatory fight scene, and even that seems like the most spacious airplane restroom of all-time. Even the multiple drop-dead deadlines aren't really played for full effect, and the decent supporting cast isn't given much to do, save for looking suspiciously at Neeson.Julianne Moore co-stars, but mostly her role consists of disbelieving stares and a tilt of the head. Corey Stoll (House of Cards) gets a few juicy scenes, as does the always interesting Scoot McNairy. Unfortunately, Oscar nominee Lupita Nyong'o, Shea Whigham, Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey), and Nate Parker have little to do, and the absolute wasting of Anson Mount is a crime.If you are skittish about flying, there is no reason to see this one, though the convoluted motive and lackluster reveal might help you forget the story takes place on an international flight. The one thing we do learn is that Liam Neeson can take a fire extinguisher to the head and bounce right back up without a mark. Let's add that to his particular set of skills, while we less than anxiously await yet another collaboration between Neeson and this director coming in 2015.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"thrilling ride at 40,000 feet!","Old man Liam Neeson does it again. His hulking energy and imposing screen presence makes Non-Stop an excellent action thriller. At 61, post Taken, Neeson is enjoying his second lease of Hollywood stardom, and his first as an action star. Seems his purple patch has no end in sight.Non-Stop is a murder mystery much in the vein of an Agatha Christie novel, set 40,000 feet in the air, within the confines of an aircraft. Neeson plays Bill Marks, a down in the dumps US Air Marshall who takes to the bottle whenever he can to overcome his perpetual grief over the loss of his daughter. When at work in a non-stop flight from New York to London, he suddenly starts receiving threatening text messages demanding $150 million. Failure to meet the demand means someone in the flight would be killed every 20 minutes.The person making these demands seem to know Marks well, at the same time looks like he is sitting in the plane itself. Bodies start to drop, and when Marks tries to find out the killer, he finds out that he is being set up. The airplane offers a wide array of characters- a drug dealing fellow Marshall, a NYPD cop, Julianne Moore's chatty friendly co-passenger, an Arab doctor, and a mobile software expert, among others. It is a claustrophobic scenario, and committing murders in front of everyone borders on the impossible. The magic of Non-Stop, then is to make all this believable.Director Jaume Collet-Serra who has established himself with the 2009 horror flick, Orphan, and has directed Neeson earlier in Unknown, has shot 95% of the film is within the confines of an airplane, but he does so with style and pace, including a manic fight in a lavatory and a crazy emergency landing. He knows his star well, and uses his appeal to the max. As the gruff, flawed, and increasingly desperate hero- Liam Neeson currently has no equal. As the movie progresses and his character's tragic past is revealed, it comes to light that he will actually do anything it takes to save the people on the flight.There are a lot of loopholes in the plot, but the thrill, intrigue, suspense, action and a star in full flow makes Non-Stop a highly recommended film- 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A crime drama and psychological thriller in one,"This is a great movie that does two things extremely well. First, it is an intense crime drama where a mystery passenger on a airplane is taking the passengers hostage through phone communication and targeted attacks. At the same time, though, it is a psychological thriller as Liam Nielson's character is at war with himself throughout the movie wondering if he really was capable of what he was being accused of. The director does an excellent job with the camera work to paint that picture for the viewer and it makes for an artistic story line that elevates this movie above simply an action movie. The hardest part of movies like this is ending them, but this one succeeds with a good ending that makes this movie one I would both rewatch and recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Revisit The Grey instead.,"The next movie in Liam Neeson's badass phase, Non-Stop is the sort of flick that becomes worse, and stupider, the more you think about it. Set aboard a mid-flight airliner where a concealed passenger threatens to kill somebody every 20 minutes unless paid $150m, it initially appears clever and ripe with opportunity. However when the ludicrous third-act twist comes along, it becomes evident just how dumb the plot really is, subsequently making what came before it harder to swallow. Which is a shame because for the first hour or so it's a decent thriller. The claustrophobic setting offers a few splices of tension, the occasional sudden change in the plane's elevation allows director Jaume Collet-Serra to include some choice slow-mo moments and the rare fight sequences – a bathroom brawl a standout – are effective. Neeson gives good gruff as the U.S. Air Marshall attempting to save the day and Michelle Dockery excels as an experienced air hostess conflicted when Neeson's Marshall is posed by the media as a hijacker, however Corey Stoll is dire as a dogged NYPD cop aboard the flight and Julianne Moore seems embarrassed to be there as a frequent flyer and potential love interest. If it weren't for the drivel in the final 30 minutes Non-Stop would be passable cinema fodder, as it is if you're looking for an exciting, interesting and smart Neeson-thriller you should revisit The Grey instead.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly better than expected!,"I would rate it 10/10 but I don't want to oversell it but be as realistic as possible. The movie is incredibly played out and totally mind blowing including being unexpected. The plot that is being played out is so evened out that you wont see it coming. The main goal is to figure out who the blackmailing criminal is but the whole plot and characters is so played out that its so hard to guess who it is and that you'll end up saying its everyone! The way the movie depicted each character builds the suspense on to who it actually it. The movie breaks down character by character till there's one left but swings the other way to a whole nother-level. The movie sets out characters to be the person but don't believe it! To be honest the way they carry out the ending is incredibly thought out and couldn't end any better. Give it a go, the action in it is earth shattering... Literally ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop is a good chamber thriller,"Non-Stop is a good chamber thriller. In 2014, the topic with similar films starring Liam Neeson had not yet had time to get bored. Non-Stop has a strong cast, Juliana Moore's performance is great. Suspense works almost the entire film, only the first third of the film falls in terms of dynamics, personally for me. The development of the plot is not the fastest way. Of course, if the final part of the movie wasn't something of a fantasy, then Non-Stop would be better. The final action scenes destroy the whole atmosphere of the film. Non-Stop can still be attributed more to trippers than to action movies. And it's a good thriller.

Predictable and unoriginal,"Non-Stop (2014) is yet another generic Action/Thriller movie staring Liam Neeson. After the huge success of the 2008 film Taken and it's sequel Taken 2 Neeson has stared in several Action films in which he plays almost the same character every time. Non-Stop is just one in a long line of action films that takes a genuinely good actor like Neeson and type casts him in several unoriginal films made to capitalise on his most successful character role.In Non-Stop Neeson plays Bill Marks a discredited, alcoholic, ex cop turned air marshal who's forced to work overtime as a second air marshal on a flight to London. Shortly after the plane takes off Bill receives a message on a secure network from someone aboard the plane who threatens to kill one passenger every twenty minutes if a ransom isn't paid into a secure account. Bill immediately begins to investigate whether of not the threat is legitimate or just a horrible prank gone too far. Soon enough the threat becomes all to real and what starts out as just another routine flight turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse as Bill desperately tries to find the mysterious terrorist aboard a plane filled with innocent people. Everyone aboard the plane becomes a suspect with few allies and little time Bill puts his own grief aside to save a plane full of innocent passengers.The plot is written to be more complex and intricate than it actually is by adding multiple side characters to distract the viewer into thinking they know who the culprit is which can work when done right. However in Non-Stop every character including Neesons is set up as a potential suspect which is meant as a clever ploy to misdirected the viewer but instead just comes across as an obvious decoy. A good mystery story will keep you guessing until the last second. However Non-Stop unfortunately falls into the category of being predictable and cliche where the culprit is easily guessed by the casual viewer.I wouldn't recommend buying Non-Stop on 4K-ULTRA HD or anything but if your looking for a half way decent action movie to pass the time with then you can certainly do worse than Non-Stop.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Stakes Never Been Higher!,"Non-Stop is a better-than-average action movie that takes place solely in the air. With the only location being an airplane, this action film manages to be quite thrilling and entertaining. I thought this would be a retread of Taken, but in the air but instead it's a complex thriller that has quite a few twists. It's the kind of movie where you'll never quite know who the villain is until they reveal themselves. That is what I liked about this movie.Jaume Collet-Serra's film is about an alcoholic air marshal who has a haunted past. Aboard a transatlantic flight, he receives text messages saying that people will die unless he transfers 150 million dollars into an offshore account. Now in a race against time and unknown villains, Bill Marks must be sure to hit the right mark.Liam Neeson does very well in this role as the grizzly drunk air marshal. When needed, he still features a simple set of action moves that made him a bona-fide action star. Julianne Moore was good, though I feel like her role should have been more challenging. We also get good supporting turns from Scoot McNairy and Lupita N'yongo.Overall, Non-Stop is a surprisingly great action thriller that is tense and suspenseful. The twists and turns come out at you from each direction, so I must give the screenplay the credit it deserves for not making the film predictable. If you're expecting this film to be Taken in the air, then you're in for a surprise. There are a few action scenes, but not as much as there could have been so this film works more of a thriller thankfully.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Non Stop - errors,Liam Neeson is great actor and also great as the action star too and I was looking forward to seeing Non Stop so I have and this is what I think of it. The movie is good but not great however it does have a few funny good scenes It is over the top but there's nothing with over the top as it's just a movie but certain things should be taken seriously and thought of more clearly as 2 things in the movie which I thought were silly and annoying. Smoking on airlines is strictly forbidden even one wouldn't be able to smoke in the toilet as that person would be kicked off the plane and maybe prosecuted and stewardesses wear fully sleeved clothing not sleeveless dresses. They might as well have had a jukebox on the plane. Obviously the film has other unrealistic moments but the ones I pointed out was just basic so someone obviously hasn't done their homework,4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Honest about what it is,"Non-Stop set its sights on being a mid-air heavy action whodunit and sets forth to stealthily achieve that goal. Sometimes its possible to smell ""producer cold feet"" syndrome, where stock action-flick action gets hyperbolic toward the end--and you can tell that the producers are panicking and pulling rank over the director. Non-Stop doesn't suffer from this: It's designed, from the ground up, to be a steady IV drip of incrementally escalating dramatic tension, built around a simple, operatic concept: Someone, for some reason, wants to endanger everyone on a transatlantic flight.Like I said, it's operatic and simple, albeit with flurries of complication arising largely from the mystery: What are the motives and means involved?The usual barrier is encountered: The viewer disbelief over the unlikelihood of the byzantinely complex scenario can be suspended IFF the mythos is compelling enough.Is it? Mmmmmm...maybe. Oddly, the ultimate revelation of the motive is a key point in the flick, and it'd be spoiling to reveal it, here. Not giving anything away, it's a guy at the frazzled end of his psychological rope, seeking to make a large social point.Another aspect of the mythos is time-honored (read: OLD): It's what Paddy Chayefsky characterized in Network (1975) as the ""crusty-but- benign"" public servant character.I give this flick as high a score as I do because it's honest about its intentions and amazingly fleshes in those intentions with very good production values and pacing. Non-Stop is not normally my cup o' tea, but I found it nonetheless compelling, in a parameterized sort of way.The tension follows the eldritch narrative trajectory; exponentially rising tension to a vertiginous height, a brief chain of intense crisis moments, release, a coda of calmness and connection.From time to time, I chime in on IMDb User Comments to tell readers to avoid certain movies, and I try (and don't always succeed) in telling folks why. The usual reason to avoid a flick is artlessness. Strange to say for a made-to-spec action flick, but Non-Stop is amazingly artful. I would definitely recommend it to budding screenwriters.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great plots in a small space,the cabin","The beginning mentioned something about security, something like it was impossible to realize even the government put all the budget into it.By that time I guess this could be a movie about hijacking. Things turned out to be uncertain since the first text came up, Neeson's reaction was just what the hijackers wanted.But we have no idea about what's going on until Neeson took out his gun and badge in the toilet.I was wondering whether the bad guys gonna be silly enough by wasting the time to text. Fortunately they were not, Neeson was on his own after the setup killing his partner. Plots from then became really appealing , everyone was guessing who gonna be the next victim and who was the killer. The scenery becomes a typical dilemma as SHERLOCK when we suspect every possible guy,including those we had trusted before. And mostly we have no idea about that at all otherwise it would be a boring movie ,we are just denying all the conclusion we made before...Interestingly that's why we prefer thrillers lol...The complicated situation on the plane nearly driven Neeson crazy and hopeless, even his boss didn't believe him. That's cruel for him,for a lonely old man regarding job as his only duty. It's very important for him that the attendants and the woman on his side still trusted him all the way till the end,which was all Neeson could count on during the tough time..The man with the glasses headed to Armsterdam saved Neeson in crisis to show he was a good man,well at least I bought it..As well as the smart-phone programmer ,seemed so trustworthy and reliable.However,it was just a setup over another setup waiting Neeson to activate.The trust crisis was choking us to make all the things like Neeson's illusion, a true hero's insanity. The copilot,attendant gave Neeson a hand in his very need.The attendant dared to stand out in face of the terrorists,and the copilot dared to go against typhoons' warning to drop to 8,000 feet.The emergency landing was made toughly but successfully,saving all the passengers on board. The plots were catching us all the time. Maybe Neeson is just an actor who is good at being an agent to save people. He can always move us more or less ,comparing to other action actors,coz he is just so charming with a sign of caring. The last smile between the woman and him means a lot. If we could know who blow the poison arrow to the captain,if we could know how did the man with glasses put the phone into the lawyer's pocket with his hand tied,if we could know whether the passenger get their free trips,if we could know why don't the terrorists bomb the plane without the delay if he never intended to escape?

Review: Non-Stop/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,"In 2009, actor Liam Neeson starred in Pierre Morel's surprise sleeper hit Taken, and what begun was an onslaught of early year/before spring Neeson action releases that solidified the star as playing aging, 'could-be real life' superheroes. Since then, there are only two things certain about early action film releases; there will always be one featuring kick-ass icon Jason Statham playing the younger, balder super human hero, and one featuring Neeson, usually playing a wrinkled, more seasoned action star who could very well be your father (or grandfather)–which was badass three films ago. Deep down I am secretly waiting for Hollywood to come to their senses and announce a showdown between the two action superstars. Now talk about a kick-ass early year action release that we kinda saw coming. With something as expected as a Neeson release, also comes the expectation for a clichéd, unoriginal, and purely entertaining action story line. Unexpectedly collaborating again with his Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra, Neeson buckles up for an actioner set in the sky. Unlike the highly entertaining nineties guilty pleasure Air Force One, Non-Stop seems to steer more in the direction of the wholly disastrous Flightplan. After all is said and done, the film becomes a constant re-hashing of previous wind-cutting skyline action films without much original altitude.Neeson plays Bill Marks, an ex-NYPD officer whose life has been riddled by alcohol and pity for his inability to deliver as a father and husband. Taking cues from 2012 Flight, the comparison between Washington's intoxicated and wholly unorthodox airline pilot Whip Whitaker and Neeson's drunken Air Marshal Marks is almost impossible to ignore–but with less satisfying results. As Marks boards his next plane, arguing with his superiors on the phone, he is on the look out for suspecting terrorists. Like most flights today, everyone who boards seem to be the same blend of miserable, occupied, exhausted and professional. As the flight takes off and Marks grips his armrest, he befriends his by chance, first-class neighbour Jen Summers (Julianne Moore). As they get to know one another, Marks receives an anonymous message via a secure network on his mobile device threatening to kill a passenger on the flight every twenty minutes. As the plane makes its way over the Atlantic, hours from the closest airport, Marks must figure out who is attempting to sabotage the plane and it's passengers, as well as frame him for a terrorist attack on the very plane he was hired to Marshal.Screenwriters John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle had the potential to do so much with a script surrounding an Air Marshal in a post-9/11 world, yet the three seemed to diddle-daddle in familiar, mystery/thriller action territory. The characters are just about as interesting as the reasoning behind the terrorist attack. Neeson brings nothing new or special to the role, leaving all that talent behind on the runway. Obvious jabs are directed towards the only clear terrorist stereotype of the film, Dr. Fahim Nasir, played with poise by Omar Metwally, the only Afghan on the flight. Throughout the film, the other passengers questions Marks' quick and uninterested attitude towards Dr. Nasir, usually resulting in a face with raised eyebrows and a ""that's it?"", even from fellow officer on-board Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll). Non-Stop shows the ignorance and fear that people still carry with them while travelling as so many are still quick to assume terror with Muslims or Middle-Easterners. It was moments like these that make one question the integrity and intelligence of the writers; either they intentionally sought to bring to light this point, or they just felt the need to capitalize on an assumption they figured everyone would make. If you ask me, this alone would make for a much more interesting take on the affects of people on a non-stop flight than what was delivered instead.The film is a truly safe, by-the numbers 'whodunit' with traces of unoriginal directing and half- assed acting. Marks watches his plane fill up with people with hazy eyes and blurry vision, insinuating his drunken state of mind. It's too bad the film serves nothing interesting once your strapped in and settled.By the time the big twist comes and the baddies are revealed, there are only a few questions that are left running around non-stop; is there anything Moore can't be good at? How was Collet- Serra able to round out a cast that includes Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker and Lupita Nyong'o? And why the hell is Neeson so inclined to collaborate with his formulaic and unoriginal director a third time in the upcoming Run All Night feature that is set on February 6th 2015, where, as expected, much of the same uncreative action antics will surely take place?Non-Stop may deliver cheap thrills, ludicrous revelations, and half-hearted scenes of redemption with much entertainment, but contrary to its title, things seem to move at a much slower rate than suggested. By the time the credits role, one of the questions I was continually asking myself was, why the heck wasn't I drinking during this turbulent, bumpy ride of a film?",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The actions of the character played by Liam are just too stupid for words and although I'm happy to allow characters to make dumb decisions it gets tedious and ridiculous when they keep making the same errors over and over and the only discernible reason for this to happen is to drive a ludicrous plot that would otherwise fall apart completely. Liam was irritating as the overly aggressive marshal and the majority of the cast working with him were superfluous. There were numerous plot holes, lots of subplots that went nowhere, shallow stereotypes, an annoying over-use of red-herrings and whole scenes directly stolen from other - better - movies with similar themes.

Disappointing,"The last true action hero, the towering elderly Liam Neeson returns to his recently found career path of on-screen macho in this hi-flying adrenaline rush. Neeson plays Bill Marks, an alcoholic ex-cop with family issues (doesn't he always?), who now works as one of the thousands of air marshals, hired in the aftermath of post-9/11 frenzy. Often unverified and with little to no background checks, various non- suitable personnel is let on-board aeroplanes (at least such is the premise of the movie) with an armed gun. Soon after start off Marks starts receiving enigmatic text messages claiming that sooner than later people will start dying on the aeroplane, unless funds are transferred to a given account. As Marks attempts to hunt down the perpetrator the body count starts to increase and soon doubts arise as to who the real culprit is...Initially promising, especially given Neeson makes for the ideal off- beat antihero, the story shifts into a whodunit scenario, with paranoia rife as to the people responsible. As such the movie however lacks originality and seems like a laboured rip-off of ""The Flight Plan"", which at least managed to keep tension high and had the audience guessing as to the insanity of the main character. Here the tension is much less palpable, albeit the payoff is way less ridiculous, although still with a significant dosage of ludicrousness. Action sequences are nonetheless top-notch and watching Neeson (once again) combat in closed quarters never gets old. Looking past that the story never really seems mysterious, the identity of the culprits is never really feasible and its pretty easy to identify non-guilty parties, even if at one point in time the finger gets pointed at them. By the end the movie swerves into the realm of laughable resolution, not only with the appalling motivation of the baddies (so bad the actors had trouble with even phoning it in). On top of that we find layered mad-hatter plotting of the evil dudes and all sort of air flight procedures being thrown about in gibberish rants, but the characters seem all to happy to omit the real options at their disposal (such as armed fighters not allowing a plane to lower altitude despite the real threat of a bomb on board).As good as Liam Neeson is, the story does syphon your intellect, leaving me ultimately disinterested. Obviously not as far fetched in idiocy as ""The Flight Plan"" or the cult favorite ""Snakes on a Plane"", but just enough on the wrong side of logic to derail an otherwise well paced high-altitude thriller.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
social media on a plane,"This movie really wasn't that good. It's not much of an action movie and stars Liam Neeson, an actor turned action star once he reached 60.

On the plane, he starts receiving text messages from someone threatening to kill passengers if he doesn't get a lot of money transferred to a bank account. Marks uses cameras to come up with suspects whom may be using a phone. Sure enough, a few die, but at whose hands. Then a bomb comes into play.Can Marks find the hijackers, whom by the way, has become the main suspect with authorities on the ground, save everyone left on the plane and keep the bomb from destroying the plane?

That hijacked airplane look kidnapped by technology and not by amateur people and at the end we see that these bad guys were so weak physically and they planned everything so perfectly but they couldn't manage even a weapon in their hands. The end was a bullshit. How the director closed that scenario was so poor and bad idea. Not smart at all! Good luck in next movie!,4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The plot only moves forward because of miscommunication,"The problem with Non-Stop is that the plot only moves forward because of miscommunication and people acting stupidly. I know that happens a lot in movies, but it happens so much in this one, that it feels forced. However, despite the ridiculous ending, this movie does a great job of making you suspect everybody. So at least it has that going for it.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's Gonna Be a Bumpy Flight,"This film is not recommended.Oh, that dreaded third act! It destroys many great works of art, be they books, plays, or movies. While Non Stop is no great work of art in anyone's mind, the curse stays with this nifty little mystery thriller. The musty old premise of this whodunit can go back to the superior puzzler, Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians: People are being systematically murdered, in this case, aboard a plane, and it is up to our hero to find the culprit and end this crime wave.Liam Neesom again is typecast in this action role as an alcoholic lawman who is forced to solve this mystery. (At least, he brings some authority and gratis to his role as the air marshal aboard the plane.) But as the story evolves, so do the loopholes in the plot. The film sets up its red herrings as interesting suspects, but becomes more ludicrous and illogical until it finally disregards the mystery and resembles a pure action film with its far-fetched conclusion. The execution of the murders are strictly preposterous and it is never fully explained how the killer had the know-how and ability to act out this scheme.Talented actors are wasted in this standard story: Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery, Corey Stoll, Lupita Nyong'o, and Linus Roache. That is the real crime afoot. That three people contributed to this screenplay (John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach, and Ryan Engle) is an even greater mystery. Direction by Jaume Collet-Serra is merely adequate, although he does keep the action moving. The special effects are routine but acceptable. The film was moderately entertaining and kept me guessing until its disappointing revelations unraveled with its dumb ending.Non-Stop left me non-plussed.

Not even Liam could rescue this,"What a waste of a good cast. I thought I could watch anything Neeson was in, but this movie proved me wrong. After an hour and change it suddenly occurred to me I didn't care what happened next. I turned it off and never looked back.It starts out pathetically formulaic and trite and never manages to get out of its own way from there. Liam is a law enforcement agent having trouble at home and drinking before work and... my eyelids are getting heavy typing this. Seriously, how many times have we seen this hackneyed character. Only every cop movie from Die Hard to Lethal Weapon.No spoilers here, but there is a hijacking plot that is ridiculously complicated with so many possible points of failure that all Liam had to do was wait for thing to implode on its own. No need for heroics. Go have a smoke in the lavatory and by the time he's done so would be the bad guy's cockamamie plan.Despite how much I like several of the cast members, this never rose above two stars in the hour plus I endured. Since I didn't make it to the end (which is a score on its own) I'll give this a neutral score of five. That's generous. Five stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tense,"Well performed air thriller with a fine cast including the unlikely ""Lady Mary"" from Downton Abbey as a stewardess no less. The plot has plenty of surprises to keep us guessing what will happen next and who dunnit. True, it's somewhat contrived in that lots that happens is beyond reality but the storyline moves fast so we don't dwell on the far-fetched. Neeson's character is likable and sympathetic to the audience. As the reviews say, there's no sex (hard to do on a plane) and some foul language but there is an excess of demeaning language offensive to believers by Neeson and a few others. Of course that's the Hollywood touch which believers will need to endure.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tense and involving, but full of problems.","This action film is based on a threat against an airplane where an air marshall, in charge of protecting it, is traveling. It is very similar to many other terrorist and hijacker films, but it still does reasonably well.Liam Neeson is an excellent actor and has a knack for action or thriller films. It is his strength as an actor and he makes this film with ease. The character did not bring any kind of challenge to the actor, and he supports the entire film on his back very well. Julianne Moore also appears, but has had very little to do other than get on the plane and have some more tense dialogues with Neeson. The same can be said of Linus Roache, Michelle Dockery and especially Lupita Nyong'o, who is demoted to a cameo.Tense and involving, the film still manages to create an environment and build around it. Cinematography is very good and collaborates very well for this purpose, as do the rare but effective special and sound effects. The soundtrack is effective, but I confess that it was not in my ear. The end of the film was criticized at times, but I think it was not possible to do it any other way. However, it could have been rethought in several places where it sounds quite bad, such as dialogues and some situations: for example, how would it be possible for an airplane in such a situation to land at an airport that not even foam placed on the runway?Despite having several flaws and losing qualities as it unfolds, it is a film that still proved capable of entertaining and involving most of the time.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Feels too familiar.,"There are a few original ideas in this, but it just feels like many other films set on a plane. I also feel like Liam Neeson is beginning to be pigeon holed as the guy to avoid travelling with regardless of the vehicle. Bottom line, the film cost $50M to make and earned half that back in one weekend in the U.S. Who cares what I think? :)",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Watch Something Else !,"I watched this film during a down-time and couldn't really get into it. I found it boring and uninteresting, but the premise of this 2014 film follows a Federal Air Marshall named Bill Marks, marvellously played by Liam Neeson, who must locate a killer on his international flight after he receives texts that say someone on board will be killed every 20 minutes until financial demands are met. It seems a little far fetched, especially all the security you have to go through in an airport. Liam Neeson's character elevates, what I think is forgettable material, as this film doesn't hurt that Julianne Moore's in the cast, too, playing a gal named Jen Summers, so it really feels like putting those two amazing actors together are just slumming it. If you watch carefully, these characters give the movie their all, as everyone pales in comparison. It's so maddening, that the film does an extreme job at heightening the tension. I feel that this plane is hurtling NON-STOP at an enormous pace, but barely makes it to the gate with momentum intact. Did I like this film? Not really and apart from Moore and Neeson working together, it sucked, actually, so sucked that Neeson has been quoted recently that he has retired from making action movies, which means we won't get a promised 'Taken 4'. Sooo sad.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Crash lands near the end,"Some Hollywood exec somewhere, really wants Liam Neeson to be taken seriously as an action hero. We all loved him in ""Taken"" (and ""The Grey"" was actually pretty good) but after ""Taken 2"" and erm, that other one where people all forgot who he was or whatever, are we willing to except yet, that ""Taken"" was a one off? In all fairness. ""Non-stop"" did actually look pretty good. Which is why I went too see it. I was hoping for a modern whodunnit. With Neeson kicking some ass on the tight confines of a plane. But what we have here is just another addition to the many mediocre action movies, that have used this setting. ""Non-stop"" could of just as easily starred Steven Seagal, Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, or even Jodie Foster. Does anyone really remember the similar movies all off these guys were in? OK, maybe Harrison Fords ""Airforce one."" That was awesome! It goes without saying that anyone expecting another ""Taken"" from this will be no doubt disappointed. After all, how much action can you really have taking place on such a crammed setting as a full up plane? For what it is though, ""Non-stop"" starts off fairly effectively. Its far from straight forward, and is at times a complex, sometimes thrilling ride, full of twists and turns. This makes it even more unfortunate though, when it crash lands near the end. ""Non-stop"" really starts to fall apart if you think about it too much. If your going to make a complicated movie. It has to actually make some sort of sense if we're putting a bit of extra effort in, to try and follow it.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not nearly as good a movie as it should have been,"Some alcoholic guy named Bill who seems to be a wreck boards a plane. All sorts of suspicious people are on board and strange things happen. Turns out he's the air marshal. He's got a seat up in business class. Some lady insist she's got to sit at a window seat next to him. As soon as they take off, he gets text messages on the ""federal network"" demanding millions or else someone will die every 20 minutes. One of the suspicious passengers turns out to be another air marshal in coach. Bill confronts this other guy, a scuffle ensues and he kills him. Thus Bill made the warning come true all by himself. Bill is friends with the crew. He calls some federal agency but they inform him that the account number of the terrorist is under his name! That makes the government and the pilots think that Bill is the hijacker. Next the pilot dies mysteriously behind closed doors. Next another passenger starts foaming out of the mouth. Among the passengers is a NYPD, he starts getting frustrated and wants to take out Bill together with other guys. They end up fighting. Now a bomb appears on board and everyone settles down and tries to work together. Bill tries to start the bomb protocol but now fighter jets are escorting the plane and will shoot it down if it doesn't follow orders. Finally it's revealed who the villains are and we learn of their motivation for it all that comes out of nowhere but is actually pretty good.If it weren't for all the A-listers in this movie, it would barely pass as an one of those Asylum movies based on an A movie. Asylum would probably have done a better job than this crew. For a script with 3 writers it's incomprehensible that they left so many gaping plot holes all over. Off course there's no shortage of lack of realism either. Direction is weak as well, despite the claims by all the actors in the behind the scenes feature claiming that the director, whoever he is, is so brilliant. Neeson's performance isn't convincing either at times when he's supposed to be all energized and taking charge. The script clearly had potential. It should have made for a very exciting movie. But despite the large budget, and Silver being the producer, they couldn't make this movie work unfortunately. Neeson isn't the right guy for the job. It shouldn't have take a whole lot of effort to fix what was wrong with the script and film this movie in a more dynamic and exciting way.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
some things just really are not making any sense,"OK i am watching the movie now and wanted to stop it and start writing some things that just don't make any sense to me.like for example, 1 what is the point of the guy having and using his cell phone if he cant even message or contact his supervises on it to let them know what is going on, don't he know how to copy and paste, and also don't they would have access to his cell phone text history from the network. anyways, let me write more as i watch2, why the captain of the plain did not want to talk or see the 2nd air marshal when he got the gun and badge from the first oneOK the movie finish now, it was an interesting story, but so crazy to be real, anyways, it was a fun watch",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Mediocre at best, but could be far worse.","When I first saw the trailers for Non-stop I thought ""Oh god, that looks awful."" Unfortunately my wife decided to get it through netflix and I must say, its not awful. Its certainly not good, but its not awful.For most of its length the movie is a decent suspense thriller. Its not a great one, but once you shut your mind off to the plot details, you can get into the ""who's doing it?"" ""How are they going to get away with it?"" aspects.Unfortunately with about 20 minutes or so to go the movie completely gives up any pretense of being decent. I won't give you any spoilers, but it goes from mediocre to just plain dumb. I mean, seriously, it lost a star just for that, it would have been a slightly more mediocre 6.Liam Neeson does a good job of the role he's sort of slouched into, being angry punching people.Julianne Moore was completely wasted. I have no idea why she was in this movie except to put another ""star"" in it? Totally under utilized and her character is, well it just feels like it was written in to give room to another name.The best aspect of this movie is the director realized he didn't have 2 hours worth of material. He didn't even have the 1:46 of material, but still, in this day and age of every horrible film feeling like it needs to be 2 hours + having a mediocre movie clock in at 1:46 is a breath of fresh air. Another 15 minutes would have been painful. Honestly I think so many Hollywood films I've hated lately would benefit from just being 90-105 minutes long instead of 120-150 minutes long, but that strays from this already rambling review.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

2 Federal Guidelines that scriptwriters toss aside...,"Don't get me wrong, folks; I loved this movie, even though fellow movie buffs like myself will say its too much like Flight-Plan, w/Jody Foster. Here is what I would like all scriptwriters and screenwriters to take note of when composing a viable airplane in crisis movie: Never assume that you will always have GPS text messaging at 30,000 feet, because unless it is a military or govt. satellite phone, no one can text and receive messages till before or after landing. Maybe someday, but not currently. 2ndly: The cockpit door is always locked shut,simply because of 9/11. Some planes have a small lavatory opposite the jump seat utilized by a flight engineer or navigator, or off-duty pilot ""jumping"" from origin to destination w/o being a paying customer. I know for a fact, if anyone in that cockpit needs to come out to use the lavatory or take in sustenance, 3 flight attendants are required to shut down the kitchen/1st class lavatory bay and maintain a fire watch perimeter while that door is compromised...In this very exciting movie, you have to suspend your disbelief simply to enjoy the flow of the show, knowing that in real life, it would never happen this way. Oh, and for the record, your list of possible suspects that you think are the bad guys or bad girls w/in the first 30min.s??? Well, rethink it, because you will never guess till 2/3rds of the movie who it really is, which means, that no matter what people say about this being a repeat of Taken 3, or Flight Plan2...the twists and turns will make you think otherwise.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Non-Stop: A Turbulent Thriller That Flies High but Doesn't Quite Land,"""Non-Stop,"" a film that marries the claustrophobia of air travel with the paranoia of conspiracy thrillers, is a curious beast. It's a movie that, much like its setting, operates within a confined space, both physically and narratively, and yet, it manages to soar at times, albeit with some turbulence.Liam Neeson, who has reinvented himself as an unlikely action hero in the autumn of his career, plays Bill Marks, a federal air marshal with a troubled past. Neeson brings a certain gravitas to the role, a weary resilience that makes his character's mid-air heroics somewhat believable. His presence is the seatbelt that keeps the audience secured amidst the plot's wild maneuvers.The film's director, Jaume Collet-Serra, orchestrates the tension with a conductor's precision, ratcheting up the suspense as Marks receives cryptic messages threatening the passengers' safety. The pacing is relentless, the editing sharp, and for a good portion of the flight, we are gripping our armrests, fully invested in the mystery at 40,000 feet.However, ""Non-Stop"" encounters turbulence in its latter half. The plot, which initially seems as tightly constructed as the aircraft itself, begins to show cracks in its fuselage. The twists, while surprising, strain credulity, and the motivations of the antagonist, when revealed, feel less like a revelation and more like a contrivance.The supporting cast, including Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery, is underutilized, their characters mere window dressing to Neeson's central performance. They are passengers in more ways than one, along for the ride but given little to do.The film's visual effects are a mixed bag. At times, they effectively convey the peril of the situation, with exterior shots of the aircraft buffeted by storms both literal and figurative. Yet, there are moments when the digital artifice is all too apparent, pulling us out of the moment and reminding us that we are, indeed, firmly on the ground.""Non-Stop"" is at its best when it embraces its identity as a B-movie with A-list talent. It's a popcorn flick, a thrill ride that doesn't demand much from its audience other than to buckle up and enjoy the flight. But for those looking for a deeper narrative, the film may feel like a holding pattern, circling around potential themes of security, surveillance, and sacrifice without ever fully landing on them.""Non-Stop"" is a film that, like many flights, has its moments of excitement and dread, its periods of comfort and boredom. It's a journey that some will find exhilarating, a welcome diversion from the mundanity of the everyday, while others may disembark feeling that the trip was all a bit unnecessary, the destination not worth the fare.As the credits roll, we're left with the impression of a film that could have been more, a flight of fancy grounded by its own limitations. It's a reminder that in cinema, as in aviation, a smooth takeoff and landing are important, but it's the journey that truly counts. ""Non-Stop"" takes off with promise but doesn't quite stick the landing, leaving us with a journey that's half satisfying, half wanting, and entirely emblematic of its title - a non-stop ride that's thrilling and forgettable in equal measure.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I liked the story and at first I thought there's not much you can film in a plane, but they managed it very well.

"Non-Stop is about as generic as they come, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this well-crafted thriller","Non-Stop brings nothing new to the action-thriller genre. It is about as standard as they come, but Liam Neeson commands the film with intensity and urgency that keeps it from ever getting boring.Non-Stop has a simple premise, yet it keeps the audience guessing throughout. One look at the poster and you'll know what to expect. From the beginning, you're wondering who is sending air marshall Bill (Liam Neeson) these text messages threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes. This interesting premise gives the film the liberty to do what it wants with the plot. You won't guess what happens, because there are so many twists and turns. While at times very unbelievable, Non-Stop is still really enjoyable.This is due in part to Liam Neeson, the recent king of action movies. Dubbed ""Taken on a Plane,"" Non-Stop is better than his recent films, and he takes command of the role and keeps audiences invested. Supporting roles from Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery, Argo's Scoot McNairy, House of Cards's Corey Stoll, and 12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o only makes you miss them in their most well-known roles. None of them are really standouts, not even Lupita. But since Neeson is the star of the show, you won't mind.Like I said, Non-Stop is nothing new. A decent thriller with some twists and turns that keeps it from getting boring. Some laughable emotional background gives at least some dimension to Neeson's character, but by the end it just feels like a cop-out, typical of recent thrillers. But the action and suspense is first-rate. The final act in particular is especially thrilling, with plane parts flying everywhere and suspense building until the end. A smart thriller that keeps you guessing, Non-Stop shouldn't be passed over, but just don't expect anything special.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Back off an international flight for a while--this is good thriller stuff.,"Bill Marks (Liam Neeson): ""I hate flying. The lines. The crowds. The delays . . . . "" Jen Summers (Julianne Moore): ""I always kinda liked it. Six hours. One seat. Nobody can get to you.""So you ask me to recommend a film after the Oscars and before the better summer fare. Ordinarily I'd tell you to wait until then because this time of year traditionally offers mediocre or worse movies. Now I can recommend an enjoyable experience with all the thriller tropes in good form and a hero to be admired: Non-Stop with Liam Neeson. Contrary to the above quote from Jen, somebody ""gets"" everyone associated with this flight.Neeson's Bill Marks is an alcoholic air marshal who doesn't like to fly and gets caught in an electronic terror aboard a transatlantic flight to London. He's trying to find out who aboard is sending texts calling for a passenger death every 20 minutes until the airline puts $150 Million into a safe account. Marks is himself a suspect (the off-shore account is in his name!), and he has to kill to remain in the game.Wait, wait—it gets more fantastical, from a number of suspects the director, Jaume Collet-Serra, has planted in various frames, as any respectable thriller would, to the big red LED lights ticking off explosion time. But what makes it all believable is the unbelievably adept acting of Neeson, who looks heroic with his solid tall frame and crooked nose.Non-Stop does not stop giving the audience faces to put behind the terror, and Neeson turns out to be as resourceful as Denzel Washington's drunken pilot in ""Flight."" The director also deftly careen's through the cabin with Bill to relieve the imprisoning small space feel all planes give, even in movies.Working previously with Neeson, the director knows how to coax the credible out of him, keeping his uncharacteristic smiling for a final scene and not too much of it. Well, who can blame Marks, when troubled but helpful passenger Julianne Moore is the object of that good feeling?Like all air trips, Non-Stop has its dull moments yet enough action to help moviegoers through the movie dead zone to better flights in May.By the way, don't see this film if you fly regularly to London.",,Anonymous,Mystery
