A Breath of Fresh Air: Review from Sundance,"For those who might not know the name, director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright who won the Oscar last year for his short film ""Six Shooter"" about a chance encounter on a train, and that film's star Brendan Gleeson has returned as Ken, one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium along with his partner Ray (Colin Farrell) to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong. Ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear he's not happy about being in Bruges, but Ken convinces him that their boss Harry has a job for them there, as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing, none of which improves Ray's mood. Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress Clémence Poésy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture.There aren't too many non-Belgian films set in Belgium, and Bruges is a beautiful but odd place to set an entire movie. You'll probably learn more about the place than you ever need to know as Ken narrates their sightseeing excursions with a few factoids about the place. The entire first act is driven by the chemistry between Farrell and Gleason as they deliver rapid-fire patter that reminds one of McDonagh's background as a playwright, but it makes them as immediately endearing as Vincent and Jules in ""Pulp Fiction,"" allowing for an even bigger impact as things happen to them. Our first encounter with the boys' boss Harry is an expletive filled telegraph and an equally amusing phone conversation with Ken, making it obvious that this is a mobster cut from the same cloth as Ben Kingsley's Don Logan. Those who don't recognize the voice will be thrilled when they learn who plays Harry, because it's a pleasant surprise.This is easily Colin Farrell's best role and performance in a long time, one that allows him to show a lot of range, not just as the big-mouthed prat we assume Ray to be, but also as a thoughtful man distraught about what happened in London. Having seen the error of his ways, he feels the need to make right, even if he hides it with a lot of complaining and arguments, and that carries over to Gleason's Ken, continuing his great run with McDonagh.McDonagh has created a clever script that interweaves its small cast of characters into an intricate crime caper that mixes humor, violence and true heartfelt human emotions into a brilliant debut feature. Just when you think you know where things are going, McDonagh throws a sharp curve ball at you and then another, and another, and pretty soon, what started as a two-handed talkie has turned into a hold-your-breath action flick, when Harry turns up in Bruges to rectify some business that Ken has botched. Even so, it never loses what made the first half so charming and entertaining, because McDonagh's impressive dialogue remains at the forefront for the extended confrontation between Ken and Harry. The ending might be somewhat grim for some tastes going by the lightness of what's gone before, but the way everything is tied together makes it all worth it.Anyone worried that Tarantino and Ritchie's best work might be behind them, can revel in the promise of McDonagh's take on the crime-comedy genre, as this talented filmmaker shows that ""Six Shooter"" was no fluke and this movie begins what's likely to be a long and promising film career. On top of that, if ""In Bruges"" doesn't end up being the funniest and most quotable movies of the year, then it should be very close",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""They're Filming Midgets...""","...in Bruges. Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.The dark comedy built around the existential quandaries of hit men has been done to death over the years. If last summer's ""You Kill Me"" was the relentlessly dark and relentlessly sitcom-y take on the genre, then ""In Bruges"" is the hipster art film take on the theme. McDonagh deserves all the credit in the world for breathing life into the stale story by texturing the tonal shifts with crisp digital camera-work (that is surprisingly haunting), deep character development, and by creating a wonderful sense of place. Imagine a Graham Greene novel (""Brighton Rock"" specifically comes to mind) modernized by David Mamet. The dialog is super smart and wickedly un-PC while the comedy parts are as gut-busting as the crime thriller parts are suspenseful.McDonagh has also brought together an outstanding cast who thrive in the material. Farrell defies all odds and manages to be as sympathetic in the dramatic parts as he is charmingly sarcastic in the comedic parts. Brendan Gleeson gives a fantastically nuanced portrayal as Farrell's mentor and friend. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes channels the scary-as-hell energy he's used previously in ""Schindler's List"" and the recent ""Harry Potter"" films in a limber subversion that is a frighteningly fun to watch. The supporting cast is to die for, with Jordan Prentice spot-on as a coked-up dwarf actor shooting an abhorrent art film on the streets of Bruges, and Clemence Poesy coyly seductive and unforgettable as Farrell's unlikely local love interest.Ultimately ""In Bruges"" meanders down too many cobblestone paths, and one scene near the end involving a bell tower stretches credibility but adds necessary dramatic effect. Certain plot elements will turn off a large segment of the viewing audience. However, those with the right mindset will be greatly rewarded. ""In Bruges"" is hilarious, contemplative, sometimes scathing, often nihilistic, but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in McDonagh's insightful light. The arrival of a commanding talent has been heralded...in Bruges.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Quite Surprised.,"Going into this movie, I didn't have the highest expectations for it. However, I went to see it anyways, and let me just say that by the end credits I was completely shocked out how much I actually liked this movie. It was not only very funny but you were able to connect with the characters in a way you didn't think you would. The plot was def. very interesting and kept my attention the whole way through. Only real problem I had with the movie was that it was a little bit too long, but it didn't take away from anything. I should also say that I'm not a huge Colin Farrell fan, but after this movie I believe that he has proved that he can hold his own with the other leading men out there. I thought there were some beautiful moments that they captured on film where you see him dealing with his characters inner demons. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something ""different"", if you're sick of seeing the same ""hollywood-esque"" movies, then please give this movie a shot. If anything, enjoy it for the witty dialogue.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A classic,"I don't believe there are perfect movies, but the ones that feel damn near perfect on first watch, and you only appreciate more and more after each re-watching over the years - these are the ones that deserve 10/10 rating. Safe to say after 14 years that ""In Bruges"" has been one of these films for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The perfect movie,"I've seen thousands of movies in my life and In Bruges is one of the ones I always come back to. The thing about it is it's almost the perfect movie.Is it an action movie? Yes
Is it a comedy? Yes
Is it a drama? Yes
But the brilliance lies in the fact that all of those categories blend together to where you don't realize what is what.It's a movie with brutal violence, brilliant humor and amazing performance by all involved
It is also a film about guilt, faith, redemption and the cost of the decisions we all make in life.Most people don't catch all that's going on. But it by far one of my Top 10, if not Top 5 movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
freaking hilarious,"This is an old movie so probably no one is gonna read this review, but writing Imdb reviews has been a hobby of mine for a while now. If you are not put off by gore, dark subject matters (suicide among others) and fat jokes, and if you like dark comedy, then congratulations, you have hit the jackpot! This movie is perfect for you. Even if you are put off by the aforementioned things, then you have also hit the jackpot cuz this movie freaking rocks. It really does. Has the tightest script I've ever seen, and so fugging funny that you might want to pause the movie for a moment just to laugh.

"Dark comedy, great dialogue, fantastic setting, but not what you'd expect","Went to see it for the setting. Loved it for the dialogue. Wished it had just gone a bit further.In Bruges is a dark comedy set in the beautiful medieval town of Bruges, Belgium, featuring an Irish duo of hit men who have been ordered by their boss to hide out there after a high-profile job in London went sour. Their instructions are to keep a low profile, sightsee, and generally avoid trouble until further notice.But all is not as it seems.The dialogue between Gleeson and Farrell is witty, delivered with perfect comic timing, zany, and a joy to watch. Farrell and the charming Clémence Poésy also have great chemistry and are fun to watch on screen. The humour is designed to make viewers uncomfortable, and succeeds remarkably on this count. If you're looking for political correctness, you won't find it here. What you will find are jabs at Americans, tourists, gays, blacks, whites, fat people, and oh yeah, midgets. As this odd assortment of characters mixes and mingles in the streets of Bruges, the tension builds.And there's just enough of a psychological dark edge to keep things interesting. This is a comedy, yes, but it's by no means light and fluffy. This movie has been compared to The Big Hit or The Whole Nine Yards, but in fact, it's much, much darker. And in my opinion, that makes it better.Shot entirely on location in Bruges, the backdrop is of course stunning. I originally went to see this knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title, simply because, having visited Bruges, I couldn't resist an opportunity to see it on the big screen. Filmed in the wintertime and largely at night, Bruges itself is one of the stars of the movie. Like the other characters, it is not portrayed as light, airy, innocent or picturesque, the way it is in real life. Instead, its more haunting quality is captured elegantly on film, with a heavy mist giving the town a sort of eerie, dream-like quality.So much of this movie was just right, and I highly recommend it to people who like twisted humour and aren't easily offended.I have two issues with this film, however. The first is the score. The music is completely wrong for this movie, giving it a feel that doesn't work at all with the dark comedy tone. The melancholy, slow, stirring music would've worked nicely with a drama or a psychological period piece, but just seems out of place here.The second issue is with the ending. Nope, I won't give it away. Suffice to say, I thought it was wrong, wrong, wrong. All wrong. Almost as though the author couldn't figure out what to do next or how to end this thing.But overall, I really enjoyed In Bruges. It was wickedly funny, daringly different, and fantastically non-PC. And the shots of Bruges are wonderful. Despite what the main characters say about the place, Bruges is really quite wonderful. I suggest seeing both the movie and the city.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Atonement and Existentialism In Bruges,"A European film through and through, showing its deep theatrical roots, ""In Bruges"" works on may levels, and is a fine night at the cinema.The film follows the denouement of a ""job"" gone bad for two Irish hit men, who are forced to hole up in Bruges, Belgium, and really can't stand the inactivity. The forced waiting, a symbolic purgatory in both assassins' struggle for absolution, gives Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell a chance to act through some marvelous comic dialogue.The film itself looks like it was filmed in an area of the old city of Bruges that is no more than a 500 square metre radius. It doesn't matter, because the film is a character study more than anything, and like all good theatre, the character interplay allows the audience to forget the confined spaces.Ralph Fiennes comes into the film late basically stealing Ben Kingsley's character from ""Sexy Beast"". This has to be an absolutely deliberate choice, so can't really be criticized. The writing is so good that Fiennes can have real fun with it. All the actors do, as a matter of fact.I have been deeply suspicious of Colin Farrell's ability to read a script in the past. His choices of projects in the past has been spotty. Not this time: his acting ability is brought to the fore by director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh. Farrell gives a very strong performance as a morally challenged hit-man.Brendan Gleeson has been around forever, and is a renowned character actor. You may remember him from ""Braveheart"" as Hamish Campbell, Mel Gibson's loyal adjutant. He is able to completely bury himself in this part. Colin Farrell has the capacity to reach these heights as well, and in fact, in this film, shows many of the mannerisms and intensity of Russell Crowe (whom I consider to be the best actor on the planet).I appreciated the comedy and satire working hand in hand with the moral complexity of the characters' inner struggles. It makes for a very satisfying film, one that is much more than entertainment. When you consider what the budget was in comparison to many Hollywood films, ""In Bruges"" serves as a reminder that it is the script and the quality of the direction that makes a film. Why Hollywood thinks they can just throw money into a project and expect people to come to the cinema is beyond me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
British Dark Humor at Best,"The Irish hit-men Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are sent by the Londoner mobster Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) to Bruges, a medieval Belgium city, in Christmas after an awry job in London. Ray, in his first assignment, was sent to murder a priest (Ciarán Hinds) in a church, and he accidentally shot also a boy on the head. While Ken enjoys the historic city, Ray, who is in inner conflict due to the death of the boy, feels completely bored and misses his home town. Ray meets the smalltime drug-dealer and crook Chloë (Clémence Poésy), who sells drug to the cast and crew of a movie that is being filmed in Bruges, and has an incident with a Canadian tourist and later with Chloë's boyfriend. Meanwhile Harry, who has an stringent code of principles, orders Ken to kill his protégée and friend Ray.""In Bruges"" is a dramatic and violent comedy with the famous British dark humor at best. The flawed characters are charismatic and weird: two hit-men, one of them living an existential crisis; a mobster kingpin with a code of principles; a drug-dealer; an American dwarf star of an Euro-trash movie; a clumsy crook; a stressed Canadian tourist are the lead components of this sarcastic story, associated to witty dialogs, with many jokes and irony, and unusual situations. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Na Mira do Chefe"" (""In the Aim of the Boss"")Note: On August 2013, I visited the lovely Bruges and I agree with Ken: it is a beautiful town. On 08 September 2013, I saw this movie again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What a Great Movie,"I've used IMDb for years but have never felt the urge to post a review until now. I had the pleasure of attending an advanced screening of this movie in NYC last night to which Colin Farrell attended. I bought the screening tickets just wanting to bring my fiancé to see some celebrities in person while not knowing much about the movie. I figured it would be a ""hard-to-understand"" foreign, indie film whose humor would be lost on a ""dumb American."" However, the truth was absolutely the opposite. My hard-to-please fiancé agreed.The movie is a bit slow for the first half but it's entirely necessary to set the mood and the contrast between that and the second half. That's all I'll say so as not to spoil anything. It is really a great movie. There's comedy, beautiful cinematography, and awesome action scenes, albeit scattered throughout and absent at times when the viewer may be growing weary. I'd highly recommend seeing this movie. It's definitely worth the price of a movie ticket while most of the crap out there these days isn't worth the cost of the paper they print the tickets on.Let us all know what you think after you see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"If you can't laugh at a man being blinded in one eye by a blank, then this isn't for you","2008 had two high-profile crime time comedies that blended action with suspense and a hintage of good ol' European humor. On one hand, we have the slick Rockn'Rolla that brought Guy Ritchie back into the spotlight, and now we have a new-school director delivering one of the most unique hit-man films in a very long time. In Bruges is one of those rare examples in which the comedy is so bleak, so dark, it can barely pass off as humor depending on the viewer. Marketed as a quirky action comedy; this film doesn't match the genre in the least bit. Instead we have a deep character study that focuses on the moral implications of the main characters, as they tour around a beautiful yet overlooked city. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. The film itself is interesting and fleshes out a clever story; but never quite gets off the ground, never quite propels itself to become a highly entertaining film. Then of course, we have the indie ending.In Bruges follows two hit men that must lay low after a mission went horrifically wrong. While Ray (Colin Ferell) soaks in the bitterness and guilt over his murder, Ray's partner Ken soaks in all the beautiful scenery and curiosity of the area. They both become well-acquainted with the place, meeting all sorts of characters. However, things become complicated when their boss (Ralph Fieness) has a new job for one of them. This is the debut feature-film script and directorial effort by Martin McDonagh as he crafts a good tale that has the same style of dark humor and tense action as his acclaimed short film from years ago. Originality is all over the place in this film, as dark humor is a tough genre to sell and deliver; it's rarely ever done successfully.The film is a delightful character study about people's actions, reactions, and the codes they must follow. Irony and subtle humor is also heavily present, as the mere premise of two murderous hit men touring around a secluded town like tourists is sure to tickle the funnybone. The script also calls for sympathy towards our anti-heroes, which is definitely a hard task that McDonagh tackled with ease. Helping the writing is superb acting by Ferell and Brendan Gleeson. If they don't interest you, Bruges certainly will. Bruges is basically a character in the film, as it adjusts and alters the mindsets and morality codes of our assassins. Beautiful scenery and nice cinematography makes In Bruges a travel documentary with a fictional story attached.However, the dark humor in the movie is a bit too dark. The movie can barely classify as a comedy because there's so much tension, so much violence, and so many heavy themes. A few chuckles will occur, but it's offset by the bitter humor that leaves you cringing at times. In Bruges in other reviews has been described as ""Irish humor."" If that's the case, Irish humor is definitely not my cup of tea, as its comedy is disguised in heavy drama.Bottom Line: A nicely written and acted film, marred by so-called ""comedy."" The humor comes off as bitterly dark and sometimes even dwells into the outright bizarre. If you can handle the dark chocolate-like taste (the 85% cacao bean kind), then you are in for a treat. The story is unique, so are the characters and situations they are involved in. This just might be American mainstream's first taste of Irish flavored film-making in years, and you can whether enjoy the flavor or move on. While the movie itself isn't amazing, this new-school director deserves a bit of attention for a strong first effort.

Nice Blend Of Drama And Comedy,"One of the problems with seeing a trailer for a film is it creates an expectation. If it raises expectations, and the film delivers, great. However, if the film is less then expected, then the viewer feels cheated. The best case scenario is the one I found myself in before I saw In Bruges. Low expectations.After seeing the trailer, In Bruges looked like a plodding British comedy with little originality and repetitious humor, hence the low expectations. Yet, In Bruges exceeded my minimal expectations, and, unlike my impression from the trailer, was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in. It was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end.Set in, no surprise here, Bruges, Belgium, the plot focuses on two London hit men, Ray played by Colin Farrell, and Ken, played by Brendan Gleeson. The pair is sent to Belgium after Ray botches his first hi. And therein lies the humor, Ray has no interest in being in the medieval city, and Ken wants to sight see.I've never really liked Colin Farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing? There is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle, and karate, that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film. Brendan Gleeson's character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, if there is such a thing. Fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of menace when he travels to Bruges to square off with Ken. Also, of note, is Jordan Prentice, an irritable dwarf who's in town to act in a movie filming there. His ramblings in one scene, about a coming race war, is worth the price of admission right there.The only aspect of the film that didn't work for me was Ray's love interest. Early in the film he manages to woo Chloe, a drug dealer with, drum roll please, a heart of gold. For my tastes, the budding romance seems a little forced and comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama. But it's a small thing and I doubt anyone but me would notice.I intentionally left a lot of plot points out, because, as I've mentioned, this film surprised me in a good way and I don't won't to ruin it for anyone else.In Bruges is a good film. Go see it.At the very least, it'll make you want to visit Bruges.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Plenty of Alcoves in Bruges,"Greetings again from the darkness. Award winning playwright Martin McDonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director. The city of Bruges (yes, in Belgium) is the perfect setting for the multi-layered story. Its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itself.Colin Farrell delivers by far his best performance to date. He is funny, dangerous, sexy and emotional throughout. This is exceptional acting from a guy who tends to disappoint. Of course, it helps to have magnificent writing and this one most certainly delivers on that front. The dialogue is quirky and quick ... so tune in early.Strong work also from Brendon Gleeson, who all will recognize from ""Gangs of New York"" and the Harry Potter series. He is a tough guy with a streak of humanity. The third piece of the puzzle is Ralph Fiennes as the mastermind bad guy. The supporting work is fine from Jordan Prentice as the dwarf actor (sadly Mr. Prentice is most famous for playing Howard the Duck) and a very cute Clemence Poesy as Farrell's odd love interest.Very few writers can write dialogue like this and even fewer can juggle as many layers without making a film seem busy, crowded or forced. Hopefully Mr. McDonagh will bring more of his work to the big screen ... he certainly adds a touch of class!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Of Mice and Hit Men.,"A lot of reviews see fit to give a thorough plot summary, so I'll just talk b*llocks instead.In Bruges is a grown up gangster film not because it uses the word f*ck very often, though it does, because even a child can type 'f*ck' repetitively into a screen play and judging by most recent gangster films, with a few notable exceptions, that wouldn't be too far from the truth.In Bruges is a grown up genre film not because it hangs out in galleries and cathedrals like a tapestry woven by Brueghel's mistress from blood, sin, and judgement. Though it does.In Bruges is a black comedy for grown ups not because it consciously satisfies our skulking childishness, our 'incorrect' urge to lash out at convention , say f*ck the lot 'o ya's, fist someone in the mouth for good measure and then offer a fast talking and wickedly funny apology. And it does all that too.In Bruges is grown up cinema because despite being sexy, fun and stylish, it is emotionally literate. Is that allowed?The complexity of Martin McDonagh's screen play is manifold, developing and delineating character through dialogue as much as action. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrel inhabit their characters with equal and at times forceful skill, displaying flawless comic timing and sensitivity. Together they breathe 'real life' into the hyperbolic corpse of a bloated genre that never quite realised it died some time ago. McDonagh's characters realise too late they've been c*nts, one way or another, and far too late, begin to grow. Characters with history, in emotional distress, barely conscious or all too aware. They do what we might in their shoes. And as they trace the outline of their own destruction in lines of cocaine or spilled beer, their conceit, self loathing, compassion or stubbornness lays them all bare. There is a cost for all of them, characters on a human scale, acting out their tragedy in recognisable terms. In Bruges is as morally instructive as it is dramatically satisfying, almost becoming a medieval mystery play in the setting of the title.Finally In Bruges is a dangerously perfect fusion of plot, meaning and story. Ripples of understanding run back and forth across the surface of the experience, hinting at the themes which swim powerfully beneath. A film this genuinely startling doesn't happen very often.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Shooting and sight-seeing in Bruges,"What drove me to seeing 'In Bruges' in the first place was primarily great actors like Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes, and also for the concept and Bruges itself.'In Bruges' is definitely not for all tastes, one can say that for a lot of films but 'In Bruges' is one of the more extreme examples. It is very foul mouthed with an extreme profanity laden script, is very uncompromisingly violent and its political incorrectness will put the easily offended and the faint hearted off. Three reasons not to see it if all this bothers you. It didn't bother me much though (having seen plenty of films with those approaches that still manage to be great). Neither did on the most part the ridiculousness that 'In Bruges' has been criticised for.What is meant by ""on the most part""? 'In Bruges' weakest element, from a storytelling standpoint and for the film in general, is the ending. This to me was the only part of the film that went over the top on the ridiculousness to overblown proportions, and it just felt contrived and running out of ideas in feel.Carter Burwell's music score is a well written and quite lovely one on its own. Within the film and its mood though, it didn't fit however and juxtaposes too much in terms of tone.However, the performances are very good, excellent in the case of Gleeson (as always) and Fiennes having tons of fun as his sinister character. Wasn't expecting acting this good from Farrell, this is the best he's ever been and he is successful in providing an interesting character that was intended to be morally complex and not likeable. It's the relationship between Farrell and Gleeson that drives the story and drama, it was essential to the film's success and manages to be entertaining, affecting and thought-provoking,Photography is both gritty and beautiful, with a clear sense of style and atmosphere. Bruges not just looks wonderful, it also is treated like a character of its own quite rightly.Similarly successful is the script, which is surprisingly intelligent with a strong balance with thought-provoking philosophical musings, very funny black comedy and character moral complexity (not making the characters likeable but it was clear early on that the intent was for them never to be so) . The story absorbs and entertains, with the brutal holds no prisoners violence not feeling gratuitous, the central relationship being beautifully written and the despair and redemptions themes being surprisingly poignant.Overall, very good if understandably polarising. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fun but Lacking,"As much as I like British movies, the cast, and black comedies, In Bruges left me unsatisfied. It wasn't enough that Colin Farrell gave one of his best performances since Tiger Land, and that Brendan Gleeson was casted superbly for the supporting role. The plot progresses enjoyably in the pleasing scenery of Bruges and the relationship between the two contract killersRay and Ken, played by Farrell and Gleeson respectivelyis amusing. But that's just it. The plot is enjoyable, not stirring or inspiring; and the dialogue is amusing, not funny or witty. All in all, it's an enjoyable flick that's fun to watch, but that's it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
You got to stick with your principlesIn Bruges,"I think that I will shortly be purchasing the Oscar winning short film Six Shooter from 2004. I've got an iTunes gift card for just the job. The thought occurred to me after seeing the wonderful debut from director Martin McDonagh, In Bruges. After seeing the trailer, which really worked for me, many times and wondering at how it is from an Oscar winning director yet never hearing of the name, I did some research. While he already has more little gold men than Alfred Hitchcock, his actual feature premiere is what has opened this weekend. It is Irish, most definitely, and if you have trouble with the accent, maybe you should steer clear until in comes out on DVD, however, if you can cope, this is a smart pitch black comedy. When I say pitch black, I mean black hole expanse of darkness. The trailer leads you to believe it will be an uproarious time, and while it is very funny and very smart, there is a tragic event that is held over the proceedings, lending a somber shadow over all that occurs. In the end though, it is consistent with its wit and drama, telling an intriguing story and never relying on the laughs to hide any plot point that the creators may not have wanted to work out to completion.If I am to gripe about anything, it will be the ending. Not the very end, however, as that is absolutely perfect. The camera-work, voice-over, and final shot cannot be argued, it is the climax that happens just before that rings false. It is the only moment like that, though, so I don't hold it against the film. McDonagh needed a way to get his characters to their arc's conclusions and if that means turning one of the roles, at first seeming to be there for jokes, into a pawn for a symmetrical kind of convenience, I'll give him that reprieve. As far as fitting with the story, yeah it works; it has to because the incident is alluded to unknowingly at many times during the course of the sightseeing romp. I guess I think it fits too well and wish McDonagh could have come up with another way to do it.Besides that, though, In Bruges is a great time at the theatre. Colin Farrell is steadily becoming a favorite of mine with his precise comic timing and broad facial expressions. I may be one of the few people on earth that loved his comedic turn in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, (yes I truly believe the comedy was intentional), and here he shows it was not a fluke. Kind of similar to his scene-stealing role in Intermission, he is a punk with a lousy disposition and disregard for tact. Here, however, he also has a conscience. This tug-of-war is ripe for laughs as he is a sweet guy, he just doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut. One-liners are in abundance and you will be laughing continuously. Brendan Gleeson helps this fact by being an effective straightman to play off of. He knows the score and tries to enjoy the ""fairytale"" city while his cohort sulks and puts on ""moods like a five year old"" because, honestly, unless you grew up on a farm and were slightly retarded, Bruges is really just hell on earth. (Actually, the city looks pretty great and I wouldn't mind checking it out once in my lifetime.) The periphery roles, and there are many, also add depth and interest to the film. Small characters like Eric Godon's alcove loving gun dealer, Jordan Prentice as a horse-tranquilizer taking midget actor (he played Howard the Duck, that is awesome), and Clémence Poésy as the love interest and enigma Cholë all are fun and never quite feel just thrown in as jokes, but instead integral parts to the story. Of course, the great Ralph Fiennes is involved too. His accent and vocabulary rivals Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast and unfortunately is a much smaller part than anticipated from the trailer. Well maybe not unfortunately, because if he was in more it might have become a gimmick. I also couldn't help stop thinking of Harry Potter with Mad-Eye Moody, Lord Voldemort, and Fleur Delacour all involved.I highly recommend this film for anyone looking to see a good drama with comic overtones.

Highly overrated,"Given the track record of Martin McDonagh as an incredibly gifted playwright, I expected In Bruges to be smarter and funnier, particularly smarter. McDonagh does have a way with words, but it seems to have eluded him in this film, which works better as a concept. Maybe it would work better as a play, but as a film it feels half-baked. I see that he is referencing Waiting for Godot and he's playing with his usual mashup of violence and humor, and he is paying homage to old, masterful movies like Touch of Evil and Vertigo, but the whole thing feels really forced and rather soulless. I am willing to suspend my disbelief and swallow that the wonderful Brendan Gleeson and the incredibly uneven Colin Farrell are hit men on holiday, but why? They really seem to be the nicest chaps, with no edge of meanness. Lovable thugs who work for a fastidious thug, played rather maniacally, by Ralph Fiennes, whose performance over the phone is actually funnier than when he actually shows up. It is nice to see him in a comic role and sporting a perfect thuggish accent, but he is not believable either. And the actors are saddled with stupid lines, which is really surprising coming from Mr. McDonagh. Gleeson is divine as a hit-man perfectly content to spend some downtime sightseeing. He revels in the calm. I love Brendan Gleeson and if there is a reason to see this movie, he is it. Farrell is all over the place, and trying really hard to be funny, which may not be entirely his fault. He is best when he feels guilty and dissolves into tears, but otherwise he mugs for the camera like there is no tomorrow. Jeremie Renier, who has starred in the distinguished films of the Dardenne brothers, L'Infant and La Promesse, has a bit part here. This always bothers me, that when the big foreign production comes to town, the best actors in that country end up playing stupid bit parts. Such is the pecking order. There is a subplot involving a racist dwarf, and fat Americans, so you know the movie is aiming low. Some American critics have vociferously objected to the violence, which is really beyond me, considering Hollywood is still churning out violent porn like Rambo. The violence is over the top in concept, as Farrell kills human beings that are taboo to kill. And this may be the point of the movie, that the principles of criminals are bogus, and killing anybody is wrong, period. But it's a point we expected Martin McDonagh to make with his accustomed panache, not all dumbed down.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fantastic mix of humour and brutality!,"Well, to be honest I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, nor am I fan of Colin Farrell, in fact I really didn't like him at all previously....but now I have a new found respect for him and with Gleason and Fienes both in excellent form coupled with a very quick and witty script and some surprisingly violent scenes, this film really has something for everyone (except the young kids).I go to see 2 or 3 movies every week and this is just about the best one I've seen since Last King of Scotland and The Departed came out a couple of years back.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Nihilistic Movie in Bad Taste,"The DVD version of this movie was advertised as a comedy. Maybe the movie should have been advertised as the ""Existential exploration of the lives of English murderers in the early 21st century"". Or as an ""Inquiry into the meaninglessness of life exemplified by three men who commit brutal acts"". A comedy it is not.The movie showed the miserable and pointless lives of three hit men, interspersed with ugly scenes of murder. There were some lame jokes on Bruges and Belgium, which did not get better by overuse. The film was slow, presenting an elegiac, not a comedic tempo. Maybe some people find the display of the internal conflicts of hit men funny. I found it -- at least in this movie -- repulsive and nauseating. At the end of the movie I had a bad taste in my mouth that I wouldn't wish on anybody.The acting and the photography were good. Forget the rest.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of my rare 10s,"The films that I find myself thinking about afterwards are of two kinds - the best and the worst. In the case of the worst I am trying to work out just why they are so bad, in the case of the best, like In Bruges, the rare 10s, they make such an impact that I cannot get them out of my head. It was only later that I realised that Martin McDonagh has, apparently, lifted his basic situation - two hit men whiling away the time waiting for instructions as to their next victim - from Harold Pinter's early one-act stage play The Dumb Waiter. However The Dumb Waiter ends when the message (the same one as in In Bruges) arrives. McDonagh then extends the scenario in quite unexpected directions, the foundations of which have been meticulously laid, sometimes by a mere throwaway line or gesture, earlier in the film. The film is full of memorable moments - dialogue, incident or characterisation - that interweave to form an indelible impression.Some of the comments posted seem to take exception to the fact that In Bruges is difficult to categorise - that terrible compulsion of the film industry to fit every film into a ""genre"". This is a film that is genuinely uncategorisable. It is often very funny, sometimes poignant and touching, sometimes darkly frightening, always thought-provoking. To categorise it as, say, a ""comedy-thriller"" would be to seriously sell its qualities short.There is one very good reason for the film's special elusive quality - it is very Irish. Although strictly speaking it would not count as an Irish production and Martin McDonagh was born in London, all his stage writing stems from a strong Irish sensibility and it is no accident that the two leading characters are played by Irish actors (albeit actors familiar to an American audience playing Americans!). The ability to see pathos behind humour, as well as the funny side of tragedy, is a peculiarly Irish trait.The brilliance of the script is matched by superb performances from the two leads as well as all the supporting cast, however small the part. The only weak link (and it is a very minor criticism) is Ralph Fiennes as the boss figure who, as one other posting commented, was more convincing on the phone than in person, perhaps, as many have pointed out, because of unfavourable comparison with Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast. Brendan Gleeson is, as always, impeccable, Colin Farrell gives his best performance since Intermission, both are subtle and totally believable. The supporting characters are so effective partly because they are very well cast, partly because they have been written with such attention to detail. Almost my favourite moment is when the hotel owner hands over a phone message from the boss, carefully typed out including all the obscenities, with a personal hand-written correction at the bottom - ""I am not the receptionist..."".I am hoping that by writing the above I will be able to stop myself thinking about In Bruges, but somehow I doubt it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
funny black comedy,"London hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hid out by their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes).

They encounter a film crew with a racist midget and Ray falls for Chloe Villette (Clémence Poésy). Ken is conflicted after Harry contacts him with the new orders.It's funny and dark. Martin McDonagh has filled his film with a black comedic tone. Farrell fills it with his fidgety energy and troubled humanity. He's also hilarious delivering McDonagh's sharp insane dialog.

Great Performances and Dialogue Make IN BRUGES a Modern Classic,"I first saw the dark comedy-thriller IN BRUGES (IB) in our local multiplex back in April 2008, and I loved it immediately. No wonder writer/director Martin McDonagh's screenplay went on to be nominated for an Oscar, and co-star Colin Farrell won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical! When McDonagh's short film SIX SHOOTER, starring Brendan Gleeson, won the 2005 Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, I was already familiar with his plays (including the 2005 Broadway hit THE PILLOWMAN with our family's household fave Jeff Goldblum), so I looked forward to seeing Gleeson work with McDonagh again in IB. I wasn't disappointed. McDonagh's quirky, funny, soul-searching dialogue is a joy to hear. It's chock full of profanity, but the delivery renders it more comical than offensive. The filmmakers even spoof the ""adult language"" in one of the DVD's bonus features, a montage of every time the word ""F***"" is used in IB.Gleeson and Farrell make a great seriocomic team as Ken and Ray, two Irish hit men who have suspenseful and surreal adventures hiding out in Belgium in the magnificent city of Bruges after their latest job goes horribly, heartbreakingly wrong. They're the ultimate odd-couple tourists as they await further instructions from their boss, with Ken enjoying the sightseeing and the swans as Ray spews forth befuddled, unfavorable, hilariously un-PC opinions of just about everything and everyone he encounters, except a pretty Flemish production assistant (Clemence Poesy of 127 HOURS), who's as full of surprises as our undercover assassins. Farrell gives one of his very best performances, blending laugh-out-loud comedy and guilt-ridden heartache beautifully. My favorite running gag was Ray's childlike fascination with dwarfs, and his oafish but well-meant concern for cokehead dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), who's in the fairytale-like city to appear in a dream sequence in a local indie art-house flick. As Harry, the boys' crime boss, Ralph Fiennes does a terrific job channeling Sir Ben Kingsley as the terrifying Don in SEXY BEAST (I assure you, that's a compliment!). IB mixes suspense, melancholia, and hilarity very well indeed. Along with THE BANK JOB, IB was my favorite crime film of 2008. The DVD's featurettes and deleted scenes are fun, too, including interviews, a captioned boat tour of Bruges, and a deleted scene involving Matt Smith in his pre-DOCTOR WHO days -- and a machete! The many deleted scenes are all quite entertaining; I'm sure they were only cut so IB wouldn't be a 3-hour epic! :-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the most brilliant and originally made films of the decade!,"I decided to see it because of all the good buzz it got from here. A surprisingly original and brilliant film! In Bruges has a very strong screenplay, full of great dialogue, unpredictable turns, and very original characters! The performances from the whole cast is great, but Colin Farrell is the central performance here! I never knew Farrell had the acting ability he demonstrated here. His performance, at times he is funny, at times, his performance centralizes over all the drama, all the twists. His accent, his expressions, a perfect performance, and he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination, I happen to think it is one of the best male performances of the decade. The film plays out soft and quiet, it certainly is a life-learning experience in a way. The film takes us on this man's journey, his journey with his partner, and his journey into the world of hit men, and the film makes something new. It makes this world a sort of livelier place to be, a sort of warm place, but only at the right times. The film is beautifully shot, and it makes it's points about the city Bruges. The cinematography is just gorgeous, as well as the haunting music score, that is manages to make every scene filled with more passion and emotion.In Bruges is very memorable, because it does things differently, it is not just a crime film, it is not just a comedy, it stands in the middle. It really absorbs you, because of the developed characters, because of their situations, because of what they go through, because of the lessons they each learn, and the lessons we learn with them. In Bruges is very human at it's core, and that is what it makes it stand out. One of the best films of the year, and one of the best examples of dark humor mix.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Good Drama,,,But NOT a Comedy","A good drama about the human relationships dealing with love, death, and the purpose of life. The ideas are taken from Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"". Great scenery throughout the movie. This movie is not, though, a comedy. It is treated as a comedy and was even nominated as a comedy, but its not a comedy or a dark comedy. Not through the wording nor through the actions. The acting is good, Colin Farrell's performance is good, but having few facial expressions mimicking Johhny Depp or Heath Ledger are not enough to grant a Golden Globe, so the acting is overrated also. In overall, an overrated film on all aspects, i have no clue why it is 8.1, but it is a good flick that you can enjoy if you know what you are going into. It is not a dark comedy, it is a pure drama, with slight dark humor relief undertones, the word comedy was probably entered for marketing campaign. If you want good drama, go for it, a light comedy (or any comedy) skip this one, because it is not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Too great to miss,"First off, I'd like to mention that this IS a Black Comedy, it's meant to be funny in a morbid way. Also, this is not a movie that should be seen for those with a faint heart as is suggested by the 18A rating (in Canada at least, no idea for other countries).Moving on, I have to say that this was a great movie, much better than I anticipated and I was already ready for something fantastic. The scenery and music are really amazing, especially as a balance to the extremely foul and crude language that are rampant. Though that might put some people off it adds to the hilarity of the situation, the contrast between this beautiful and melancholic music and scenery and the dialog that goes on between the two main characters.There is, of course, a great deal of violence, but that is to be expected of a movie about hit men. THe fact that everything took place in Bruges makes it all the more funny, especially with all the jokes that are made about both the town and Belgium in general.There is much more that I can say but I think that the film should speak for itself, go watch it. Please do keep in mind though that this is not a slap-stick comedy, nor a sit-com as generally perceived. A lot of it is laughing at the absurdity of what is happening and the dialog which is witty and great. Once again, go watch the movie, you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
In a fairytale city with a couple of foul mouthed hit men.,"Ray (Colin Farrell) & Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are two Irish hit men who are sent to lay low in the beautiful city of Bruges by their gangster boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). As they wait for instruction from Harry the pair start to address many things that are troubling them, with one pressing matter particularly relevant to their lives post the Bruges visit.Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, a man more known for his play writing abilities, In Bruges is a rare old animal indeed. Not only is it a winner in the very wobbly sub-genre that encompasses the British gangster movie, it's also a hugely funny and tasteless button pusher to boot. From the outset the film sets itself up to not be to everybody's cup of tea. As Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson exchange expletive after expletive whilst surrounded by the considerable beauty of Bruges, it's obvious this is not going to be a ""normal"" movie. Throw in drug abuse, prostitution and a racist dwarf, well you can understand why the film is seen as unpalatable to some - yet still be digestible brilliance to others. What is for sure is that those who haven't seen it really should do so for it may just become one of your favourite movies, yes, it really does deserve the chance to pull you on board.By definition, it's an ultimate black comedy, But in amongst the laughs, and there are many, lies a potent and affecting human drama involving love, guilt, morals and redemption. With the trick pulled by McDonagh being that of having every character in the piece dislikable, and yet easy to be on side with. Don't be surprised if you find yourself welling up with emotion during some of the more critical scenes. For the screenplay (BAFTA Award Winning) and the performances of Farrell (Golden Globe Award Best Actor) & Gleeson are razor sharp and very involving. Even Fiennes' spiv gangster boss is shown to be a ruthless sweary anger merchant, yet still capable of apology and genuinely respective of good principals. If that sounds odd? Then good, because it's an odd and strange little movie. I mean the love interest comes in the form of pretty Clémence Poésy, a criminal femme fatale type here, but once ""Fleur Delacour"" in ""Harry Potter"" & ""The Goblet Of Fire"". While Canadian dwarf actor Jordan Prentice is more well known for playing ""Howard The Duck"". Each of them serving genuine purpose, both for the funny side of the story, and for the more humanistic elements that unravel as we hurtle towards to the coup de grâce a like finale.A barbed wire black comedy led by a towering performance from Farrell - where just like him you should laugh, cry and swear to your hearts content. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A #@&%ing Great Time!!,"I have to start this one off by saying this isn't a movie to take home for Grandma to enjoy. In Bruges starring Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes is a well played dark comedy for those who relish the poetic use of obscenities. It is a filth-laden film that unapologetically abuses every word your mom wishes wasn't in the dictionary. When watching this movie you are quick to realize that the over use of foul language is simply one aspect of the comedy that writer/director Martin McDonagh uses as a niche to carve out his piece of the film world. For me, this was just the tip of all the fun In Bruges has to offer.Winner of an Academy Award in 2006 for his short film Six Shooter (also starring Gleeson), celebrated British playwright McDonagh's first feature length film is hopefully a glimpse into a bright future of film-making. For In Bruges, much like Six Shooter, McDonagh uses his writing talents to tell a comical story through a dark and twisted sense of humor. In addition, with a shock of ultra violence within a not too violent film, it is sure to make all fans of foul words and blood scream for joy.It is difficult to offer a comparison for In Bruges, such as if you like that one, you'll like this one sort of thing. I would however put it in the same genre as Tarantino films, Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels, Boondock Saints, and Very Bad Things. This whole genre of modern day melodramas are films that use a bit of extreme violence with extreme language all perpetuated by extremely bad decisions. Then, to top it all off we the audience are meant to view these things as a comedy. I love it! The story of In Bruges is of two hit men (Farrell and Gleeson) that are sent to the city of Bruges in Belgium to sit tight and await new orders from their boss (played by Fiennes). Bruges is a simple historic little town, and no place for the likes of these two. A skewed view of a code of honor places the two hit men in a violent battle with their employer, and when the past catches up with them the mayhem ensues.Again, this film isn't for everyone. A person near and dear to me said it best: ""some people just can't see past the #@%&"". If you're lucky enough to qualify as being not one of these people, then run out and get your copy of In Bruges today, and #@%&ing enjoy it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Big disappointment,"""In Bruges"" was a huge disappointment, especially considering the unending praise this movie has been drawing from critics and viewers alike.I thought it was very false, and contrived.The movie centers on two professional hit men from Ireland, rationalising what they do for a living, i.e. killing people for money, by telling themselves that most of the people they've killed weren't very nice anyway, so kinda had it coming/only got their comeuppance. At the same time, they do of course have very appropriate pangs of conscience about the few people they killed who may not have deserved it. Generally speaking I don't care for movies about contract killers (""Grosse Pointe Blank"" being another example) which depict their protagonists in a naïve, romanticised way: Yeah, here are these two paid killers, but don't be put off by what they do for a living, they're really quite friendly people, so long as you don't end up on their hitlist! In fact, even if you do end up on their hitlist, they are still going to be friendly to you, although they are going to have to kill you, but that's strictly business, nothing personal! There is a scene where one of them relates how he had to kill a man he wasn't paid to kill  the man just stood in his way trying to protect a relative who was on the assassin's hitlist. The scene turns into a mock argument about whether or not he shot the man in self-defence, with the two talking at cross points, or rather Colin Farrell's character pretending to be too obtuse to see the other guy's point. The scene is clearly meant to be hilarious. I had no inclination to smile.One thing I am really sick of in English-language movies (not only this one) is all these Continental European supporting characters with absolutely flawless English, in this case Colin Farrell's enormously annoying Belgian love interest. Not only do they never make any mistakes, they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers, firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on English words that I assume wouldn't work in their own language. How about making a movie for a change in which Belgians, Germans, Italians, etc. speak English the way they really do, i.e. BADLY? Of course, no explanation is ever given why they speak English so well. Usually one of the native-speaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like ""Wow, your English is really good"", and that's that. On to the next pun.Another thing I am tired of is all these regular people with superhuman courage in the face of extreme danger, in this case an extremely pregnant(!) hotel owner who never wavers for a second as she stands in the way of an armed madman, in defiance of the danger to her own life and that of her unborn baby. Right. If there was anybody in the real world who would really act this way, it wouldn't be courageous, it would be plain stupid.There is one scene of such colossal absurdity, I can't help but relate it. A man is first shot in the leg, then he hobbles down the winding stairs of a bell tower (albeit propped up by another man, to be fair), then he gets shot into the throat or maybe shoulder, then he drags himself back up the same winding staircase (this time without the help of the other man), then  once at the top  he drags himself onto the parapet of said bell tower to stand erect(!) upon the parapet before hurling himself down. There is a massive cloud of blood as he hits the ground. I won't reveal what happens next, let's just say the guy is of an impressive resilience.Almost as absurd is the ending which has the five leads all in the same place at the same time, so the movie can conveniently deal with them one after the other until all emotional and outer conflicts are neatly resolved, in a way that could only have been contrived by a director who comes from theater.I am giving this movie a liberal 2 out of 10 stars, the lowest rating I have given any movie since Terry Gilliam's ""Brothers Grimm"". If you want to see an honest movie about a paid assassin, watch the original ""Day of the Jackal"". That movie too centered on a man who killed for a living, but unlike ""In Bruges"" it never tries to coax the viewer into sympathising with its protagonist. Instead, it deals with its subject matter-of-factly: he's a contract killer, ruthless and despicable.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fear and loathing....and horse tranquilizers...in Bruges,"This is exactly my sort of film. If you like edgy, minimalist crime capers, this is your sort of film too. If you liked ""The Limey"" and/or ""The Matador"", I think you'll like this one. Really I thought I'd like this one, but didn't expect it to be as satisfying as it was.Colin Farrell really should be considered for an Oscar for this performance. He plays Ray, a troubled hit-man who is struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of a hit gone wrong. While some commenters have noted Ray's erratic behavior, few have mentioned his quite profound crisis of conscience. Some might say he has no conscience but that is undercut by the moral code to which the hit men in this film adhere. This one act has thrown him completely off-course and he acts out in anti-social (and very funny) ways. He insults other tourists; he is excessively irritated by minor things. He is completely disinterested in sightseeing in the beautiful medieval city (it's in Belgium) where he and and his laid-back accomplice, Ken (the ever professional Brendan Gleeson) have been sent with instructions to lay low until they get their next word from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes playing a character whose job and demeanor seem very similar to those of Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast."" That said, Fiennes, makes this role his own with his passion and intelligence).Director Martin McDonagh, as mentioned, has a flare for capturing the ultimately sad human essence of hit men. He does not glamorize them but captures them at their most mundane. The laughs seem all the funnier for their very universality. That said, he never loses sight of the fact that this story is really about hit men attempting to come to terms with what they have done. It lends the story a sobering undertone which ensures the movie will stay with you for a long time. Farrell is absolutely at the top of his game. Fiennes is (like Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"") scarily psychotic, and Brendan Gleeson is, like others have said in comments, the moral center of the film. The conclusion is satisfying and appropriate and I cannot wait to see what McDonagh does next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Setup,"There are a lot of writerly things going on with this script. Most of them are standard devices. Almost too standard.But there is something I noticed. The spoiler here is that the story takes over by the very end and the structure of the story forces the characters to knowingly act as they know they must. Even at great sacrifice. This works by two means. One is conventional: the code of the assassins is underscored as it is in hundreds of movies. This is supplemented by the nature of the place as a sort of purgatory which has its own rules leading toward passage.But there's a second writerly trick at work here. Its the use of story fragments being introduced at one point in the story in such a way that they are tagged with significance. Then those story dynamics take on a life of their own and retouch the narrative later on. An example is that the threat of a bottle is introduced. Later, that threat appears. Its only done there and a few other times so we can subconsciously read the sense of the story. Midgets dying. Guns in rivers. Written instruction. Weight and climbing stairs. Prostitutes.Of course the all-important film within the film makes an appearance.So this sets us up for the noir-driven ending where an earlier story element inserts itself taking control.Ferrell always understood this method, even as Bullseye. He's good, that one. What would we do without the Irish and Australians?Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Superb.,"It's rare to find a film that can go from hilarious comedy to dark violence and genuine emotion without compromising either the humour or the drama but this one does it time and again.The cast are excellent, Gleeson is good as the sensible adult figure while Farrell is brilliant as the comic and immature lead.

The supporting cast are all good, everyone is believable.The humour is often very politically incorrect but never in a nasty way, the dialogue is superb and there are some great set pieces and unexpected comic twists to catch you by surprise and make you laugh out loud.The dramatic side handles a very dark and emotional subject very deftly with believable switches from humour to sadness and the leads really earn there money by pulling those switches off seamlessly.There is a lot of action and violence especially towards the end and this throws in ideas that I had never seen used before.If you liked the film ""Intermission"" you'll definitely like this, but this has more and better jokes and the plot is far more interesting.I've rarely left a cinema feeling I got as much value for my money as I did with this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
IN BRUGES is an excellent example of how an original and brilliant narrative can be undermined by over-performance of an actor.,"The plot is very well constructed, containing essential elements of both tragedy and comedy, a mixture resulting in a surprising acidity. The characters are driven, surrounded by the dream city of Bruges, through psychological conflicts both funny and desperate.However, IN BRUGES is an excellent example of how an original and brilliant narrative can be undermined by over-performance of an actor.Absolutely flawless interpretation of Ralph Fiennes in the role of Harry. Fiennes is a rare actor with stunning versatility, able to transform in both aberrant Amon Goeth (Schindler's List) as the innocent Justin Quayle (The Constant Gardener). Harry is no exception: Fiennes embodies with incredible easiness the surgical brutality of the character, capturing his private moral principles with naturally. This adds a fundamental coherence to the outcome of the film (anagnorisis +peripeteia), without which, no doubt, all the work would collapse.The exact opposite can be said about Colin Farrell performance. A desperate attempt to add a childish innocence to the character overrides his likelihood. In other words, an exaggerated performance, inconsistent with the sobriety of Fiennes and Brendan Gleeson (probably a view shared solely by this writing, considering the Golden Globes received by that performance).I believe that the work of Farrell, data venia, weighed in the assessment, belittling, by contrast, an excellent narrative.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A huge disappointment!,"I was looking forward to this, being a huge fan of Martin McDonagh and Colin Farrell AND Brendan Gleeson.Bruges is a character in the film too, a beautiful Bruges, canals, cathedrals and lovely cobblestones.

"""In Bruges"" aims high and misses by a mile","""In Bruges"" is an ambitious, but ultimately failed attempt to deliver some sort of existential fable... The internal ""moral"" conflicts of professional assassins weren't amusing in any way or intelligently presented. This subject matter would have any movie director walking on very thin ice.

Dark comedies are hard to master, and this is certainly the most worthwhile I have seen since Lethal Weapon creator Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; especially with far lesser attempts such as War Inc. fouling up the pond.Bruges, the capital of West Flanders in Belgium (pronounced 'Broo-jiz') serves as the quirky setting for second time director Martin McDonagh, and the cinematography and art direction immerses the viewer into this abstract setting. In Bruges evokes a somewhat dreamlike carriage which is efficiently echoed by journey of the characters. This beguiling fable follows two hit men, the distraught and emotionally fragile Ray (Colin Farrell) and the gentle fatherly Ken (Brendan Gleeson) sent by their irritable and emotionally erratic employer Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to Bruges to fulfill a hit. Complicating the situation is Ray's unstable mental state, which was shaken on an earlier job when a young boy was caught in the crossfire, and which has left quite suicidal. The surreal surroundings of Bruges leave Ray wanting, but thrills Ken with its Gothic storybook refinement. Things become even more phantasmal during the meeting of a movie star dwarf, played by Jordan Prentice and with the development of an unlikely relationship between Ray and a local girl, Chloe (Clémence Poséy). These circumstances sway the line between a dreamworld and the bleak reality of the duos proffesions, but never to the extent where the film could be considered a physiological bind-bender by any means.Colin Farrell has always been a solid actor, but needs to rethink his agent, as his roles carry from routine action flicks which leave him emotionally grounded, to art house flops that become far to precious and quirky for their own good. Farrell gives the performance of his career, flawlessly blurring the line between a coy smart-aleck and tragic silhouette. Gleeson is equally sensational, again showing, like never before, his acting chops. I cannot say that Ralph Fiennes gives his best here, as that distinction belongs with his astounding portrayal of Amon Goeth in Schindler's List but it is certainly his most accomplished since then. Poséy is delightful and complex for her small role, and Prentice proves that an actor of his stature does not have to be typecast in meaningless roles.As amazing as the ensemble cast is, kudos are justly due to McDonough, whose writing chops provide the drole and solid foundation for the performances. This effort is simultaneously hilarious, tragic and mystical; and the three blend seamlessly. Unlike other films cut from the same cloth, In Bruges never lets its quirkiness take the story, setting and characters hostage. It is involving and endearing, with countless meaningful undercurrents, and as a whole this film demands repeat viewings; an order I am highly pleased to fill. There is also some gunplay and bloodshed for those who find themselves hard-pressed to sit through a film completely devoid of a scuffle or two. Really, In Bruges takes a bit of everything, and perhaps that is best suited to the continually surreal surroundings that we find the two immersed in, and although risking a lot with such a direction, it never seems scattershot or incoherent. And after this infinitely satisfying adventure, in Bruges was the only place I wanted to be.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
My personal favourite movie,"I don't think there's a movie that stands infinite viewings. But if I have to pick the closest one to this, for me it's In Bruge. Just because it's a perfectly filmed feeling. Feeling of the city. And because Martin McDonagh is master of emotional swing. He absolutely nails getting from a high point cheerful mood to the deepest sadness in a matter of few words of dialogue. And this city is perfect to be filmed this way. It's just like time and space and human skill all collided in one point. That's how this movie came to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the Best Films of the Year,"Where to begin on this film? ""In Bruges"" is simply the most original films that I have seen in a long while. Martin McDonagh has written a hilarious dark comedic adventure. The story is very intriguing, but the characters are shear genius, and they are improved with the perfect cast.Many people will pass this up on these bases: I've never heard of it; It is a British film; and Colin Farrel is in it.I am openly admitting that before I saw this film, I did not care for Colin Farrel and I was not a fan of his acting. He redeems himself in this role. His deep and comedic portrayal of his character cannot be missed, not to mention Brendan Gleeson's astounding work and Ralph Fiennes doing one hell of a performance. Even the smaller characters are so very interesting.This film is a must see! Don't miss out on ""In Bruges""!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"In Bruges - review, 7/10","In Bruges was a movie that took it's time to really sink its teeth into me; it began as a slow, chilled-out meander around Bruges (the Belgian town in which the movie is set) that was interspersed with a bit of witty back-and-forth from the two main protagonists (a couple of Irish hitmen preparing to deal with the fallout after a job gone wrong). Whilst the setting of Bruges was interesting in and of itself, I wasn't used to a movie focusing on so little for so long, however, by the time that the stakes were ratcheted up in the second half of the movie I noticed that I had connected with the characters on a level that surprised me.Of course, this was largely down to the excellent cast, the two main characters Ray (played by Colin Farrell) and Ken (played by Brendan Gleeson) have good chemistry and make their flawed characters endearing and relatable. Some credit should also be given to the writers, the cast were given great lines to work with. Admittedly, I found the comedic tone a little strange (especially the weird midget jokes) but it works when it counts and the movie successfully uses humour to explore the inner demons of the hitmen without trivialising their emotions. A more conventional movie would opt out of taking the opportunity to poke fun of its protagonist's emotional turmoil but that's what makes the movie so refreshing; it strikes a balance between humour and thoughtfulness and gets it (mostly) right, adding a breath of fresh air to an already pretty unique movie. I say mostly as the plot gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on, events start of quite tame but soon Bruges opens up as it's unconvincing locals introduce themselves and devolve into unconvincing plot devices, it was good for a few good laughs but felt very lazy and pulled me out of the movie.Saying that, I still enjoyed the film, the cast did a good job of holding the movie up as the plot began to thin near the climax. Overall, the entire 'feel' of In Bruges is very... unconventional and while it is lacking in areas, it's setting, characters and humour are still a welcome step back from typical Hollywood blockbusters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Eerie good,"Directed by Martin McDonagh, ""In Bruges"" is a darkly comedic drama that skillfully balances humor with poignant character exploration.The film follows two hitmen, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), who are sent to the medieval Belgian city of Bruges after a job goes wrong. As they await further instructions from their boss, they find themselves in a surreal and picturesque setting that contrasts with the violence and darkness of their profession.""In Bruges"" stands out for its sharp writing, blending witty and dark humor with moments of introspection and emotional depth. The film navigates a fine line between comedy and drama, delving into themes of guilt, redemption, and the complexities of human relationships.Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson deliver outstanding performances, showcasing their comedic talents while also exploring the emotional turmoil of their characters. The chemistry between the two leads adds heart to the film's often morbidly funny situations.The picturesque backdrop of Bruges serves as both a character and a commentary on the contrast between beauty and darkness. The film's setting enhances the film's unique atmosphere, giving it a distinct visual style.""In Bruges"" succeeds in finding humor in unexpected places while also addressing deeper themes of morality and personal growth. It's a film that manages to blend drama and comedy seamlessly, resulting in a genuinely compelling and unforgettable cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""In Bruges"" is a hidden gem that offers a unique blend of dark comedy and drama.

Two hit men blow a job and are told to go hide out in Bruges,"What a great film. Both gritty and beautiful, superbly acted, with a taught script. There are predictable parts, but they are often only foreshadowed by a few minutes. It is one of those great dark crime comedies that the Brits are so good at--a little lighter than Sexy Beast, a little darker than Snatch, but with a dream-like quality that shows just a touch of influence from Felini. Really fun flick. In a way the characters are a bit clichéd--especially Ralph Fienes' gangster, but that's no big deal. I thought the inclusion of Jimmy the racist dwarf was a stroke of brilliance, and the tight way he is woven into the script shows some real skill. Go see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Cracking!,"Great film! I watched this in a packed movie theater in the USA, and although parts of the dialogue are a bit ""near the mark"" for the American audience, and certain jokes are aimed squarely at the British / Irish audience, it went down very well.A very original take on a good story, all performances were excellent. The script can seem a little cheesy at first, but once it gets flowing it's very natural and very well written, and performed seamlessly.Colin is excellent, probably his best role I would say! The only slight negative is that 'Arry, Ralph Fiennes' character, is rather too similar to Don Logan, Ben Kingsley's character in Sexy Beast. However, this isn't a bad thing as both characters work well, it's just a shame I couldn't stop myself comparing them.My wife and I really enjoyed, it's very, very funny throughout, with moments of real subtle, dry comedy genius, plus moments of in your face humour. It's also bittersweet, romantic, violent, briefly offensive to some, occasionally shocking and upsetting, but hugely enjoyable and very well done.Overall a very strong 9 / 10 for a great independent movie! Deserves a lot more success than I expect it will get!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Awful. The Pits.,"Atrocious film-making. Two morons, that by the end we're meant to find adorable, arrive in Bruges for some sinister mission. What follows is basically a hate filled diatribe humiliating gay men (shock horror), dwarfs and women. There's no sophistication in the supposedly brilliant writing. It's the kind of lousy movie that seems to have been inspired by rednecks and writing on toilet walls in pubs.Reading some of the reviews of this film is mind boggling. Most harp on and on about Farrell's redemption but given that this particular element in the script is so utterly unconvincing (Is this what McDonaugh considers irony?) and simply used as a device to validate Farrell's rampant homophobia and misogyny-the result is sickening, not illuminating.Yes, Bruges looks wonderful but who cares when you're watching offensive rubbish of this nature. Painful.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
You WILL talk about this film after seeing it,"This is one of those awesome films that a viewer will either love or hate...there is no in-between.If you love it, you must have a twisted, wicked sense of humor, an open mind enough to truly appreciate well-written, intelligent dialogue and an imagination that will go along w/a plot that LOOKS like it is two jig-saw puzzles mixed together...until it all comes together brilliantly in the last 30 minutes. Add in a performance from Colin Farrell that is SO different from the arrogant A-type character he usually plays...his ""dumb"" character is actually funny in this one.At the industry screening here in LA several ""older types"" walked out early...maybe because of the liberal use of the F-word...but the majority stayed to debate the ending and ""why"" it had to end the way it did.For those who hated it: you're too stupid to understand an intelligent, thought-provoking film when you see one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Colin Farrell deserved an Oscar,"I rewatched this movie very recently, having not watched it since its first release. I had forgotten how funny and emotional a movie it is.Brendan Gleeson is the straight man to Colin Farrells comedic role and both play them really well. However Colin Farrell steals the show in what I believe is his best ever performance. His childlike, witty humour hits the mark every time and I guarantee there will be lines from this that you will remember for ever.There is of course a darker side to the movie and this plays out very well, with contributions from not just to two main protagonists, but the entire cast, with Raplh Feines adding that gangster edge.Its dark comedy will have to rewatching this movie every few years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Doesn't quite work but is still darkly comic and entertaining,"Hit men Ray and Ken have been sent to Bruges to lay low for a while and await a call from their criminal boss Harry. They are meant to stay near the phone in the evening and are free to sightsee during the day but Ray is less than impressed with his surroundings even in Ken is soaking it all in. While they await further instructions, the two talk over things, travel round the city, get involved with some of the cast and crew making a film and generally fail to stay out of trouble or maintain a low profile.In Bruges was sold as a hilarious comedy and this in combination with the names involved made me want to check it out. It was mis-sold but this is not to say that the film still wasn't pretty good. It is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny but it is only occasionally and mostly the tone is very black, with humour coming laced with violence. On the flip of this approach though the film does still have a plot where the characters are in danger and it does still expect to pack a narrative and emotional punch. Both sides are OK but they do not work as well together as I would have liked. When it is funny the film is brilliant, with great lines juxtapositioning with the often violent situations they are in and this darkly comic stuff really appealed to me but the downside is that it does make it harder to suddenly launch into a more dramatic film where we really need to feel the danger. This is difficult given we have just watched danger being dealt with in a comic and offhand way, so my heart was not really in it in the later stages of the film.When the violence is handled with humour, it doesn't bother me much but the gore and the impact of the violence is pretty harshly depicted, which again makes the film a little hard to ""enjoy"" in the way I was in the first half of the movie. Really it needed to go one way or the other for definite so that there was an overall direction for the film because, as it is, it does feel like two different approaches with a reasonable blend in the middle. The cast make it work though and you can see from their performances that they know they are the whole show here. Farrell impressed me with his comedy abilities and although he did remind me of Father Dougal at times, he is really good here, getting laughs and being able to deliver sudden brutality. Gleeson is equally good and the film is great when the two of them are allowed to play off one another. Fiennes helps the latter stages of the film work because his performance is strong  injecting dark energy into the film just when it needed something to carry it across the end. Reuten and Prentice are OK but are very much secondary to the main three.Overall In Bruges is not a brilliant or hilarious film but it does more or less work and entertain throughout. The darker it gets the less it works and the ending is not as strong as the first half of the film but mostly the darkly comic and brutal material does work thanks to the really good playing from the three main actors, while Bruges itself provides a picturesque background. Come to it with low expectations and it will probably charm and engage you but it is not quite as good as some would have you believe.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This Decade Will Remember This One!,"Martin McDonagh, no matter what he's made in the past, the Oscar-Winner this time he has made a Film that easily goes down in history as one of the finest films of all-time.Don't pretend, if you've seen 'In Bruges', you know it's nothing short of Fantastic. McDonagh's writing and direction are THE pluses of the film. The screenplay is astounding; the execution is high-class. 'In Bruges' makes you smile, makes you sad, it's a joyride you can't afford to miss.If the writing and direction get all the hoopla, here's a special mention to: Cinematographer Eigil Bryld for doing his work par-excellence. The editing by Jon Gregory is nothing short of perfection.Talking of performances: Colin Farrell has delivered bravura performances in many of his previous works, but his work in'In Bruges' makes him go down as one of the finest actors of all-time. The regret, the pain of killing an innocent kid, you fell the pain he's going through. Calling his performance as fantastic would've been an understatement. Bombastic, ya, maybe, but a performance like this is above the words and higher than any praise. Ralph Fiennes is, as always, commendable. Brenden Gleeson is outstanding; especially in the climax. Clémence Poésy does a good job.Now get this straight: 'In Bruges' is above-the-normal-stuff, way above. This film is gory at places agreed, but in totality, A treat for the viewer!

"ok, don't expect to much","This movie is enjoyable if you want to clear your mind a bit. Nothing difficult, no wit, just a slow movie with thugs, guns, girl(s) and drugs.As a Belgian however I visited Bruges multiple times. The spirit of Bruges is not as shown here.

English Mafia Films.. Here's Another Good One,"After a botched hit job on a priest, two hit men are sent to ""hide out"" in Bruges (that's Belgium) until they receive further instructions. However, when those instructions arrive, it's not the happy ending they may have been hoping for.""In Bruges"" is pretty much awesome. It has the English mafia mentality of Guy Ritchie's work, with a fair amount of action and violence, but it also has a sentimental side that Ritchie doesn't really touch upon in his tales. These are men who not only kill, but can love... and have their own moral code of right and wrong.Colin Farrell shines here. If he never did anything else, he could still be remembered for this film (he's also decent in ""Dr. Parnassus""). And then you have Ralph Fiennes, who pretty much never makes a bad film, even when it's a sappy romantic comedy. More than any other role, Harry (Fiennes) brings out the anger and the control.This film is ""Snatch"" brought to the next level with some of ""The Third Man"" thrown in. A few unpredictable twists and turns, and some lively characters that are unique in more ways than one. I highly recommend this film for anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I found myself laughing when I shouldn't have been.,"To put it succinctly, In Bruges was the best film that I saw in 2007. I loved every minute of it, from the expletives in the opening scene to the shockingly crazy ending. Colin Farrell plays a hit-man recruited by Brendan Gleeson to work for Ralph Fiennes. When Farrell botches his first job, Fiennes sends both him and Gleeson to Bruges, Belgium, to get them away from London.Colin Farrell was disastrous in Alexander, largely because the film was a catastrophe, so watching him in In Bruges was a real surprise, he is excellent. He fits the character so well, the mannerisms, emotions, everything. His interactions with Gleeson during their escapades throughout the medieval town of Bruges are examples of perfect cinematography, excellent scripts, and superb sounds. The score complements the film in every way, fitting both the scenery and the film.However, if you are easily offended or unable to deal with violent scenes you probably do not want to watch this film. Violence, coarse language, and other ""antisocial"" tendencies are pervasive throughout the film as they form the core of the movie. I know of only two people that would not like this film, in fact I plan to show this to my mum, and I'm sure she'll love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A brilliant exercise in storytelling,"It feels like they don't make movies like that anymore. The drama plays between an extremely small of characters, and the exposition is very long to the point where you're not sure if it's another one of these European movies where it's just talking and lanscape shots. Then slowly but surely, the threads of the plots stir and stitch together, drawing you into a nail-biting, tense experience. There's no explosions, no grand gestures, but the stakes are extremely high - the movie in a discrete way makes you care about the characters a lot. Plot points fall like dominoes in an unavoidable, brutal way. A realistic, gritty, melancholic gangster story with morally grey and sympathetic characters and brilliant dialogue. Each exchange in the movie is perfect in its message and delivery. The movie is a great experience especially for the lovers of the Coen brothers (which I count myself among the ranks of).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"""Isn't vicious murder funny? Let's make a comedy about it.""","Don't much like films made like this one. Ultimately psychopathically vicious, treacherous, and murderous but....""let's have big fun with it by making bloody murder and psychopathic hit men funny in the beginning before we get down to the real cruel blood and guts at the end""...... more or less a tired copy of one of Tarantino's films like Pulp Fiction, and it was mostly a one trick pony commercially calculated to depict sick but marginally entertaining segments of contrived and cruel human behavior including all the violence, blood and suffering an audience could stand for 2 hours without turning theaters into vomiteriums. The worst aspect of this film was that it shamelessly copied others in this genre who have done a much better job of it, like Tarantino, Peckinpah, and Scorcese.In Bruges was two disparate films tacked together.....the first one was a goofy, near Monty Python sketch of a forced stay in Bruges, Belgium by two joking and wise-cracking hit men sent there by their head man to cool off after a botched assignment in the UK, and the second part was a cruelly vicious and bloody version of a typical Peckinpah/Scorcese/Tarantino film of terminal comeuppance and payback for treachery and nearly limitless earlier sins. The two film parts and the character's actions in each part did not match well and thus the result looked contrived and uneven overall and appeared to be done by one who has a lot to learn about what makes a film good, and that includes consistent characterization that he did not well control. And, it does not include shamelessly copying a story style done better many times in the past 40 years and essentially pretty worn down by now.So, to me there was little substance that was interestingly new or different here. Instead, go see No Country For Old Men for this story genre done as well as it can be done. But, Bruges did look like a nice place to visit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The violence was very graphic which is fine by me and the language was offensive and very funny. This black comedy is a gem and should be seen by anybody over 18 (even though I am 15! :)).

"Sadly, no midgets are tossed","Two hit men hide out in an unassuming Belgian town in this thriller, which starts out as a quiet two-character study and then jukes and jives its way to a screamingly violent conclusion. In Bruges is a low-rent Pulp Fiction knockoff, but it's a knockoff that pays off in spades, with strong, believable acting, excellent cinematography, and a taut, amusing script.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have just completed a rather difficult job and have been ordered by their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to repair to the idyllic town of Bruges to lay low for up to two weeks. ""Two weeks with you?"" Ray exclaims to Ken. ""No way!"" Ray's a novice to the world of hit-manning, and being as young as he is he's not too keen to spend two weeks in any spot that's not teeming with hot women or other fun things to do. Bruges isn't exactly a Mecca of excitement, you see. On the other hand, the more seasoned Ken is pretty happy with staying in the placid little burg, because it'll give him time to sightsee and take it easy.Both men start to believe there's something else afoot. Why Bruges, after all? They're Londoners, so why not hide out in London, or even in the English countryside? No, they had to schlep over to Belgium. (There are plenty of Belgian jokes, and a smart dig at Americans that was both accurate and snicker-worthy.) But before Ray can get properly bored, he meets a sweet young lady named Chloe (Clemence Poesy, late of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) working on a movie that's being filmed right there in Bruges, and he sees a chance to redeem himself for past sins - but apparently Chloe has a few dark secrets of her own.Gleeson and Farrell are wonderful together, and the film avoids such clichés as the young impetuous hothead and the veteran killer on one last job, and you never get the impression that they're just a couple of lunkheads who go around killing people randomly. (You know the type: Guy gets tired awaiting further instructions, so he shoots someone to keep in practice.) And of course, nothing goes as Ray and Ken expect it to go. There's no way, of course, that they're going to stay the entire two weeks in the podunk town with nothing happening, right? Yeah, probably not.So they wait around for Harry to call and give them further instructions, and when he does all hell really breaks loose. But setting that aside for the moment, here are some other entertaining aspects of the movie: drug use, gunplay, midgets, and blood. Yes, midgets! Okay, dwarfs. And although there's no dwarf tossing, there is a karate chop to a dwarf's neck, which is awesome in and of itself.Another plus is the film is remarkably well shot. Filming on location in the actual town of Brugge in Belgium, cinematographer Eigil Bryld brilliantly juxtaposes the angularity of the buildings and the beauty of the landscapes with the brutality of the men's violent behavior and coarse language. The pooling of blood on stark, gritty pavement, surrounded by gleaming snowdrifts and the pulchritude and quiet desperation of Bruges itself.Although not as wittily intelligent as Pulp Fiction, In Bruges is still quite clever - and not too clever for its own good, either. It's not one of those movies that tosses in funny dialog just to be funny or so-called twists just to keep the viewer guessing. Two charming, gutsy performances by Gleeson as the unorthodox older man and Farrell as the twitchy younger one boost this one up a notch about the typical caper thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Not as good as I had hoped,"I had high hopes for this movie. Roeper and Whoever made it sound as though it was one of the best movies of the year, and hilarious.It was pretty good, but it was not great, and I don't know exactly why.It had a few laughs, but it was not a comedy.Two hit men go to Bruges (pronounced Brooj) after a hit. The person who hired them sends them there, supposedly for a little r & r after a hit. One of the hit men, played by Brendan Gleeson, soaks in the history. The other, played by Collin Farrell, is bored to tears, until he meets a local woman. She has an ex-boyfriend. She also deals drugs to a movie cast and crew, who are filming in Bruges.We don't know why the hit men (well, actually, the hit man - Farrell was the hit man, Gleeson was the person who recruited him) were hired to do the job, or why the hit was commissioned, but this was not important anyway. Ralph Fiennes plays the guy who called for the hit.oh - there's also the hostess of the hotel (or was it a b & b) where Farrell and Gleason are staying in Bruges. She's pregnant.I'm not going to say too much more, because to do so would give away too much of the plot.The acting was fine. Gleeson especially shines. Ralph Fiennes is properly menacing. Farrell does a pretty good job as a novice hit man. The women are fine, although they really aren't given much to do with their parts.The movie was entertaining, and it held my interest, and it was a nice change of pace from a Hollywood story, but I can't highly recommend the movie.It was worth the price of a matinée, plus a medium popcorn and soda.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What a Disappointment,"It's getting harder and harder to find decent movies to attend or rent, so I was looking forward to In Bruges. High praise, Brendan Gleeson, hapless gangsters, etc. What could be better? But what a disappointment.I can't believe this movie has garnered the praise it has. It was boring and amateurish, there was nothing to the characters, and if the dialogue was half as clever as it thought it was it would've been mildly amusing. Every single plot device may as well have come with sirens and flashing lights. And to tie it all together into one big mess, Ralph Fiennes is miscast, and for Colin Farrell, apparently, acting equals working every facial muscle he owns. This is no successor to Tarentino or Sexy Beast. Not at all. If it weren't for the glimpses of Bruges's canals and medieval buildings, I'd say this was a total waste.If you want to see wit, humor, and Brendan Gleeson as a reluctant thug with a younger sidekick, try to find a copy of I Went Down.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
If you like your comedy black and without sugar...,"This is a hard movie to classify, let alone review. Where do you start? It IS humorous, but essentially it is a tragedy. It is unashamedly politically incorrect, but it does so indiscriminately. The central characters are really reprehensible in their actions & views and hardly distinguishable from the 'bad guys'. Wow - just like in real life.The scenes of Bruges are beautifully shot, the script is clever and funny and the acting first rate. The whole movie is a work of art. It became my favourite movie from the first viewing but I left it nearly a year before reviewing it as I thought my enthusiasm may subside. It has not: I have given this film 10/10.There is a wonderfully warm paternal relationship between Ken (Brendan Gleeson) & Ray (Colin Farrell) both characters are beautifully written with depth and wit. The background story unfolds gently without any fanfares that would insult the viewer. There are several very interesting characters floating around Bruges with Ray & Ken many of whom have good lines and memorable presence in the film: Tourists, drug dealers, a dwarf and a ticket seller, all with their part to play and who play it well.The movie changes tempo in the final half hour becoming more action orientated and for me this is the weakest part. But the ending itself is perfect for the film. It has ambiguity which is something I normally hate, but a happy ending would be out of the question in this story and who the hell wants to see a sad one?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"One man's heaven, another man's hell","I saw in Bruges last night and to be honest I'm still struggling with it a bit. The trailer for the film is misleading, as it makes it look like one of those fun sassy Guy Ritchie style movies about a couple of quirky hit men hiding out well In Bruges. The dialogue is Tarantino-esquire sharp and very funny. But the trailer gives no hints whatsoever to the darkness of the material lurking in ""the alcoves"" of this film.The violence is intense, and disturbing both thematically and visually. This is NOT a light comedy for kids. I would hesitate about letting teenagers see it as well. I know a lot of people have been desensitized to violence, and I have too to a large degree. Tarantino does violence like a kid playing with plastic army toys in the backyard. You know he's just splashing fake blood all over everything so you never really invest all that much weight to it. But the violence in In Bruges is realistic and visceral in a way that seems much too dark, intense and serious for the comedy it introduces itself as.The characters take the violence and associated guilt and consequences seriously as well. I can't tell if the director intended for the drama to be as serious as the comedy is funny or if the actors he brought together on screen are simply way too talented and played it too straight. Then again, the darkness of the demon is much too serious to play it any other way.Farrell plays the guilt-ridden Ray to Macbeth perfection, craving distraction in the form of drink, drugs and women to avoid facing his freshly minted demons, and twitching with discomfort at his exile in the calm, sleepy bucolic Bruges, a place tailor made for quiet reflection. He is literally squirming with frustration, boredom and remorse like a 10 year old kid in church. His rapport with Brendon Gleeson is delightful, easy and funny, a patient older brother/younger brother dynamic. Gleeson's Ken finds an inspired serenity to the city, and his reflection on Ray's plight brings forth a strong conviction of compassion for the younger man. The dichotomy that plays between their characters as Bruges presents itself as one man's heaven and another man's hell is genuine and interesting.As a comedy the film is sassy and delightfully fun. As a drama, the film is dark and unexpectedly movingly dramatic. But combining both of these tones into one film left me feeling a bit confused as to how to feel. What Ray did was bad. Real bad. It was hard to abandon myself to the sassy silliness of the comedy, given the darkness of the dirty deeds. I felt guilty laughing at the jokes, and regardless of how charming Farrell is, I still felt conflicted about sympathizing with Ray.Movie goers with a thicker skin will enjoy it tremendously. I find myself wondering why the guys who can make this truly hip, fresh, funny stuff can't leave out all the blood and demons for once and just let me kick back and enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Decent entertainment once it finally gets going,"'In Bruges' has a lot of glowing reviews and an average rating that puts it up with the some of the best films of 2008, but I can't say I share the same enthusiasm for it. Firstly, even though dark humour is usually my thing, I didn't think 'In Bruges' was particularly funny. The constant crude language, especially from Farrell's character, was more irritating than humorous and didn't feel natural at all, and neither did the character's constant whinging.The second half of 'In Bruges' is a lot better than the dull and directionless first half, in which the two characters do little more than wonder around the city complaining about anything and everything. At least we get some action in the second half, though it only partly recovers what it a disappointing spectacle. 'In Bruges' isn't bad once it finally gets going and the humour will probably appeal to some people, but I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fear and Loathing In Bruges,"Martin McDonagh, in his first feature film, has created one hell of an introduction. The movie is not complex, at first, as two hit men are sent to Bruges to wait for their orders after a hit goes terribly wrong. Bruges is in Belgium, by the way. It's a beautiful medieval city that lifts off the screen with gorgeous cinematography. It's hard to imagine a city so aesthetically pleasing with its towers, canals, and scenery that most would cherish.One of the hit men is Ray (Colin Farrell) and the other is Ken (Brenden Gleeson). Ray finds Bruges to be old and boring while Ken admires the architecture with wondrous eyes. As they wait for their orders we have a lot of comedic banter with a setting Quentin Tarantino could write dialogue for days with. It takes about twenty minutes into the film when the action and the plot start to pull all the strings together with a hit; in a church of all places. This is Ray's first hit. The scene starts, through a flashback, with Ray confessing to a murder that will take place in the not so distant feature. He tells the priest, ""I've murdered someone."" The priest asks, ""Who did you murder?"" Ray responds with, ""You, Father."" As the bullets start to fly a life is taken. More importantly an innocent life - a young boy's life. The boy is on his knees as he just finished writing his confession for all the bad things he did.This sets into place a string of events involving characters recognizing their own absurdity in certain situations (they call them principles). The humor is dark and extremely effective, mostly coming from Ray. At some point in the film, I was laughing so hard I missed the next lines. It truly is laugh-out-loud funny. Farrell is perfect with his childish delivery, batting eyebrows and high pitched squeaking sounds to emphasize certain words. Farrell does an excellent job as and makes you feel for his characters pain immensely as he agonizes over the little boy's death. Both of these actors work exceptionally well off one another and both give heart felt performances.Do hit men such as these have moral boundaries? Do they cross them? Do they stand by their word, and more importantly, do they do what they say they would do when the gun is put to their own head? Ethics would never come into play with hit men in most films, but these men have boundaries and their word means something to them.Henry (Ralph Fiennes) is the leader of these two hit men and he sent both to Bruges to wait for his orders after the tragic hit in the church. For the first 2/3 of the film we only hear him over the phone and he brings dark humor into the picture as well. The writing is fantastic as certain characters constantly repeat themselves and say the same thing multiple times. It sounds musical and so rhythmic with the delivery and the repetition. Fiennes is terrific. He and Ken have a couple of great scenes together in the final act. It's acting at its finest.The direction overall is extremely well done. After the film settles in it takes off and most of that is due in large part by the gorgeous cinematography and the great score lifting the film to the heights that it will stay at for the rest of the film. As the film progresses it gets better and better and better. You'll find yourself gradually becoming more and more involved with the outcome of the characters. ""In Bruges"" is a dark and funny film that's engaging till the end with an engrossing plot and characters. The best movie of 2008.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Charm does not overcome slow, dry pace of film.","I had been interested in seeing this film after having viewed the trailer, and jumped at the chance to see it at a local arts theater. Sadly, although it is not without charm, I found it to be slow and dry more often than not. It seemed as if the film was searching for an identity that it never really found, was it a comedy, drama, gangster picture, or what? I was was never sure. The scenery is interesting and of course plays a role in the film. I did enjoy some of the comic dialogue and moments in the story, but in the end it did not make it a worthwhile trip to the theater. I would have been happier seeing it on cable and not spending $7.00. My suggestion, wait until you can see it on cable and save your money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Superb Film.,"This is a terrific movie, and the best I've seen this year. Anyone reading the boards will be aware of the storyline, but will be unappreciative of the way it develops and its twists and turns. Martin McDonagh has given us a film of multi-layers, which hits the right spot every time. Let's hope there's more great work to come from this highly talented director & playwright. As for the performances, well Colin Farrell's is absolutely top notch. For an actor whose work, so far, has seen highs and lows this is a notable high point. His portrayal of Ray is absolutely first class, and he simply displays a quite amazing range of acting ability in this film. The rest of the leads, especially Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes, provide superlative support. This is a cinematic experience that should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Bruges will never look the same,"Poor old Bruges. I've never been there, but the name of the town will now forever evoke the collocation 'shithole' in my mind.Ray and Ken are two assassins sitting in out in Bruges after a botched job. ""Why Bruges?"" asks Ray. Why indeed, the answer becoming clearer as the opening banter gives way to a darker undercurrent.Colin Farrell has never been better, playing the dumb-but-deadly Ray. The humour, though not always successful, is daring at times. Delightfully, the film makes no attempt to pander to an American audience. Delicate souls from the The States might come out of this one chest-thumping. Farrell's courting of a local film PA sets up most of the comedic moments, along with his reluctant mentoring by Gleeson. When called upon to provide some deeper emotions, Farrell rises to the occasion with aplomb.Gleeson, who has quietly built an incredible CV that includes Braveheart and Gangs of New York, is as dependable as ever. When the boss charges him with a repugnant task, his inner turmoil is all-too-evident.Both men, so used to acting in foreign accents, clearly revel in the exchanges in unadulterated Irish English.The casting of Ralph Fiennes as London hood Harry Waters is less successful. Fiennes appears late in what appears to be almost a cameo, but the holding back of his presence is somewhat undercut by featuring his visage prominently on the poster. His performance is too derivative of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, and comes across as poor parody. He does share one of the films best moments with Gleeson in the pavement café, in a heated discussion revolving around an insult to his kids. But his character arc is forced, and his demise far too contrived, telegraphed as soon as the dwarf appears in school uniform.The running gags about dwarfs committing suicide, and the fighting prowess of the Vietnamese, are fresh and inventive. Gleeson and Farrell pitch their odd couple routine to a tee. In Bruges is both funny and moving and is not to be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Excellent, bloody dark comedy","Two killers find themselves in the medieval town of Bruges for a little involuntary R'n'R after a hit goes tragically wrong. One of the shooters, Ken (Brendan Gleeson) finds the old city quaint and fascinating, the other Ray (Colin Farrell) despises it as a boring backwater in a tedious country. Both the leads and Ralph Fiennes, who plays their profane, volatile boss Harry, are excellent in a clever, sharply scripted story of a short but bloody path to redemption. Religious symbolism is deftly woven in throughout the movie, in which Bruges serves as heaven, purgatory, or hell depending on the character, including imagery from Hieronymus Bosch's famous painting Last Judgment (itself sort of a 'black comedy'). Overall, an excellent, if somewhat violent and profanity-rich, film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
What is in Bruges??,"From what i had heard about this movie, it could have been like ""Apocalypse Now"" or it could have been another one of those movies which are spoofed in the likes of ""Pulp Fiction"". But it wasn't. I don't know whether its an adapted screenplay or an original one, still this is such a movie that i won't mind even if the novel is written for the movie. A classy cinematography, Gothic photography, amazing screenplay (the most unpredictable one), very mature acting by a superb star-cast, enough humor to keep me amused with a wide smile on my face, and the core of it all, the theme or drama never being misplaced in this simple looking complex film. The director Martin McDonaugh is a winner already. I would certainly not compare it to anything that has been done before, but would go as far to say it a benchmark for the movies to come. A complete package of everything that is required for a blockbuster but with a little difference because it is in Bruges.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Funny, Violent, Rude, With Tons of Swearing","In Bruge is an incredible film about two assassins struck in the Mideival Belgian city of Bruges. The movie is by Martin McDonagh, his first, although he has won the Tony for playwriting and is an incredible story teller! He has been described as Tarantino-esquire, and the dialogue certainly comes off that way, as well as the comic presentation of violence.I thought the drama was very well placed, though many will disagree, and it eventually added to the strong character development and overall effect of the story. Dwarfs are very prevalent in this film and provide much of the comic relief, as well as the foreshadowed ending.The movie is funny, violent, rude, with tons of swearing, and an incredible story; I recommend it highly!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I feel I want to go to Bruges...,"Pick some excellent actors, add a superb and unpredictable plot, mix in some believable dialogue and odd, yet completely realistic situations, and then set almost the entire film in a haunting yet mesmerising location most of us have never been to, some never even heard of.The film ""In Brujes"" is many things. It is extremely endearing, gory, violent, funny, tender, but most of all it is a compellingly human film. It charts a handful of days in the lives of two hired killers, after a job in London goes wrong, and they are sent to ""cool off and lay low"" in a rather unexpected place: Brujes, Belgium.The reason they are sent there becomes apparent once we have already been drawn well into the plot, and have developed empathy for the main characters, which makes everything that happens to them in the final act all the more resonant.Without spoiling it, as I believe this film is one of the least predictable ones I have seen in years, the reason they are sent to this little-known place (in Cinema, at least) partly involves the fact that ""Brujes is like a fairy tale city"".Since I dearly treasure the feeling of going to the cinema and being pleasantly surprised throughout the length of a film, both by its quality acting and original plot, I shall simply tell you that I was amused and laughed throughout, I felt pity, I felt pain, I felt hope. I felt.And I now feel I want to see this city. Because both it, and this film, have something of a fairytale about them. Honestly, miss this gem at your peril.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A surprisingly good movie with a convincing Farrell in the lead.,"When I was going to see this I didn't have the highest expectations. But In Bruiges surprised me, It was a great movie, and one of the best comedies of the year. I'm not the biggest fan of Colin Farrell either, but I have to say that he was fantastic in this movie, his character is so convincing that I will probably always see him as ""Ray"" from now on. Brendan Gleeson made a great performance as well, but Fiennes could have been better, I See his performance as rather flat. The directing and cinematography was great, they make Bruiges seem so beautiful and exotic. The writing is superb, some scenes are really funny, bu there's also a lot of suspense and great dialog.

The best scriptwriter since the Golden Age,"I recently revisited this film after a few years. The performances and direction are excellent, but it is the script which makes the film. McDonagh's reputation as one of the two great playwrights for the West End (alongside Stoppard) has clearly carried over to the script for this film, with the sharp witty dialogue last seen in the Golden Age allied with the most satisfying of storylines, bringing all the strands to a convincing conclusion. Yes, there is violence and yes, the film is not for the over sensititive - but anyone who knows McDonagh from work such as The Lieutenant of Inishmore would know what to expect. If you want the Brady Bunch don't watch a McDonagh film. And to round it all off Ralph Fiennes gives the most hilarious send up of Ben Kingsley (in his Sexy Beast persona) that is possible.McDonagh is a solid gold certified genius and this film announced a new God in the film pantheon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant and different.,"Over a blank screen an Irish accent starts a monologue that ends with a brilliant opening joke and I realise that I'm going to like this film. Like a violent and very adult episode of 'Father Ted' the two main characters Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) are hit men relocated to the sleepy Belgium town of Bruges after a job in England goes wrong. The pair are constantly at odds and like any great comedy duo play off each other amazingly well, the dialogue is fast and funny and the only let up is to make way for action or at times poignancy. The films charm lies in the fact that you can never quite tell what it wants to be, just when you think it's a sharp script based comedy like 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' it changes direction to become a tense thriller via moments that wouldn't seem out of place in a Farley brothers gross out movie. As well as an impressive use of swearing and some totally un-pc insults there are effects that would make even the strongest stomached patron wince a little, but as part of the whole package including a great little part from Fiennes as big boss Harry, this is one of the most enjoyable cinema going experiences I've had all year. A hidden gem with all the elements that other films lack, humour, excitement, a storyline, and characterisation. It is also blessed with an overwhelming sense of not being afraid to play out for an adult audience, brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Stupid people and stupid script.,"I rarely write reviews, but this tripe inspired me. It could have been called stupid people doing stupid things. One killer can't shut up; it seems he believes other people are fascinated at everything that goes on in his life, to the minutest detail. The script is full of holes. People that hold a gun on someone close enough for them to take it away. A supposedly professional killer walking through a park with his weapon held in his hand for all to see. And the stupidity goes on and on. Things that no one with an ounce of common sense would do.

I have seen the trailer of the movie, and I got to say all great movies have very poor trailers or no trailers at all. I didn't really ever liked Colin Farrell but he had an outstanding performance in this movie. The other movie that I would I recommend with C.F. is Phone Booth.

"""In Bruges"", get in the mood of one of the most unforgettable cinematic trips  ...","What a fantastic 'little' movie and I mean no disrespect by using the epithetic 'little'. In fact, it's a word that conveys extremely well the charm of this film, set in a small town in Belgium, Bruges, one of the unlikeliest but cleverest settings of a crime film.Even the title couldn't have been more eloquent, since the whole point of the film is that two Irish hit men are basically spending time ""In Bruges"", waiting for their boss' instructions after a botched job. While one of the two protagonists, Brendan Gleeson as the calm and moderate Ken, takes the opportunity to do the most normal thing we would do in a touristic place, his younger partner and friend, Ray, Colin Farrell, more free-spirited and tormented, impatiently thinks of leaving the town.There's a melancholic feeling inhabiting the first part of the film, as if we're waiting for something to happen ""In Bruges"", the action takes its time ... but that didn't bother me at all. The pacing's slowness gives us enough time to follow the characters and understand their personalities, and in the specific case of Ray: the big trauma that tortures his mind, and might have something to do with their 'waiting' in Bruges. And as the film progresses, you realize that Ray's pain reveals another one, even subtler, hidden in Ken's heart. It's a film with an unexpected depth that doesn't distract from the whole comedic atmosphere and reveals what is for me, one of the best written scripts of the last decade. Actually, I still wonder if I saw a black humor comedy or a light-hearted drama, but in both cases, I know I've seen one of the most unconventionally original films which is hard not to review without sounding like a pompous critic.So ... what I loved the most about ""In Bruges"" is this little universe it created, something very distinctive that I can't compare with any other film. A unique atmosphere where tourists, actors, thieves, prostitutes meet together and discuss everyday or futile matters like we do in real-life, when we go visit a foreign place. It's a cinematic melting-pot made of curiosity, discovery and knowledge, creating a supplementary delight while watching the film, as if the town was a character we learn about it, too. And that's how the movie works first, as a comedic medley of all the intriguing and entertaining situations we face while visiting a foreign country, something that gives the impression of an episodic and non-linear story, but the power of the script is that all these situations evolve crescendo and then finally combine for a totally satisfying and gripping climax, even more gripping because it took time to come to this situation. Where the official antagonist appears, Ralph Fiennes as Harry, the boss with some serious anger management's problem, we know we are getting closer to a memorable shootout, and a movie as original as ""In Bruges"" couldn't have disappointed.But I don't want to spoil anything from that movie, just to say that the performances from Gleeson, Farrell and Fiennes, are absolutely amazing, and convincing in their mix of goofy seriousness and melancholic depth. In many moments all through the film, especially in the scenes featuring Ken and Ray, you never cease to feel extreme empathy for these people whose presence in Bruges seems to serve a purpose that goes beyond the mission, as if it meant something even deeper, strangely deeper, they can't even figure what  as if Bruges was in the crossroads of these fates where something new was going to explode from these cocktails of feelings, of traumas and repressions, like those kind of holidays where we do change, from redemption or alienation, or both  but this is not a movie to over-analyze. The intellectual approach is smoothly invited near the ending when we collect the right pieces of the puzzle, and wait for us to find the last, the most precious piece, which still relies on the central character's soul, Ray.Ray is not necessarily deeper than Ken, and at many points, Ken is the most likely to get our sympathy, but what makes Ray more interesting is the way he's highlighted and foiled by the people he meets. Ray makes us encounter strange and unforgettable characters in a way that seems to go nowhere, like the very trip in a random place named Bruges, and the greatness of that film, is to make you wait until the end before you realize, they couldn't have chosen a better place to live this adventure. In Bruges, as the quintessential charm of the apparent insignificance which offers the best setting to explore our lives' own insignificance until the ultimate realization, that some things must change. Damn, whenever I try to praise the comedy, I end up talking about a drama.Indeed, ""In Bruges"" seems to be more a lighthearted drama that transcends the dramatic element and translate it into something so deeply funny, that you're never quite sure if you should laugh or cry, but why hesitating, the barrier between the two is so tight, you can go back and forth from one emotion to another without feeling any emotional jet-lag. And like the story, the emotions provided gets more and more intriguing and disturbing until they culminate in a tower where comedy thrones hand in hand with the psychological thriller in a bloody honeymoon, in a small town, named BrugesBruges finally put in the Belgian map, in Belgium, the country that ""Man Bites Dog"", another masterpiece of Black Comedy, put in the map too  Bruges as the crossroads of destinies, or dead-end, or both  Bruges as the town, we hate so much, we just can't live in, but can't leave it either",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Thrilling and funny at the same time,"This film is about two London hit men sent by their boss to wait for their next assignment in Bruges.I was put off by the slow beginning, as it meanders around the streets of Bruges without an apparent clear focus. This situation is completely changed once the cold blooded boss, played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes, appears. The story escalates to become a thriller, and yet it preserves comedic moments in a clever way without being silly. This is hard to achieve, but ""In Bruges"" succeeds in making thrilling scenes funny. All three leads are great, cinematography is nice and the locations are beautiful. All these elements combine together to make ""In Bruges"" an appealing film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"At first beautifully slow, then just slow, and then a bit forced...","In Bruges (2008)A quiet film about a couple of hit men hiding in Bruges, one of them loving it (played by Brendan Gleeson) and the other (Colin Farrell) bored and unappreciative. They run into trouble in several ways, mainly learning that they are not there to hide out after all, but this only turns into a kind of shoot 'em up climax that isn't what the movie's arc really intends. A couple of side characters have some effect on events, mainly a drug running love interest (Clemence Poesy) who is meant to be searing and different but comes off a bit stilted, and a dwarf in a movie being filmed there (Jordan Prentice) who is charming and a little incidental after all.What really works best is the screenplay. The writing is sharp, and the idea, offbeat within a large and well-worked genre, develops with some nice turns. Oddly, the back and forth humor between these hit men doesn't quite gel despite their good dialog, and I think it's just bad casting or bad directing, because Gleeson and Farrell sure are trying to be ironic and wry and a bit doltish. Maybe they try too hard.Or maybe it really is the direction, under Martin McDonagh, who did also help with the writing. This is McDonagh's first full fledged film (he made an earlier prescient short, ""Six Shooter,"" also starring Gleeson). The complexity of the plot isn't overwhelming, but the threads seems to coexist rather than interweave. It gets especially single-minded (and heavy handed) when the master hit-man arrives, played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes. The violence becomes a series of tricks and spectacular effects, and it's entertaining but never quite gripping or enchanting or whatever it is this strange series of events is aiming for.Bruges, which plays its own role in the film, is gorgeous, even for a hit-man, and the film was filmed there for good reason.

Delightful Tour De force,"I don't need to repeat anything about the plot line since you have already read it, or should have. In any event I found this film to be a wonderful diversion. What we soon learn is that the two hit men are completely unsuited to the job. They are complex, morally conflicted and emotional, while their employer is a cynical psychopath. Having some time off with these two in the Belgian city of Bruges during Christmas allows us to move about the old city on a sight seeing tour, punctuated with serendipitous or chaotic encounters with other people and interactions between the two leads. Along with the Christmas lights there is some violence, but it is integral to the black comedy aspect of the film. Some of the violence is quite comical.The addition of a film in production within this film adds another level. Two of the supporting characters come out of that inner film, in a certain way providing a connection between waking and dreaming. Bit parts played by people in fantastic costumes add to the magic of what might otherwise be a purely dark scene.All the characters are very carefully crafted. As another review stated this is (in part) a character study. It is also designed to be very entertaining, which it is. I enjoyed it immensely. A bit slow moving at times, but this is a European film which holds the value of the stage very high, yet it does not appear staged. It puts you right there.

"Ray, you are about the worst tourist in the whole world.","You cannot say much about this film without giving it away, and I wouldn't dare do that as it is so full of surprises that everyone should see it.It so reminded me of Crete. I spent two years there and visited all the Minoan sites. Of course, all the tourists go to Knossos, and my wife didn't mind that as it is partially reconstructed, but the other four were a real pain to her. One is way on top of a mountain that is accessible only by a one lane dirt road. All the time you are going up, you hope a bus isn't coming down. You finally get there and you see the site as it is - a 5000-year-old, unreconstructed site. In my wife's description, ""We climbed up here to see a pile of rocks!"" It is exactly how Ray (Colin Farrell) felt when sent to Bruges with his partner, Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Ken, like me, of course liked the sites. The banter between the two is priceless. Martin McDonagh not only directed a winner, he wrote some of the best dialog that I have heard in a long time. Imagine a Hugh Grant film with hit men. Well, he did one of those, didn't her, but this was far superior.And, it has Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) in a very un-Harry Potter-like role.

"Beautifully Dark and Funny, yet Intelligent","When I first saw the previews for In Bruges, I didn't really expect much. But wow, it really surprised me. I wasn't only entertained, but it actually was a really good film. This is Martin McDonagh first feature film after winning an Oscar for Best Live Action Short, a few years back.In Bruges is labeled as a ""Dark Comedy"" type of film. However, it is more dark, than comedic. (Which is a good thing) I expected something more of a regular comedy that tried to take itself top seriously by adding the crime aspects to it. It's actually more of a crime/drama type with a lot of added humor/comedic situations and it works quite well.It's shot entirely in Bruges, Belgium. The backdrop scenes are beautiful. It shows the classic, older style of architecture of Western Europe. Amazing cinematography. Cool, dark colors, set up the tone and style of the film.You know the plot, two hit men reside in Bruges after a botched job. They wait for a call from their boss to hear what to do next. Seems simple, right? Well it is, That's what I like about it. It's simple, but to the point. The writing is what carries the film. It makes everything interesting. Tremendous, witty dialogue throughout the film, which also receives recognition with an Oscar nomination.I was pleasantly surprised with Colin Farrell. He really gives a great performance and fits extremely well in to role. Earns a lot more respect with this performance. As a hit man, he is surprisingly sympathetic. Brendon Gleeson is also solid in his role. He is a tough guy with a streak of humanity. They seem to work together well. Ralph Fienees also appears in a supporting role. He shows his evil sides, but is quite funny as well. There is a variety of different, quirky characters ranging from the two hit-man, an extremely overweight family, a local love interest, to a midget in a film production. Overrall, solid performances all around.I appreciated the ""dark comedy"" and with the moral complexity of the characters' inner struggles. They're hit men, but they are oddly interesting and seem much more like us than we may think. It makes for a very satisfying film, one that is much more than just entertainment. It's an interesting film, that deserves to be looked into some time.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Psychic Isolation of Two Hit Men in Bruges,"Martin McDonagh makes an impressive writing and directing debut with the very fresh and entertaining and surprisingly well rounded film IN BRUGES. Though the basic storyline is rather simple, McDonagh knows how to keep it turning and twisting with generous amounts of humor as well as probing character development. He has assembled a cast of very fine actors, turned the cinematography of the gorgeous Belgian city of Bruges over to the capable creative hands of Eigil Bryld, and finished his project off with a fine musical score by the gifted Carter Burwell (with a nod to Schubert and others): the result is a beautiful little film with messages galore and always a visual treat to see repeatedly.Two hit men - Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a chubby, optimistic bloke who loves spending time with the sights of Bruges, and Ray (Colin Farrell), an emotionally distraught young man in the throes of guilt from a botched 'hit' that accidentally killed a young boy - have been sent by their 'boss' Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to 'lay low' after the botched murder of a priest (Ciarán Hinds). It is Christmas season and there are too few rooms available so Ken and Ray reluctantly share a tiny hotel room to await further orders from Harry. Ken falls in love with the beauty of the city of Bruges while Ray, ever anxious and distrustful, finds some solace in a film being shot about 'midgets' (Jérémie Renie) with behind the scenes girl Chloë (Clémence Poésy). How these two Irish guys make the most of their enforced isolation ultimately leads to the real reason for their assignment, a reason that includes a last 'hit' that sweeps the audience to a surprising ending.McDonagh writes very well, giving some of the best comedic lines to Farrell who proves himself a fine fit for this difficult role. Yes, it is another 'hit man film', but this one has the good fortune to deal with very real people, conflicted with their choice of 'occupation' and who are hungry to share their tenuous lives with good friends. Though there is considerable bloody derring-do, the film uses the chase and kill scenes to good advantage, allowing the audience to feel the human side of those whose job it is to 'off' others. Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are superb and their roles are enhanced by a choice selection of character actors who speed the plot along nicely. This is a very entertaining movie, one that can be appreciated on many levels, and one that suggests that Martin McDonagh has a solid future in cinema. Grady Harp",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Quirky hit-man outing,"At first, I wasn't sure what to make of this small-scale crime thriller that follows the exploits of a couple of hit men hiding out in a European city after a job gone wrong. The profane script recalls Guy Ritchie, not in a particularly good way, and the characters are difficult to warm to. The tone is quite uneven, with black comedy being the order of the day as the script sees the characters ruminating on bizarre characters and occurrences, such as when they become involved with a dwarf actor currently staying in the city. I was tempted to switch off during the first half. Then the narrative becomes to be more focused and the second half becomes a lot more entertaining. I found myself warming to both of the leads (a given with the reliable Gleeson, but a surprise as Colin Farrell isn't a favourite of mine) as their humanity becomes evident, and things build up to a thrilling, eventful climax that never disappoints.The on-screen antics are small scale but the acting strong and the pacing spot on. Ralph Fiennes contributes an extended cameo as the duo's violent employee and uses it as a showcase for some over-the-top ranting and humorous scenes. I enjoyed the sense of darkness that pervaded the film, particularly as the ending grows near, and while it's not a favourite, I did find this a solidly enjoyable outing that's more original than most.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

ringing the Belgium,"Prior to seeing Martin McDonagh's ""In Bruges"", I had heard that it was a straightforward comedy. It turned out that while the movie starts out comedic, it gets more serious as it progresses. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson play hit men Ray and Ken, respectively. After Ray accidentally kills a boy, head honcho Harry (Ralph Fiennes) sends Ray and Ken to Bruges, Belgium. This is the sort of city that by rights should attract just about every tourist; certainly Ken spends as much time as possible sightseeing. Ray, however, can't get over his previous actions, and his short temper gets him into trouble everywhere.Two wrenches get thrown into the works when Ray strikes up a relationship with local drug dealer Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and Harry orders Ken to kill Ray. The events resulting from the second part really set the movie on its more serious course.I guess that the movie disappointed me a little in that it turned out not to be the comedy that I expected. But for the most part I liked how it posed the question of what is right in such a convoluted situation and lets the audience decide for themselves (sort of like what ""No Country for Old Men"" does). Worth seeing, if not the best movie. And if I may say so, Jimmy's (Jordan Prentice) description of the race war sounded like what Charles Manson envisioned.Also starring Elizabeth Berrington, Anna Madeley, Thekla Reuten, Ciaran Hinds, Rudy Blomme, Mark Donovan, Ann Elsley and Jean-Marc Favorin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A few (few) jokes, and some strange characters do not make a comedy.This film is about suicide, death, killing of innocent children, guilt and hopelessness. Just what people find funny about this eludes me.The ""un-PC"" dialog seemed forced and unfunny.Regarding the thriller/drama/crime aspect, I was never engaged with the characters and every plot twist could be seen 20 minutes before hand.I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed with a film.As a straight drama/thriller, the film put me to sleep.

You can't sell horse tranquilisers to a midget...,"Brilliant observational comedy juxtaposed with profound violent tragedy, the director plays postmodern pinball with your emotion.

Symetrical Yet Unbalanced (but in a good way),"Ray, Ray, Ray! We can't help but be captured by his goofiness. His petulance! His pique. He is like a bad puppy. He is what happens when potential and opportunity do NOT cross paths. We are given no real background on any of the characters, only this slice of their lives,but sophistication isn't required here. We see the essence of wastrelism in Ray. The inevitable Greek tragedy of Ken, Ken who should (and does!) know better. In Harry we see the kind of principled villainy that is wierdly common i.e. the bank robber who would never steal a car or say, the rapist who would never stiff a waitress for a tip. Ken and Ray, a fine pair of Irishmen, work for a good fellow named Harry. Ken is the greater tragedy of this comi-tragic and even occasionally sublime duo. This movie speaks of basic humanity in some pretty base humans. There are lines even drunken little people should not cross. Even medieval tower docents can go too far. Elephants do not belong in towers and pompous Canadians do get their beaks bent occasionally. Hookers it turns out may be found in brothels. How bizarre but strangely real this film is. Unfortunately, as seems to be the case in reality, the innocent victims are incidental because the guilty ones are so much more interesting. The real question asked by great film is ""who are we?"" This Movie asks us again from a fresh perspective.Colin Farrell finally cast well! Fine acting throughout. 9.5 out of ten for pacing. A modern masterwork; Near poetic.

Redemption and Regret,"The trailer for this film would suggest fair like 2007's Shoot 'Em blood bath with a bit dark sense of humor. Instead, this film is totally different. No fast killing starts off this film, but a bit of profanity and a strangely tortured main character named Ray, who is supposedly a hit man. Things do not become crystal clear until about midway and then things take off crescendos to a slam-bang finish full of blood, but that is not what makes the film. What makes the film is its bitingly sharp sense of black humor where characters are mean to those around them trying to get away from their own problems. I never thought I would come away impressed by a Colin Farrell film, but this film made me immensely mirthful and laugh hard than I have for a while over this winter season of films.

Wonderfully crafted film in all respects.,"Some films you can watch over and over again but just because you wouldn't watch a film twice doesn't mean its rubbish. This is the case with in Bruges.For a film that uses the word 'f*ck' and its derivatives 126 times that's an average of 1.18 'f*cks' per minute. You really wouldn't notice, as they are lost in the fantastic dialogue.In Bruges is a wonderfully crafted film in all respects. Martin McDonagh wrote and directed the film and brings out the best in the two Irish leads Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Ken. Ken and Ray are two hit men sent to Bruge by their boss play by Ralph Fiennes after a job goes wrong all of which are amusingly characterised and portrayed realistically.The film oozes atmosphere and I wouldn't want to spoil the story but it is both touching and funny. As with any kind of successful dark comedy there is an array of quirky characters including a dwarf, a one-eyed boyfriend, pregnant hotel lady, gun seller and a drug trafficker. All the actors' performances are a joy and overall it is a piece of excellent executed movie making with some great moments.I'd recommend this film to anyone that wants to see something original.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

They didn't know how to end it,"In Bruges successfully blends comedy, drama and some action with very powerful performances by Colin Farrel, Ralph Fiennes and, most of all, Brendan Gleeson. Most interestingly, In Bruges appears common and accessible at times, but when everything seems predictable, we are thrown a curve-ball that gives the movie a certain edge and an ever present blanket of dark comedy that permeates all characters, most especially Ray, played by Colin F. Bruges, a medieval city in Belgium, is presented to us as a blend of old and new. Its locals and its buildings set the background, while the characters upfront stand out like sore thumbs within a ""fairy tale"" place as it is often described. Hidden within the comedy is a very dramatic script that deals with feelings of regret, suicide, murder and love but that never seems burdensome or hard to watch. Especially important to the development of the story is the character of Brendan Gleeson who has come to Bruges not knowing it will be a crucial moment in his life, a setting that will allow him to reevaluate his values and make decisions that go against all that he has done in the past. Ken seeks for redemption, even when he knows he is already condemned and we see the interesting transformation on the screen.Despite its crafty mix of comedy and drama, In Bruges falls short as it delivers an ending that over-relies in unnecessary action and unsubstantial dialogue. It is the typical case of a story that needs to end but does not know how. There is no better example of this that the final scene and the predictable cyclical ending we are given.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I love how this movie now seems like an offensive film on many levels. The terms said and things shown in this movie can be very politically incorrect.
What I liked about the movie is that even the unnecessary scenes in this movie are delightful. The story itself is very clever and the way it's told is clever as well. The morality involved in this movie is quite challenging and influencing. Even the lowest of the low have standards in their ethics. This can be seen in many significant moments of the movie.
I loved the brutally real comedy in the movie. it's not that it is meant to be a comedy, but it is funny. Just how life itself is. Loyalty is the other great element in this movie and somehow I feel is the same as the standards.

"A dark film imbued with much humour, pathos and humanity. Excellent!","Hit men Ray and Ken have been told to lay low and await orders in Bruges, a city in Belgium, after a job gone wrong. While Ken is happy to relax and sightsee, Ray could not be unhappier. Of course, aside from the fact that Ray does not care for the cultural offerings of their surroundings, he is also dealing with past wrongdoings that play heavily on his conscience.While this may sound like the makings of a dour story (not that there's anything wrong with dour stories; I love them), I do not think any film has made me sad and then laugh in immediate succession without devolving into parody. This movie may be the only one that has, and does so more than once. Indeed, I sometimes laughed whilst I was sad, and rather than the integrity of the scene being ruined, I was confounded; should I be laughing or crying? I say ""without devolving into parody"" because some films unintentionally make light of the more downbeat moments, thus detracting from them. In Bruges does not fall into this trap. Yes, the film can be classified as a black comedy and yes, much of the (often very dark) humour is amongst the funniest I've come across in my time watching films. However, the more serious portions of the film, which mostly deal with Ray's struggle with his guilt, are truly sincere and heartfelt.Colin Farrell gives a truly great performance. He makes it easy to sympathise with Ray; you really feel sorry for him. It seems to me that Farrell generally is not given the respect he deserves as an actor. This maybe more a reflection of the roles he chooses rather than his ability. If you don't like Colin Farrell, watch In Bruges and maybe you'll change your mind.Brendan Gleeson, as always, is excellent as the older Ken. Ken may be a hit-man but it's hard to believe due to his warm, amiable and gentle nature. At the same time, Gleeson also manages to bring a certain gravity to the role; notwithstanding his trade, Ken could very well be a role model for a young man, at least in terms of his mannerisms. Ken is like a father figure to Ray; he genuinely cares for Ray's wellbeing.The foul-mouthed character of Harry- Ray's and Ken's boss- is played by, well, I won't say; if you do not know already, it's better to find out when you watch the film. Perhaps you'll be surprised. Even though we only hear Harry over the phone for the first half or more of the film, he exudes a strong presence.None of the main characters (I refer to Ray, Ken and Harry) are truly despicable; yes, they've committed evil deeds and are deeply flawed, however, they all have their principles (many of them actually honourable) and stick to them. This instils respect in one's heart for the characters, if not unreserved love (but how can you not love Ken?).The film also looks very good. The night-time scenes in particular stand out, especially the ones with fog. You might say ""it's like a fairy-tale or something"".Last but not least is the dark and pensive score by Carter Burwell, which exemplifies the themes of guilt and redemption and really underscores Ray's anguish. Burwell is fast becoming one of my favourite composers.In Bruges is a dark film imbued with much humour, pathos and humanity. It succeeds because of its characters. It is one of my favourite films, and I hope you feel the same after watching it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
British Humor,"For those of us who try to avoid Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie's Hollywood pop corn & explosion mega-movies, well this was tempting.An European movie shot in Europe with a good old James Bond flavor.We barely have British movies where we live, and to tell the truth we didn't know they have a film industry that would not just take the state subsidies and play in a Festival to resume the usual non-Hollywood movie lifetime.Well known actors hiding in the city of Bruges, playing hit men on the lurk , waiting for directions, arguing each other and the ubiquitous romance with a local cute girl.Farrell's is acting of Real life Farrell and thats a role that suits him at his best.It was such a surprise that the comedy is dark , very dark, and not what we use to see these days , what it lacks is a good argument.A little more reflecting the euro life would've been a bonus, we don't have the chance of seeing much socialist Europe with an overvalued currency , excellent health care system and that.

Even criminals have hearts.,"A rather ironic film mixing crime with morals. The first half is rather slow that you start wondering what the fuss is all about but the last twenty-something minutes is a really rewarding finish to this quite thought-provoking film. Colin Farrell plays a hit-man who is bothered by guilt because of the serious fuckup he commits on his first assignment. He is sent to Bruges together with a colleague to initially lie low for a while. As the plot unfolds and the real reason why they are in Bruges is uncovered, the story thickens as the audience begins to sympathize with the unusual leads. This film presents the much debated upon idea that no one is either purely good or just downright evil. It proves in very unlikely ways that even criminals have hearts and even the worst kind of people can be honorable.

In Bruges is one of those few movies which appears beyond everyones expectations and in my opinion can easily be called a modern Cinema masterpiece.This Drama-comedy movie, made in 2008, narrates the story of two Irish contract killers, which after a tragic accident in a mission, are asked by their boss to go Bruges and spend two weeks there until they receive the next orders.The 37 years old director and scriptwriter, Martin McDonough, casted Collin Farrell (Alexander & Phone boot) as the main character of the movie, And Brandon Gleeson (Troy & Braveheart) as Farrell's supporting character. Farrells acting was called his ""his A-game"" by the Guardian and brought him the best leading Actor award at the 66th Golden Globe awards.Almost everything about this movie is well planned. Combination of the Drama and Dark comedy and a wonderful script, with a great theme music and amazing acting by the entire cast alongside the beautiful views of the city Bruges, makes this movie more and more interesting, every second.The movie wasn't able to achieve a good box-office success back in 2008, but it was given a positive review by critics and was highly appreciated by the audience.The entire movie was a new and special experience for me and personally the last lines of the script were really touching and affected me like a ""Knock-out punch"".

Sad hired killers go into hiding but are found(or something like that),"Once again after reading the reviews I decided to watch this British ""comedy"" but was left feeling depressed and verbally assaulted. Absolutely no imagination went into this movie nor did any notion of comedy that I am familiar with.The movie is incredibly offensive and thinks it's being funny, people walked out of the cinema it was that bad.Sometimes it really makes me wonder what the movie reviewers are thinking when they write these praise filled reviews.

'In Bruges',"'In Bruges' is the directorial debut of Irish director Martin McDonagh who has recently become known for 'dramadies' such as 'Seven Psychopaths' and 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.'McDonagh has written and directed a brilliant film, balancing tonal extremes masterfully. It contains hilarious comedy, dark, emotional moments and graphic violence, yet none ever feels out of place. All these elements are balanced with skill.The hitmen portryed by Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleason are developed subtly as the story progresses. Ralph Fiennes also delivers a fiercely profane, hilariously entertaining performance as their uncompromising boss.The setting of 'Bruges' is used by McDonagh with precision, introducing its aspects subtly throughout the script with later payoffs, such as the tower and canal. By the time the climactic action takes place, we already know the town of 'Bruges' and its basic geography as well as the characters.Similarly to McDonagh's other films, he does not shy away from extremities in the script. Characters say things which you would not usually hear in a film, making them feel more realistic, and also hilarious, although definitely not to everyone. I definitely found it extremely funny, with smarter comedy than most actual straight 'comedy' films that are released currently.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
In Bruges,"It was six months back when I went to Bruge and it fascinated me by its beauty  lovely place. On BBC, when I saw the discussion of this new movie  In Bruges, I found it interesting. I saw the trailers, and that too appealed me  as is based on an interesting premise.Two hit men  elderly Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and young Ray (Collin Farrell)  are ordered to hide in Bruges by their Boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), because Ray along with a priest, by mistake killed a young boy  and other gangs are behind them to seek revenge. The only way the thing can be resolved is to kill Ray. Harry asks Ken to kill Ray, who is suicidally depressed. Ken wants to give Ray another chance. Harry gets angry and comes to Bruges. The final show-down results in lots of gun-shots, blood and death of most of the protagonist.This is a dark comedy thriller movie. Writer-Director Martin McDonagh, who had won an Oscar for a short film  Six Shooter in 2004, comes back with this wonderful movie. He has this uncanny style of narrative- where he infuses dark comedy and racism slurs  with penache. And the style is felt in every frame of this movie. Even in the darkest and grimmest scene  Martin manages to keep audience gay  with the dialogue and style. The writing / story / screenplay are the kings, and Martin takes out brilliant performances from his perfecting casting.Brendan as Key, masterly enacts this role of loyal hit-man and a compassionate friend. Collin Farrel is just outstanding in his role of this innocent, eccentric, dry humored & silly guy  who is also a cold blooded murderer, with a conscious. Ralph Fiennes  since Shakespeare in Love, has grown in stature and maturity in his characterization of roles.The musical score is Carter Burwell and cinematography of Bruges by Eigil Bryld are excellent.There are also other characters in the film, who are real to the groove and have given top class performances.Though comparable with Tarantino dark humor and style, I think Martin has his own genre of telling the story. I hope he continues giving us such lovely and enjoyable gems.Those audience, who do not like talkative movies or movies that show blood in cold shots  stay away from it. Others, go and enjoy this wonderful flick.Just a trivia, I went to see this movie with my work colleague Claudia Misch, and met other two colleagues - Lena and Guido. All four sat together and enjoyed seeing this movie.(Stars 7.25 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Refreshing Dark Comedy,"Whilst the start of the film is somewhat slow and unconvincing, this sets the tone for the rest of the film, and a great tone at that. Collin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson have great chemistry as the two hitman friends, whilst Ralf Fiennes is exceptional in his role as the psychopathic boss. The funny moments are set up by earlier comments, and the ridiculous moments almost seem plausible thanks to the consistent alt-reality tone of the film and the great work of Collin Farrell and Ralf Fiennes to support this. The script is unapologetic in its potential for offense but well crafted and with great hidden meaning in the metaphors of purgatory etc. Overall this is a fun and relatively original film, well worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great comedy action!,I had actually never heard of this movie before watching it for the first time the other night and let me start off by saying I was very pleasantly surprised. The acting was great Ferrel did an excellent job. And the way they mixed the comedy with an intense story I just loved it. The humor was actually really funny too.After hit-man Ray kills the wrong person during a hit his boss sends him to bruge to lay low and ease off some of the guilt of killing the innocent person.This movie was really good. It was a fresh interesting idea and it was hilarious and at the same time it was really brutal.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Just like French fries, this noir is all Belgium","OK, perhaps not a noir per-se, even if it definitely has the style and the attitude. Not Hollywood made, for instance, but with a sense of black comedy and caustic wit worthy of standing amongst that genre. This is all thanks to writer/director Martin McDonagh's experience as a playwright and his uncanny ability to mix comedy and tragedy--the bipolar canvass on which all theatre is built--with a boldness that is not concerned with coming off a bit strange.This is a fact that few filmmakers understand. Cinema is not meant to replicate reality, nor it has any responsibility to rationalize its characters' thoughts, actions and personalities. If it's effective at whatever it aims to do, then it's a success. The end justifies the means; in fact, sometimes the means themselves are part of the end. It's definitely the case here. To give you a debrief, ""In Bruges"" finds its two stars lying low in the titular town after committing murder for money. One of them, Ray (Colin Farrell) would rather be anywhere but there, while his more senior partner Ken (Brendan Gleeson) visually eats up a tourist card and proclaims that Bruges is the most well preserved medieval city in the world. From here, the plot revolves in an ineffable, but palpable manner. There is no surrealism, avant-garde or any other form of the abstract--this movie keeps it real.To return to the ""means and ends"" metaphor, here the means represent the way in which the plot unfolds, and the ends is all about execution. It's not about what the characters do, but how they do it. I will not describe anything as this is something you must experience yourself, but know that the plot manifests in a brutalist manner, its characters driven by logical arguments and principles even if that means destroying themselves. The movie is also not polished, an approach which serves its impactful style and cheeky Irish attitude. While there are no bad performances, Colin Farrell's portrayal of the disturbed Ray, whose conscience is burdened by a collateral victim he shot dead, is--like this movie--juggling between funny and tragic in a seamless manner. He never felt more at home.McDonagh's tribute to the world of theatre that made him is clear here. While there is plenty of action, this movie is at its most fascinating in the way in which the characters verbally combat each other. I'm not saying that this movie could be a theatre play, but there is an underlying sense of inner turmoil in Ray, not to mention an artistically ambitious flamboyance in Farrell's--and the entire cast's--performances. Among them is a beautiful girl, a ""racist gnome"" and an anger-driven villain out for blood. Curtains, please!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Super Funny, Well-Paced, and a Lot Deeper than Expected","I was looking forward to seeing this movie. The plot sounded really funny, and I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint.In Bruges has an interesting plot. Two hit men are sent to await orders in the city of Bruge after killing their last target. The only thing is that Ray, the main character, hates Bruge. It goes deeper than that, but I don't want to spoil anything. The plot is good and thankfully Martin McDonagh knew what to do with it.The characters end up being one of the major driving forces of the movie. Ray himself goes a lot deeper than expected. Despite this, the movie never takes itself too seriously. Ray's always got something to whine about, and it's great fun to watch. The other characters are good too, but Ray especially.As mentioned above, the movie is very funny. It's a comedy though, so you'd hope so. But the jokes, while random and weird, still make sense in the context (for the most part). They aren't just random noises or phrases, they actually fit, which is nice.The movie is paced quite well too. Despite pulling off a 107 run time, not a whole lot happened thinking back on it. But it never felt rushed or too slow.Overall In Bruges is great fun, while still managing to stand as a great film. It's funny with great characters, a great plot, and great pacing. It's all around just a great movie. I'd recommend this movie to basically anyone, so long as you have a good (and a little dark) sense of humor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A fantastic first film in the ""McDonagh trilogy.""","It's interesting to see Martin McDonagh's first film with the hindsight of his two other movies. While I missed In Bruges (2008) back when it came out, I have recently enjoyed Seven Psychopaths (2012) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). Having now seen all three of McDonagh's films, I see the themes and motifs he uses throughout his directing. I already had hints of these common elements; it's just that seeing In Bruges for the first time has cemented them. From using short people to drug use to some uncomfortable violence, McDonagh has a style all his own, and it clearly shows in his breakout film.I think what draws me to McDonagh's films is his expert use of multiple ""Chekov's Guns"" as well as tying all these various foreshadowings together in a satisfying way. Whether it's a fat American, spare change, or the untimely death of a child, each part of In Bruges was included for a purpose that becomes evident in some truly genius twists along the way. Some may say that the ambiguity of the endings of his movies is frustrating, but I almost like the open-ended conclusions that seem to say ""and life goes on.""While I did enjoy In Bruges, it still had some areas where McDonagh eventually improved through his continued filmmaking. Even though they spoke English, half the time, I couldn't understand what was being said by the actors. This almost caused me to turn on closed captions for some semblance of ""subtitles."" Other than that, the dark comedy helped to balance the deeply dramatic plot as it centered around death in its many forms. I was already a fan of McDonagh's films, but In Bruges helps to confirm that the McDonagh trilogy is one of the best pieces of filmmaking to happen in the last decade.A fantastic first film in the ""McDonagh trilogy,"" I give In Bruges 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An unusual experience with extreme pleasure and radical boredom,"""In Bruges"" is a rather unusual genre mix with many funny moments but also a couple of lengths and a more or less convincing story line. The movie mixes many comedy elements with romantic bits and pieces, a suspenseful background story, some cultural elements and a little bit of action.Sometimes, this mix gets a little bit odd. At some points, this movie is more like a tourist guide through Bruges and therefor a weird kind of documentary rather than a film with a coherent development.But the true problem lies elsewhere. The characters are so diversified that they simply aren't authentic anymore in my humble opinion. The funny guy in love suddenly is the calm and suicidal victim. The pitiless and very emotional boss suddenly becomes the consequent killer that discusses about the morality of life and death. The old and very rational killer is suddenly let by strong emotions and risks his whole existence. The sadly inevitable love story of this flick is also overused and not authentic at all.Next to these complex and strange characters, there are many stereotypical persons that appear in this movie that might make you laugh at first sight but that get quite redundant after a while, for example the dwarf or the gunrunner. This contrast is what makes this movie quite entertaining and surprising on one side but also rather odd and torn apart on the negative side. I can understand people that would rate this movie under five points and people that would give it a top rating, the whole thing heavily depends on your personal taste. If you're open-minded and just want to live a strange odyssey, the chances are good that you might at least appreciate this somehow experimental film but if you're looking for something coherent, gripping and more traditional in terms of suspense or comedy flick, you should watch a detailed trailer before you get your hands on a copy of this.The strongest point of this feature is definitely the dirty humour. I know many people that actually adore Bruges. I have been there and must admit that even though I'm pretty much interested in arts and history, this town is pretty boring and almost appeared as a sleepy ghost town to me filled with tourists and their guides and a couple of old people. That's why I can really laugh about the stereotypical descriptions of that city and the extreme discussions about its strong and weak points. These discussions and the slapstick elements in many unpredictable situations were my favourite parts in the film.I disliked the character development, basically the whole plot and the lack of true suspense after all. There were only episodes, bits and pieces of the movie that I appreciated while there were also many unnecessary lengths. Sometimes, I was extremely bored, then suddenly extremely addicted to this movie. In the end, this feature was worth to be watched and gets some credit for its experimental originality. This is something different from anything I have seen before. It's not always different in good terms but it was refreshing but also exhausting to discover something that unusual. I would though watch it again as this flick has the potential to become a cult movie and might also grow on me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Assassins Decreed.,"""Three Billboards"", I thought it might be a good idea to look at the rest of Martin McDonagh's relatively short filmography and give that my appraisal. First up was a revisit to his debut feature ""In Bruges"" which I'd seen before and thought fondly about.Two assassins, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) head to Bruges to lie low after one of Ray's jobs goes catastrophically wrong. Though the cities medieval charm appeals to the older Ken, Ray is desperately bored, and the place is not the required distraction from the failure that he desperately needs. The pair await instructions from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) about what to do next, but when the orders come, Ken is unsure how to proceed.Despite being quite prodigiously and hilariously offensive, I still enjoyed ""In Bruges"". I wasn't immediate convinced by Farrell but, when he settled into the heart and the pain of his character, he's doing some of his best work ever. In fact, all the performances are really good, Gleeson and Fiennes are pretty much incapable of being bad and, despite smaller roles, Jordan Prentice and Clemence Poesey are memorable too.Though I found ""The Banshees"" funny also, I do think that ""In Bruges"" was a funnier effort, probably more conventionally amusing too. Despite its darker moments. ""In Bruges"" has a more complete story that ""Banshees"" does too and, though I liked the interpretive work in that film, the story is what draws me most to any film.I don't think I'll need to see it again for at least another ten years, but of the three McDonagh films I've seen so far, ""In Bruges"" is the most accomplished.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
good humor and location,"The movie is mainly a black comedy, quite British, has very witty dialogs to and fro and a few twists as well. Set in the wonderfully preserved Medioeval city of Bruges it's also an intriguing mix, well executed, of situational humor and existential dread, and gets also to balance light and dark. ""In Bruges"" is undoubtedly clever, as well as properly acted and written (I had the impression it didn't quite know how to end after its best scene, more or less in the middle of the movie). In my opinion it's certainly to recommend for this look into how criminals' personal codes of honor and ethics get in the way of their jobs. Plus its original location adds surely something more to the story, although this peculiar genre has already been populated with other good examples of funny and storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It's in Belgium.,"Now I've heard of In Bruges when I was a teenager and I also heard about how offensive it is with it's jokes and such. But on the other hand this is a dark comedy thriller like it's supposed to and it stars some good cast with Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes which both in the Harry Potter films apart from Colin Farrell. All right, let's get on with it. Two Irish hitmen, Ray and Ken played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, have been sent to hide in Bruges after a failed assassination attempt in London by their employer Harry played by Ralph Fiennes. Ray thinks Bruges is a s**thole. In church he shoots a priest during confession, but accidentally kills a little boy. He saw that they're shooting movie in Bruges with a dwarf actor in it. He's attracted to Chloë which he takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple (mistaking them for Americans) and ends up knocking them unconscious. Chloë takes Ray to her apartment but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray takes the gun of Eirik and shoots him in the eye blinding him. Now as a dark comedy I'm aware that there are some jokes in this are offensive involving dwarfs and black people. Speaking of dwarfs, Ray mentioned Hervé Villechaize from The Man with the Golden Gun. I have to admit that years ago I watched the ending on Film4 channel. Now for the movie itself I really enjoyed it. It's darkly comical, it's well scripted, well acted and well put by Martin McDonagh. Well, I'll tell you something. If you never heard of Bruges before or don't know what that term is, well, take Hercule Poirot for example. It's in Belgium.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I'm Bruised (2008),"This is a thinly-disguised rip-off of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Instead of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as the hit-men, we have Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. In Pulp Fiction, John Travolta's character was just back from Amsterdam; here Farrell and Gleason are just over the Dutch border in Bruges, Belgium. Like Jackson and Travolta, Farrell and Gleason spend most of their time arguing about trivial things. There is also drug-taking as in Tarantino's movie, but this film is non-league compared to Pulp Fiction's Premiership status.As in Pulp Fiction, the hit-men work for a scary Mr. Big character, here played by Ralph Fiennes (in one of his worst performances) instead of Ving Rhames. Fiennes has clearly seen Ben Kingsley's performance in ""Sexy Beast"" and he's tried to pitch his performance at the same hysterical level. The difference is that Kingsley had some terrific dialogue to say in his film, where Fiennes just screams the F-word so often here that you just wish he'd shut up after a while. Fiennes also seems to be doing a Peter Cook impression, using the same nasal, whiny intonations of the late comic genius. He's terrible in it, but the script has to take some of the blame for that too.If you like making fun of midgets, as the writer of this film seems to, then this movie is for you. The so-called ""jokes"" about little people aren't funny and they become repetitive and offensive after a while. If midgets were the funniest subject in the world, then this movie would be the best comedy of all time, but they're not and it isn't. It's a failed stab at humour that's poorly executed.The script was written by a playwright and, like a play, it's all talk and no action. Every second word is the F-word in a desperate bid at humour; you become numb to it after a while. Ralph Fiennes shows up at the end to try and liven things up, but by then it's too late to care. This is an overrated mess of a movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Still McDonagh's best.,"After loving The Banshees of Inisherin, I felt compelled to revisit In Bruges. Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are hitmen... in Bruges. They've come from their last hit in London and are waiting on a call from the boss. They're chalk and cheese. Ken is a culture vulture, embracing the city. I'm with Ken. Ray isn't, he's the essence of a miserable teenager. Pissing of Canadian tourists and sulking. It's a comedy, but there's tragedy at its core. Inevitable I guess when there's profit based murder going on. They're supposed to be lying low, but Ray is the excitable type. He's also got a lot on his mind. Things he regrets doing and now with time on his hands, he's chance to reflect... and he's struggling. Until he meets Chloe (Clémence Poséy). She shares his dark humour, even after he nailed two annoying Canadian tourists on their first date. While Ray is out finally enjoying Bruges. Ken takes a call from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), which has to be one of the most wince inducing calls in cinema and that's before Harry delivers news of Ken's next hit. Bruges is a beautiful city and the camera makes the most of it. It's a lovely setting for what becomes an increasingly bonkers and difficult story. Ken finds himself in an unenviable position, but this is far from a simple story. It unfolds delightfully and despite having seen this before, it's no less enjoyable. I'm a bit indifferent about Farrell. He does well here... but not as well as Gleeson and Fiennes, who are both magnificent. Martin McDonagh's roll call is pretty damn impressive. I'm not sure I could pick a favourite. Three Billboards, Banshees, Psychopaths. In Bruges though, I think may still just take the top spot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The actors all do a great job, the pacing of the film is superb and the soundtrack captures the tone and setting excellently - I honestly can't recall the last time I commented positively on a soundtrack!However, the ending is both predictable and illogical - given the inconsistencies in damage - which really led me to reducing a stellar 8-star film to a 7.

"Enjoyable and funny but never loosing focus in both its narrative and study, In Bruges hits most marks rather impressively.","What a neat, compact and thoroughly entertaining little package In Bruges actually is - a film that never takes itself too seriously, but will have you feeling some sort of slap of emotion if you've gone with it by the time the finale has arrived. The film is an extremely black comic piece, relying on jokes and humour that targets specific ethnicities and 'types' of people but at the same time includes the necessary substance through slyly introducing events and flashbacks, confirming why certain characters carry certain hate ridden and confused opinions on their surroundings. The film is encouraging in another sense; a British director running on British fuelled money directing a debut piece he also wrote and quite clearly using other British co-writers/directors from recent times as a source of inspiration.The sources for this inspiration range from Guy Ritichie to Simon Pegg with an essence of Jonathan Glazer's 2000 gangster outing Sexy Beast thrown in for good measure and it all pulls through rather nicely. Interestingly, fellow writer/director Martin McDonagh pays tribute, not necessarily directly to these people but certainly acknowledges he's updating and referencing, very early on when one of the lead characters stumbles across a film set. Here, he meets a young Belgian female production assistant and she exclaims that 'what we're doing here is an homage; a pastiche is too strong-a word for the project'. The lead's confused reaction might well be the same for some audience members but the girl has nailed it and McDonagh has nailed it in his own screenplay.It is a homage; maybe pastiche IS too strong-a word but it is poignant this exchange happens on a film set. McDonagh has cleverly brandished his two leads Irish, making it particularly difficult to label them British gangsters of sorts but you know exactly where he's coming from. In Bruges sees two Irish hit men hiding out in the Belgian city of Bruges following a botched job. Their orders are to wait for a phone call from English mafia boss Harry (Fiennes) as he assesses the situation but Harry has a dilemma and when he does call, his intentions are far more menacing. But that would be spoiling the fun. The two leads are Ken (Gleeson) and Ray (Farrell) and their initial time spent there has the film crack its best jokes that are particularly un-PC but also sees the script establish several complex emotional pieces of substance to back up the content. It appears Ray is having a bit of a break down and thus resorts to verbal insults and discrimination as well as adopting a relatively childlike persona, best highlighted at his glee at the sight of dwarfs, beer and his bemoaning at the sights of historical buildings.Since we do not get to know Ray prior to his 'tragedy', we cannot compare mentalities before/after. Ken seems to have known Ray for a certain amount of time and acts as a foil to Ray once all the bickering in Bruges begins. The important thing here is that Ken actually replies to Ray's bickering so all the complaining and un-PC comments Ray says in Belgium probably does not reflect the kind of person he really is. If he'd been like this even 'before' the event, perhaps Ken would've got sick of always snapping back and might've let Ray just get on with it. If Ray is an assassin, we expect a certain degree of professionalism from him but what we get is a spoilt child performance conflicting archetypes. He is, indeed, referred to as 'the boy' by characters later on.Ray's badgering sees him insult the Belgians, fat people, autistic people and dwarfs but this sort of neurotic behaviour is confirmed when it becomes apparent Ray's suffering an identity crisis and is branching off into a mindset of guilt and suicidal ideation, hence his too sharp-a tongue and insults. For a long time, we share Ken's viewpoint. We are disgusted at Ray's dialogue and we get to hear first hand of the revelation Harry calls up with. But the perspective begins to shift quite brilliantly when things become apparent and emotion comes to the forefront.Ralph Fiennes' Harry Waters is introduced brilliantly. He carries a Don Logan persona about him and the same air of menace with the constant badgering and talk of things seemingly innocent and random, only off screen down a telephone. Our first actual look at him in his England home whilst on the phone is a really tasty piece of editing. McDonagh's fast, wise talking gangsters are indebted to Guy Ritchie and his branching off into a fast paced action film that actually has its characters acknowledge the finale is nearing and that ""this is the shootout"" nearer the end is more a link to Hot Fuzz than anything else. Again, the film set location within the film pops up at the end and it's no coincidence this is where the fatal blows are played out.While nobody weeps for the priest Ray killed on the job in the flashback and the fact Harry has young kids of his own which is quite alarming, the film is brutally entertaining and shot in cold, bleak and distant colours commending the psychological feelings Ray goes through. The film begins in a jovial and juvenile manner but we're hit with a brick that knocks both us and the film into focus rather than off course, which is very refreshing for a change. Fast; witty and quite humbling at times, In Bruges is a winner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Cheap Trick to Sell Stale Dialogue,"""In Bruges"" has two things going for it: a tender, poignant performance by Colin Farrell, and Bruges itself, a city most of us don't pay much attention to. Other than that, the film is derivative and almost empty  I say ""almost"" because it does have some content, and that content is vile.Colin Farrell used to be the next big thing, but that hasn't panned out, and he's made a lot of small, independent films like this one. I hope his next movie offers him a script worthy of the acting talent he reveals here.Bruges is a city in Belgium with lots of extant medieval structures and museums dedicated to medieval masters like Jan van Eyck and Hieronymus Bosch. ""In Bruges"" just shovels Bruges on the screen; no art is exercised. There's no special lighting or setting or marrying of the film's themes or dialogue to unforgettable images of Bruges, its structures, paintings, or swans. ""In Bruges"" doesn't do for Bruges what a Woody Allen film does for Manhattan or any number of movies do for Paris.Outside of Farrell's performance and the city itself, ""In Bruges"" is a rip-off of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Sexy Beast."" Rather than John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as talkative hit men, you get Farrell and Gleeson. Rather than Ben Kingsley in a contrary-to-type role as a vicious crime lord, you get Ralph Fiennes in a contrary-to-type role as a vicious crime lord. Fiennes is surprisingly uninteresting and not at all scary here.For the most part, you get Gleeson and Farrell strolling around Bruges, trading low key, banal observations: Americans are fat, racist, and kill John Lennon and Vietnamese, beer is good, medieval art is deep. These observations are larded with the F word. So effing beer is effing good and effing medieval art effing is effing deep and effing Americans effing are effing fat effing. Oh, and since Gleeson and Farrell are Irish, and Irish people are inherently cuter and more interesting than anyone else on the planet (this movie thinks) their banal, F-work larded comments are all the more valuable.And, of course, every twenty minutes or so the screen is spattered with blood as another character dies.You get the idea.Here's the thing  the director and script writer, the inherently cute and smart (because Irish) Martin McDonagh, doesn't know anything at all about crime or hit men or how bodies react to bullets. McDonagh doesn't even know the make of the guns he shows on screen.But McDonagh knows that he'd never be able to sell a movie about two Irish accountants, say, or two Irish sanitation workers, or two Irish school teachers, strolling around a poorly lit (because this is a low budget movie) Bruges trading banal observations about how effing wonderful effing beer effing is, so he makes his characters hit men, and, voila, suddenly everything they say is ultra fascinating, or funny, or profound, in a way that it would not be had they been common working slobs.This could be called the Big-Mac-in-France trick. In ""Pulp Fiction,"" two hit men discuss the naming of fast food hamburgers. It's an incredibly banal conversation. The only reason the movie's largely teen male fans love the scene is because they believe the men having the conversation not to be John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, but two hit men, and hit men, teen boys think, are glamorous and inherently interesting, and so their comments about Big Macs warrant careful attention.Putting banal, shallow dialogue into the mouth of an imaginary hit man who bares no relation to real life hit men in an effort to make his dialogue sound profound has got to be the cheapest trick in the book. Arthur Miller managed to make Willy Loman, a traveling salesman, the most fascinating character in the world  through Miller's brilliant writing. A great, or even competent writer, doesn't have to make his character a hit-man to make his words matter.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A dark comedy with a heart,"Martin Mcdoanagh is a perfect example of how to write bad people who are good.
Ray is not a good person he is rude, vulgar, miserable and to top it off a hitman. However, as the film goes on it pulls us in and shows what a broken a thoughtful man Ray really is.
Performance wise this movie is incredibly strong Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleeson are perfect as a comedic duo they play off of each other wonderfully and the banter between the two feels genuine. Also to accompany that is the more serious talks between the two. Ray's confessions to Ken are truly sad and have a lot of weight to them. Ray's relationship with Chloe also has those nice relaxing sit down moments which help to evolve these characters and create a bond between them as they slowly fall in love. These moments carry this story from what could be a generic buddy comedy film to a deep character drama with a comedic kick.
The star of the show to me is Ralph Fiennes' character-Harry. He is an angry, short tempered man with rules and his motives as the antagonist are completely understandable from start to finish. He is a man who sticks to his principles right to the end and you have to respect him for that. He is not just a cold blooded killer( all the time).
Another great feature of this film is the minor characters and their quirks. The  dwarf Jimmy, Yuri and his talk of alcoves, and the pregnant hotel owner. Each of these characters helps make the world feel big and add some extra life to this film.
Cinematography wise this is very well shot, each shot helps convey the sad melancholic tone of the film. The use of cold blues and static wide shots, set the tone perfectly. The camera here is used very well to convey emotion throughout the entire film.Overall In Bruges is a well told simple plot with fantastic performances throughout and is not bogged down by it's depressing topics of death and guilt. Each character feels real which is a credit to the writing, and the film looks and sounds fantastic. With a very powerful and open ending I highly recommend In Bruges.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Martin McDonagh doesn't miss,"Watching McDonagh's more recet work made me want to go back and consume everything he has created. It's astounding how brave and unconventional ""In Bruges"" is, considering it is his first full lenght film.Altough it feels lighthearted, that is purely due to the witty dialogue. There is some wonderfully twisted humor in this thing. Attempting to murder a person while he is commiting suicide and stopping him?? The restaurant scene with Ray and Chloe also sticks out - ""I shoot people for money. Priests, children, you know the usual"". Colin Farrell offers an amazing performance, perhaps the best I have seen.Somehow it all adds up gratifyingly, the final scene with Harry being a direct call back to an earlier sequence that starts the entire story.

Watch First. Thank Me Later.,"A swiftly paced, endlessly entertaining & downright hilarious tale about tragedy, guilt, friendship & principles, all pierced with one witty line after another, Martin McDonagh's feature film debut is an expertly directed, cleverly scripted & splendidly performed black comedy that not only ranks amongst the best films of its year but is also one of the most accomplished works of its genre.Set in the medieval city of Bruges, Belgium, In Bruges tells the story of two London-based hit men who are asked to lie low in Bruges for a while & await further instructions from their employer after their latest hit goes horribly wrong. The city affects both of them as one is completely enamoured by its culture while the other absolutely detests it but things change when next instructions finally arrive.Written & directed by Martin McDonagh, In Bruges brims with a fresh, invigorating energy and is highly gripping from start to finish. McDonagh's work behind the camera is no doubt impressive but the screenplay he penned down is even better. Packed with sharp humour & memorable one- liners, the scripted tale retains its lighthearted tone even in serious moments and is just as funny as it is thrilling.Shot in exotic locations, the city of Bruges comes alive in vivid detail and while the film captures its old-fashioned vibe & way of living in an evocative manner, it also doesn't shy away from poking fun of the same from time to time. Cinematography infuses the tale with neo-noir elements, the pacing is smooth & steady, there isn't one dull scene in the final print, and Carter Burwell's score fits the premise beautifully.Coming to the performances, In Bruges features a talented cast in Collin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson & Ralph Fiennes, along with a couple more, and since their respective characters already exhibit an interesting arc, the actors are able to build their work on a solid platform. The chemistry between Farrell & Gleeson is delightful but Fiennes isn't far behind either & steals pretty much every scene in the supporting role of Harry, their employer.On an overall scale, In Bruges is a thoroughly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying crime-drama that scores high marks in all departments of filmmaking and is further boosted by its pitch black humour & committed performances. A surprisingly effective marriage of comedy, crime & drama that has the ability to evoke rib-tickling laughter from its audience in the most unexpected ways, In Bruges is an instant classic that's every bit worthy of its cult status. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"I know I'm awake,but i feel like i am in a dream....","Being this the first feature film of recognized play maker Martin McDonagh i did not really knew what to expect. To be honest i only knew that Colin Farrel was in this and that Martin McDonagh's short Six shooter won an academy award(If you watched and enjoyed In Bruges i recommend this short). I was not much of a fan of Farrel, and i have to admit this movie changed my whole perception of him,i can see him now like a true actor.The movie itself it's packed with a lot of dark humor,also with action and drama. Some scenes can be very touching and other ones can be pretty funny too.Wonderfully shot in the outdoors of Bruges (In Belgium) and with flawless script and direction. The cast is perfectly chosen. Being Farrel and Gleeson two irish hit mens working in London, and after a job went bad and told to hide in Bruges. Poésy playing a local custom and builds a relationship with Farrel's character. And finally Ralph Fiennes plays the ultimate mastermind of this London criminal group.This movie is truly one of 2008's cinema gems and i highly recommend it for anyone looking for a very well made film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Lives up to the title,"Fantastic. If it were just a movie that had great shots of Brugge, that would be enough. But it also has a great story that is hard to predict where it will go. At the beginning of the movie I thought to myself it could well do without Colin Farrell, but by the end he had won me over. I particularly liked the bit about the guy not letting Brendan G's character into the tower because he was short 0.10. I lived in Belgium for 2 years and this is absolutely what they would do - most uptight people I've ever encountered in my life. (I actually got kicked off a train in Brugge because my train pass had been improperly stamped. Mind you, I'm not the one that did the stamping.)Brugge is one of the most spectacularly beautiful cities I've ever been to and this film does it justice with it's cinematography and storyline.

This movie accomplishes the difficult task of enabling the viewer to connect emotionally with murderers.

Ritual Storytelling,"Forgotten art of ritual storytelling in which each detail is treated so thoroughly that you may regard it as sacred, could be felt in every scene of this art piece of cinema. Good films are made at the presence of a human's mind or soul; masterpieces are made in integral presence of mind & soul. In Bruges is a film of the last kind. all of the characters in it - main or marginal - are memorable by their functions in the course of narration & as the story spreads ahead, roles of them which seemed at first marginal to the story, suddenly come miraculously up, fit as a part of a foreseen destiny.Just two main traits in the film that makes it an unforgettable piece of creation by human's mind & soul are:1-some mythological characters with nonnegotiable principles which they are fighting & dying for; alongside of a few earthly characters which living under the shadow of the first group's dominance. 2-a tinge of comedy - some sense of sitcom - mixed in overwhelming taste of tragedy. (Polytonal texture)Everything seems like an occult or symbolic story of undying creatures that have been sent on earth to teach some things transcendental to the humankind. It's a hypnotizing magical masterpiece. Don't know what to say more, however there is much more to say about its cinematography(chocolate brownish velvet tonality in colors), acting, haunting score, the script structure, offbeat dialogues & all. Just watch it ;you'll be haunted for the rest of your life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Quite simply, the best film of the year (so far)!","The wittiest script since ""All About Eve"", combined with deep insights, magnificent performances, brilliant scenery, fine cinematography, excellent music - it's hard to fault this great film. At its core is the superb performance by Colin Farrell, proving yet again that he is one of the finest actors of his generation (check him out in Woody Allen's ""Cassandra's Dream"" as well and you'll see what I mean). A perfect blend of comic timing, rough charm and vulnerability - it's a knockout performance. And that's not to diminish the work of Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes or any of the other cast members - even the bit part players are terrific. Best not to say too much about the plot, as it's better to see it with fresh eyes - but Martin McDonagh deserves to be showered with awards for his work as both writer and director (and it's his first feature!).

nice movie but i expected more,"Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson were very good in their roles. Also the pictures from Bruge were awesome, like a fairytale!!At the beginning it was nice that there were two people doing sightseeing without purpose but in the same time knowing that something strange is going to happen. It would be better if we had an idea about the relationship of the two contract killers before their first common job went wrong, something from their past.After a while the plot was expected and along with some excesses on the way people died and the shootouts (which i didn't find funny if that was the purpose of the director) were the two main elements i didn't like at the movie.I was expectingI do not strongly recommend the movie but it's worth watching if you like action with some smart dialogs and a bit of English humor",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Two hit men hide out in Bruges and come to learn a very hard truth,"This is a brilliant film, the story and scenery are great, but it has been pirated on a camcorder which the user DID NOT seem to know how to focus. If you want this to copy to disc, i suggest you do NOT use this copy. I would recommend waiting for this film to be released on DVD.There are a couple of glaring errors I noticed on this film, mainly the bell tower has a cage around the bells to prevent visitors from falling down the shaft or from touching the bells themselves. The bells in that tower are irreplaceable antiques. Also, the steps to the tower are too narrow to allow well-padded people, like one of the lead actors, to be able to climb them easily. Also, at the end, another character runs down them, which is dangerous and foolhardy, as you cannot place your entire foot on the steps without half your foot hanging over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Would I recommend it?  No.,"OK, so this movie is /watchable/. It didn't make me want to vomit with cringeworthiness like, say, Eragon. It had some novelty to it, it was funny in places. That said...I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie. There were several reasons I didn't like it. It's a ""feel bad"" movie. You might come out of it wanting to go home and have a bit of a cry about how nothing really made you feel like justice had been done, or your brain had been pleasured.For a start, you'd better be prepared to hear one of the two main protagonists, Ray (Colin Farrell), whinge and whine about how he just HATES Bruges, every 5 minutes or so in the movie. This grated on me. A lot. Ray's character irritated me in just about every way imaginable. He is rude, arrogant, ignorant, and gets a kick out of hitting, killing, and insulting people (particularly midgets). For this, the storyline rewards him with the love of a beautiful Belgian girl. This felt very unjust, and just plain irritated me for the whole movie. I kept hoping Ray was going to die.You'd also better not be easily offended. When people say this movie has lots of black humour, they're not lying. Few taboos are left unbroken, short perhaps of paedophilia. Drugs, sex, violence, racism, insults, you name it, it's in there. I'm not easily offended, nor am I politically correct, but the casual overuse of these somewhat nasty tones for frequent black humour also grated on me. It made me feel bad.In conclusion, you MAY want to see this movie. It may surprise you at times, but probably not in a good way. It will not make you feel happy, and you'll probably be quite satisfied that those who die in the movie, die. They're all quite nasty people.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I want more films from McDonagh,"This is my first comment on IMDb after visiting it nearly every day for two years. I felt the need to write something because when I found out that this was the only long film of McDonagh, I felt rather disappointed. I was entranced by the sophistication of the film. I'm a filmaholic who watches at least one film everyday. What was so extraordinary with In Bruges that allured me so much? Was it the music? The city of Bruges? The characters? Or the humor which does not use cheap jokes? I really could not answer that question to myself, although I am a 4. year psychology student. I also feel a need to say something about Colin Farrell. I have seen some of his previous films. In all of them he tries to draw a male charisma like many pert Hollywood actors do. But in this film he becomes a real human being with all his weaknesses. Now, I started to respect him as a successful and modest actor. I hope McDonagh is reading these comments; because I really want many more films from him. I will be following you McDonagh! Of course, there will be some people who do not like your work, but if you continue to shoot your films in your original way you will have your fans like me.

"""Maybe that's what hell is: the entire rest of eternity spent in effing Bruges""","What exactly is ""In Bruges""? A 'quirky' crime/comedy in the vein of Guy Ritchie's early films and the slew of imitations which followed? A meta deconstruction of the crime genre? A character-based drama laced with plenty of humor? Martin McDonagh doesn't want to limit himself to one of those things, making ""In Bruges"" if nothing else a film certainly worth seeing, and something that promises a future for him as a film writer (he is already a well- established and acclaimed playwright responsible for the superb Leenane trilogy and the closer in tone to ""In Bruge"" Aran Islands trilogy, yet to be completed).While there is nothing bad about McDonagh's direction it's pretty standard modern TV- level stuff, there's the typical amateur trick of having the camera moving nonstop even when people are just talking (although McDonagh makes the wise decision not to do this whenever our lead romantic pair are on-screen, suggesting that he at least had a reason for doing that when the criminals were conversing, even though it's still an unwelcome distraction and a cheap ploy to keep impatient viewers interested). The film never rises above the level of a television series visually, in spite of some neat outdoor scenes where the cinematography becomes notably better than it is throughout the rest of the movie (where, again, it's pretty standard TV-level stuff). I would have loved to see this script handled by a more mature, experienced, and better director than McDonagh, although he could improve later in his career for sure.The screenplay is not surprisingly a far more consistent and solid affair. Not everything works and there's a little too much reliance on catchphrases and character quirks which are supposed to make you laugh just by inclusion ('in f-ckin' Bruges' was funny, oh, the first ten times, but it gets old), as well as too many 'look how clever this is' meta touches ('are you stupid? This is the shootout!'). Still, the movie is genuinely funny a lot of the time, and has a surprising amount of depth with the two main characters, particularly Colin Farrell's character Ray (and Farrell is great here, which helps. He's done this sort of thing before, but nothing has given him as much to chew on, and he's surprisingly good at the more contemplative stuff). The far-fetched ending, which fits with the tone of the film and the established idea that being in Bruges is like being in a fairytale, is still a costly mistake along with everything leading up to it, and Ralph Fiennes is coasting on his 'evil routine' here, with, again, some meta comedic touches. Still, considering the ambition of the script, to make something more out of a genre which has been extremely lightweight for a long time, it's overall quite successful.""In Bruges"" is not McDonagh's best work as a writer, but hopefully it will open doors for him in the industry and allow more of his dark comedy, often featuring some real intelligence and solid character writing, to be seen by a wider audience. ""In Bruges"" is fresh and involving enough, neither as bad (and certainly not as 'tired') as its detractors claim it is, and probably not quite as good as its fans would tell you.

Drop the Curtain and Move On,"Pretty vulgar, pretty ultra-violent, and some pretty Cinematography are things that are the attraction here.

'A lot of midgets tend to kill themselves...',"All I knew before watching this movie are the actors that are in it. I like all the actors involved and I thought that this might be a good movie to watch, but I really had no big expectations. But I was surprised at the end. ""In Bruges"" is a really good movie, with great dialogs and great actors and what I cannot forget to mention: brilliant photography that presents us all Bruges. There is no panoramic scene same like others. Just great! Movie is in some things similar to ""The Matador"". There, we've got only Brosnan shining in not so good movie; but here we've got Farrell & co. shining in very good movie. I must admit that I didn't expect such a good performance from Farrell after disappointing ""Alexander"", ""Ask the Dust"" and ""Miami Vice""; at least disappointing to me. So about the script.Movie is about two professional killers Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) who come in Bruges on some sort of vacation. There, they must keep low profile and wait for the further instructions of their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). As the movie goes on we found out that Ray is troubled by his first job. He accidentally killed a young boy while he was trying to kill his target. Because of that he's got suicidal thoughts. And one more thing, Ray really dislikes Bruges. His older partner, Ken is enjoying in Bruges and its culture, with all that old houses, churches, towers and canals. Ray meets Chloë on set of the movie that took place in central of Bruges. But soon Ken is given instructions to kill Ray, because of his incident with the little boy.""In Bruges"" is first long movie of Martin McDonagh. McDonagh wrote a fine scenario, where he puts one younger and older killer in front and fills the movie with big doses of dark humor (mostly coming from Ray, who acts sarcastic about everything) and nice turn in a story. I must say that the ending is quite unexpected; it's not American happy ending where everybody lives happy after. That's why this movie is so good. With message that you must follow your principals and with lots of irony, humor and strange events (like dwarf war). Also McDonagh presents his characters like ordinary people, with all their problems. But what's most important is that he managed to combine humor and human tragedy (Ray falls in love but he must be punished because he killed a child) in a way that at the end you feel sorry for main characters even though there is no completely positive character (only that little boy). So, ""In Bruges"" is not a movie for everybody. If you expect action comedy, look somewhere else. Cause this movie has a big touch of drama and makes you think about it. Great debut for McDonagh, one of the best roles for Farrell and great movie for me (and I hope for all of you).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"great crime comedy to rival guy Ritchie, instant classic.","i went in to this movie avoiding much info on this movie. the result was great.its hard to some the movie up, but the main thing about it is its character driven. the characters are realistic and down to earth, especially for hit men. Brendan Gleason is old and wise, as well as more mature than his partner. he is calm through most of the movie and not bothered by their situation. Colin Farrell on the other hand is messed up, and seeks to get out of bruges. many could relate to him being the annoying traveller of the group.the story starts out slow, but by the end you will not feel ripped off. Colin Farrell is a young hit-man, who has just been on his first hit. not too spoil things, but things don't go too well. so he is sent away to bruges with another hit-man to look after him (Brendan Gleason). however things seem to escalate, getting even worse. the two of them try to keep a low profile, but end up giving up. Colin Farrell gets involved with a girl, meets a midget who's making a movie, etc. Brendan Gleason however gets another assignment from his boss (Ralph Fiens) and is torn between loyalties.this movie is fantastic and for the first half of the movie will keep you laughing. however it gets much darker towards the end. this movie has a few scenes of violence, most of which are quite disturbing. but despite the dark themes, you can always expect great dialogue between Colin and Brendan.Ralph Fiens is great as a mean guy with a cockney accent. he and the other two main cast members also overcome each of their individual problems in a surprising way.this movie is very funny and very intriguing with three great actors. i would recommend it to fans of guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. but in my opinion i found this movie deeper than most of their movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Surprisingly Sensitive and Funny,"Whenever I went to the theater, no matter the movie, In Bruges would be one of the previews. Truthfully, not being a big fan of Colin, I was getting very sick of seeing it. But after hearing all the good word, I decided to buck up and check it out. And damn, this was a real good flick.Story focuses on two hit men who are sent to a beautiful and culture rich city in Belgium, known as Bruges. They're both to stay put in Bruges and keep a low profile until they hear word from their boss, Harry.Bruges is a gorgeous, quaint looking city with canals and cobblestone roads. One would think anyone would love to spend time here, but this isn't the case with this odd couple. The two men both share a profession, but not tastes. And this is where some really nice humor plays in. One appreciates life, the other not so much. The story focuses on why these two see life in different manners which really gives the film some great character development. And this is where the movie shines best. In it's two leading men and their banter with one another. From just talking about beer or how silly something is, to serious issues of death and the afterlife. It's all very entertaining which makes the movie move at a fast clip.Like any other flick with Irish actors, you've got the silly observational type humor, the thick as a brick accents and the motormouth way of speaking. It's all good, but I have a tough time hearing/understanding them quite a bit. If you're like me, this is just a warning to keep your ears open.In Bruges was a surprisingly good flick with great performances by the two leads and two supporting actors being the characters Harry and Jimmy. The others, like Ray's girly, were nothing special. She really just felt like a model thrown into the mix. Besides that, anyone who enjoys a well-written flick, a little blood and some taboo themes should definitely check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
They're filming midgets!,"Wow, what a little gem this movie turned out to be. I had heard absolutely nothing about it, and just decided to rent it a random. To say the least, I was pleasantly surprised.In Bruges turned out to be a wonderful black comedy about two hit men spending time i the Belgian town of Bruges, waiting for a call detailing their next assignment.The script was very good, but the dialogue is nothing but excellent! There are so many wonderful moments and hilarious one-liners, but it never feels forced or strained. Instead, the comedy comes naturally from the situations and the characters.I don't think I've ever seen Colin Farrell in a comedic role before, but he delivers a fantastic performance. The same said can be said about the rest of the cast who were all wonderful.In Bruges was one of the best and funniest movies that I've seen this year, and I've seen quite a bunch. It's quite rare with a movie that manages to balance drama and comedy so well.It is definitely a movie that I am likely to watch many times again in the future. Actually, I had to pause the movie about half way through to send an email to my friends, recommending this film. Don't miss it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Masterful...an Irish Pulp Fiction,"If the three most important things in real estate are Location, Location, and Location, the three most important things in a great film are Dialog, Dialog, and Dialog. ""In Bruges"" has Dialog up the wazoo. There haven't been this many black comedy one-liners in one film since ""Pulp Fiction."" All three of the principal actors are superb, with each revealing new facets of their talents I had not suspected before, even though I know their work well. Most impressive in a way is Colin Farrell, finally rescued from the handsome male lead ghetto and given some lines to really chew on. And chew he does...his Ray makes up for with scathing wit what he lacks in subtlety. The subtlety belongs to Brendan Gleeson, who manages to transcend both his character Ken's profession (hit man) and his background to explore the art, culture, and philosophy that he finds in Bruges. Ray thinks Bruges is Hell; Ken finds it a kind of Heaven. And the third surprise in this film is Ralph Fiennes, a very, very different Ralph Fiennes than we see in *his* handsome male lead ghetto roles.Martin McDonagh has been called ""the most famous Oscar-winning director you've never heard of,"" based on his win for a short called ""Six Shooter."" I've seen that film, and it's even darker in its way than ""In Bruges."" But it's that Irish kind of dark that is full of humor. Black humor, admittedly, but humor nonetheless. And, like ""Pulp Fiction,"" if you can get beyond the surface characters and what they are and what they do for a living, and focus on what they're SAYING, the humor is side-splitting. I snorted milk through my nose at Ray's ""They're filming midgets!"" and at several other lines. I haven't had so much fun listening to two hit men talk since Jules and Vincent and the Big Kahuna Burger.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A strange movie.,"This is quite a strange film but as it gets going you do get into the story and it's strange plot. The tone is pretty all over the place, the writing seems to take a lot of joy from writing awkward and absurd moments into that a plot like this would not usually include. A coming gunfight may be interrupted by one character and another stopping to talk about how to make sure it happens safely for others around. The film has quite a keen sense of irony, every single action in the film has a sort of meaning to it and every act of badness is repaid it seems upon that character. The film features some extreme people even apparently normal people may be hoping for a race war or turn out to rob innocent tourists for a kick. The film though also is layered with humour as though it was all one big joke ultimately. On a technical side the film has great sound and the camera work and lighting is also very good. I have a few small gripes with the movie, would a group of hitmen really be this reflective for instance? All in all though this is worth seeing though it is not for me an easy watch some of the time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Brooding in Bruges,"One of the outstanding movies of 2008, ""In Bruges"" is that rare cinematic high wire act that manages to juggle any number of seemingly contradictory moods and tones simultaneously without ever once dropping the ball. Alternating between the absurdly funny and the deadly serious, the movie, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, offers a wise, witty and surprisingly touching take on friendship, guilt, redemption and the strange code of ethics that guides the behavior of the professional killer (those who appear in the movies at least).Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are superb as Ray and Ken, two British hit men who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out after Ray accidentally kills a young boy in an assassination gone wrong. Stuck in this strange Medieval city, the two men make the best of a bad situation, Ken by taking in the sights and immersing himself in the rich history and culture of the place, Ray by moaning about how bored and homesick he is, all the while trying to work through the guilt of having the blood of an innocent child on his hands.In a screenplay crackling with irony and wit, McDonagh paints the portrait of an unusual friendship between two men who seemingly have little in common beyond their chosen profession and a mutual respect for one another. Ken is mature, well educated, even-tempered and pragmatic, while Ray is unbright, hot-headed, and easily provoked by the words and actions of others. Yet, somewhere beneath his rough-and-tumble, sometimes rather befuddled exterior beats a giving heart and an appreciation for the good that can be found in certain people. Gleason and Farrell give performances of immense sophistication and depth, with Farrell, in particular, creating a fully rounded portrait of a ""loveable"" killer. His body compressed down into a perpetual slump while a host of conflicting emotions flutter across his expressive face, Farrell demonstrates that he has the physicality an actor needs to make a character come to life on screen. In a much smaller role, Ralph Fiennes also makes his mark as the mob boss who has some strange notions about what constitutes morality and honor when it comes to killing.Add to all these various virtues lyrical direction by McDonagh, beautiful cinematography by Eigil Bryld, some colorful minor characters, and architecture guaranteed to knock the viewer's eye out - and you have one of the true movie going pleasures of recent years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
In Bruges,"A film that reaches for both profound redemption drama and Tarantino-style comic banter and falls short on both accounts. On the comic side, there are maybe a few clever bits but most of it is stuff from the same old bag of gags, with a few homophobic lines thrown in for good measure. It fares slightly better with the drama, although Farrell (who I can't stand looking at... those freak eyebrows and tiny mouth... it's amazing I like THE NEW WORLD as much as I do) doesn't really go through a transformation so much as he keeps shifting back and forth between dickhead and swell guy. We're asked to accept Gleeson as the sage, soulful elder hit-man but even though I liked his performance, the character feels manufactured. Also the ending is possibly the lamest example of dramatic irony I've ever seen. You could almost hear McDonagh quietly and smugly chuckling to himself as he thought of it. The cinematography and score are pretty good, and I really did enjoy Gleeson, but otherwise I didn't dig this very much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good film ... BUT,"I went to see this film with my girlfriend, who hated it. She was not best pleased that I choose this film. However I thought it was pretty good and it has been a while since I have heard so many people in the cinema laugh all together.This film has a lot of mixed reviews when i bring it up in conversation and I can see why. It is dark and does have jokes some people just may not like.It is very well put together and thought about which is one of the reasons I like it. Colin did a great job and was funny as hell.If you are thinking about whether you should watch this or not I would read some reviews and ask some friends who have seen it.

In Bruges There Are No Swear Jars,"In Bruges is a simple movie that thrives on the strength of it's writing. Two Hitmen are sent to Bruges to lay low while things cool down from their last job. It's a simple enough story but every interaction, every line of dialogue is just gold here. There's not a bad performance, no lousy special effects, to age it, just great character development and interactions.It's weird at times and I imagine it absolutely wont work for a lot of people, it's very British and very vulgar, but for everyone else this is a simple, no frills movie that's absolutely worth the watch. Also, Colin Farrell is a sneakily good actor when he gets the right role.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Exceptional!,"This is McDonagh's first feature, and it's a sure bet that he's a writer/director to watch in the future. In Bruges was advertised as a straight comedy featuring gangsters who like to shoot at each other, so the three-dimensional characters and emotional depth come as a nice surprise. Colin Farrell, who, if he hadn't already convinced me he was a great actor, certainly wins that title now, stars as a green hit-man with a short attention span who messes up his first job by killing an innocent bystander. Things seem to be okay with the boss (Ralph Fiennes), who sends Farrell and his partner, Brendan Gleeson, to the beautiful Belgian town of Bruges to wait for their next instructions. The fact is, Fiennes plans for Gleeson to snuff out Farrell. That's the basic set-up, and it would be criminal to reveal too much more. McDonagh's script is a thing of beauty, quick-witted, smart and frequently touching. I did think that the final twists were a bit overly clever. Jordan Prentice, who plays the dwarf Jimmy in the film, began his career as one of several dwarfs inhabiting the Howard the Duck costume in the film of the same name.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The best script of the year.  All three leads are marvelous.,"Ah, we finally reach Spy's favorite genre of film: the hit-man dramedy. One of my favorite films is The Matador, which is about a dysfunctional hit-man's friendship with a regular average joe. In Bruges, while sporting similar characters, is different in the plot and outcome, but is the same in that it is now one of my favorite films.It is a great character study. Martin McDonagh's existential hit-man piece has wonderful humor packed into a greater drama that serves as a big time eye opener for our characters. All three of our leads, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes, will experience a change in their outlooks on life before the credits roll. For those that do not know this film, it follows the misadventures of two hit men (Farrell and Gleeson) in Bruges, Belgium as they await a call from their boss (Fiennes). It's a moving picture, despite the fact that it moves fast and has some of the best comedic dialog of the year. I found the movie utterly hilarious at some points, with most of the humor coming from Colin Farrell.I've always found that the existential/introspective type of dramedy has been my favorite type of film, and the fact that there's guns firing and laughs bursting at the same time only makes it better. There's humor injected into all the action sequences (though they are few and far between, they are well shot and edited). A good score also helps the film out a lot, but this film truly belongs to our actors.I never thought I'd say this, but DAMN! Colin Farrell is wonderful in the film, and in my opinion, his role was the hardest to pull off. I've noticed that Farrell's best performances come when he uses his natural Irish accent. The emotional intensity of Farrell's performance, combined with his uncanny comic timing, make for the best performance of his career, bar none. His character was my favorite in the story, and he really impressed me here. Brendan Gleeson...well, I've long felt that he's one of Europe's diamonds in the rough, and very underrated. Hopefully he gets the exposure he deserves from this film. Gleeson, giving us a wonderfully introspective show, helps provide the wisdom and balance to Farrell's fast talking youngster. The partners really compliment each other. Then there's Ralph Fiennes, who, despite being absent for a big portion of the movie, had me on the floor laughing when he finally enters (he is heard on the phone at some point but doesn't actually appear for a while longer). To continue the appearances of cast members from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Clemence Poesy is also impressive (and might I say, quite beautiful) and well casted in her role as Chloe.In Bruges is a true gem of an action/dramedy that shouldn't be missed. It has a wonderful script with the best dialog of the year, some of which will have you laughing through the next few lines after. It's a beautiful character study and a well shot piece that will make our director a hot commodity over the next few years. Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes should be proud to have this movie on their resumes. I know I would be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
%$#@ing Bruges!,"If there is a person that hates Bruges the most, it would be Ray in the movie In Bruges played brilliantly by Colin Farrell. I can't say I'm a huge fan of Farrell but I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see play Ray in this movie.If you like dark humor than this movie is way up your ally. As you might of read in IMDb's trivia section, the word %$#@ is said 125 times in this movie and every time it makes me crack up. Interestingly, Ralph Feinnes doesn't make his mark until the last half hour of the movie. Every scene he is in made me laugh so hard. So many brilliantly played out awkward moments that always have a punch line even if it was meant to be serious. The script was brilliant and very original. The movie only made around 7,000,000 in The United States but then again, most of the little films these days seem to be the better movie.Ray and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are trying to settle down from there wild lives of being hit-man. But it isn't easy for hit-man to blend in as tourist. The big turn of the movie comes around forty minutes but it acts like a small twist so I won't say anything else.They're really isn't much out there on DVD right now so as long as violence, profanity, and drugs (and there are lots of all the above) don't offend you, give In Bruges a try. Could be the biggest surprise of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
...and now for something completely different,"I am always on the lookout for true originals. It's such a pity they so seldom happen. ""Eraserhead"", ""Duel"" and ""The Night of the Hunter"" evoke the pleasure of something so completely different that it is easy to see why so much art house cinema is such a crashing bore. Don't get me wrong. I will always regard the work of Angelopoulos, Bergman and Satyajit Ray as absolutely supreme but there are so many lesser artists with so very little to say that one thirsts for entertainment that is not just mediocre time-passing but stimulates through courting the wholly unexpected. I discovered a wonderful example the other week and have to confess to being drawn to it a half dozen times since, so much so that I find myself beginning to quote lines in the same way that I do from ""The Third Man"", ""Love and Death"" and ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"". ""In Bruges"" is a stunner. I won't begin to outline the plot as this has been done so many times elsewhere, rather will I just say that I adore the characters of the two Irish hit men and can only admire the way that the director has made a star of a city in as integral a way as any since Carol Reed's Vienna. To cap it all I love the dramatic irony of a scene towards the end involving size and coincidence that it would be wrong to give away, but which clarifies so perfectly much that is chaotic on a first viewing, resulting in a black comedy of extreme intelligence as well as one of enormous entertainment value.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great Until the End,"I'm not one of those people who can't stomach violence in a movie, rather, I'm find with violence as long as it fits the story and isn't gratuitous.The vast majority of In Bruges is an absolute scream. I never knew that Colin Ferrel could do comedy like he does? The dialog, which is very tongue and cheek and politically in correct, had me in stitches throughout. The idea of hit men with ethics could have become tiring pretty quickly, but the director makes it work for the whole movie.My only grip is the incredible violence in the last five minutes. The story line probably required the killing that occurs but why did it have to be incredibly graphic? I have no idea why directors feel the need to spray blood all over the screen in a final climax. In this way, the movie is like an American movie with the inevitable final chase scene.Still, a VERY witty film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

melancholy drama-comedy of career criminals in moral jeopardy,"Playwright McDonaugh's debut feature, In Bruges, works only up to a point as a crime comedy (however considering up to what point is quite remarkable), featuring a supporting cast ranging from quirky Euro-trash and plain old jolly eccentrics. But as a moral drama, it's almost as top of the pops one could ask for. The trailer didn't make it seem as such, then again it is hard to express the kind of conundrum that the main characters get themselves into while also appealing to a base of fans that love quip-type one liners (i.e. ""You're a bunch of bleeping elephants!"" or ""If I was retarded, or grew up on a farm, Bruges would impress me, but I didn't, so I'm not impressed."")When In Bruges is at its best- and until its self-consciously symbolic touches in the last five minutes it usually is at its ""Best"" whatever that means- it expresses what I love seeing in films about career criminals: the total inner turmoil of what was done coming back to haunt the person. If it's true that no good deed goes unpunished, the same would probably go for bad deeds in the world of In Bruges, where the atmosphere of the practically medieval city is, the character Ken observes, like ""a fairytale"", and a sharp contrast to the dark side pervading Ken, Ray, and Harry.The basic thrust of the plot is that Ray (half wise-ass womanizer and half half-suicidal played by Farrell) did a job back in London, a murder, which went horribly wrong in just one misstep (I won't reveal it here, though I should, except to say that it's one of those cardinal rules career criminals/hit men have to stick to), and so he and the older, less cynical Ken (Gleeson, who seems to be one of the most honest looking types in the character actor world, a spot-on casting choice), are sent to Bruges to receive more instructions. But those instructions, sent by the easily angered Harry (Ralph Fiennes, doing almost a hilarious imitation of Kingskey in Sexy Beast), aren't followed through, and then some manner of chaos ensues.Here and there McDonaugh takes what appears to be a lackadaisical attitude to the characters in this otherwise tense and uncertain fatalistic situation, as if an odd-matched comic duo are in a place one likes and one only can stand for mocking midgets (scuse me, dwarfs) in movie-making and hitting on the one hot girl in all of Bruges. But it's such a strange form that McDonaugh is working with here, with its mix of tones that it suddenly feels, in the context of the slightly bizarre and chilling circumstances, truthful. It goes without saying the cast helps give the material a boost, and that McDonaugh doesn't throw too many out-of-left-field curve balls with the plot. If he does, it's not of the sort we know we're usually hitting in this kind of crime story loaded with gallows humor and Catholic redemption mini-saga.In short, if I were a bloke in Britain or a fella in Dublin, or a dupe in Bruges, as a writer this is the kind of stuff I'd immediately try to go for. It's smart, serious, mature genre work that relies on just enough blood-shed and violence and trauma to haunt its audience proper, and do its duty to supply another batch of wonderfully off-kilter 'comedy' scenes for fans of British gangster flicks. That this is nowhere near as shallow as a Ritchie pic goes without saying.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Beautiful scenery mediocre acting,Colin Farrell as a hitman? You know the one. Set in one of the most beautiful European cities? I'll have a slice of that. The film starts off well with an exciting understanding of the plot as the hitmen go into hiding for reasons unknown but as the film progresses you understand the darkness and the hidden code of hitmen(probably not true). Cinematography was very nice with that dark tint however some of the dialogue and acting at the time from Ralph Fiennes lacked any real substance and fear for a gangster villain enjoyable film but could of been more violent if he was a true gangster.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Almost makes me want to be... In Bruges,"I went to see In Bruges last night, and I was really pleasantly surprised. I didn't have high expectations since I hadn't heard much about it, and I'm not a huge fan of Colin Farrell, but I'm pleased to say that I was blown away by this dark, witty black comedy.I was laughing within 5 minutes of the film starting, and the laughs continued from there. Somehow Farrell manages to make his assassin Ray both likable and amusing, and the bond between the two hit men is touching without being sickly sweet.Basically, this film has it all: comedy, drama, action, thrills and a hint of romance.I would highly recommend seeing it, you won't regret it! Although I would warn people of a sensitive nature that it's possibly the most politically incorrect film I've ever seen (alongside Death at a Funeral, which happens to be one of the worst films I've ever seen!). So watch out for bad language, xenophobia, drugs, violence, racism and, yes, even scenes of an anti-dwarf nature... Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny & Quirky  good suspense in the end!,"I loved this movie. I saw it at Sundance. Probably best classified as a dark comedy, IN BRUGES has a mix of comedy, drama, and action. There are a few violent scenes. Great job by writer/director Martin McDonagh.The movie made me laugh from the opening note: Colin Farrell's voice over during the opening credits asking ""Where the fook is Bruges?"" The movie follows two hit men stuck in Bruges awaiting the next order from their boss. Farrell is dealing with some of his own personal demons. Much of the first half of the movie is talking heads, but due to the clever writing and comedic moments (often cynical and not-PC), the movie never gets stale. Both lead actors  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson  are the superb and they make the perfect odd couple. It is nice to see Colin Farrell playing a role other than the cool, slick guy. Farrell's character verges on whiney, but that is part of what makes him endearing. Ralph Fiennes add a bad guy to the mix of eclectic characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Stroke Of Genius,"I rarely heap unqualified praise on a film as I can generally find something to get my claws in but not with ""In Bruges"". It is a masterpiece of black comedy. I loved it so much I watched it twice in seven days and could watch it again and again and still laugh.It is one of those films where, as they say, the chemistry is perfect. Gleeson's performance is stupendous. A large brooding man with a soft interior acts as the perfect foil for Farrel's almost manic character. The script is superbly crafted and the timing of these two actors would put many a stand up comedian to shame.I admire the director for selecting Bruges for the backdrop. How many more 'cockney gangsta' films must we see that are shot in London? He has broken the mould.I have to admit I have no liking for Ralph Fiennes. How could anybody like a pratt that insists on being called Rafe and not Ralph? Conceit or what? Having said that his character performance is brilliant. It goes from parody to menacing and his face and accent for the role fit the bill perfectly.I think it's going to be a long long time before I see another film of this calibre.I would shower this film with awards and it is to be hoped the Director/Writer gets busy with some more high class entertainment.Excellent!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Blood Battle In Bruges,"'In Bruges' tells a darkly hilarious story of two hit men who visit Bruges to stay in hiding. 'In Bruges' deserves credit for the creativity behind it among other things. Being a huge fan of black comedy, I haven't seen anything like it. The screenplay is superb and unique. The story feels very Shakespearean and I wonder whether there is another movie where the dialogue is loaded with such dark humour through dialogue, situations and characterization. McDonagh does take the dialogue to quite an extreme side of darkness using themes like pedophilia, racism, homosexuality and xenophobia but the comic impact isn't lost.The setting is amazing. Bruges looks amazing. It's historical, quiet, seemingly peaceful and mysterious. Thanks to the remarkable cinematography which allows the town to play a character of its own. It definitely makes one want to visit the place.'In Bruges' is additionally loaded with colourful characters that include the aforementioned two hit men (the main characters), a gangster, a racist little person who prefers to be as a dwarf, a blind con-artist, a Russian arms dealer, a pregnant lodger, a sexy drug dealer, a Dutch prostitute and a Canadian couple who hate cigarette smoke. Many of their appearances may sound random but it all comes together beautifully in this film.All the actors do nothing short of a splendid job. Farrell and Gleeson both perform naturally as the killers with conscience. Their dialogue delivery and comic timing is fantastic. Colin Farrell is in form after a long time. Though the reason for Ray's arrival in Bruges was to escape the consequences of having killed a child, Ray is portrayed as a childlike character himself and Farrell makes him believable and human. Brendan Gleeson is excellent as a father/big brotherly figure to Ray. His reaction to his costars is particularly of note. Ralph Fiennes has played villainous parts before (like in 'Schindler's List' and that Harry Potter movie) and here he does it wonderfully displaying a flair for comedy. Thekla Reuten is a surprise treat as she is very likable as the hostess. Clémence Poésy is charming.'In Bruges' is an exceptional witty black comedy that is both entertaining and fascinating. It's been a long while since I laughed out loud so many times during a movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Product of Its Time, For Better or Worse","The Good: Farrell and Gleeson have excellent chemistry, which is a good thing, since a lot of the movie hinges upon their characters. In Bruges is about two hitmen, and it's got plenty of violence and gore, but mostly at the end. This is a relatively slow, contemplative, but still entertaining (even if it takes a while to get going).A lot of this has to do with the dialog, which - like many a late 2000s Tarantino inspired crime film - is quirky and funny. Similar to Tarantino, there's a colourful cast of characters from pregnant hotel owner Marie, to cantankerous American dwarf Jimmy, there's quite a few fun and interesting characters that give Bruges a lot of personality. Speaking of which, as much as Bruges is made fun of in this movie, the city is absolutely gorgeous and honestly, I think this movie works as an inadvertent travel advertisement.The final 30 minutes of this film are really, really good. Ralph Fiennes kind of steals the show and he's such an interesting and compelling antagonist that he injects life into the plot just when you thought it was spinning its wheels. As frustrating as the film can be at times, I think by the end, it all comes together.The Bad: This movie suffers from a chronic issue that many 2000s films did and that's ""chronic edginess."" This movie LOVES to be sardonic, edgy, and a bit over the top with its dialog and I can totally see this being off putting for a lot of people. Sort of like Bullet Train, the movie is obsessed with being cool and quirky, and while it works for the most part, there are moments where I rolled my eyes.This is especially true anytime McDonagh has ""race"" as the centre of the joke. He's weird with race. Let's be honest. He doesn't know how to approach the topic tactfully, yet insists on doing it in almost every film he's made. It comes off as unfunny and frankly, a little bit uncomfortable.As I said before, I also feel like the film slows down a bit towards the middle and I wish it was a bit shorter.The Ugly: In Bruges is a surprisingly good time capsule movie; it has that good ol' fashioned War on Terror inspired anti-Americanism, lots of offensive jokes that probably wouldn't fly today, and the quirk factor turned up to 11. I don't think it's as good as people remember it being, but it's still a fun time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Excellent black comedy....,"I would call this a black comedy .....it contains some very dark subject matter that won't appeal to everybody, but it's also different than anything else I've ever seen - thought provoking, and yet funny at the same time. My kind of movie! The musical score is quite excellent.Production values are generally good, though it's obviously not a big budget feature. However the intellectual content more than makes up for any lack of big screen special effects or opulent sets. The two main characters (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) turn in compelling performances that convince the viewer that this not a movie, but a documentary of a real event.Overall, I highly recommend it for anybody who enjoys thought provoking cinema, and doesn't mind if it's a bit on the dark side.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The best Belgian film ever,"It doesn't happen too often that international productions are filmed in Belgium. That's why it was big news in Belgium when Martin McDonagh came to Bruges to shoot his film over here. A film with a title like this, couldn't be filmed anywhere but in Belgium, you can argue. Right, but the film could as well have been called 'In Prague', 'In Sevilla', 'In Florence' or 'In Talinn' if you want. Only, Martin McDonagh sincerely seemed to be mesmerized by the city which we like to call the Venice of the North. Bruges is beautiful, fairytale-like and on a certain level the city really looks like an open-air-museum, though the mayor of Bruges and his band try very hard to make Bruges a modern, contemporary city and succeed to have it be more. So, it's human for foreigners in the first place to be mesmerized by Bruges. And indeed, it is possible that Martin McDonagh loved the city that much that he really wanted his film to be made over there. In that case, Bruges is very lucky. But whether Bruges did everything to get this production to their city or it was the director or the producer who decided to film in Bruges, it makes no difference, the result is great. It's a story about two hit men arriving in Bruges. As a viewer the only information we get at first is that something went wrong with their last job. So their boss gave them the order to travel to Bruges, and keep low for a while, try to be unnoticed and enjoy the great views. The oldest of the two seems to be the smarter one. He enjoys to do some sightseeing and loves the old buildings, the museums and the great paintings by Flemish masters. He is brilliantly played by Brendan Gleeson. You believe he can be a tough guy, who is capable of murdering someone, but on the other hand he's very soft, sweet and nice, gentle and a joy to be around. One likes to listen to him when he talks, and you can't dream of a better companion to find hanging around in a bar Bruges and to have a couple of beers with. His partner is the wild one, he is played by Colin Farrell, the actor who seemed to have forgotten for a couple of years that he was an actor. Hollywood wanted him to be a star instead. An image that didn't him. He is an actor indeed, and he proves it here. A brilliant one. He's a comedian even. I didn't know he was capable of giving such a performance. Really astonishing. The rest of the cast is also great. But of course everything stands or falls with Bruges and the performances of the two leading actors. As a Flemish Belgian it is a pity we don't get to see one Flemish actor in the film, while Bruges is in Flanders and the only Belgians in the film are played by Dutch, French and Walloon actors, who -- mind you  are all great. I couldn't think of a negative word on this film. It's the best comedy I've seen in a long time. I laughed my head off. Not once, but also the second time I went to see the film. Bruges is so lucky that this film is made over here. Although McDonagh and his cast make fun of the city and of boring Belgium all the time, it's the greatest publicity Bruges and Belgium could dream of. The film shows how beautiful some corners of our country are, and how great it is to live over here. I was proud to be Belgian before seeing this film, I am even more so after seeing it. And I will see it again and again. It's so funny when something you love is made fun of. We know it's good, so everyone can laugh. Also great are the constant laughs at the expense of the fat American tourists. Easy laughs, I know, but funny nevertheless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Shootings, violence, insults, cynicism, intelligence and Bruges.","This is a film that does not fit any audience, mainly, I believe, those who are or live in the city of Bruges, Belgium. And I say this because I felt that the film was not at all sympathetic to this beautiful city, one of the most iconic cities in Flanders, and an old and important commercial trade port with which Portugal had privileged commercial relations in the Middle Ages. It is a magnificent and very well-preserved city, which the film insults a lot.The script is simple: two professional assassins flee from England and hide in Bruges, according to their boss's orders. However, what happens next is that each of them will live those days in their own way, interacting with the city in an individual and personal way, while waiting for the next instructions.The film could not be more provocative and incorrect: the actors insult the city, they insult the Americans, they insult each other. Dialogues laden with profanity and insults are aggressive and politically incorrect. The scenes involving the dwarf, and the jokes around him, are very especially infamous. However, the film proved to be engaging and capable of entertaining, in addition to having an interesting dose of black humor and profoundly intelligent cynicism, hidden under the high dose of aggression. The worst was, indeed, the ending, which sounds forced and unconvincing.There are hidden and barely visible qualities in this film, which the excellent work of the cast was able to exploit, bringing to life hateful characters, but elegantly constructed and complex. Colin Farrell shows all of his talent and was really extraordinary in his role. Brendan Gleeson is not an actor that I particularly like, and I think he always opted for somewhat rude characters, but he was excellent at bringing a very humane, honorable killer to life and establishes an excellent collaboration with Farrell. Ralph Fiennes is not the type of actor you would expect to see in such a controversial film, but he did very well and seems to have made the film for the pleasure of doing so. To some extent, the city of Bruges turns out to be a character in the film, with whom everyone is relating, in a relationship with ups and downs, moments of fascination and contempt.The film is directed by Martin McDonagh. He proved to be a skilled director, and guided his group of actors and the technical team well. At a technical level, the director offers us a great cinematography, which makes the most of the magnificent landscapes and buildings of Bruges. All scenarios were very good, in full agreement with the theme and the environment. The action scenes are good, and the effects have been well accomplished.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fifth rate rip-off of Pulp Fiction,"In Pulp Fiction, the dialogue was, if not witty exactly, at least funny from time to time. And you empathise to an extent with Jules and whateverisnamewas, especially after the scene where they are cleaning up the car. That's really quite funny.There's nothing equivalent in ""In Bruges"", (and they can't even spell or call it right, the city is really named Brugge as everybody knows) and I don't understand the point at all. WTF is all that stuff with the midget all about? And why is it to be assumed that just because a guy uses the c-word every third time he opens his mouth that that makes him well hard? (Sexy Beast, another totally crap film, makes the same mistake). The fairies at the bottom of my garden are harder than Harry is.As a gangster film it's ludicrous. (Has there been a decent gangster film since Lee Marvin died?)

Subtly Vicious and Yet Bloody Funny,"This is a rare gem of a movie, which by all standard definitions, should not work at all. However, it does, and boy does it, most movies which try to contain everything, usually fall over, with over elaborate or totally stupid subplots, however this film does not fall into any of these traps, it ranges from Funny, Sad, Romantic (Sort Off) to Down Right Nasty, and pulls it off magnificently. The plot is simplistic yet very clever, and this is where its beauty lies. The Movie will definitely not be to everyone's tastes, and some of the Jokes / scenarios that the Colin and Brendan get themselves into are so far off the Do-Gooder Brigades PC scale, that they need to have a classification of there own, but if like me you can look past this and enjoy them in the context that they are in, then you will Love this movie.

A new place for purgatory,"Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are ""In Bruges,"" a 2008 film directed by Martin McDonagh.Farrell and Gleason are Ray and Ken, two hit men sent to Bruges, Belgium to await instructions on their next hit from their boss Yuri (Ralph Fiennes). Ken (Gleason) loves the fairytale prettiness and medieval sites of the town, but Farrell, a volatile and troubled young man, is bored out of his mind. He perks up a little when he meets a pretty drug dealer and makes a date with her. It gets to be kind of messy, though, when he takes offense at the restaurant and beats up a fellow patron, and then at her place, her boyfriend.Ken is at the hotel to receive the call on the next hit, and it's on Ray. The boss was trying to show him a nice time in a pretty place before he dies. The reason? On his first hit, which was in a church on a priest, one of Farrell's bullets hit a child. Not only can't Farrell recover from it, but Fiennes wants him gone.Though this is a dark film, it has a great deal of humor, mostly provided by Farrell's excellent performance as the reckless Ray. The director, McDonagh, has skillfully enmeshed both the comedy and the drama together and woven the idea of heaven, hell, and purgatory into the story. For Ken, Bruges is his idea of heaven, peaceful and beautiful. For Ray, since they're stuck there for two weeks, it's purgatory.""In Bruges"" is a beautiful film about guilt, camaraderie, and the possibility of redemption. It's depressing but not completely. And the scenery, despite what Ray thinks, is beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
my film of the year so far.,"I'd heard a couple of reviews comparing this to Pulp fiction, and so was eager to see it. Whilst I can see the comparisons they are very different, the only similarities really is that there are 2 hit-man, the dialogue is razor sharp and slightly ambling and are both brilliant pieces of film in their own way. In Bruges is a lot more sedentary. There's no Hollywood gloss in this film, and younger viewers may find it a little slow paced. But the script is funny, the cinematography is wonderful, and ALL the characters are interesting. I loved it when Yuri who thought that ""nooks and crannies"" was a more suitable English word than ""alcoves"". The performances were all as what you can expect from such fine actors as Ralph Fiennes, but I felt that Colin Farrell made the film with the main character Ray. Surely this is an Oscar winning performance and it heightens my belief that anything that Film-4 put their name to is a stamp of excellence. With all that said I'll reserve my only slight criticism of the film till last. I, like some other reviewers found that the end was slightly disappointing. Was it that or was because I simply didn't want the film to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A great movie,"I saw this movie yesterday. After reading the reviews here I thought that I am going to see a crime comedy, similar to that of Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Its not. Its a drama with comic reliefs, and I am not sure whether overusing ""Fu*king"" and ""Bruges is a sh*t hole"" is that funny or just suppose to ease the tension that the movie would have imposed on the audience otherwise. With that said, I really enjoyed the movie. It got a Tarantino like dialog, though its not a rip off. It has a beautiful setting of Bruges and I enjoyed Hieronymus Bosch references.

"Too slow for a hit man movie, not enough laughs for a good black comedy.","Two hit men are stuck in Bruges, Belgium- one loves the place and the other hates it. They tour the beautiful medieval scenery, meet a girl and a midget, do drugs, have some fights, some funny/stupid conversations and eventually there is a shootout. If that sounds kind of boring than you have an accurate idea of what the movie's like- kind of boring with some redeeming qualities: some interesting situations, good acting, some funny dialogue and nice cinematography. The high point by far was the Ralph Fiennes character but he doesn't show up till the movie's half over. At some of the more preposterous action situations, I had to keep reminding myself this was a comedy, or was it? I wasn't really sure, which is probably why this film didn't work for me. If I think about the setup and the Ralph Fiennes character, this could have been a really good movie, but there is just too much screen time in the first half where nothing particularly interesting or funny is going on.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Thank God for this Film!,"Simply fantastic! The visual art in the film makes it worth the rent. Amazing location shots that are set amongst beautiful and historic backdrops compliment Martin McDonagh's perfect direction. The acting in the film ranges from average to great, but Colin Farrell gives the performance of his career(which is obviously not a grueling task). The script was very inclusive and gave viewers aspects of dark comedy as well as straight comedy. All of this was mixed into a pot of social awareness, love story and satire. The beautifully brutal action sequences were perfectly distributed between the dry and scoreless dialogue. I believe In Bruges is one of the finest of 2008, I absolutely loved this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fun non-cliché movie,"This movie could have easily have been the mob-hit-man-buddy movie cliché, but it wasn't. This movie is a better movie, technically, than I expected.

Farrell's character may be viewed as ""un-PC,"" but I think it is important to his character. He comes across ignorant. That ignorance it is also part of the charm of the character...This was one of those movies that I can't help but suggest to others because it was such a good time.

"Loved it ""In Bruges""","When I had my cinematic travel experience in ""In Bruges"", it was a sheer entertainment extravaganza. Writer-Director Martin McDonagh's ""In Bruges"" creation was a juicy blood-broiled black comedic offering, with a few Irish fried hit men to go along with it. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson star as Ray and Ken, the aforementioned hit men protagonists who are ordered by their mob boss Harry to lay low in Bruges, Belgium due to the fact that Ray accidentally killed a young boy on a hit job. Ken takes a touristy liking to Bruges, while Ken thinks that Bruges is the boredom capital of the world. Their hit men chemistry was definitely on target, and in equilibrant comparison to Jules & Vincent in the classic ""Pulp Fiction""; and this is a fact! Team Kenray do come across some eccentric characters while in Bruges including a: a foul-mouthed dwarf actor, a one-eyed robber, and a rude Canadian couple. A ray of sunshine appears in Ray's torturous Bruges experience when he meets the beautiful ecstasy drug dealer Chloe. Things get a bit hairy for Ray & Ken when Harry comes to Bruges to hunt them down for hit men insubordination; if such thing exists. Colin Farrell was phenomenal as Ray with his witty banter on his hatred for Bruges. Farrell also did the best heavy emotional work in his career portraying Ray as a guilt-ridden suicidal hit-man, while still maintaining his sarcastic comedic liveliness. Gleeson's subdued but resounding performance was also a sure shot winner. Ralph Fiennes continues to be one of the finest actors in the business with his hair-raising thespian fineness as the menacing Harry. I also gladly in took the ""In Bruges"" supporting acting experience with crafty performances by Jordan Prentice as the American dwarf actor Jimmy and Clemency Posey as the poised Chloe. Obviously, the city of Bruges does play an integral part of the film's symbolization. I dunno where McDonagh's imaginative genial inspiration came from for his ""In Bruges"" masterpiece direction & script; but I bet this is a McDonagh that has more tasty offerings for us to cinematically chew on for some time to come. Must also fare well to Carter Burwell's soothing ""In Bruges"" score; might just get the top score as the best movie score of the year in my book. So colonize yourself to Colin's colossal acting and the rest of the outstanding movie attractions that ""In Bruges"" has to offer. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Absolutely Fantastic!,"There are many great reviews of this film, and all are justified. What drew our interest to it was we used to live in Belgium, and have been to Brugge (Flemish spelling) on several occasions. It is truly a beautiful town, and that is what makes this such a great movie, as it is the perfect backdrop for the plot. The acting is absolutely brilliant (kudos to Colin Farrell, most likely his best performance ever), the script well written and overall it is just what a movie should be, a balanced combination of humor, action and drama! This is far from a brainless action flick, this movie draws the viewer in and holds their attention the entire time. This is one to buy on DVD, as like I you will want to watch it every so often as it remains as fresh and entertaining as the first time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not many movies like it,"In Bruges is a movie that should have a category unto its own, because there are very few movies out there like it; that mix brutal violence with such a frivolity. In a way it is comparable to say Pulp Fiction but the reason Pulp Fiction is sometimes funny is because of the absurdity of its violence, In Bruges combines hard hitting and sometimes heart wrenching violence with light-hearted humor. This is something not completely new but definitely something that has not explored widely. Colin Farrell does a terrific job in the film. I haven't seen in act so well since Tigerland in 2000. He plays a naive man named Ray lamented by the torment of a past mistake, who finds himself stuck in place which is perhaps worse than the Hell he has left behind, Bruges, a storybook town in Belgium. Brendan Gleeson as Ken takes a break from period piece movies and provides a conservative contrast to Farrell's stark Ray. Then there is Harry, a crime boss played to perfection by Ralph Fiennes who in my opinion should earn an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal. In the end In Bruges is mortality tale and a morality tale wrapped up in an often time hilarious and sometime brutal movie which serves to remind us all that good film-making comes first a foremost from a good script.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
In Hell? Or In Bruges?,"How do you make the story of a hit-man who accidentally blew a hole through a child's head funny and light? It ain't easy, but IN BRUGE does it on several levels.You definitely have to have a main character who can pull off something both dramatic and comedic. And that someone is Colin Farrell (MIAMI VICE), a killer who finds he's having trouble living with the accidental death of child who got in the way of a bullet.Then you have to have a great co-star, and he turns out to be Brendan Gleeson (KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). Gleeson has been a favorite star of mine since his American portrayal of Sheriff Keough in LAKE PLACID. His combination of dramatic chops mixed with witty line delivery made him the perfect choice for this role.You've also gotta have some sort of tryst going on, and there's actually several of those. The primary is that of Ray (Collin Farrell) and Chloë (Clémence Poésy). Their brutal honesty with each other makes for some interesting mental sparring between the two and has some of the lighter moments within this otherwise dark dramedy. The other is that between Ken (Gleeson) and pregnant Belgium hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten). Ken's distant manner opens up to Marie during certain film segments, and Marie's stunning good looks and prideful appearance make her a person to be reckoned with. Another mini-tryst comes thanks to a film being produced ""In Bruges"" where one of its stars named Jimmy (midget Jordan Prentice) is out to have a good time with whatever women he can find (or drugs).Normally location wouldn't necessarily play that important of a role in a movie like this that is truly a character study of dark people who are also genuinely decent in many ways. But Bruges, Belgium IS important. After Ray (Farrell) accidentally kills the small boy, he and Ken (Gleeson) are told to ""get out of town and head to Bruges."" For Ken, it's like a vacation; the stunning buildings and peaceful waterways put Ken in laid-back mode. But Ray is tense, on edge, and sincerely depressed at his accidental shooting of the small boy. The two clash as soon as they reach Bruges, and their differences are mirrored in the landscape around them: swans, steeples, guns, and prostitutes.There's also a comparative study going on between a famous painting of Hell in Bruges, Belgium (that Ken and Ray check out), to that of the movie being filmed in town by Jimmy (Prentice) and that of the experience Ken and Ray find while visiting this quaint, Belgian community. I won't say more for fear of giving away too much.The final bonus for movie watchers is checking out Ralph Fiennes (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) as the overly-scrupulous death dealer Harry Waters. He's a family man with a mob-boss mentality who must head to Bruges himself in order to set things right. And once he's there things really heat up! Bullets fly. Bodies fall from tall buildings with resounding *splats!* And he finds himself the victim of his own moral code in the end. Nicely played.A warning should probably be given to those who are squeamish or don't care for the overuse of foul language. Both play out significantly in the film, but they are also integral to the characters and the life they've chosen. But you can't say I didn't warn you (the R rating is definitely deserved).What's more interesting to me now, though, is that I would LOVE to see Bruges in person. The extra features on the DVD include a boat trip through the canals of Bruges and point out incredible spots of interest. An added bonus, for sure. I just hope I don't see any cloaked midgets or men with silencers running around.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Sure is an interesting production, but not a comedy","The description said ""comedy"" and who isn't on board for a comedy with Collin Farrel. In Bruges is an interesting production indeed, but it sure isn't a comedy. A layer of humour only covers this slow-paced grungy drama that plays out in the cold grey Bruges, where our troubled characters are stuck with one another, processing their issues.The film successfully manages to turn an otherwise slow and uneventful plot into an interesting and, in today's world of formulaic recycling, refreshing play. Its little gloomy quirks and twists make it a memorable film, but don't expect an action movie or lots of laughs, as it is not that kind of movie. It feels more like a stage play.The movie is carried by Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell. Collin's character combines despair, resulting from the position he finds himself in, with a humoristic childlike perception of the events around him. He is erratic, sometimes going through several facial expressions in a matter of seconds. Brendan Gleeson gives a much more subtle and realistic performance. He serves as contrast to Collin Farrell's character, both in terms of his outlook on life and physical appearance, but at the same time, the two have good chemistry together. You sometimes forget that these people are hitmen.In fact, I wish the movie had removed the hitman component altogether and had a different central premise. The main characters play hired killers. It would've been far easier to empathize with them if they weren't murderers by trade. You're supposed to feel bad for the young inexperienced Ray played by Collin Farrell, who botched his job and now feels guilty about it, but even if you ignore the botched job, he is still a murderer. Hitmen are psychos. There are no charming lovable serial killers, but that's what the audience is being sold. Ralph Fiennes's character functions as the looming danger hanging over the heads of the other 2 characters and creates the necessary tension and urgency, but this danger could've just as well been provided by some police detective. The action scenes are so few that they could've been removed or replaced, without the movie losing much.The film is filled with awkward violence that comes suddenly and goes away just as quickly. The up-close emotional awkwardness and drama make this a quirky movie with a very specific type of mood that's not really for me. But the performances are undeniably yummy. Fienne's and Gleeson's characters have one of the best exchanges I've seen on screen. In Bruges is a cute local little drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An Erratic Effort,"Contract killers Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the former a clumsy hatchling with easily ruffled feathers, the latter a calm veteran whose patience only intensifies Farrell's aggravation, are sent to the picturesque old Belgian world of Bruges by their edgy, ferocious boss Ralph Fiennes and told to await further instructions. While Gleeson peacefully absorbs the sights and historic buildings, streets and quays, Farrell is pessimistic and finicky, irritated with the lack of local nightlife. From the wild playwright of the feral, hypersensitive Lieutenant of Inishmore, this is a wonderfully enjoyable set-up for an action/comedy buddy crime film. It prepares itself with comic dynamics and quaint atmosphere, just as it markets itself in trailers, but it lets us down with an erratic handling of its tone as a jarringly dark twist in backstory unravels itself. It could have balanced its mood swings if it did not so convincingly set itself up as the duo comedy as which it was marketed.The pace accompanies the tone in the dunce corner, the film's running time being nothing more than filled by the subplot of Farrell striking up a romance with a thieving drug dealer he meets while she is working as a PA on a movie set with a temperamental dwarf actor.There is nothing wrong with a film that gets darker and darker as it unfolds, but In Bruges's missteps lay in its disappointing effect as well as its odd feeling of severing us from it, as despite its beautifully antiquated medieval scenery and occasional moment of fulfilling humor among a promising cast of great contemporary English actors, its struggle with its own contrivance being transparent more than the story's capacity to absorb.By either following through with the spirit of its exposition or helming better control over its landslides into melodrama, it could have avoided being an incoherent disappointment which, if I came across it one day with a lack of better choices, I would still watch again. I sense it as a film that has the potential to grow on you despite its nearly crippling flaws.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Terrible but good at the same time,"I am completely uncertain as to how to feel about In Bruges. It's witty and funny, but at the same time so terrible that I don't want to think about it.

Not for the squeamish as there's a lot of quite disgusting violence. Don't let anyone ""young"" see it as it's a bit too heavy for most people under 16 to handle.

Good Black comedy,"In Bruges is a black comedy whose idea arose from a vacation writer/director Martin McDonagh took to the pristine town of Bruges, Belgium. McDonagh reflected in the DVD featurette that he was in awe of the town's medieval beauty but had the simultaneous feeling of being incredibly bored after two or three hours. He took these two disparate feelings and split them up over two characters. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are a pair of hit men who are paid by their boss to go to Bruges for an undisclosed assignment. They are supposed to pose as two tourists and maintain a low profile while waiting for a phone call. Ken (Gleason) takes an interest in the sights of the town and jollily obliges, while Ray (Farrell) is very bored. He is somewhat of a cultural boob with low intellectual curiosity but he gets more likable as the film progresses as we slowly see that he starts to develop a curiosity about living a better life. He is also bored because he has just accidentally shot a boy and is coping with guilt over that. Ralph Feinnes also enters in the story a little later as the enigmatic boss. The film is also populated by the kinds of characters that come with small-town comedies: An obnoxious Canadian tourist, a pregnant innkeeper, an alluring coke dealer (who Ray falls in love with) and her unfortunate boyfriend, and an opinionated midget.The film reminds me of Analyze This or Anger Mangement in that it features a star (Robert De Niro or Jack Nicholson in the above examples) making fun of their screen personas. Colin Farrell is playing to type in an extreme sense, reflecting his public image: Shallow and mostly interested in booze and women. (In real life, Colin Farrell is an avid reader and student of history who would be the kind of guy who's interested in a place like Bruges, but I digress). It's an interesting mix of genres but as is the staple of this genre, the black comedy, there are usually meaningless deaths. I won't spoil what happens but I grew close enough to these characters that I came to hope that we wouldn't be seeing anything bad happen to them.The film also has an interesting and curious romance between Ray and the coke dealer. She seems to give him a lot of chances but it turns out that she has a dark side to her as well.The dialogue was really good and it was clearly an engaging film but a pet peeve of mine in the dialogue is that everyone talks the same and uses the f-word in every sentence. The screenwriter did such a great job of giving everyone distinct personalities so I wish they would give them distinct styles of speech.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It'll send you to the Internet.,"""The Venice of the North . . ."" (Bruges tourist information)I have been in Brussels and Amsterdam, and now thanks to Martin McDonagh's absurdist, existential, and comic film, I have been In Bruges. And, yes, thanks to the cinematography of Eigil Bryid, I am not only loving this European medieval city, with canals and glowing cathedrals, but I am also reminded of the dark shadows and intricate morality of the Third Man.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are hit men waiting days, like players in Beckett or Pinter plays, for orders about their next hit. For Ken, it is a chance to tour a glorious ancient city; for Ray it's a chance not to do that but rather watch a Belgian movie about dwarfs and hook up with the lovely girl who supplies drugs to the cast. Like two buddies from Patrice Leconte's Man on the Train, the boys couldn't be more different except for the deep well of feelings to emerge from an absurd situation.Reluctant as I am to comment on acting, I must confess to being won over by Farrell's sympathetic portrayal of a man/boy haunted by his first hit. Nor does Gleeson's Ken suffer by comparisonhe's tough but caring, willing to take a life or spare one. These guys are also straight out of David Mamet (think of Heist, Spartan, and House of Games)amoral and thoughtful, rude and poetic: Ken urges Ray to climb a medieval tower to look at ""the view""; Ray responds, ""Why do I have to climb up there to see down here? I'm already here."" Or when Ray says, ""If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't."" Perhaps Ray Fiennes Harry, the uber assassin, is more in the Mamet tradition with his repertoire of f-word variations.I am as moved by the existential sub theme as I am by the gallows-humor of these lost souls. As in the Crying Game (in which there is also a skin head former boyfriend and arguable orientations in love and murder), being comfortable in the game of murder is not easy, especially for those who like people a bit too much to be in the business and are uncertain about their identities when it comes to life, love, and death.If for nothing else, In Bruges will send you to the internet for the best travel deal to Belgium. For those who demand meaning married to story, this is a satisfying character study in the best European tradition. At the graveyard time of year for movies, I'm in heaven and Bruges is its name.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Rough around the edges but generally entertaining.,"Though it's a little rough around the edges thanks mainly to some brash, backwards-thinking 'edgy' dialogue (a McDonagh trademark), 'In Bruges (2008)' plays fast and loose with convention to usually crowd-pleasing effect, making for an unpredictable and pacy piece that doesn't stick to the confines of its genre. It's a generally entertaining, twist-and-turn-laden time that has some tangible consequences and proper payoffs for pretty much everything it sets up, including a complete central character arc. Ultimately, though, this tight thriller is let down by the occasionally forced, sometimes (purposefully) inappropriate humour and its overall detrimental 'edginess'. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the best movies so far this year.,"Even if the ""life of a hit-man"" thing has been done many times before, ""In Bruges"" is a great movie, and miles above most of the crap being put out in theaters today.The story is about two hit men, Ray and Ken, who, after a hit that went wrong, are ordered to go to Bruges (it's in Belgium) and wait for their orders there. Ken goes around sightseeing, but Ray hates the place and wants to get out of there as soon as possible. Ray is still haunted by what happened at the last hit (I won't give away what happened, because it might be a spoiler) and is pretty depressed. But it all changes after Ken receives a phone call from his boss...As I said before, the ""life of a hit-man"" genre has been done many times. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""You Kill Me"", movies like that. I somewhat enjoyed ""You Kill Me"", but ""In Bruges"" is a definite step up.Ray and Ken are two interesting characters that are fleshed out well for the movie. They really are two good characters that you end up caring about by the end of the film.The dialog is great, and the black humor is very funny at parts. Some viewers might not ""get"" the humor, but they can just go back to watching recycled crap like ""First Sunday"" and ""Meet the Spartans"". I thought it was really funny.But the tone isn't always humorous, as soon the story turns even darker. The plot is interesting, and there's many unexpected twists along the way. It's a good balance between humor and drama, and the movie plays both perfectly.It's a shame movies like ""Fool's Gold"" get nationwide release and lots of publicity, but a gem like ""In Bruges"" gets forgotten. If you want a great comedy/drama, I definitely recommend ""In Bruges"", but if you want a full-on action-packed thriller, this really isn't what you're wanting.""In Bruges"" has an engrossing plot, great character development and is overall just a GOOD movie. It's out on DVD now, and I definitely recommend that you rent it, or even buy it! It truly is great, and I say: SEE IT.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A very good movie without extra parts,"When i first saw In Bruges, i liked it very much. In a short time, a very good screenplay is brought to us in a beautiful film.I think this movie had the best original screenplay in 2008. I like that movie, because it has lots of good sights. first of all, screenplay is perfect, actors are playing normally, music is great (i think classic music makes movies very pleasant to see), and there are no extra scenes. if there is a scene, is has to be there. i have seen lots of movies which are two and a half hour long and have nothing to tell the audience but a story, which can be brought to them in hour and a half.The movie isn't boring at all. beautiful buildings and European architecture makes the movie very nice to see. In Bruges is a film, not too long and not too short, which gives you it's story in amazing way. You'll also hear some very funny dialogs in the movie, so it won't be boring 110 minutes of criminal story about guys with guns. it has a great ending and it's one of the best movies of modern times for me.I have never heard about Bruges before, but after seeing the film, i really have desire to visit it. i recommend everyone not to miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Disappointing black comedy becomes a fascinating surreal movie,"I watched this film expecting to see a brilliant dark comedy, but I didn't find the jokes funny at all. It was indeed dark, but slow paced and half-way through I was thinking of giving this boring film just 5 stars.But then the story became very surreal and interesting. I started to wonder if Ray was already dead and Bruges itself actually symbolised purgatory, where good (Ken) and evil (Harry) were fighting for Ray's soul.Still not sure what to make of this flick, but I kinda like it now. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Once your in Bruges you'll never want to leave.,"Centered in the small and unappealing town of Bruges in Belgium, this very British based production achieves Hollywood perfection. Redefining the ability to cross cut two differing genres, In Bruges is a comical yet tense work that stands superior to any past production piece regardless of its genre, in which a deep feeling of envy should be felt.Employing a narrative that does not stretch any further than being simple yet engaging, it is a story that features both deep sorrow and realistic humour. As two hit men Ray and Ken exile to Bruges after a hit goes terribly wrong, it focuses on the morals and trauma surrounding the pairs past killings as they engage with the historical beauty of Bruges and the alternate lifestyle it offers. The director Martin McDonagh is vigilante not to glorify the pairs criminal career in any way, which is essential to the realistic factor the film employs, as there is a deep focus on the aftermath and trauma of both their failures and lack of mercy for their victims. The plot from early on is fairly engaging, but it is the truly unsuspecting plot twist that engages the viewer further into the the tension that begins to climatically build from that point. Regardless of the change of attitudes and tipping balance of genre focus that switches between comedy to drama at various points, the comical and emotion provoking actions that the characters commit provide a narrative that is not only unique but surprisingly enjoyable.With a strong focus on a shrewd use of comedy throughout, ""In Bruges"" provides the viewers with an extensive collection of memorable scenes due to the many comical moments and factors that account for the films comedy based success. Being dominated by a fairly broad range of foul mouthed arguments often ending in violence, the more significant comedy factor is present within the difference in ideology and interests between Ray and Ken. With the pairs similarities stretching no further than their corrupt career path, the pair often resemble the powerless father and brat like child relationship in the early aspects of the plot. Yet it is the lack of belonging the pair experience in the somewhat unideal town of Bruges that provide the most credible element of amusement throughout, as two Irish hit men in a small Belgium town is unsurprisingly unideal, as their actions from early on indicate.Incorporating a fairly small yet diverse range of characters, the casting follows other aspects of the films success in being impeccable. With Colin Farrell heading the cast as the guilt stricken hit-man Ray, his performance of a far from stable individual with a lack of enthusiasm for his partners historical interests or Bruges itself is of the highest caliber. Farrell's revival of his often disregarded Irish accent is highly approved of, as it certainly emphasizes the comedy within his dialogue and is obviously an essential factor for the characters portrayal. Brendan Gleeson shares not only the strong Irish accent employed by Farrell, but equals the high standard of his performance. Gleeson's portrayal of the culture loving hit-man Ken tends to be so genuine that his characters career choice tends to seem hard to believe, which is far from a criticism considering his characters purpose is to blend in with the law abiding citizens of Bruges. Ralph Fiennes on the other hand is a far more clouded character for the most part as Ken and Ray's boss Harry. Displaying the ruthlessness not present within the exiled pair of hit men, Fiennes' performances as yet another villain is just as flawless in comparison to his contributions in past productions and his casting colleagues in this one.Where as the visual factors of ""In Bruges"" are immaculate, its relevant soundtrack deserves the same credit. With a primarily piano based soundtrack it is not only suitable for the location of the film, but also adds to the sense of foreboding which ensures the comical factor disappears in the more serious sequences of the films narrative. Without this imperial soundtrack the impressive balance between drama and comedy would certainly be lost.Undoubtedly ""In Bruges"" is one of the most unsuspecting film successes of the 21st century. With a narrative that is easy to follow and thus more engaging, a likable cast of characters and flawless performances by the cast themselves, ""In Bruges"" genuinely is a must see film and shouldn't be overshadowed by its lack of popularity on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Unexpectedly captivating,"I got to In Bruges expecting a comedy . Turned out there was more to it than just that.The movie's style of comedy suits me, so it was a pleasant first half with these in-character performances. As the movie gets darker, the actors still successfully pull it off. Colin Farrell's emotions look genuine.Principle wise, the movie deals with racism and racial prejudices (lightheartedly), as well as a certain criminal code and their willingness to stick to it. The major theme, however, is atonement, and is dealt with quite well.An interesting watch, with a good plot and some real emotions",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Don't look for deeper meanings here, there ain't none","The real charm of this movie is in its setting (Bruges is very picturesque and it's very well used by the director) and Colin Farrell's expressive face. When I first saw it, I was also amazed, but watching it again, its flaws become pretty obvious. The story's full of gaps and things that don't quite add up, and even if you ignore those, it's missing something deeper. And the idea that the characters might be in purgatory isn't all that mind-blowing or original. Overall, it's got a cool vibe, kind of like a medieval fairytale, and it's well-acted and set up, but it's not a masterpiece. If you're not too picky, it's good for a watch, just don't look in it for a deeper meaning it has not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Hit,"After a botched job, two London hit men are sent to Bruges, Belgium to lay low for a while, unaware of what their evil boss has planned for them. A delightful black comedy, highlighted by the witty banter between Farrell and Gleeson, the hit men with contrasting interests. The two actors work well together and Fiennes is hilarious as their quick-tempered boss. The dramatic elements are somewhat weak and don't mesh very well with the comedy, and the last part of the film goes a bit too far with the violence. However, for the most part, this film is quite enjoyable. A remarkable feature film debut for McDonagh, who wrote and directed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Anyway I suspect my comments are confusing and unclear but in a way that is what you kind of experience with these films.One curious thing about the end titles, a fine actor who has a minor speaking role was not credited.

Unexpectedly brilliant!,"If you're trying to decide whether to watch this title or not and are using reviews to help you make a decision, all I can tell you is look no further.

But that was all before I actually got the urge to watch this dare I say it ""masterpiece"". This film has that one key element that i seek for in films: it can hold you glued to your seat and keep your eyes pinned on the screen the entire time. This is the kind of film whose scenes have a way of sticking with you and in a way you keep remembering parts of the movie on daily bases. I was very very surprised, in a good way of course, by this movie. Its incredible to see how much can be done without sky-high budget, explosions, and Hollywood-y environment.

"Horrible gratuitous violence, shallow plot.  Sick garbage film.","Horrible gratuitous violence, shallow plot. Horrible acting (non- Flemings pretending to be Flemish) Every scene degenerates into some kind of bar fight.

Of course there are the stereotypical fat Americans in the first Brugges brawl scene (one of many). More Americans/Canadians in the second or third restaurant brawl scene. Had I seen this in a theater I would have walked out but in my own home I had a morbid fascination at how this pre-adolescent type plot would work out and how many more sick acts of gratuitous violence could be added into one shallow plot.

An excellent example of smart modern cinema,"In Bruges is an impressive feature length debut by playwright Martin McDonagh. Its spot-on pace sparkles with intelligent dialogue and black humour. Within minutes, I felt I knew the principal characters, Irish hit men Ken and Ray (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell), for years, and felt drawn in like an invisible third protagonist to join them on their Leffe-fuelled strolls along the Gothic canals.The titular city functions more than a mere cinematographic backdrop. It evolves with the plot, becoming more otherworldly and menacing as the pitch of impending doom heightens, reaching its crescendo in the final scene as Ray stumbles into the living canvas of Bosch's Last Judgement.It appears obligatory for smart movies these days to reference cult cinema, and In Bruges does contain several such nods, including a recurring homage to Nic Roeg's Don't Look Now, itself referenced in the dialogue. This is does not unduly distract, merely reinforces McDonagh's anchorage in the fabric of unnerving European cinema.Many will principally remember this movie for its laugh-out-loud surrealism, such as the ketamine-stoned, racist dwarf. Yet beneath the buoyant dialogue and memorable set pieces lies a convincing morality tale. The choices and questions effortlessly posed here are no less serious than those in more self-conscious and ponderous recent redemption tales. I actually found myself pausing the movie at one point to ask myself what I would do in a situation.With Tarrantino firing blanks these days, I for one would be delighted to see McDonagh establish himself as the modern champion of smart, edgy cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Darkly Comedic Masterpiece,"In Bruges, directed by Martin McDonagh, is a film that skillfully balances dark comedy with poignant drama, set against the picturesque backdrop of Bruges, Belgium. The story follows two Irish hitmen, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), who are sent to Bruges by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), after a job in London goes terribly wrong.Farrell delivers a standout performance as Ray, a hitman wracked with guilt and existential angst. His comedic timing and emotional depth create a character who is both tragic and endearing. Gleeson, as the seasoned and reflective Ken, provides a perfect counterbalance, grounding the film with his wisdom and compassion. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, adding a layer of authenticity to their complex relationship.Ralph Fiennes, as the volatile and morally rigid Harry, brings an intensity that elevates the film's tension. His presence looms large even when he is off-screen, and his arrival in Bruges sets the stage for the film's explosive climax.McDonagh's screenplay is sharp and witty, filled with memorable lines and thought-provoking themes. The film explores ideas of guilt, redemption, and the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent world. The dialogue is both hilarious and heartbreaking, often within the same scene, showcasing McDonagh's unique talent for blending humor with pathos.The city of Bruges itself plays a crucial role, its medieval architecture and serene canals providing a stark contrast to the violent lives of the protagonists. The cinematography captures the beauty of the city, making it almost a character in its own right.In Bruges is a film that defies easy categorization. It is a dark comedy, a crime thriller and a poignant drama all at once. McDonagh's direction, combined with stellar performances from the cast, makes it a compelling and unforgettable cinematic experience. For those who appreciate films that challenge the conventions of genre and offer a deep, reflective look at the human condition, In Bruges is a must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Morality, violence, character acting, what more can you ask for?","In Bruges was one of those movies you could see becoming great from a distance. The trailer definitely showed promise and the cast and concept seemed good. A while went and I forgot about it, but then it suddenly movie popped up again, so of course I went to see it.Not really sure what to expect other than Colin Farell, and old guy and Ralph Fiennes interacting in the bizarre location of Bruges, Belgium, the movie was a delightful surprise. There is a good dose of humour, dark and somewhat lighter, and there's more humanity than in all of Hollywood's summer blockbusters combined.Superficially a slow actioner, In Bruges is a morality play, which shows the new-comer director's background in the theater. The interaction between the characters, the amazing twists and turns of the story and the great acting between the three lead men(Brendan Gleeson a surprise to me, his Harry Potter role did not impress but how could it have?) is the main thing to expect from this movie, with a clever and exciting climactic ending to top it off.If you liked Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, or Layer Cake, or any other subtle off-beat dark comedy, then this is definitely for you.

The pacing was also all over the place, with some moments feeling out of place and other parts seeming unrealistic, which made it hard to stay engaged.Overall, while the film has some interesting aspects, its heavy-handed approach and pacing issues made it a tough watch for me.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are.... in Bruges,"I tell you what - life is offensive, funny, eclectic, existential, and just plain p!ssed off when you're a hit-man in Bruges.Colin Farrell plays Ray, a very bored philistine hit-man who hates his life, his conscience, and everything about Bruges. His mate Ken, an excellent Brendan Gleeson,, is more stoic, dependable, and has seen it all.What lifts this is not only the script by playwright and first time director Martin McDonagh but the deadpan delivery and wonderful sense of comradeship.Without a doubt one of the better films about hit men of recent memory - better than Matador et al - due to a stonkingly good script and lots and lots of little touches and surprises.

A decent crime flick but nothing particularly special,"""In Bruges"" is a crime flick like so many in recent years that explore the lives and moral dilemmas of criminals. In this case, the film centres on two hit men holed up in Bruges, Belgium after a hit gone wrong. When it becomes apparent that someone is going to have to take the fall questions of right and wrong are raised.The cast is a pretty good one with Brendan Gleeson & Colin Farrell working well together. I give the edge to Gleeson in the acting department but that may be because Farrell's character is rather unlikable (at least initially). Ralph Fiennes also turns in a good performance as their menacing boss and Clémence Poésy amply supplies the eye candy.The script is better than average but I wouldn't rank it alongside the best films of this type. It's got much of the same flavour but it just isn't as memorable. Overall, the storyline is pretty satisfying though it surprises me to see this film classed as a comedy.The technical side of things is ably handled but not particularly notable.In the end, this is a worthwhile film if you're looking for something along the lines of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" et al., except with more depth. While I think that this film lacks the indefinable spark that makes the best of those films appealing it is nevertheless a fairly unique spin on similar material.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Another terrific film from the U.K.,"This is the first feature film of director Martin McDonagh. His previous foray into film was the short, ""Six Shooter"" which, come to think of it, would be an ideal addition when ""In Bruges"" is released on DVD. ""In Bruges"" is a superior English gangster film, similar, but not an echo of those two other great English gangster films, ""The Long Good Friday"" and ""Sexy Beast"" Indeed, the Harry Waters character played with venomous realism by Ralph Fiennes is strikingly similar to the Don Logan character (played with even more toxicity by Ben Kingsley), in ""Sexy Beast"" But there is where any resemblance ends. Whereas the ""The Long Good Friday"" was about power and how easily it can slip through one's fingers, and ""Sexy Beast"" was about a retired criminal being persuaded to carry out one last job, ""In Bruges"" is about the aftermath of a 'hit.' Ray and Ken (Farrell and Gleeson respectively), play two hit men. The film opens with postcard scenes of the old city of Bruges in Belgium, while a voice over explains why these two men find themselves in this ancient city. Ken is the more pragmatic of the two. He is quite content to do a spot of 'sightseeing.'while awaiting further instructions. Ray on the other hand, thinks Bruges is a dump. Ray just wants to get back to the city he was born in, Dublin. But, as the film progresses, it's gradually revealed why both men have to hang around, till they receive these 'further instructions.' When the instructions finally comes, is not what we expect. Both Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell, are terrific, especially Farrell as Ray. The supporting cast is equally good  Jordan Prentice as ""Jimmy, Zeljko Ivanek as the 'Canadian"", and Eric Godon as 'Yuri"" There were a few instances in the film I found somewhat confusing  but to list them would be both superfluous, unnecessary, and would spoil other film goers enjoyment. ""In Bruges"" is a rollicking yarn, expertly crafted, with great dialogue and many an unexpected plot twist. I recommend it unreservedly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"interesting, but feels more like an intellectual exercise than a story","Do really awful people have a strict moral code and deep conscience? I'm going to guess no, but In Bruges suggests writer/director Martin McDonagh might disagree.In Bruges begins with two guys checking into a hotel in Bruges. They have come to wait an unspecified amount of time to speak to someone. They go sightseeing. One man loves Bruges, the other finds it tedious.This is maybe the first third of the movie, which is sometimes amusing but doesn't give you much to hold onto. Then a flurry of things happen and an elaborate, ingenious story kicks in. And that part involves terrible people being shockingly full of scruples.The film is very well acted and generally amusing with some dark and occasionally suspenseful moments, yet I was never fully drawn in. The ingenuity of the story and moral code of the protagonists felt like dramatic devices rather than something that comes from real life experience. A false clever plot and unlikely characters is not inherently unworkable, and I think the problem is less the script than that McDonagh can't quite figure out how to flesh that script with human complexity (something he successfully did in ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."")I enjoyed this well enough, but I wouldn't say it's something you should seek out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Loved every minute of it,At first glance of the DVD case of In Bruges i didn't think much of it.But by the end of the film i have just one thing to say that is: one of the best films i've ever seen.The story is a great mix of humour and Darkness about two hit men hiding out in Bruges (it's in Belgium) who come to terms with their past and death.This is the best film so far with Colin Farrel who plays the young hit-man and Gleeson is superb as the more experienced of the two. Also Ralph Finnes is great as the foul mouthed gang leader who's out to level the scores.

In Bruges..... What a sneaky little b*****d!,"In Bruges came out of absolutely nowhere and put our faith back into the British gangster flick with its fast paced script, amazing acting talents and sheer wittiness.Colin Farrell is slightly underrated in his acting talents but mainly due to the fact his acting CV consists of roles in slightly terrible films (Daredevil for one) but to deny this man his praise for his portrayal of Ray in this film would be nothing short of a disgrace. Holed up in a the shitty little town of Bruges after a hit goes wrong you can see that the character of Ray is too large for such a small town. Brendan Gleeson brings us one of the best characters I've seen him play in a long time as Ken the professional hit-man acting more along the lines of a father figure to Ray. In Bruges is one of the freshest pieces of British cinema i've witnessed since Sexy Beast and we all know the two main reasons that film was fantastic but in this the angry English hit-man/gangster type role is left to the ever great Ralph Fiennes playing Harry, who's psychotic and ruthless persona sets up for a fantastic villain.

"Odd, but great","After watching 5 minutes, I knew that this will be a great movie. Great conversations, great music, great atmosphere. 3 of the most important things for me when it comes to movies.The only thing that stroke me as a bit odd, was the character Colin has been playing. A naive, childish, conscience-smitten killer with a short temper and a disposition to violence. Even though he was childish and naive, he still was skilled at flirting, and decently witty. An impossible to play character. Collin Farrel made the best out of it.My other problem has been the story. The story isn't too bad, but I found, it had too many coincidences. But, if you don't really pay attention, and if you don't have to analyze everything to death (as I tend to do), you will probably not notice how empty the story is, simply because it is told quite well.If you are a fan of cool gangster movies, like Tarentino movies, this might be for you.

"Funny, poignant, genuinely interesting.","Playwright Martin McDonagh makes an assured feature film-making debut with this witty and generally amusing combination of dark comedy, drama, crime picture, and travelogue.The Bruges of the title is a Belgian city with a real storybook quality and which is a magnet for the tourist trade. Hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have been sent there on orders from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) after a job has been botched and a young boy accidentally killed. They're instructed to take in the sights - which Ken is more than happy to do - while awaiting further orders. But Ray is grumpy and bored and thinks that spending time in Bruges is like spending time in Purgatory.Audiences accustomed to loud and fast action films may possibly find this to be just as dull as Ray finds Bruges, but some may also consider this to be a rather interesting breath of fresh air. It's very dependent on character and situation, and working from McDonaghs' script, the three principal actors do excellent jobs creating well rounded individuals who may be in a morbid line of work but who each have their own moral code.Among the assorted episodes of the story, Ray romances a free-spirited local named Chloe (Clemence Poesy), makes the acquaintance of a little person named Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), gets briefly menaced by Chloes' associate Eirik (Jeremie Renier), roughs up a loud-mouthed Canadian guy (!) portrayed by Zeljko Ivanek, and learns the truth about why he and Ken were sent to Bruges in the first place.McDonaghs' dialogue is sometimes surprising and often quite funny; he gives the material an impressively politically incorrect flair. There are spurts of bloody violence here and there, but what the writer / director often sets out to do is actually subvert the conventions of typical crime-gone-wrong flicks, even coming up with a way to avoid the kind of shootout one might normally see in this sort of thing. Beautiful photography and scenery are of course a credit to the film; the city does become a character in its own right. The music by Carter Burwell is superb at setting the mood. The three leads are terrific, with Fiennes showing a winning aptitude for comedy, and Farrell and Gleeson definitely managing to win our sympathies. They help to make this nicely offbeat film worth seeking out for movie lovers who get tired of more formulaic fare. Recommended.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Beautifully filmed,"I'm a fan and I don't mind the violence, which is an essential part of a film about hit men. The characters are violent men but we see that they all have a softer side. The darkness at the heart of even a beautiful place like the touristy city of Bruges is evident, and although the city is shown in all its beauty, I'm ready to believe that there is indeed a seedier side - there always is in any place of beauty.Colin Farrell's performance is excellent, as is Brendan Gleeson and of course Ralph Fiennes. The supporting cast are also very good, and the balance of humour and tragedy is satisfying. I also think the ending is great, unexpected and appropriate.I have been to Bruges several times and it is exactly like that, except hopefully without the violence. I recommend this film to anyone with an open mind who appreciates lovely architecture, dark humour and doesn't mind very strong language.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A film that I was expecting to like. Unfortunately, it's one I was underwhelmed by.","'In Bruges' is a film that I was expecting to like. Unfortunately, it's one I was underwhelmed by. We were clearly on to a good thing with Martin McDonagh, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson (see: 'The Banshees of Inisherin') but I didn't enjoy them on this occasion.There are glimpses of it working and there are still a couple of moments where I could see myself liking it. I will say that the final 30 minutes or so is better, though what precedes does the damage in my opinion. The humour is its biggest fault, only one or two jokes got me.Farrell and Gleeson are, nevertheless, a solid pairing, as we see to far greater effect with that 2022 film. The latter is the stand out here, Farrell's character is a bit too irritating for my liking. Away from them, Ralph Fiennes is decent, his distracting accent is bad though.Elsewhere on the cast, there are not one but two stars from 'The Walking Dead' universe in this - from differing spin-offs, interestingly. Clémence Poésy of 'Daryl Dixon' (great in that, fwiw) and Zeljko Ivanek of 'Dead City'. Love me some TWD.I also love McDonagh's other work in 'The Banshees of Inisherin' and, especially, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'. So I guess one was gonna be a miss at some point, fingers crossed I enjoy 2012's 'Seven Psychopaths'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
this movie was a pleasant surprise,"i expected a British comedy, which i love, and got it. But i also got a movie that has that single indescribable quality that so few films have. I rank this one right up there with films like fight club, lost in translation, and No country for old men. which i hold in high regard. On a final note does any1 else think that Bredan Gleeson should get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor? I do i was very impressed with his acting in this move. I felt that it was much better than it was in gangs of new york and way better than in the fifth harry potter film. Id like some other opinions on this so let me know.Aside from the acting I also enjoyed what i saw as an increase in realism when compared to other (American) films. Not realism in the sense that i thought the character Ken should have survived that amount of blood loss and a fall of somewhere around twelve stories, , let alone be able to mutter words and have them make sense. But the realism in that they did not curb anything for sake of getting a lower age rating. They said what they wanted too, and used an uncommon amount of blood when compared to many other films. Especially the last time Ken is shot and when he hits the pavement from the tower.Lastly did any1 else think that the costumes and scenery for the movie that was being filmed at the end was supposed to be a reference back to the painting that Ray and Ken discussed in the museum? Let me know your thought on the matter.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Bruges is a stage,"If I had to describe ""In Bruges"" in one word it would be - theater. Because that's how I felt after I saw it.Story about two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) who were sent to hide in Bruges by their boss (Ralph Fiennes) is dark comedy with brilliant screenplay. Dialogue is just fantastic, it's incredible how you can be pulled to screen watching dialogue about midget war or touristic attraction of Bruges. But don't be fooled - behind, on first sight, irrelevant conversations and witty dialogues lie existentialistic questions about life and death and everything between. Why theater? Well, through this brilliant dialogue (base of every good play), in Bruges as stage, develops relationship between four main characters - nihilist Ray (Collin Farrell), experienced Ken (Brendan Gleeson), energetic Harry (Ralph Fiennes) and Bruges itself. Besides this there are great supporting characters - hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten), midget Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), Ray's girlfriend Chloe (Clemence Poesi) and many others. Acting is excellent with actors fitting roles perfectly. Very nice surprise is Collin Farrell who has proved he can carry film as leading actor.With European touch of Martin McDonagh ""In Bruges"" became one of the best films I saw this year, if not the best.

Wonderful characterisation, fantastic performances, real surprises, sublime dialogue, funny and beautifully tragic, what else can you ask for? Colin Farrell is absolutely superb, bringing life to a character at a level that is surely beyond the call of a man who has 'made it' in Hollywood.

In Bruges Much Better Than Expected,"In Bruges was a better than expected action crime thriller comedy because of the great performances by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two hit men held up in Bruges after a difficult job, and Raplh Fiennes in a brief role as their angry boss. Writer/Director Martin McDonagh does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen with just enough humor, action, and some suspense thats makes In Bruges an enjoyable film. The rest of supporting cast are good in their roles but it's Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes who stand out amongst them. In Bruges impressed me it was funny at times and violent with dark humor. Most of the screen time is given to the two leads (Farrell and Gleeson) who definitely make the best of it their scenes together are worth watching the film alone. Ralph Fiennes does lack screen time because he doesn't show up until late into the movie but he does a decent enough job with his smart part. I recommend anyone looking for a movie to watch thats different and entertaining at the same time most of that because of the terrific performances by Farrell and Gleeson.

McDonagh's premise could have been really cliché, there's plenty of movies about Hit-Mans. Also his movie doesn't try to be cool as well, which it's quite unique. Farrell is excellent in the picture, i haven't seen him this good in a movie (Although his dialogue are hard to understand at times, since he has a thick Irish accent). Gleeson is terrific as well. Poséy is certainly a great talent to watch for, since she's very beautiful as well. Fiennes is a hoot as the vulgar boss, which his dialogue are hilarious.

"I loved the first, slow paced, first half more.","""In Bruges"" was the feature length debut of director Martin McDonagh. It is about a friendship under pressure between Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell). Fourteen years later the same director would make another movie about a friendship under pressure (although because of very different reasons) between two friends played by the very same actors (""The Banshees of Inisherin"", 2022).In ""In Bruges"" two hitman are hiding in the Belgian city of Bruges after an assignment gone terribly wrong. They are waiting for their next assignment. The arrival of the next assignment cuts the film into two pieces.The first half of the film sees the two main characters coming to terms with the tragedy that their last assignment had become. Brendon does this by admiring the (religious) art of Bruges, thereby emphasizing the idyllic image of this city. Ray uses booze, drugs and women, coming together in the tantalizing character of Chloë (Clémence Poésy). Thereby Ray shows that under the tourist surface of Bruges there is a wild and chaotic undertow, just like David Lynch showed in ""Blue velvet"" (1986).After the next assignment the pace of the film accelerates and the plot grows increasingly surprising. Some reviewers compare the second part with ""Pulp fiction"" (1994, Quentin Tarantino) Ken and Ray being a sort of Vincent Vega ((John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). I can't say anything sensible about it, because I never saw ""Pulp fiction"". The only thing I know is that I loved the first, slow paced, first half more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Bad copy of ""Sexy beast""","Yet another Brit-underworld film that tries far too hard. Two hit men hide out in Bruges after botching a job, and we're supposed to buy into some arc of redemption. But do we really need another dive into the world of brooding criminals?The movie desperately wants to channel The Third Man and Sexy Beast, but its attempts at humor, style, and wit fall flat. And Bruges - let's be honest, despite the film's efforts, it's not exactly a must-see destination, as Colin Farrell's character bluntly points out.Borrowing from The Third Man, the film gives us a villain named Harry. Ralph Fiennes tries to be the charming psycho like Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, but he wobbles between crazed gangster and doting dad, and neither is convincing. Kingsley nailed it because he embraced the lunacy, without any fatherly mush.The real issue, though, is the laughable idea that these criminals care about collateral damage. If they had consciences, they wouldn't be criminals in the first place.It's also impossible to root for these characters. They drone on with absurd dialogue, their actions make no sense for hardened criminals, and they're just plain unlikable. Farrell's ""nice bad guy"" has major anger issues - at one point, he beats up a man and his girlfriend over a cigarette complaint. Handsome or not, that's a hard pass for me.The glowing reviews mystify me, but maybe that's because I've been to Bruges, and once was more than enough.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Literate,Bloody Crime Caper","In an era when script tends to play a poor second fiddle to visuals, this fine story restores your faith in storytelling. Writer and producer Martin McDonagh already has a distinguished pedigree as a playwright, ""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"" being perhaps his finest work to date. When some playwrights bring their craft to the big screen they fail to grasp the possibilities that a space beyond a stage offers them. With McDonagh, he brings the best of the intensity of the stage to the screen.The storyline is simple, two hit men flee London after a job to Bruges, and await instructions.Played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the first hour is an absolute joy.They talk, they reflect they discuss in a manner very reminiscent of Travolta and Jackson in Pulp Fiction.Intermittently very violent the film oozes restraint making the bloody outbursts even more shocking.A perverse gunman's morality also underpins everything which passes.Ralph Fiennes has great fun as ""Godfather"", Harry in a role which acknowledges that played by Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"".As is the hallmark of most playwrights, the story has a ""proper"" end and is all the more satisfying for it.With Tarrantino and Ritchie seemingly spent forces at the moment the field is open for the likes of McDonagh and the Coen brothers to blaze a trail for 21st Century crime capers.At just over an hour and a half the film also displays a rare discipline as the viewer quickly learns to soak in each setting and each exchange of ""badinage"" , so little is wasted.As of early May, my favourite film of 2008.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Modern Monument To 'Shakespearean-like' Storytelling,"In Bruges is a truly wonderful film set in Belgium (... in Bruges), starring Colin Farrell, Ralph Fiennes, and one of the greatest performances from the past 5 years in cinema, from Brendan Gleeson. The plot in brief is two Irish assassins are sent to a hide out after a mission gone awry, with little or no idea of their objectives out in Belgium. After some 'sight-seeing', their boss gets in contact, and the whole dynamic of the film is shaken. As emotions of hate, self-loathing, and prevailing love and compassion become apparent, the film spirals into a grandiose 'Tarantino' esque encounter.The action takes awhile to come in, meaningfully fitted into the narrative, and unlike so many other modern day pictures, never needs to be excused for.There's plenty of gripping, intense, and highly emotional scenes, at it's apex felt in one of the most poignant moments of the past decade in film, involving Brendan Gleeson and a perfectly chosen track from the Dubliners. Whether it's the soundtrack or cast, this film has Celtic blood coursing through it's veins, and no matter how alien the surroundings are, this iconic scene couldn't have been more pertinent with regard to the over-arching theme. I may just have had a tear in my eye.And whether it's midgets in dream-like art house productions in the cobbled streets of Bruges, or fat snooty elephants, or 'Americans', walking up a narrow staircase, the dark humour is great, and will certainly satisfy those in hunger of satire amongst the morbidity bursting at the seams of the piece.For anyone who has seen Sexy Beast, Fiennes is the Ben Kingsley equivalent, the rabid mob boss with a blood-lust, but not without a conscience. This film is too clever to deal in the absolutes, 'Good vs Evil', of traditional Hollywood; the moral compass wavers throughout, and becomes a confrontation based on outlooks over complex subjects like retribution and punishment, grounded where no one is of the divine.The cinematography is breathtaking, and the whole plot feels very Shakespearean, as a modestly sized ensemble of characters are weaved into the film, always with a purpose.And perhaps most of all, i finally 'got' Colin Farrell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Real Gritty and Edgy Drama That Misses In Places,"28 January 2009. ""In Bruges"" is an uncomfortable experience with Colin Farrell as a rather abrasive protagonist and not the most likable fellow who is both insensitive and a brute and its a wonder why a woman would actually like him. While there's an effort to portray him with some remnant of sympathy, his guilt seems to wear a bit thin. This a beautifully well shot movie, with much of the foreign flavor captured on film along with a lovely musical score. The script is strong, harsh, brutal along with some rather risky comical inserts that are in a few places appear forced for aesthetic sake. Overall, this is an intensely strong and moving film if one can except the characters, their circumstances. Perhaps, in some ways, Colin Farrell reflects a little bit of reality of all of us, the good and the dirty parts. In this way, the movie might be considered actually a black, dark comedy of some note. The ending is a bit convenient, maybe too much so for the audience's discretion to make it what they want.

A cult classic in the making,"Colin Farrel and Brendan Gleeson work perfectly together as characters with opposing minds. The performance of Colin Farrel reminds me of his great and under appreciated work in Phonebooth. The beginning may appear slow to many, but it is the cause for it becoming popular upon others. The constant and offensive dialogue by Farrel will cause many laughs and spark the interest of any movie lover. Gleeson's role further enhances everything that Farrel does in the film. Ralph Fiennes plays his role perfectly and is compatible with the other characters.A person choosing to watch this film will be delightfully surprised and enjoy every second. The cast mends together fantastically and there is not a single character that doesn't cause an eyebrow to be raised.

A fairytale town...but this is no fairytale,"Bruges. It's in Belgium. And after a job gone wrong two Irish hit-men, Ken and Ray, are sent there to hide out. Their boss loves the place, calling it a fairytale town. Ken becomes a happy tourist, embracing the chance to explore the best-preserved Medieval city in Belgium. Ray is not happy. He wants out of Bruges from the moment he gets there. Touring a Medieval city is not his thing. And it also becomes very quickly obvious that Ray is tormented by something. The film is very smart in waiting to reveal exactly what it is that is weighing so heavily on Ray's mind. When all is revealed a new spin is put on things. The story, which to that point had seemed to be an odd couple comedy, takes an emotional turn. But the film never stops giving you plenty to laugh at. And when Ken and Ray's boss reveals exactly why he sent them to Bruges the film turns again, giving us some action, drama and real suspense. But still laughs too. Always laughs. The film has serious elements but at heart it's always a comedy. A very dark comedy. And a very good one.Much of the credit for the film's success has to go to the actors portraying Ken and Ray. Brendan Gleeson is perfect as Ken, the older and wiser of the pair. And Colin Farrell is excellent as young hothead Ray. Farrell is hilarious in Ray's biting exchanges with Ken about the merits, or lack thereof, of Bruges. But Farrell also nails the serious, emotional side of the character. Gleeson and Farrell really do make for the perfect screen pairing. It helps that they have a great script to work with, writer/director Martin McDonagh providing them with plenty of hilarious dialogue all along the way. The starring pair are also ably supported by some other performers. Ken and Ray's boss is not revealed until well into the picture and when he arrives things really kick up a notch. This guy is explosive and, in his own unique way, hilarious. There's a woman involved, she's about the only thing in Bruges which Ray finds appealing. Oh, there's also a cocaine-snorting racist dwarf with an affinity for hookers.In this film the city of Bruges itself is just as important a character as any of the people. What a lovely city, and director McDonagh shows it off beautifully. It may not be Ray's thing but chances are you'll want to visit the place after seeing the film. And you'll probably want to see the film another time or two as well. It's a dark comedy which gives you plenty of laughs but it has a great deal of heart as well. And some good action too.

"Dark, engaging, alcoves.","Had no doubts giving this one an 8/10. Just back recently from a cumbersome rating dilemma which saw me settle for a similar score for Pan's Labyrinth, which further strengthens my stand that IMDb should let us vote with more accuracy (for example 7.7, what pans labyrinth should've deserved).I loved in Bruges. I thought there really was nothing wrong with it. How the dark elements were incorporated into the film, as well as the mesmerizingly haunting soundtrack that just weaved into everything nice and well. Colin Farrell did surprisingly well, with his native Irish tongue it was all set up for him to nail the role. Brendan Gleeson does well in his role too. Ralph Fiennes does a stellar job, being cast as the boss Harry Waters, classically and stylishly encompassing the character. Blatantly or so, he is extremely comparable to Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast.The magnificence of the Belgian surroundings coupled with the soundtrack is what really brings this movie along. The screenplay is also equally matched if not better. I would recommend In Bruges to all who've seen one too many of the usual stuff.

A Crisp Thriller,"Imagine Christmas in a medieval European town, complete with cathedrals, graceful swans gently gliding along on a river – ""a fairyland"" – as one character describes the setting for In Bruges, a film starring Colin Farrell, Bredan Gleeson, and Joseph Fiennes. Yet before we get too comfortable with the view, don't forget we're talking about a Colin Farrell movie here. The fairyland setting begins to ring false almost from the moment our two mismatched characters, Ken and Ray, stumble into Bruges, a quaint little town in Belgium.Ken and Ray have been abruptly ordered by their boss, Harry, to lay low in Bruges, following a routine hit gone very wrong for two weeks. As the boys settle into their hotel, sharing a room instead of being in separate rooms, even we get the hint that nothing will be going quite the way either of them wants.I must say that Colin Farrell's raw-ready portrayal of a tightly wound, would-be hit man, gives me renewed faith in his talents and his current career choices. (Apparently, so did the Golden Globes 2009!) As a man running from his boss, his past misdeeds, and his failed life, Farrell's performance commands us to feel more deeply for Ray than he may actually feel for himself. Awash in overwhelming guilt and remorse for an accident cloaked within a heinous crime, Ray careens through his involuntary vacation of high-brow culture and low-lifes for which his partner and friend, Ray must woefully shoulder.Ray, played by Brenden Gleeson, serves as a steady counter-point to his strung-out partner. Gleeson is a quiet marvel of studied self-control. His Ray is at once genial and half-mocking, only to reveal a kindred ranting soul, seething at the injustices of his world, which forces him to make unpleasant choices that he can't neatly rationalize and would rather not face at all.A deft supporting cast and subtle directing blend to lift this sharp little Indie film to a three-reeler for me. The only weakness for In Bruges is the screenplay, which at time wants to bludgeon us with the sin vs. redemption theme overandoverandover again. The triteness of Harry's final act almost ruins Ray's bittersweet hope for his future for us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Most underrated movie of 2008,"Whenever one of my friends comes over for a movie night, I always desperately try to elbow this movie into our play list. Generally, the consensus of this film is that it will be a boring British film. I mean how could a British film be exciting with Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes set in a small Belgian town? What my friends soon realize is that this movie is completely off the wall! It masterfully balances comedy, violence and drama. There are so many laugh out loud scenes that if I tried to describe all of them I would explain the entire film, suffice to say by the end my throat was sore from laughing so god damned much. The characters are amazingly well realized especially Ralph Fiennes, who provides an amazing performance. Also people who say that Colin Farrel is a poor actor will retract those comments after seeing this film.

Two mismatched hoodlums, more emotionally attached to each other than they initially suspect.The story of IN BRUGES becomes more surreal as it moves to its climax, a progression that for me doesn't quite come off - perhaps it needed more swirling mists and arty camera work a little earlier than the writer/director opted for.

Good dark comedy with a mini series feel.,"This was a good dark comedy; could've have been great. The casting was on point...except for the girl. She was 2 dimensional and not fully actualized. She was a moot point in the movie and could've been played without any words being spoken at all and still would have come across the same way. The dwarf didn't go too gimmicky like movies usually portray them. However, the other characters were preformed beautifully. The writing was excellent sometimes almost tipping into cheesy. However, the acting brought it back from tipping over. It starts off a little too slow but slowly rolls into a more interesting film.

A Movie That Defies Description (In a Good Way),"Writer/director Martin McDonagh has fashioned a little gem of a crime thriller/black comedy with his film, ""In Bruges."" It's quirky and eccentric, but in a way that comes naturally and doesn't feel remotely forced. And despite the running joke about Bruges being such a boring and dull place to be, the movie makes the city itself look lovely.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) play two hit men who hole up in the titular city awaiting orders from their boss, Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes. Both suffer a crisis of conscience -- Ray because his first hit resulted in his accidentally killing a little boy, Ken because his orders once they come are to bump off Ray, who annoys him but who he rather likes. When Ken tells Harry he refuses to kill Ray, Harry comes after the two men himself, resulting in a quite violent finale.McDonagh's background in theatre shows, especially in his writing. The screenplay to ""In Bruges"" is a marvel, tightly wound and compact. It's fresh and surprising, traits that don't frequently describe movie scripts nowadays. The movie is viciously funny, but the relationship between Ray and Ken is also rather moving, and the violence (and boy is it graphic at times) is very disturbing precisely because we come to care so much about the characters it's happening to.All of the performances, but especially those of Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes, are superb.

Uber violent look at the duality of humanity's inanity and search for principled living,"This movie raises existential questions about life and meaning when two hit men are ordered to spend time in Bruge, a picturesque, Flemish part of Belgium. Along the way to facing questions such as why pregnant mothers and children deserve special protection that life-stained adults do not, you'll wade through drunken, drug-induced attempts to dampen the meaninglessness of life, together with attempts to connect in romance and pleasure, and even some admirable bravery. I thought the story was just too indulgent in terms of violence that it's legitimacy and storyline was somewhat undermined. Still, it does deliver a wake up call to those who are tempted to float, dreamlike through life without grounding themselves in First Things that genuinely are seeds of true meaningful, fulfilling life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the best films of the year,"I like to think of movies like In Bruges as genuine gems. When I say ""movies like In Bruges"", I necessarily think of films with similar subject matter. I tend to think of those kind of films which justappear. Out of nowhere, you hear about a movie. The promotional material looks rather impressive. The film looks like it belongs to a genre you're interested in. You allow yourself a glimpse of the basic plot (no more, lest the experience is spoilt) and it sounds like something that, in the right hands, could be inflated into a compelling piece of cinema. In Bruges is a tick in each of those boxes. As of writing, I'd definitely consider it one of the best films I've seen all year, if not the best outright.""What makes you say that?"" you may ask. I guess the simple answer is this  everything. Yes, I know, very simple  but everything in this movie just falls right into place and the result is a finely polished caper flick. If I had to pinpoint the film's strongest individual part, I'd say it was the script. Writer-director McDonagh is also a renowned playwright, and the same quality translates to the film's story. In Bruges has a very play-like feel to it, largely due to its heavy reliance on character development. As the two leads, Gleeson and Farrell are nothing short of brilliant. They are capable of taking several different ""duo"" clichés and twisting them into something that feels surprisingly fresh, and even when they're not paired together, they maintain strong presences on-screen. Gleeson is perfect as the amiable Ken, but Farrell truly shines as Ray, who balances cockiness with insecurity deftly. Even though I haven't seen much of Farrell's other work, I honestly think he turned in a potential career-best act here.The supporting cast is also treated very well. Even the smallest supporting characters are a source of great comedy or great drama, whatever may be needed. Whenever they reappear in the story, it never feels forced but fits in perfectly. Out of all of them, Jordan Prentice steals the show as an embittered American dwarf who's in Bruges to make an art-house film. The only real weakness I could find with the cast was Clémence Poésy as drug-dealer/love interest Chlöe, who isn't necessarily bad, but isn't really given anything spectacular to work with.The film rolls along at a great pace. There is the very occasional scene that doesn't feel like it goes anywhere, but the rest of it manages to be great. The balance between comedy (largely as a result of Ray's none-too-pleasant altercations with locals and non-locals alike) and drama is excellent. The film has countless laugh-out-loud moments, yet it also has some genuinely shocking twists in it. It manages to remain compelling all throughout its running time. Another aspect I feel really gives the film a distinct feel is the location of Bruges itself. You've got to love those films where the location virtually becomes a character in the story, and Bruges (memorably described by Ralph Fiennes's Harry as a ""beautiful f***ing fairy tale town"") certainly comes into its own as such a ""character"". The locales are brilliant, none so much as the Bell Tower, which is easily the most memorable building featured in the film.To conclude, I loved In Bruges. Plain and simple. It's a hundred-odd minutes worth of entertainment, both comedic and tragic. What few flaws this film has are made up for by its many strengths. It may be a little strong in the violence/language department, but if that doesn't bother you, you should enjoy this, easily one of the best films I've watched in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fantastic,"I saw this movie on a whim. I had heard good things about it from friends, and the reviews seemed positive enough, but I wasn't necessarily chomping at the bit to see it. I wasn't terribly impressed with Martin McDonough's Oscar-winning short film Revolver, but, based on the buzz, I figured In Bruges was worth a look. I was very mistaken in my assumptions. This is an absolutely fantastic movie. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are both phenomenal, and Ralph Fiennes, though he only appears halfway through the film, is perfect as a hard-edged crime boss with a short fuse. Colin Farrell tends to catch a lot of guff for his performances, but I have always found him to be a very talented actor. He may not always choose the best roles, but in everything that I've seen him in he has engaged me as a viewer. Here, his work is superb. He nails everything about the character of Ray, and is utterly believable as a hit-man wrestling with his demons. Clemence Poesy is good as well, and obviously very beautiful and enigmatic, though her character wasn't as fully fleshed out as I would have liked. Bruges makes a gorgeous backdrop for the action of the film, and having recently returned from Belgium myself (not Bruges, however, though now I wish I'd gone there), the charm of the country and the overwhelming sense of history is captured perfectly. The fairytale town is not only beautiful, but its atmosphere and the palpable sense of medieval ideals are essential to the central ideas of the story. And what a story it is. In my opinion, the script is the strength of this film. Thematically, emotionally, and narratively, this script is firing on all cylinders. McDonough does a fantastic job of connecting the characters not only through their actions, but through the dramatic tension inherent in maintaining proximity with people whom you may not really like. The relationship that evolves between Ray and Ken is brilliant, and the secondary characters fill in the gaps admirably. The sense of sacrifice and redemption is handled very well, and at no point do the actions taken by the characters feel forced or unrealistic. Nor do their interactions with one another feel overly expository. Everything is very even-handed, and McDonough has crafted one hell of a well-balanced. The trailers lead one to believe that this is a sort of noir/comedy. It is, in a sense, and there are many funny parts, but there are some very serious themes presented here. Hell, guilt, redemption, and sacrifice are the themes that drive the story, and Martin McDounough's ability to inject humor into very serious subject matter is part of what makes this film so successful. Overall, a great movie, and an exceptionally original piece of film-making.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Into 90% Of This Film,"Bruges, the most well-preserved medieval city in the whole of Belgium, is a welcoming destination for travelers from all over the world. But for hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), it could be their final destination; a difficult job has resulted in the pair being ordered right before Christmas by their London boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to go and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for a couple of weeks.Very much out of place amidst the Gothic architecture, canals, and cobbled streets, the two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city.But the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor (Jordan Prentice) shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloe (Clemence Poesy), who may have some dark secrets of her own. And when the call from Harry does finally come, Ken and Ray's vacation becomes a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences.

a must watch =],"This must be my first time ever writing a review for any movie on IMDb. I often refer to the reviews on IMDb, but never quite felt the need to comment on the movies I have watched. In Bruges, it seems, is not very well known. But it is definitely the best movie I have seen in a while.I was told that it was a witty movie about two hit men and that's about all I really knew about the movie itself. I'd never seen the trailer or anything. I must admit that Bruges is a beautiful place and the cinematography excellently brought out the finer points of the little town. I'd have to say that it was slow in the beginning and left me in a state of curiosity, but things all worked themselves into place eventually and the movie itself was more emotional than I had expected. I loved the Irish humour and it was a good balance for the emotional strings that the movie managed to pull.I've told everyone I've talked to that they should watch this movie.

Decent Comedy/Drama,"This one wasn't bad. I read a lot of reviews that raved for this movie. I don't think it was that great but it was still a relatively good Comedy/Drama. It's got some good looking women, hit men, a even a midget, or dwarf, or little person depending on what you prefer.Colin Farrel plays Ray a hit-man who travels with a fellow hit-man Ken (Brendan Gleeson) to Bruges, Belgium to complete a job for their boss (Ralph Fiennes) Harry. Ray completes the job but is grief stricken when he inadvertently makes a mistake taking out and innocent bystander. Now, his friend and partner Ken is tasked with a hit on Ray. Choices need to be made and it takes both men through quite a mix of characters on the way to a conclusion.It sounds like a pretty grim, more action based drama, but it's not. The comedy aspects are pretty good ala a good Quentin Tarantino, and like his films is pretty dialog heavy, but worth listening to. There wasn't a lot of action in this one, but it is a pretty smart, funny, and intelligent movie.A 7 is the best I can give this one, but a 7 for me is definitely worth a view.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hmm...,"...a few of months back, when my uncle returned home from one of his many business trips, a DVD copy of 'In Bruges' returned with him. Being a fool, i ended up judging the film by it's cover and deciding not to dedicate precious time to viewing it. A combination of incidents including the Christmas holidays and having nothing better to do, resulted in me giving the ""shithole"" of Bruges a try.What i found is quite hard to describe. Comedy? perhaps, i hope i'm not too rude to say that this film was too good to be categorized as a comedy. Drama? that might be it, but then again...no. Anyways, the film takes place in Bruges. ""Where the **** is Bruges? It's in Belgium."" Two hit-man are sent there after completing a mission, and are being asked to wait for further instructions.Beautiful, Beautiful cinematography of Christmas time in a small town known mostly for it's well preserved medieval and Gothic character. A most captivating Original Soundtrack composed by Carter Burwell. Brilliant script writing, including a great, great dialogue as well as a impressive direction debut, both by Martin McDonagh. Adding to that a cast led by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes along with magnificent smaller roles by more unpopular faces portraying a dwarf, a female lover, a Russian gun supplier, an historical tower manager and a local policeman. And there you have your Must-See!I'll end by referring to what turned this film from just being good to being great, to me at least, and this is the ending. In my eyes, the ending is a homage, or perhaps a pastiche to a painting of Hell and Judgment Day we are acquainted with in a museum along the film. This ending, these images, they will stay with you well after the credits are gone.It takes a little something for a film to make me watch it twice.

Crass and Vulgar,"Two hit men named ""Ken"" (Brendon Gleeson) and ""Ray"" (Colin Farrell) are sent to a small town in Belgium and told to wait for further instructions. It is then disclosed that Ray has accidentally killed a young boy in a church while in the process of killing his assigned target and this event has haunted Ray deeply. Ken fully understands and tries to console Ray the best that he can but because Ray is so neurotic it becomes quite a challenge in itself. However, things change quickly when Ken is informed by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) that his next assignment is to kill-Ray. Now, in between some beautiful scenery, a fairly interesting plot and a good dose of irony, there is more than a little profanity which some might believe gives the movie its flavor. To me it just seemed crass and vulgar which further lowered my opinion of it. Considering the high rating (on IMDb) I am obviously in the minority but in any case I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly below average.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
In Bruges is a must-see!!!,"Bruges is a fairytale. It's also in Belgium. We are repeatedly reminded of both these facts throughout the movie In Bruges, a dark comedy that isn't afraid to push the envelope on topics ranging from hit men and religion to midgets (no, dwarfs!), racism and tourist etiquette. This movie is not for the queasy or the easily offended as the violence is grisly and the jokes dance in the glory that is un-Politically Correctness.However, don't get me wrong, there is a lot that is easy to like about In Bruges. First, the scenery is gorgeous and the picturesque, quiet town serves as a delightful backdrop and foil to the story, which is at times pleasantly crude. After watching this movie, many feel a strong desire to visit Bruges and even I, a tourist more like Ray in taste than Ken, admit that there is a strange, almost magical appeal to the town. Indeed, often, it truly does feel like a fairytale place, especially when contrasted to the violence and pitch-black humor that fills much of the film.Secondly, the cast is absolutely flawless. As Ray, Colin Farrell brings an odd sort of charisma that immediately endears his character to the hearts of the viewers. Ray could easily have been overly rude and obnoxious, but instead, it is almost impossible not to like him and care about what happens to him. In this movie, Colin Farrell has perfect comedic timing and expressions that are, alternately, hilarious and touching and he proves that he can indeed act, something which many - including me - have known for a long time, and reminds the world why he reached A-list status at the ripe age of 25. As Ken, Ray's perfect foil, Brendan Gleeson brings a more subtle brilliance to the screen, lending his character a sort of quiet dignity that is rare in hit men, even those in the movies. In addition to their pitch-perfect performances, what really makes the friendship between Ray and Ken work is the undeniable chemistry between the actors. Also, it must be said that even though he appears in less than half of the movie, Ralph Fiennes gives a memorable performance and is, in turns, hilarious and menacing. The supporting cast is worth noting and, especially Jordan Prentice and Clemence Posey, does an excellent job of, well, supporting the main actors.The next most noteworthy aspect of In Bruges is the nearly flawless direction and writing by Martin McDonagh. This is McDonagh's first feature film (he is most known for his theater work and for winning the Oscar for the short film Six Shooter) and it is a better debut than almost anyone could ask for. There is barely a line of the dialogue that is unquotable and perhaps even more remarkable is the way McDonagh seamlessly blends all the elements of In Bruges. The action, comedy, romance and drama work together in perfect balance, giving the movie a unique and unforgettable feel. Also, while it is undeniably hilarious, it is the emotion that really makes In Bruges stand out, as well as the subtle message of redemption and friendship.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"If it's Tuesday, this must be Belgium","For his first feature film, In Bruges (pronounced Broozh), Irish playwright Martin McDonagh (The Pillowman) has fashioned an absurdist black comedy about hit men hiding out in the medieval city of Bruges, Belgium, taking stock of their life while awaiting their next assignment. The film offers fabulous acting by a stellar cast, glorious scenery worthy of the best travelogue, and the characters' poignant metaphoric journey from cave to cathedral. Yet the story line about thoughtful hit men and the mobster's code of honor is artificial and self-conscious and contains some insensitive humor that comes off as more of an ""I'll show you if you think I am politically correct"" exercise than something intrinsic to the characters.Colin Farrell plays Ray, an English hit man who botched his first assignment and has been exiled to Bruges by his London handler, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), together with Ray's partner Ken (Brendan Gleeson). The absurdity of having two mobsters trying to come to terms with a city full of culture and history is quite funny and engenders some feeling about being a stranger in a strange land. The culture unfortunately is lost on Ray. He calls Bruges a *beep* hole and humors Ken who is interested in seeing the sights and attractions of the old city. In the process, McDonagh goes out of his way to be offensive to everyone including gays, dwarfs, blacks, and women, and also dumps on Americans (a safe target), showing an overweight couple taken aback when Ray suggests that they would have trouble maneuvering the winding stairs to the top of a monument.He paints Bruges as a city with Russian gunrunners and Chloe (Clemence Poesy), an attractive drug dealer selling drugs to a racist dwarf (Jordan Prentice) while an art movie is being filmed, but this has more to do with the demands of the script than the reality of Bruges. McDonagh's idea of humor seems to be his characters putting down the world around them. Ray calls the timeless art works ""rubbish by spastics"" and says he would be impressed with Bruges if he had grown up on a farm ""and was retarded"". ""Do you think this is good?"" he asks Ken ""going 'round in a boat looking at stuff?"" Neither have any idea why they are there. I guess if its Tuesday, this must be Belgium.We soon find out that Ray is racked with guilt because he accidentally killed a five-year old boy who was in the line of fire as he was murdering a priest. Naturally he has no remorse for killing the priest because that is his chosen profession and he was only doing his job. The hardball hit men turn softies right before our eyes as they ruminate about guilt, sin, and the hereafter and question what they have done and whether it means they are going to hell, Ray says, ""Aside from trying to live a good life, I have to reconcile myself to the fact that I have killed people."" Fine time to think of that. While they do not exactly engage our sympathies, the relationship between the two men is touching and they deserve credit for being willing to reexamine the choices they made in their life.One is forced to wonder about these choices even more when Ken turns up as an advocate of Ghandian non-violence after Harry emerges from London to act out his sociopathic ""principles"". What remains after the soul searching is a bit of a romance, some cool Tarantino-like hip dialogue, some obligatory chase scenes, and a contrived plot sequence involving a murderous ex-boy friend of Chloe who is blinded in one eye when Ray shoots him with a blank in self-defense. At the bottom of this is the gangster's Code of Honor that we are supposed to admire but never seems to be a part of anything real. Yet in spite of its infuriating flaws, In Bruges is always entertaining, and at times moving and does make me want to visit this entrancing city now that the lowlifes have been dispersed in true Shakespearean style.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Tarantino inspired crime film that scores more hits than misses,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter a hit in London goes wrong, hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are told to wait in Bruges, a Belgian town, to await a call from Harry (Ralph Fiennes) the crime boss who ordered the hit. Ray was responsible for the hit going wrong, so it's his neck most likely on the line and it doesn't help that while Ken tries to take in the local culture and experience, he sees everything wrong with it. So as they await the call, they must also come to terms with a town where everything seems foreign and weird.Quentin Tarantino's style of crime thriller writing has inspired some notable imitations, one of which would appear to be this well received Europe set film from Martin McDonaugh.Your sense of political correctness can be left well at the door, as jabs at the Chinese, midgets and retards come thick and fast. Other problems though, include it being a rather slow and talky film at times, but it's an undeniably sharp and well written film, which makes it funny and thrilling as well. Performances wise, it's nice to see Farrell back (check out the scene where he talks to the midget and the prostitute, double chin or what???) and there's nice support from Gleeson and Fiennes, ditching his usual well spoken brit thing for a sharp cockney villain dialect. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Enjoyable but implausible,"I really enjoyed this movie, right up until the very end. One is not convinced that the last act of extreme violence would have been committed.

Cynical and derivative,"I wasn't going to review this, but a recent rash of award nominations together with encouragement from people like Barry Norman (the UK film critic) provokes it. A characteristically attractive central performance by Brendan Gleeson (too good for this material) and at least competent performances by Farrell and Fiennes conceal the profound moral emptiness and cynicism at the heart of this film, which blatantly attempts to assemble the components of a cult hit. Add a dash of Tarantino dialogue, the comic cinematic dwarf from ""Living in Oblivion"", the psychopathic geezer-gangster from Sexy Beast; even the title is probably a steal (though in different circumstances it could have been quite a funny one; American readers should know that there is a satirical magazine in the UK called Private Eye, a bit like your ""Onion"", and in Private Eye there is a running joke about an imaginary film called ""They flew to Bruges"", which successfully captures everything about the sort of worthy and desperately unglamorous black-and-white 1950s war film that you might doze off to on a Sunday afternoon's telly).But look: it takes more than adding a few effs and jeffs to the dialogue to make you Tarantino. You have to have an ear for real speech to make this work. All we get here is just pointless foul-mouthedness, but with not one memorable or quotable line in the whole thing. Compare this to, for example, Armando Ianucci's ""The thick of it"" (A TV political satire), where a character hovering in a doorway is told to ""Come the f*** in or f*** the f*** off""; now that's funny, creative swearing. In ""In Bruges"" it's just depressing and relentless. Still, the director and producers are enormously proud of their potty-mouths, as they devote a whole DVD extra to counting the instances. ""Oh, grow up"", is the only response I can muster.These three central characters are two hit men and their psycho boss. Gleeson's character can remain appealing enough as we are told little enough about the hard realities of his background, but Farrell (the ostensible lead, with whom we are supposed to sympathise), is on the run in Bruges (this isn't a spoiler as it's clear early on) because of a ""hit"" that's gone wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent child (a choirboy, no less). Still, any moral qualms one might have about rooting for these dangerous sociopaths can be conveniently be put to one side because the ""hit"" that went wrong was on a priest who had been interfering with children. A paedo! So that's alright then; never mind that their more normal business is enforcing with violence the trades of prostitution and protection and drugs, not to mention narcissistic concepts of ""respect""; he was attempting to shoot a paedo, so the collateral killing of a child is just another comic blunder.As for the denouement, which I don't need (and can't be bothered)to introduce spoiler warnings for: preposterous, just preposterous. If the contrived ending had introduced some moral shape (even if just a subversive or nihilistic one) to the proceedings, there might have been some redemptive power. Instead, all it does is just emphasise the cynical way in which the ingredients, including the calculated taunting of imagined ""political correctness"", have been mixed together. Not to mention their sheer implausibility.Not clever, not funny, not original, not satirical, not cutting-edge or black comedy, not even realistic; just a nasty taste in the mouth.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Truly Dark Comedy,"When you think of a dark comedy you generally associate it with dark humor. However, in the case of In Bruges, it is the story and themes that are dark with the humor used as levity, unlike others which use it simply to get a laugh out of their film, the comedy in In Bruges serves a purpose.In terms of acting this movie is top-notch with all actors at the top of their game, namely Colin Farrell as Ray, Brandon Gleeson as Ken, and Ralph Fiennes as Harry. Every actor absolutely nails their roles and give truly convincing performances. On top of that, every character is multi-layered and interesting in their own unique way, Ray could've just been a mentally unstable whiny guy who didn't want to be in Bruges, but he was also a guilt-ridden suicide case who doesn't know if life is truly worth living anymore. Ken could've been just another old mentor figure, but he was also a conflicted man being forced to decide between what is right and wrong. Harry could've been just an easily- enraged menacing villain, but he was also an incredibly honor-driven man and a clearly loving father (to a certain extent). Even the side characters all add their own unique likability to the film. Huge props to this film for knowing how to create truly interesting and likable characters.Now that that's out of the way, let's get to what truly makes this film great: the themes explored in the dialogue. Despite technically being a comedy, like The Truman Show, this film is so much more than just something to laugh at. Themes explored include guilt, depression, suicide, death, morality, and even the meaning of life. This movie somehow manages to seamlessly blend all of these themes into it's narrative using the oldest trick in the book when it comes to exploring themes: dialogue. This movie has amazing dialogue between it's characters and truly makes them feel like real people by having them swear, use slang, and occasionally joke while discussing the themes mentioned above. A round of applause for Martin McDonagh, who wrote and directed the film and truly breathed life into his work.So to summarize, In Bruges is an absolutely incredible movie with interesting themes, fantastic performances, and very good direction. It's refreshing to see such a well made comedy which knows that humor alone is not what makes a movie great. Despite it's somewhat underrated status I consider this film to be a must-watch for anyone and everyone.The End",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The closest to screen writing perfection I have ever seen,"In Bruges has been, and I think will stay for a while, the most interesting combination of cinematic gold I've seen in it's genre. The story line, dialogue, acting, scene progression, cinematography it's all great. What captured my interest the most though, and really the ultimate reason why I've been able to rewatch this Film over and over the years is thanks to a uniquely captured interplay found inside the story. A propelling force created by and between the films lovable antihero character creations. I saw something that's hard to describe. It's really something I think you can just feel as your laugh continuously catches you off guard throughout. There's a lot of great humor in honesty and I think the actors captured the essence intended by the writing. They nailed it. It almost feels like improvisation. It reaches an organic level bordering on legendary.They've captured something here. The unexpected candidacy resulted in comedy that caught me off guard in all the right ways. The assassin with a conscience, an empathetic chord striking and interest attracting element that will hook you in and keep you coming back for more. The writing I found here is the benchmark renting, then leasing, now owning space in the back of my mind. There I think it will remain as a constant personal aspiration of my own. Ever even coming close to writing like this as an end result, much less post production, would be something I could really consider a true accomplishment. A great dark comedy great if not the greatest. One of my favorite movies of all time based upon shear creativity. Do I think it's under rated. Not if your from an audience that watches Housewives of Atlanta or Honey Boo Boo. Not if you you are addicted to the opposite of laughter..and enjoyment. Not if you're a toddler, probably. That's fair. Not if you are a potato. It's awesome. In Bruges! In Bruges! In Bruges!! Crushed it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Words cannot say how much I love this movie,"I can't really say in enough words how much I love In Bruges. In fact there aren't words in my language which can express how deeply in tune to it I feel every time I put the DVD in for a watch, which is at least every four months or so. The dual forces of comedy and tragedy have combined here using Martin McDonough's genius script writing as an avatar to create something raucously funny and profoundly moving. The comedy is of the spiciest and very darkest nature (my favourite), and the tragedy tugs at both the heart strings and the tear ducts, scarcely giving you time to wipe away the tears of laughter from the scene that came before. The best in UK crime fare, some of the most balanced, peculiar writing and fully rounded characters who are as flawed as human beings get. Colin Farrell delves deep and gives the performance of his career as Ray, a would be hit-man who has messed up bad, and now heads for Bruges (it's in Belgium) with his mentor Ken (Brendan Gleeson, pure brilliance and humble class). Ken loves eccentric little Bruges, with its historical architecture and quaint townsfolk. Ray is bored to tears and pouts like a toddler. They meander around the town getting into all sorts of mischief including a dwarf (who has fascinating ideas about the ultimate race war), museums, cocaine, the Belgium film industry and more. Ray sets his sights on the gorgeous Chloe (), and Ken does his paternal best to keep him out of trouble while wrestling with his own gnawing guilt. The film gets a shot of pissy adrenaline when their boss Harry comes looking for them, in the form of a knock it out of the park funny Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes rarely cuts loose and bounces off the walls like he does here, and his Harry is a delightful creature to watch in action. Angry, petty, volatile, clever and out for blood, just a joy to behold. As playful as the script is, there's a purgatorial sadness to Ray's situation, a fateful sense that he's been dumped in Bruges not just to fool around, get drunk and utter witty barbs in that brogue (which he does do a lot) but to deeply ruminate on his choices and ponder where his actions will lead him moving forward from his terrible deed. Maturity permeates each exchange between him and Ken, a fledgling and an old timer shooting the breeze about heavy topics which neither of them pretend to understand, but both are neck deep in. I always cry at certain scenes, always laugh my ass off at others, and never cease to be affected right to my emotional center and the marrow of my funny bone each time I watch this. Look for a brief cameo from Ciaran Hinds in the opening few minutes. Every second of this piece is filled with lush, thought provoking dialogue, awesomely un-politically correct dialogue that doesn't censor a single impulse from its characters, and a yearning to explore the decisions which cause people to be labeled 'good' or 'bad', something that's inherently complex yet feels lightly treaded on here. Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Overlooked masterpiece.,"FIrst review. Spoiler free.Hard to beleive it´s been 11 years since I first saw it. A friend of mine showed it to me even though I could barely speak english at the time (learning english in Ireland is helpful though) but even though I couldn't understand some of the dialogue I instantly fell in love with this movie.
The main cast (Fiennes,Gleeson, Farell) is just incredible and they deliver some of the best performance of their respective carreers. Dialogues are sharp and hilarious though never feel forced or out of place, every details count.
Writing is good, it´s definitly not a story you´ve heard before and the way the characters evolve and react is rarely seen in movies.
Direction is masterfull. Photography is great, the shots (mostly at night) of the city really set the mood from the very first scene as is the music.
Probably one of the very best movie in the very tricky genre of Dark comedy as some dialogues can be truly hilarious even though the set up is dark, almost desperate at time.
A must see although it might not be for everyone.
Best movie from McDonnagh so far in my opinion, yes even better than Three Bilboards.. even though I loved it. They actually have a lot in common.
McDonnagh might be one of the best director of his generation and I hope to see more in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Simple story set in a small town has a very big heart,"Reviewed July 2011It deals on a very serious and sad story to be called a comedy, but it's consistence in humor is way too dense than your regular fun movie. It does not pack any laugh out loud kind of jokes, but the one that leaves a smile on you with it's subtlety and darkness and a nod of appreciation for it's wit.A hit goes bad as a kid gets killed by accident and the two guys Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) responsible for it are asked to go to Bruges, Belgium to get away from the heat.Takes a little while to get used to Colin Farrell's histrionics as it starts and it gets better as it goes. Gleeson does full justice to a terrific role. Bruges, the town itself is a character and justifies the title of the movie. Last and not the least, Clémence Poésy has the best smile going around and she is mostly used as a pretty doll. It packs sharp and dark satirical dialogue that is full of wit and fun and there are many sequences which makes full use of it, be it the ones involving the midget or how they go on in the climax about honor.Though there is nothing to enlighten you here (which one shouldn't be expecting out of any movie), it is a thoroughly enjoyable film with fantastic writing and performances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"The only thing worse than being stuck in Bruges is watching ""In Bruges""!","In Bruges is one of those comedies that thinks it is far more witty and clever than it actually is. It's a shame, because it has an interesting premise with a lot of potential, but ultimately that potential amounts to nothing more than cussing and midget jokes.The film follows two hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are ordered by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), to hide away in the remote Belgian town of Bruges after a botched hit in London. They are supposed to stay until Harry gives them a call saying it's OK to leave. Ken seizes the opportunity to explore and sightsee while Ray, who takes an instant disliking to Bruges, prefers to spend his time at the pub. While there, the duo have many strange encounters in Bruges, including ones with a midget actor, a skinhead robber, Dutch prostitutes, and involving loads of drugs, all which lead up to a matter of life-or-death situation involving Ray, Ken and Harry.In Bruges is a strange combination of a drama and a comedy, and it really fails in both genres. The movie is primarily a comedic one. Although there are a few jokes that were mildly funny, most of them fall flat. The problem is that In Bruges presents itself as ""sophisticated"" and tries to come off as clever, character-based comedy, yet half the jokes are incredibly low brow. For instance, there are repetitive jokes involving a midget. Even if the joke had been remotely funny in the first place (which it wasn't), it's repeated far too many times before the movie ends. Most of the jokes are mean-spirited and un-politically correct. Don't get me wrong, I normally wouldn't have a problem with that. However, here there is nothing funny. Ray ridicules overweight people, he karate chops the midget, he knocks out a couple in a restaurant, swears like a sailor and (once again with the midget) engages in a discussion about whether or not there will be a race war in the future. None of this is funny. It's cruel-spirited for the sake of it. The director must know that simply being mean-spirited isn't funny. There's nothing clever or witty about it. It's the same humor we've seen done before, in countless idiotic, low brow comedies, presented as a Sundance-approved, highbrow comedy.As well, it would've helped if the lead role was played by someone other than Colin Farrell. I like Farrell; he's a good actor. He is not a comedic actor though. He's just not funny. It's as simple as that. His performance here is good, but he's not funny enough for a movie like this. His character gets most of the better lines in the film and they are all wasted. Ralph Fiennes fairs much better comically, yet is relegated to the last 30 minutes of the film.The rest of the movie is a mess, as it strives to be a thought-provoking drama, as well as an action film towards the end. There are long periods of the movie devoid of jokes, which would be fine if anything were happening. Unfortunately, for the first hour of the film, nothing much happens. Ray and Ken stumble around Bruges doing random things. It's boring and dull. There are a few emotional moments here and there, and although they are well done, they don't fit in with the rest of the movie, which is often crude and crass. The last 20 minutes has some good action, violence and shoot-outs, but which once again, really has no place in this film. The ending switches gears from this and attempts to be profound. It feels out of place. ""Hot Fuzz"", which came out almost a year ago and had a similar premise, stuck primarily to the comedy genre and succeeded. In Bruges tries to blend together comedy and drama, trying to be profound, rude, funny and thrilling. It's too much and the film would've worked better if it had focused more on one of these areas.All in all, I can't say I recommend In Bruges. It's a jumbled mess of a film that thinks much too highly of itself. The only thing worse than being stuck in Bruges would be having to watch this film again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Unusual Crime Drama,This action drama centers around three characters from a criminal organisation. Two hit men and their boss become involved in a situation that creates unusual circumstances and outcomes. The relationship between the characters are complex and change continually throughout the movie. The movie is also set in a town in Belgium which creates a different setting and environment from the main characters own experience. Many local characters also become involved with the hit men developing additional story lines that interweave with the overall direction of the film.

"Not what I expected, but excellent!!","I've seen one other movie from Martin McDonagh: Seven Psychopaths. That one happens to be in one of my top 5 favourite movies, so I thought I'd see something else from Martin McDonagh, since the guy seems to know what he's doing. He's an excellent writer, and it can be seen in In Bruges as well. McDonagh is phenomenal at writing dialogue. It's natural yet colourful, and while it might not be the most politically correct, it works, and no one is trying to convince that the characters of this movie would be extremely good people.Still the moral code of the characters is interesting. They are hit men, criminals, yet killing an innocent little boy is clearly wrong, and all of them seem to agree on that. The view of some of them might just be harder than others'.The music affects this movie a lot. In the beginning the dialogue sounds more like a comedy, but the music makes the whole thing feel like a weird European drama. The copy I rented just had the genre ""comedy"" listed in the back, nothing else, and the beginning gave me a lot of mixed feelings about that, since the beginning seems rather serious - apart from the dialogue. Other than that, the music mostly amplified the feeling of the movie at every point, the beginning just stands out if you're not prepared.But is this film really a comedy? Well, if it is, it certainly isn't the typical simple joke kind of funny. It's extremely dark funny. I was actually surprised at what kind of stuff I found myself chuckling at. this shows how wide the comedy genre actually is, since it includes typical comedies such as 21 Jump Street, not too funny but cheerful movies like The Grand Budapest Hotel and then really dark comedies like In Bruges and Death to Smoochy.In Bruged wasn't what I expected, considering the quite crappy description behind the DVD cover. Still I enjoyed it, however it was quite slow sometimes. Still, the story is intriguing and so are the characters. Definitely worth seeing!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Colin Farrell does his usual bad boy performance, but he adds a lot of emotional dimensions to his act. Really good job. I like Ralph Fiennes, and he seems he got the ""bad bug"" after he played Voldemort and he will be playing more negative roles from now on.The script is funny to laugh at and sad to cry. It is both complex in metaphors and simple enough to be enjoyed by anyone. A truly good script if I've ever seen one. A bit boring at the start, but hey, it was setting the stage for a great act.The music wasn't bad either, the location (a medieval burg in Belgium called Bruges) was nice, too.

"Terrific film, great dialogue, laugh-aloud moments","Reading through these comments, one is struck by how much goodwill there is to this film. One would think that only those with their noses out of joint would bother writing negative comments, but to have the overwhelming reaction positive shows how engaging this film is. To have Colin Farrell as the star would normally stop me from sitting in front of the telly to watch him for 90 minutes but he provides a sympathetic, nuanced performance without going over the top which would have been understandable given the storyline. Gleeson is given ample screen time to show why he's one of Ireland's great thespians. I was first introduced to him in the film 'I Went Down;' although I can't for the life of me remember that film apart from the nonsensical reason given for the title, I do remember Gleeson's performance as a revelation that single-handedly raised an otherwise non-descript film. And Fiennes once again shows no matter the genre, he'll step up and nail it. His accent is spot-on; I thought for a minute they'd hired Michael Caine to phone in a cameo when I first heard his voice. The plot itself is nothing to get worked up over, and the various turns used to stretch out the film are a bit laboured but, with the sublime humour and great dialogue, it doesn't matter. And what a setting! My main issue was the ending where it rather fell apart for me in terms of believability, but it is truly minor compared to everything that makes up this movie.

A fairy tale about a fairy-tale city,"In Bruges (2008), written and directed by Martin McDonagh, stars Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Ken. These two professional killers have been sent to Bruges to lie low after a killing-gone-wrong. Their boss is Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, who follows their progress by phone from England.Ray is hyperactive, depressed, and hates Bruges. Ken can actually enjoy the wonders of Bruges, even though it's just a stop on the road to the next killing. Clémence Poésy is Chloë, a woman who hangs around movie sets to deal drugs and offer her body as enticement to the unwary.I've been to Bruges twice, and it's probably the most enchanting city I've ever seen. It's called the Sleeping Beauty city because progress passed it by, and there was no incentive to tear down the old and build the new. By the time people got around to modernizing Bruges, they understood the value of a city preserved as if in amber, and they left it the way it was. (You actually get a pretty good tour of Bruges in the movie, and it looks beautiful. That's the point--it's a beautiful city in which terrible things are happening.)The terrible things naturally involve Ray, Ken, Harry, Chloë, and other lowlife types as well. What makes the story a fairy tale is that all kinds of mayhem take place on the streets and in the houses of Bruges, and no one except the main characters appears to notice. People shoot at each other, coins rain down from a tower, and a police officer never appears. Bruges has police, and they intervene there as they would intervene anywhere else. You have to suspend disbelief to accept their absence in the film.Despite this lack of realism, the movie is both a powerful psychological study and a real thriller. It's definitely worth seeking out in a theater, and will work fairly well on the small screen as well. See it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

First I was surprised by the depth of character Colin Farrell displayed, it was, I thought, a touching performance laced with nuance and intensity. The great Brendan Gleeson played the wise foil, to Farrell's brash and ignorant thug with aplomb. The real star was Martin Mcdonagh with a great script and subtle direction. Ralph Fiennes reminded me of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, relishing his menace. All in All, the dark humor was top notch. I will be watching for more Martin Mcdonagh films, and I highly recommend this one as a place to start.Rick",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great Movie,"I know it's been awhile since this came out I actually still remember the first time I saw this. I was at my buddies house and we're doing a movie day we had already watched ""Funny Games"" and ""Diary of the Dead"" but I really didn't think when we put this in it would be as great as it was.Colin Farrell who I've been a fan of since ""Hart's War"" shows that he is a great actor in this movie. In the first maybe half of the movie it's a very dark comedic movie that I thoroughly enjoy but when it finally gets to the serious plot points it doesn't disappoint. Brendan Gleeson along with Colin Farrell make a great duo. With Gleeson's love of old buildings and tourism and Farrell's pouting and only wanting to go get drunk at the local pub.With all the quick side stories and adventures I won't waste my time trying to explain some of them and it would also decrease from the pleasure of finding out for yourself. Movies like this are rare nowadays it seems, a movie with slapstick comedy, bloody violence, and soul.Let's not forget Ralph Fiennes role, you almost want to say he went over the top but he doesn't it's almost pitch perfect for the role, I smiled whenever he was on screen, I've said before that previews are ruining movies lately by giving away to much plot but even if you think that's true with this one, trust me your wrong there is so much more to the movie then what's shown in the preview.So in conclusion I've tried to not give away any of the plot because this is one of the movies that you should know almost nothing about going in and let the movie take you for a enjoyable ride.

Dramedy in Bruges,"An excellent film. Extremely subtle and humorous. Not everyone will like this film. It's not fast paced or action packed. However, the acting is exceptional and it is filled with both humor and sober thoughts on life, death and guilt.Colin Farrell has undoubtedly offered up his finest performance in film. Farrell has been decent in other films but this role was filled with humor and vulnerability. The acting during a conversation at breakfast with Brendan Gleeson in the hotel is priceless; so, too, Farrell's attempt to get a date with the lovely and wonderfully attractive Clemence Poesy.Gleeson himself is excellent as well as a brief but very poignant role by Ralph Fiennes. The Golden Globe nominations of Gleeson and Farrell for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy were well deserved. In my view, Farrell should get a Best Actor nomination for the Academy; it is not a winning role. But, it is phenomenal acting. I doubt he'll get a nomination given the Academy's melodrama fetish. However, I will guarantee that Farrell's role is better than two or three of the roles. Farrell takes small scenes with good dialog and makes it exceptional.The various views of Bruges are very nice; the movie captures very well life in a mid-sized European town. The main square the hotel and its breakfast area all are captured quite well.The screenplay is equal to Farrell's acting. There are great statements about life and choices one makes - as well as great humor. To be able to explore both with equal aplomb in a film is quite an achievement. The screenplay for this movie is also quite deserving of an Oscar nomination. The one slight negative I would have is that I might have changed around a couple of scenes near the end, but that's always the writer's prerogative.Finally, the language is pretty rough at times. However, this seems essential for a legitimate portrayal of the characters.Unless you can only handle mindless action films (don't get me wrong - those have their place!) or fast action dramas - you should enjoy this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""Maybe that's what hell is: the entire rest of eternity spent in Bruges""","'In Bruges (2008)' is director Martin McDonagh's feature debut, and it promises excellent things to come. His film shows the influence of Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' and 'Snatch (2000),' but is mostly without the excessive stylisation of Ritchie's films. For two hours, the film delicately blends black comedy and action, exploring difficult themes of life and death, but in a manner entirely without pretension. McDonagh's highly-quotable screenplay (""they're filming midgets!""), despite an over-reliance on obscenities, enjoyed an Oscar nomination, but otherwise the film escaped most official recognition.After an assassination attempt goes wrong, two London hit-men take shelter in the unfamiliar Belgian city of Bruges. While the philosophical Ken (Brendan Gleeson) takes an interest in the city's historical architecture, the impatient Ray (Colin Farrell) takes to complaining at every possible opportunity. Eventually, the unique history and people of Bruges – including stunning local girl Chloe (Clémence Poésy) and an American midget actor (Jordan Prentice) – leads both men to reevaluate their lives, for better or worse. When specific orders are ultimately disobeyed, their disgruntled boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) reluctantly flies to Bruges to settle matters himself.'In Bruges' contains several scenes that don't quite work: the midget's narcotics-fuelled rant about interracial warfare feels like forced drug humour, and the climax seems to operate out of ironic obligation rather than an understanding of character. However, Gleeson and Farrell share a chemistry that is amusing and often quite moving. The city of Bruges, whatever Ray has to say about it, is photographed with fondness and affection, depicted as a sort of historical sanctuary where time stands still.

Little Gem,"I must start this review by stating that even tough I love the big, epic, genre-defining, multi-million dollar, all time and all new classics, my greatest pleasure in cinema is to stumble upon the little movie. Not little on budget(even if it happens to be true many times), but a movie that is restrained in scale, that has but a few characters and a simple premise; a movie that expects nothing of itself but to be what it is. In one word: SIMPLICITY!If you read Tolstoy, you soon realize that in his writing the biggest remarks on human nature are expressed in the most beautifully simplified verse. It holds true to all arts that, through simplicity and showing nothing more than a detail, you get a more accurate display of life.""In Bruges"" is such a gem. Perfect as it is. Shot in the beautiful city of Bruges, to which we are introduced by some of the most beautiful(and some times hilarious) footage I have ever seen-one where a dog looks from the window to the street like an old lady burns into the memory fast. The acting, as it always happens in such small movies, is what carries the film. Great acting all around with the grand prize going to Colin Farell who seems to be on top form after giving up alcohol. A very nuanced performance from a truly great actor.Overall, this is the most enjoyment I have taken from cinema this year. Fun, layered, meaningful and a treat to the eyes.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Paddy power...,"Having bagged the Oscar for best short film four years back with his dark humoured thriller Six Shooter, London born director Martin McDonagh steps up to the big screen with this: In Bruges; an incisive and bloody fierce laugh-out-loud revamp of his 27 minute short debut.Starring an inform Collin Farrell, In Bruges is set...well...in Bruges: a tucked-away Belgian town that's both easy-on-the-eye and peaceful. Until now. Hired Irish hit men Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have been sent to the small medieval town following a botched job where they're to keep their heads low and wait for word from Harry (Ralph Fiennes). But why Belgium? And why the hell Bruges?While waiting for Harry's instructions, Ray and Ken encounter more than their fair share of problems and misfits, prostitutes and elephants, Canadians, thieves, gunmen, xenophobes and racist midgets. Their overseas waiting game soon becomes one laden with toe-curling hilarity yet mystery, anguish and philosophy as the two hired guns share a few home truths regarding the nature of their so-called profession, the blood of Christ, the beauty of Bruge, lollipop men who know kung-fu and the unfolding events of recent times that have led them to this shat- hole.When Ray's not p*ssed, he's p*ssed off. With every one and everything. He's a bearded, doughy, chauvinistic paddy who rarely passes up a chance to make a harsh yet hilarious example of society's minorities while keeping his middle finger held high and firm in the face of political correctness. ""I believe that the balance shall tip in the favour of culture, like a big fat fcuking retarded fcuking a black girl on a see- saw with a midget on the other fcuking end.""Lamping two Yanks in the name of the Vietnamese and John Lennon won't sit too pretty with many neither, nor will the four or five dozen uses of the dreaded c-word. But the sheer vigour, acid-tongued brilliance of McDonagh's dialogue is channelled so effectively through Farrell that it not only makes for a genuinely believable and, somehow, likable character, but also the Irishman's best performance in years. The role of Ray fits him like a glove and will go a long way to re-establishing his faded reputation in eyes of many. Gleeson is also superb. Chipping in with a solid, father-like supporting role, the experienced screen vet' gives a performance of a dead beat bloke in whom regret, honour and an estranged sense of decency suffer a series of head on collisions. Then there's Ralph Fiennes; the intense and steely-eyed method actor who's pure and utter dynamite as the scornful, dirty Harry. His turn ushers in the bloody final third of McDonagh's medieval morality-play.His multi-layered plot remains unwavering and steady throughout featuring just enough well placed hooks to keep audiences interested. The sheer weight and wit of McDonagh's smartly scripted dialogue is what gives Bruges its muscle, though. Rarely does it cease to entertain or amuse, shock or transgress. It's both rare in style and scandalous in content. You know full-well you shouldn't conform to the shallowness of the humour. You know you shouldn't laugh. But you do anyway.Violent, vicious, bloody funny, brilliantly executed and surprisingly touching: In Bruges is as fine a film you're likely to see this side of Pulp Fiction. It's a merciless, pin-sharp feature from the big screen débutant with a big heart that barks like a p*ssed paddy on st. Patrick's day and bites like a Reservoir Dog set loose in Bruges.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
On Raglan Road.. In Bruges,"All I could muster to say after watching In Bruges was 'Nothing'. Literally Dumb stuck on how brilliant this movie was. Read quite a few reviews complaining about soundtrack not in sync with the story line, but for me that was mesmerizing, What can be better than the 'On Raglan Road' by 'The Dubliners' for that particular scene - ""DO NOT WANT TO PUT SPOILERS HERE"", But that scene stole the show.Colin Farrell - His best performance so far, Quirky yet emotional. Brendan Gleeson - Brilliant would be an understatement for his portrayal of Ken. Ralph Fiennes - I now cannot imagine anyone as Harry but him. The Message he leaves with the Motel Owner ""Receptionist"" was hilariously accusing.STARS of the movie.Story - Have never seen any movie with such a story this for me has raised the bar for defining good movies , completely off shelf, fresh, though its a movie on hit men it will make you feel sympathetic towards all characters in the movie though they have Grey shades.Bruges - The film is extensively shot in Bruges, a medieval city beautifully shot, excellent cinematography. I just fell in love with this place, And now Bruges is on my dream list of places to visit.Dialogues - Quick, quirky, funny and yet speaks a lot about integrity and humanity. Harry's role stands out, 'You got to stick with your principles'Soundtrack - Excellent tracks through out the movie absolutely fitting scores matching the beautiful city, and again On Raglan Road with that particular scene gives me goose bumps.Its a must watch movie. A complete fresh way of looking at things. Though it has a serious story line the way it has been written makes it funny yet emotional, quirky yet soothing, Cruel yet sympathetic.DO NOT MISS THIS...Also like to share this poem On Raglan Road by Patrick Kavanagh Sung by The Dubliners...On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way, And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day.On Grafton Street in November we tripped lightly along the ledge Of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge, The Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay - O I loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away.I gave her gifts of the mind I gave her the secret sign that's known To the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone And word and tint. I did not stint for I gave her poems to say. With her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of MayOn a quiet street where old ghosts meet I see her walking now Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow That I had wooed not as I should a creature made of clay - When the angel woos the clay he'd lose his wings at the dawn of day.Heaven ""In Bruges""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The saving grace of the year it was released.,"Personally, I found 2008 to be a very underwhelming year for film-making. Three of my favourite directors came up short (Chris Nolan with The Dark Knight, the Coens with Burn After Reading and Guy Ritchie with RockNRolla) and a lot of the currently popular 'superhero' pictures just weren't cutting it. Every new movie I saw seemed to be lacking in witty scripting, and most had disappointing endings.Fortunately, somebody recommended I watch In Bruges. And what a bloody good decision that turned out to be.This film has attracted a lot of flak. It seems to polarise critics. People who look on the surface just see a couple of hit-man types who swear all the time and are throughly unpleasant individuals, not at all likable. These critics perhaps missed two of the most important aspects of the picture: it's a dark, black comedy in the vein of American Psycho, and it is incredibly subtle in places. So subtle that it really needs a couple of viewings to appreciate the minimalistic approach of the scriptwriting and direction.What I like most about the experience - and it really is an experience - is the deliberately grey morality demonstrated by everyone in the film. How nice people can be rude and indecent, and how those supposed to be evil can actually be incredibly tender and caring even if they might be confused about expressing it. Colin Farrell finally comes into his own here, demonstrating an incredible emotional range. He goes from childlike impatience to arrogant and presumptuous to heartbroken and desolate. It would be a tough job for any lead, but I was with him all the way. Veteran actor Brendan Gleeson has some formidable chops to add as well, with the camaraderie and gradual friendship/mentorship he gives to Ray being one of the focal points and a definite highlight. Everyone in this makes their screen time count, whether it's minutes or mere seconds.It's an odd story, not completely original but certainly off-kilter. The swearing is necessary, as it is in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. That Martin McDonagh both writes and directs allows him to flesh out his script with more emotion, because as mentioned it's quite minimal and all the better for it. It relies on strong delivery and use of body language and facial expression. I honestly think you have to see it three or four times to truly appreciate the effect.Bruges is captured beautifully on film. Without drawing too much attention to the backdrop, it is clear that the location is an intriguing juxtaposition to the moral dilemmas faced by our two protagonists. It speaks volumes about the young gun, Ray, that he finds nothing comforting or calming in the serenity of his hiding place. Ken, the wise and weary companion, finds peace of mind and a moral clarity it is obvious he had ignored for years.If you can get your head around the violence (it's used sparingly but is, I felt, genuinely shocking and horrific) and the strong, blunt language, you might find not just the best picture of 2008 by some distance, but also the sort of drama you want to revisit time and again.If you haven't yet, go and watch In Bruges. It's fine work to be sure, to be sure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"One of My Favorite recent Movies. Hilarious, smart and features great dialogue and is highly original","I highly recommend this film for any Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie films, but really to any lover of film. There is a reason film's like this aren't big Hollywood block buster hits, because it is a highly original, dialogue driven film that will go places you couldn't foresee happening. This is a hilarious dark comedy (which may be a little to dark for some, especially one scene in particular about mid way through), but I really consider it more of a crime drama than a comedy. The best way to watch this film is to watch it without seeing any trailers or reading any reviews that contain spoilers so you can get the best experience when you watch it. The premise seems simple, two hit men hiding out after a recent job, but trust me when I say it is much more complex than that. If you enjoy this film I highly recommend watching Martin Mcdonagh's second feature, Seven Psychopaths. Also, I haven't seen many Short's but his first and only short ""Six Shooter""(Which Won an Academy Award) I have seen many times, its only about 30minutes in length and features a simple premise as well, but it is a powerful 30 minutes and you can watch the entire thing for free on youtube ( just search ""Six Shooter Martin Mcdonagh"").",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Different Kind of Hit Man Movie,"Every budding film maker seems to cut his feature teeth on a hit man movie. In fact, I've always thought hit man movies should be in their own genre. Instead, they fall into the action/adventure category.In Bruges (pronounced like the sled, luge) is it's own kind of hit man movie. It breaks new ground in much the same way Pulp Fiction and The Professional did. But while Pulp Fiction is about cartoon characters who love to act 'cool' and hear themselves talk (can you tell I'm not a Tarantino fan?), and The Professional relies on the Lolita effect and blatant sentimentality for it's characterization (it still worked for me), In Bruges is filled with real humanity and real drama. It takes very, very few cheap shots, and those it does take seem to be the film maker winking at classic cinematic conventions.This doesn't mean the story is completely free of plot devices and such. There are McGuffins and other devices in all hit man movies. In Pulp Fiction it was the briefcase, in The Professional, the plant, to name just two. I won't give away the device in In Bruges but you'll know it immediately when you see it.The two main characters, played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the hit men, are not meant to be likable, but we empathize with them because of each one's emotional struggle. I like this about the movie. Bad characters doing bad things, and yet we feel for them because of what they're going through. However, not all the characters have the same emotional wallop. The two female characters aren't as deep, and one of them, Chloe, isn't the least bit likable to this viewer. Also, the character Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, suffers slightly from a lack of screen time.I guessed the final resolution about five minutes before it arrived, and you'll probably see it coming, too. That's OK. You don't have to be entirely surprised by this movie to appreciate it.Lastly, I'm glad the writer/director edited out the scenes on the disk labeled ""deleted scenes."" The movie was much better leaving the audience to fill in the blanks on the individual back stories.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Who says Belgium is boring?,"I saw In Bruges at the cinema last night, and I haven't enjoyed myself so much in ages. Martin McDonagh's film is apparently a first for him, and on the strength of this work he should be schmoozed or lashed into making a lot more. This story of two hit men in the doghouse, holed up in Bruges for two weeks, is as dark a comedy as I've seen in some time, but it works on every level. This beautifully shot film is a wonderful advert for Bruges, Belgium's touristic jewel in the crown, and is accompanied by an excellent score. Brendan Gleason, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes (in a very different kind of role from his usual) are all excellent. Gleason's character is a world-weary, almost fatherly figure, who gives the impression that he's ended up being a hit-man almost by accident. Farrell's character is by turns boorish and childish, yet charming and likable at the same time. The language is frequently crude, but fitting to the characters portrayed here. The story has an inevitability about it, and so there may not be too many surprises for the viewer, but it hardly seems to matter. I can't praise this film too highly, and I urge all adults to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Most Interesting Blend,"I think what impressed me most about this movie is something the actors all say in the one bonus feature of the DVD: it captures and expresses the humanity of the characters no matter what they may be or do. Somehow even in the worst of behavior they are still very real, very human, very complex, flawed and noble simultaneously.I really like this film. I liked the premise: two shady guys from the 20th Century on the lam in a perfectly preserved Medieval city whose sureness of architectural line and composition stands in stark contrast to their uncertainty and fear and collective guilt. The stately orderly beauty of the buildings which sit on the cobble stone streets or border the canal with its swans which wends its way through the heart of the city of Bruges and passes under its many small arched bridges create a sense of composure and timelessness. A sense of time frozen as in a Master painting . . . The setting of Bruges as calm backdrop to these frenzied visitors is quite purposeful for the writer/director to allow the mood of incongruity to add to the dark humor. One doesn't really see the trappings of modernity at all. Cars and trucks are almost nonexistent, and even though the boats have motors you don't hear them. It could well be the 14th Century. What we hear instead is the noise of the invading people whose orderliness is fairly nonexistent. The background is still, the people in motion, an emphasis of the tension within the characters.I believe that nothing here is brand new but cleverly adapted by Martin McDonagh from certain works. While not a cut and paste of other offerings, it borrows heavily from works that are cited either directly or indirectly and most notably the 1970 British film ""Performance,"" which featured a criminal on the lam hiding in a very strange old mansion inhabited by people living a lifestyle very different than the one he knew. Part of the allure of that film was that strange juxtaposition of personae who seemed from other worlds. The other work that ""In Bruges"" borrows from is Roeg's classic ""Don't Look Now"" which featured a child/dwarf and the canaled streets and empty facades of the ancient buildings of Venice. Where that movie had a creepiness, this one transposes humor and a dark lightness. Where Roeg used the ambiance of Venice to create an insecurity for characters and audience, the lovely tranquility of Bruges serves to calm the viewer, even though the on screen characters are running at emotional redline. It is also worth noting that the citizens of Bruges are portrayed mostly as in neutral, non-involved. Even when things get out of hand, they maintain a calm very much at odds with the adrenalized British/Irish protagonists.It is most clever how McDonagh takes us into a movie within a movie while paying homage to the fantasied works of Heironymus Bosch. He suggests that there may a quantity of insanity in the film industry with its fictional depiction of reality, and that no one is immune from being part of that distorted sanity who is participating in any way with cinema, whether as makers, actors, or spectators. His replication through costuming of Bosch figures into the film within film also suggests that every work of art only issues from the mind of a creator, fiction given form.What is well done is McDonagh's use of language. His script sparkles and breathes strongly. None of the lines delivered by any of the characters fail to delight. He pokes fun at language through his characters' use of certain words and phrases, such as ""alcove"" to mean ""nooks and crannies."" A great deal of the likability of this movie for me comes from the script, and I might say that I acted pre-emptively and put on the captioning when I realized that the characters were speaking British English which is far different than American English. It helped to see, and hear what they were saying the better to not miss the nuances of a well done script.Cast is very good. Most impressive was Brendan Gleeson, who has a truly wonderful camera presence here. Fiennes is very very good as gang leader Harry Water, (another nod to Roeg's criminal boss in ""Performance,"" Harry Flowers), while Farrell does an admirable job all the way through. Farrell obviously enjoyed himself on this one. There were a couple of times when his facial contortions went places I don't think Farrell knew where they were. Great fun.Rest of cast did what they had to do, and did it well. Lighting, mood, sound were all supportive and well placed. Overall, a very nice dark comedy, and one well worth recommending to others. Given the beauty of the background scenery, I wish I had seen this in a theater, not on DVD at home. Still beautiful on the small screen. A bit bloody though, not for the squeamish or young children. Grade 9 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A very original gangster movie,"This film features characters and a plot which one would normally expect to be located in the east end of London. Or if it was about gangsters hiding out in a continental city one would expect it to be Amsterdam. But no, it's Bruges. The plot may seem relatively simple but there are a lot of deeper meanings in the film in the imagery of Bosch paintings and references to religious relics. Bruges is a city well worth visiting which I have been to a couple of times before but for me the city will never be the same again after seeing this film. The film is an 18 certificate and one can see why. Kids who may want to see it because it features four moonlighters from the Harry Potter films should not be allowed to. There is a lot of swearing in it and the scenes where people get shot are quite grisly. There is also one scene which is not for people who suffer from vertigo. Very good and Clemence Poesy also looks hot in a slip!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
the irony! oh gosh the irony was what made it!,"So I watched In Bruges last night. From the very opening of the film, Colin Farrell's voice over informs us he's a hit-man. Now, this bit of information didn't turn me off the story, but a part of me wondered just how much more this film could offer to the many hit-man parodies.Well, after viewing the entire film, I'm not sure if In Bruges added anything expediential new to the hit-man genre, but I'll be damned if it wasn't smart, funny, incredibly witty with its irony, and just all around great! In Bruges's goal isn't to add a brand new take on hit-man movies (at parts it plays on some of the same strategies as Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), but it still has its very original voice and execution. I think what made this film stand out so much for me was it's brilliance in irony! The screenwriter, Martin McDonagh (and director) knew exactly what he wanted to do, and more important, knew what the audience thought he was going to dotherefore, twisting the story into many unpredictable moments. And further, he was able to build up these amazingly funny and oddly morally-compelling situations for his characters. Like when watching the Ocean 11/12/13 movies, where you know the cast is pretty much just having one big party while filming; In Bruges's story makes it seem like McDonagh had his own little writing-partydeciding never to restrict himself when challenging his characters' morals (and always doing so in very amusing fashions) and constantly trying to make us guess ""where to next?"" I would love to go deeper into many ironic scenes, but I'm afraid that would make the film less rewarding for those who haven't seen it (and if you have seen it, I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about).Aside from all the compliments I want to keep giving this film, I do have one beef. It's one of those beefs that you let slide because the movie as a whole is just so well done, however, I feel I should bring it up brieflyperhaps somebody can clear it up for me. The only issue I had had to do with Brendan Gleeson's character, Ken. It's never really explained just why Ken gets so attached to Ray (Colin Farrell). We know the governing reason of why he feels sorry for him (and we know why Ray hates himself); however, within the actions of the film we find out that while Ray is very new to the hit-man occupation, Ken has been in the business for awhile now. Because this is the case, I feel like Ken would have had to encounter moral dilemmas like the main one in this film before. Yet, he reacts very differently during this moral-dilemma, but I never understood why this time was so different. What was it that he saw in Ray that was so moving? Surely, he's seen reactions like Ray's before within this kind of profession.Nevertheless, my small complaint is nothing to dwell on, strictly because everything else is so well executed and fun. Each actor gives a pitch-perfect performance; owning their moments when needing to and bowing down to their partners when needing too. (And Fiennes scene when smashing the phone had me on the floorsorry, I just really wanted to give that scene a shot out)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly entertaining,"When 'In Bruges' was first released, I originally didn't pay much attention to it, dismissing it (in a very stereotypical and naive fashion) as an under-the-radar box-office flop. How wrong I was.The film begins by gradually introducing the film's setting and characters; Ray, here played by Colin Farrell, initially has very little idea where or what Bruges is, or what its culture and traditions entail. Therefore this helps the audience to identify with his character, in that he is struggling to understand his current situation and how to act. Ken (Brendan Gleeson) seems to take the role of mentor at first, however as the film progresses so does his relationship with Ray, finally arriving at a point where they have a mutual friendship.To me this film seemed to be more of an action film sprinkled with dark and comic humour, rather than a comedy film with action fitted in; the second half of the film seems to reflect the former. The tone of the film shifts entirely, transforming what was once a rather light-hearted exploration of the city and the characters, into a dark, relentlessly-paced endgame.The acting from both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson is spot-on, not only settling into their characters well but humanising them; Farrell plays the role of lovable rogue Ray who's busy wrestling with his conscience, whilst Gleeson portrays a middle-aged, world-weary hit-man who'd rather hand in his gun in favour of sightseeing and Belgian culture. A star turn from Ralph Fiennes also, as a truly intimidating Harry Waters.Overall, a very well-written and superbly handled piece of film-making, proving once more that quality movies do not have to include bucket-loads of CGI effects and over-the-top shootouts and car chases to impress.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A subtle film for intellectual openness.,"Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are hit men. Their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), instructs them to travel to Bruges and await further instructions while hiding out in the medieval town, since Ray has made a terrible, life-changing mistake on the job. ""In Bruges"" is listed virtually everywhere as ""comedy"", but a slightly-more-than-superficial viewer might have something to say about that. In fact, the film is actually a complex fresco of slapstick comedy, intense mob drama, Gothic phantasmagoria and, to top it all off, grotesque extravaganza. What makes this film so unique and superb is an (apparently) unlikely combination of genres in one unfathomable, original, hilarious and outrageous script, wrongfully devoid of an Oscar. Most of the time you forget that Ken and Ray are Irish mobsters rather accidental tourists and Farrell plus Gleeson plus Fiennes equals comedic virtuosity. Colin Farrell graces us with the best performance of his entire career, full of immeasurable depth and versatility, while Brendan Gleeson watches over him with paternal warmth and veteran excellence. Ralph Fiennes rounds out the main cast as a foul-mouthed, shamefully funny and overly memorable mob-boss, thus proving his exquisite range as an actor. There is one member of the cast who is not mentioned as such, but nevertheless acquires fundamental importance: that is, of course, the town of Bruges, exuding its ancient history from every inch of the screen and wrapped in Eigil Bryld's marvellous cinematography, which gives it an aura of mysticism and mystery seldom achieved in films. Carter Burwell's full-bodied and profound score underlines the dramatic aspects of the story, which crawl almost unnoticed during the first part of the film only to explode with violent and bloody vigour in the second one and culminate into a suspenseful finale. Overall, this subtle operation is not a dish for the weak-hearted or the intellectually obtuse, as it conjures up an emotional journey which requires full involvement, suspension of disbelief and, most importantly, intellectual openness, a trait rarely found in contemporary audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A well-intentioned genre experiment with mixed results,"""In Bruges"" is a very interesting film, and as dull as that term is, it truly feels most appropriate. Writer/director Martin McDonagh's first feature length film is somewhere between a European crime comedy reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's work and an existential drama. Sometimes this works and sometimes it honestly becomes schizophrenic: a marketing nightmare. I'm not surprised it was released in the off-month of February as a result. The film is an experiment that pays dividends in ways, mostly in humor and characters, and feels curious and strange in others when it comes to the more dramatic moments. As with most experiments, it's the kind of film that some people won't be able to stand and some will flat out love.The film starts off as it was marketed, as the off-beat Euro crime comedy. The premise is simply that Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) are hit men and their boss (Fiennes, who doesn't appear until an hour into the film) tells them to lay low in Bruges and await further instructions. The city thus plays a vital role in the plot and especially in the film's deeper meaning. The gentle balance between the humor and the themes of personal inner turmoil is where the film goes schizophrenic. The first hour is mostly all lighter and the second is substantially darker. The humor exists throughout though it grows darker as the plot does.I found the humor to be the greatest strength of the film. Each joke is sort of a swift punch in the gut: you laugh hard very quickly but it doesn't linger for long. The characters were obviously instrumental in this. Though I felt Farrell's characters was a bit too all over the place, he was really quite excellent at showing his inner monologue whenever McDonagh had a shot exclusively of him with no actual action or dialogue. Gleeson is also a terrific supporting actor and brings an interest to Ken though he's not the funnier of the two. Fiennes, though his time brief, does as he always does in sucking your attention toward him. When he plays an antagonist, he always steals moments in films and this really isn't an exception.The hidden gem of this movie is the notion of Bruges as purgatory or perhaps even hell and the way it psychologically affects the characters and their thoughts about life and death. How much you like ""In Bruges"" will pretty much depend on how well you make that connection and it resonates with you. It's easy to get caught up in only the humor of it the film and totally miss all that, or in some cases that thematic content simply is too subtle. In general, I felt that because it set the tone early on as an only minimally dark crime comedy, those themes fell short with me. So while I think ""In Bruges"" is one of the more interesting films I've seen lately, it didn't click with me all the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Quite good actually... witty script!,"Surprisingly good movie. I rather liked the dark comedy element of the whole thing. The dynamic between Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes was great. Those 3 really made the movie for me! The movie made me laugh out loud in quite a few spots. Two hit men wandering around aimlessly is not really my type of thing but the script is so clever that you somehow end up marveling at the whole ridiculous story. I never cared much for Farrell as an actor - he always seems to be playing these annoying schmucks - but here he's just hilarious. Especially the way he plays off Brendan Gleeson's character. He is sooooooo bored out of his skull by being in Bruges that you almost feel sorry for him. While Gleeson is taking in the sites and all the architecture that Bruges has to offer Farrell looks like he's about to crack up or lose his mind. He's *that* bored! Hilarious stuff!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The cityscape as the main protagonist,"As usual, a great script is the basis for this great film. The story turns on a series of highly improbable circumstances (which I won't mention to not spoil the enjoyment), but the script has managed to flesh out the characters sufficiently well that we even come to expect them, or at least regard them as normal in context. The camera work is excellent, with long, static shots of the cityscape, and with zooms reserved mostly for people shots, so we unconsciously accept how Bruges and its Medieval architecture becomes a powerful player in the story, and the protagonists' life and death decisions and actions (this is a crime and morality play, so I can safely reveal that there is a certain level of violence) seem almost arbitrary and meaningless compared to the permanence and therefore emotional force of the constructed landscape against which the action takes place. In fact, the script acknowledges this several times, since the protagonists in several crucial moments actually stop shooting each other to allow themselves to change locales that they think are more appropriate (the tower on the main square is the most importance example, though at least one scene involves Bruges' famous canals). Other normally important actions – there's a great scene with one criminal, a dwarf and two prostitutes in a nondescript hotel room – are interrupted or are inconclusive. It's as if meaningful action can only take place against the backdrop of the city's public places. David Lean's films, especially Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, also tended to transform the environment from simple backdrop into an active protagonist. In Bruges does it in a much more subtle yet strangely effective manner, which is perhaps as it should be since the life and death situations in which the protagonists find themselves are all the result of venal, morally disgusting and illegal activities. The city, unbeknown to them, works its magic (despite that Ray one of the killers on the lam describes it as a ""shithole"") and brings each of them to their just desserts, hell or redemption, or perhaps both. All in all, an extremely well-crafted film that makes believable the improbable and underscores the futility of individual human action (cities are the symbol of the entire community par excellence). I haven't mentioned the actors, but Colin Farell's excesses for once are used to good effect, and Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleason are excellent as usual, and the excellent and underplayed script allows the secondary actors to shine as well. All in all, a great little movie. Life and Death in L.A. makes sense, in America, but here, life and death have strangely little effect or impact, since the location makes it such that life or death are almost predestined and thus meaningless as individual destinies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Things to to do in Belgium when you're (almost) dead,"Johanna Adorján is one of my favorite print journalists. So sharp is her mind and so acute her judgment that her reviews are universal, applicable even to movies she may not have seen at all. Anyway. She said, about some other movie, that, for reasons of clarity, it should be entitled ""Beware! Very, very boring!"" Very true, and very applicable to ""In Bruges"". I was at least as bored by the story as Colin Farrell's character is by medieval architecture. In fact, ""In Bruges"" is so boring that you wonder whether it was funded by the Flemish Board of Tourism. The movie only picks up some speed when Harry arrives on the scene. Cast against character, Ralph Fiennes plays a fast-talking mobster with a heart of gunpowder and a quirky code of honor. Minor perks include local lassies like Clémence Poésy (in the part of Chloë) and Thekla Reuten (as a hard-headed innkeeper). The one thing that makes the movie stand out despite its many flaws is Carter Burwell's music. But it feels strangely out of place in a movie so devoid of depth and drama.

"""Dark and Funny.""","The film tells the story of two individuals who land in Bruges for a vacation, as told by their employer. Their past is haunting them and they deal with it during their stay. The story is good but what makes the film better is the acting and occasional use of humor.PROS:I have always liked Black comedies. This film does not contain that much humor as is present in different films of this genre, but it manages to induce laughter sometimes owing to the acting of Colin Farrell. The story moves slowly and you might feel bored in the starting. The ambiance of the film is cold and silent. After the first half, you will feel happy that you started this film. Another good thing is that there are not too many characters so the details of the story are limited. Acting by all is top notch and Colin farrell definitely deserved an award for this.

A comic noir worthy of several viewings,"Brilliantly written and shot, this dark, un-PC tale in painfully funny while keeping its unsettling undertones. Each role is played distinctively well and the character interaction is most entertaining and impressive, even Farrell, who surprised me in several very dramatic scenes. The films cinematography captures Bruges with excellent scenery while close ups of the characters immerse the viewer. A subtle, soft piano score follows throughout the film while the suspense scenes offer great orchestration. I must agree with many that although Gleeson shines with warmth and Farrell proves himself worthy of acting, Fiennes steals the show as the incredibly rude, witty and deadly antagonist. Yes, In Bruges is a vulgar and mean spirited tale but offers a genuine viewing experience for those not squeamish to continual harsh language and bloody action.

"Not for everyone. But when it's for you, you'll think he's the best in the world.","In Bruges is Martin McDonagh's first feature film after his Oscar winning short film Six Shooter. In Bruges stars Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farell as two hit men Ray and Ken, being told to hideout in Bruges and await further instructions from their boss Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, in London.The film has all of Martin McDonagh's traits and style, e.g Lots of cursing, lots of blood and violence and lots of black comedy. His style isn't for everyone and his comedy is defiantly not for everyone, however if he is for you you'll think he's the best in the world. But, aside from whether he's your cup of tea or not, you have to appreciate the storyline, the acting and most defiantly the script.In Bruges is one of the best films to release in the last few years and defiantly 2008. It is an undeniable little gem that I'm sure people have missed. But since I've seen it, I've been hooked on what he's done previously and what he will do in the future. He's a brilliant writer and a great director and you can tell he works well with the actors as Colin Farell was brilliant in it.Great film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Two Irishmen go to Belgium...,"British gangster film: a genre that, apart from Guy Ritchie's films and Sexy Beast, has gone pretty much unnoticed for quite some time. So what makes Martin McDonagh's feature debut any different from the rest? What justifies its status as a really good gangster movie? Well, for starters, there's a lot of religious symbolism, which fits in nicely with the incessant profanity and occasional bouts of outrageous violence. Second, and this is the real selling point: it takes place in Bruges.For anyone who's never been to the beautiful Belgian city (the official name is actually Brugge, since it's in the Dutch-speaking part of the country), McDonagh's film can serve as a satisfying tour guide, despite the consistent complaints from Ray (Colin Farrell), who calls the place ""a sh*thole"". Not that he is there willingly: he screwed up an assignment (he's a hit-man, you know), and so he and his mentor Ken are hiding abroad for a couple of weeks until their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) calls with new instructions. And while Ken laps up the gorgeous architecture, medieval streets and museums, Ray says that unless he was retarded and had grown up on a farm, there's no way Bruges could ever impress him.Then, all of a sudden, Ray has an epiphany: a film set where the main character is a rude midget (Jordan Prentice). He bonds with the little fella, falls in love with a woman named Chloe (Clémence Poésy, aka Fleur Delacour from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), and starts appreciating the town a bit more (plus, a little cocaine never detracts from the pleasure). And just as things are beginning to shape up, Harry and his instructions show up for a ""social call"".The stark contrast between beauty (the landscape) and ugliness (the language and eventual bloodshed) is the key ingredient of In Bruges' weird appeal. In fact, the two aspects come together when Ken and Ray are admiring a series of paintings by famous artist Hyeronimus Bosch and Ray just can't take his eyes off ""The Last Judgement"", a splendid yet shocking depiction of the afterlife. This is also where the film's underlying spiritual theme is unveiled: the two protagonists are seeking redemption, and Bruges is their Purgatory (although Ray has another opinion on the matter: ""This is what Hell must be like: spending the rest of eternity in f*cking Bruges!""). It may seem a bit far-fetched, but then again the characters themselves describe Bruges as something out of a fairy tale, thus justifying the movie's surreal turns (not least the fact, and it's no coincidence, that the movie-within-the-movie is inspired by Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now).But the real beauty of In Bruges doesn't lie in the setting alone: who's there is also a crucial element. Gleeson is, as expected, a tough but ultimately loving presence, and Fiennes, though ostensibly ripping off Ben Kingsley's work in Sexy Beast (but hey, so did Alec Baldwin in The Cooler), especially the language (""He swears a lot, doesn't he?"" says Ray), adds an extra notch of creepiness to what is fundamentally the villain of the piece (of course, the main characters are all gangsters, so it's a pretty strange distinction). And then there's Colin Farrell, a revelation in spite of his being in the business for over a decade. It was a given that he's a good actor (just look at Tigerland, Phone Booth or Miami Vice), but the comic and dramatic heights he reaches here, with a deeply sad yet endearingly entertaining performance (for which he won a deserved Golden Globe), show that he's still got a lot to give, and it's an impressive lot, judging from this film.Bottom line: In Bruges is brutal, filled with expletives, visually irresistible, boasts terrific acting and comes with a fascinating religious subtext. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but any lover of the gangster genre ought to check out an opus so postmodern that it actually has a conversation where one character asks two people to put their guns down and one of the shooters replies: ""Don't be stupid. This is the shootout."".",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

2008 Oscar Alert!!!,"This film really astonished me. I never really cared much for Colin Farrell, but man did he surprise me in this movie. Now, of course most of the credit goes to Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes, as they bring sophistication to this raunchy flick. The dialogue, I think, was the movie's strongest point, and that just may earn it a well deserved Oscar nod. The chemistry between Gleeson and Farrell was remarkable, and the introduction of Fiennes into the affair is downright brilliant. Acting wise, Gleeson gave the best performance of his career, while Fiennes unleashed his inner beast out (reminded me of Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast). Of course, the film is somewhat risqué, but ultimately it just works out so well. It's shame that not too many people saw it, because this movie's potential is just so amazing. Alas, these little gems are overlooked by the critics, but in the heart of the fans, the movie's brilliance takes center stage. With the exception of the Dark Knight, the grand spectacle of 2008, this is the best film I've seen so far this year. With Oscar season approaching, more complex films may come, but I will always remember this fairytale set in Bruges.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"For such a beautiful city, there isn't much to see","The fault of this movie rests entirely on the script. There is a reason that movies are usually written by one person and directed by another. The collaboration tends to heal the weaknesses that each side brings to the project. ""In Brugges"" was made without collaboration. The acting is great. The cinematography is great. The soundtrack (what there is of it) is great. The story is just written and directed in such a amateurish manner that the experience becomes an hour long wait for the ""big finish"" that is spelled out so completely in the overdone foreshadowing that all surprise and excitement is lost. Think of it as going out for dinner on your birthday and being told on the way that it is a surprise party, then being told who will be there, and finally being told exactly what present each person bought for you -- all before you even open the door to hear SURPRISE!

In a Nutshell Masterpiece: In Bruges (8.5/10),"In Bruges...""You've got to stick to your principles""Defining the genre of Dark Comedy, In Bruges presents a cinematic course of continuously entertaining dialogues in a classic clash of humour and drama. A story of two hit men, ""Ray"" (Collin Farrell) and ""Ken"" (Brendan Gleeson), sent on time off in Bruges, Belgium by their boss ""Harry"" (Ralph Fiennes) after a tough job. During the few days they spend in the little gloomy town, circumstances lead them to show more of their characters and their thoughts on different matters of life.As you watch In Bruges you can't help getting pulled right into the plot and what it presents from dramatic reality. The key to that is none other than the actual setting of the movie. Think about this; the most preserved medieval town in Belgium, old buildings and little canals, and two Irishmen trying to make something of it. It all makes the place itself very interesting to the viewer even while Collin Farrell keeps going at it as being a s*** hole. Bruges may not make it to the top the viewers' favourite cities list but what makes it very fit for this film is its dull atmosphere and cloudy layout where morning scenes are as dark and gloomy as night ones; an essential element for shooting a black comedy.Evidently the strongest, most significant factor that makes In Bruges an anything but ordinary kind of film is its Oscar nominated screenplay. A rich flow of dialogues and random conversations, so irrelevant and so inappropriate sometimes that it daringly shows the awkward reality of different life situations usually acted out differently in the movies. This appears clearly in what I consider one of the most enjoyable phone conversations ever acted on the big screen; it's Harry (Fiennes) vs. Ken (Gleeson) talking about Bruges and how Ray (Farrell) feels about it. Even the excessive swearing and the use of the F word 126 times throughout the film help darken the dialogues and perfecting them for one of the most inspirational black comedies in the history of the genre.But there's always something special about any movie that's written and directed by the same person. When you take a closer look at In Bruges, you figure that Martin McDonagh has shown pure brilliance in directing his very own tight script. Having created the story himself, his presentation constantly gives a hint of pure originality in every scene. The dramatic depth of In Bruges is only deepened even more by what I believe to be the perfect cast; it's one of those rare movies where you think the writer thought of the actor even before the character itself was written. Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes, each an acting phenomenon on his own, fill in their roles in a quite convincing manner; good enough to earn Collin Farrell a Golden Globe in 2008.In a nutshell, In Bruges is one deep sophisticated yet simple story, full of morals and symbols. It is funny, it is dark and it is fully entertaining. The piano score, the medieval city and the awkward conversations, all make it quite the ride, the kind of ride you don't miss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Boring & stereotypes Americans,"Okay, so unless you're into very slow-paced movies, and whispering dialogue, mixed with bashing Americans..you'll hate this movie or at least fall asleep to it while watching it.

I know all movies shouldn't be a generic American-style action movie, but I've seriously never seen a ""drama/comedy/thriller"" this awful, particularly a British one. Trainspotting was brilliant, Snatch was amazing...etc. I usually don't mind movies picking fun at other nationalities but the way they did it to the Americans was outright ridiculous and even stood out as being irrelevant to the storyline.

Gleeson is a wonderful character actor and gives a tremendous performance here - Farrell is also a pleasant surprise - when he is usually put into the leading man roles I find him rather boring but he's powerful here as the naive, jump first =think later criminal.

It's an Excellent Drama with Some Funny Lines,"Thank God for awards seasons or else low profile yet note-worthy films like ""In Bruges"" would never have made my list of movies to watch. I first read about it as one of the Top 10 films of 2008 in about.com, together with all five eventual Oscar Best Picture nominees. Then in the Golden Globes, both lead actors Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson netted nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy. Colin Farrell won his first Globe here. From then on, I knew I had to watch this.You may wonder why I put ""Drama"" as the Genre above, instead of Comedy like the Golden Globes did. Well, it is simply because I did not think this was a comedy AT ALL! The plot follows two hit men sent to the medieval town of Bruges in Belgium to hide out after a messy assignment. The main conflicts and resolution of the story are hardly a laughing matter. Very serious issues of guilt and death are tackled here, with some very violent scenes.Certainly, there are some really funny episodes and witty lines of dialogue interspersed within that main storyline. But for me, these ironic scenes and words do not a comedy make, even if that were the intention of the writer and director Martin McDonagh. Of course, this, I would not really know.The interaction of Farrell and Gleeson was flawless. They both deserved to be nominated, yet the victory of one over the other is debatable. Farrell played the younger guy Ray who carries with him the weight of a tragic miscalculation. Gleeson is his jaded senior Ken who has already learned to find the good in bad situations. Ralph Fiennes adds to the mix with a startling performance as their malevolent boss Harry, who has a weird misplaced sense of honor.More interesting color is added to the film by the various flawed characters the two meet in Bruges. Despite the number of these people in the sidelines, each one plays an important role in the story and film never loses its focus. I have to mention here the very pretty love interest Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and the midget actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) for putting in some memorable quality screen time and dialogue.Although excellent, this may not be a film for everyone. The violent scenes can be quite bloody. There are several lines that may offend midgets, blacks and Belgians, but I guess that is where most of the black humor lay. In addition, I appreciated the fact that I watched a copy with good subtitles since the Irish brogue can get difficult to understand. And, like Ken, I do like the look, history and ambiance of Bruges, and I would like to visit that place sometime in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
All over the place,"I headed into my screening of the new Colin Farrell/Brendan Gleeson film, In Bruges wanting to like the film as much as any film I have travelled a distance to experience this year.I am one of the few that think Farrell's interviews over the years have been far better than any of his performances, but Gleeson is someone that I have admired since he stole a few scenes from Gibson and the gang back in 1995's Braveheart.Putting the two Irishmen together in a film ripe with violence and humour was as welcomed into my day's itinerary as that favourite uncle that always came to the house bearing gifts.But when the full experience came to a close, I was left feeling like I opened up the gift only to find a rattle rapped inside a knitted sweater.In Bruges stars Farrell and Gleeson as Ray and Ken, two hit men hiding out in the Brussels town of Bruges after Ray's first assignment suffers some collateral damage. The two couldn't be more opposite. Ken is the elder, father-like figure that would spend his days traveling the city and taking in the historical sites and buildings. Ray, is the cynical partner (and comic relief) that prefers to chase skirts and head to the local pub for a pint or two of local lager. Together the two are Frick and Frack. Murtaugh and Riggs. Lee and Carter.With not much going on in the small town, the two seem to squeeze their entertainment value out of the locals thanks to large consumptions of beer, some cocaine and quirky acquaintances that provide leisurely distractions to both Ray and Ken as they await further instruction from crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Particularly small man Jordan Prentice as Jimmy. As a midget on location in Bruges shooting a dream sequence in a film, Jimmy provides all the laughs that don't come from Ray's adolescent behaviour.The fun and games take a turn for the serious when Harry orders Ken to off Ray as punishment for the hit that resulted in complications. Unfortunately, this is also where the film turns predictable. You know just know that Ken is not going to kill his apprentice Ray and that Harry would end up having to come to town himself to rid himself of now two problems.And this all takes us to a bloody finale that should have been more fun that its conclusion and more satisfying than its ending.I definitely cannot fault the writing via a screenplay from director Marin McDonagh who at one time had more Oscars (with one) than Martin Scorsese. When Ray utters such non-politically correct phrases as ""If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't."" I could imagine Farrell and Gleeson sitting around a script reading table laughing uncontrollably over the audacity of the lines that are played with quick witted precision in front of the camera.But the film from top to bottom confused me and left me bouncing off the walls trying to figure out what type of film it was trying to become. It started off with the black humour and utter ignorance of a Payback, then went into a Lethal Weapon buddy/buddy film only to change pace and go incredible serious leading up to the final chapters that were more bloody than most of the horrors I have seen in recent weeks.For all that, I cannot give In Bruges a recommendation. It is one of those few films that I do expect to watch again on DVD and I hope I can be swayed into seeing the film for the individual parts even if they don't flow together cohesively. But in the meantime, I recommend that you don't go to Bruges, but you stay at home and do a virtual tour on the internet instead.www.robertsreviews.com",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of those surprisingly great movies!,"I went to see this movie with no expectations whatsoever, as i hadn't heard much about it in the press and I thought it would be one of those idiotic comedies that are only intended to lace some people's wallets. How wrong I was.From the very first line, I was hooked. The dialogue between Farrell and Gleeson is hilarious, particularly because of the Irish wit that makes this movie what it is. In Bruges contains such dark, 'un-PC' humour, and is quite brutal at times, but this just adds to the charm of the movie. Although, it is safe to say, you will be shocked at some point watching this, regardless of how thick-skinned you are. I am actually surprised they were allowed to release this, but so happy they did.My only fault with this movie is the ending (I won't ruin it) as it was rather cruel, and some of the scenes involving gunshots are especially revealing and callous.The setting is beautiful, and the diverse mixture of characters (the man in the ticket booth, the fat Americans and the skinhead ex-boyfriend to name a few) make this a magnificent experience.I would say that this film is not for everyone.

My favorite dark comedy film,"In Bruges stars Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Finnes and is directed by Martin McDonagh. The story revolves around two hit men who hide out in a little town in Belgium called Bruges. And one of them loves the town, while the other one hates and despises it. This movie connects with me as will everyone else. I can't tell you how many times I've been across the world and have been bored out of mind because this is the oldest church or the history of this piece of art. Some places around the world have interested me as well as the history, but after a while it becomes excruciating and boring. And that's what this movie does so well. In Bruges captures these two characters that we can relate to these two people. We've all been that one person who is fascinated by history and the other one who finds this place dull and mundane. Before Martin McDonagh directed Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and Seven Psychopaths this was his first movie he directed. And what he gives us is one of my favorite dark comedies since Pulp Fiction. It's so brilliantly written with subtle references to Martin's own version of what heaven and hell looks like, but for the rest of the movie it's far from subtle. He's not afraid to write what's on his mind unlike some script writers who are hesitant because they'll offend someone. Martin gives us his own version of a dark comedy and doesn't try to copy anything from Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. This movie does a brilliant job of balancing comedy and drama, but even during those drama moments the movie still finds humor. Each of the three main characters bring their own style of humor to the table as they come up with their own version of heaven and hell. Overall this is one of my favorite dark comedies that is definitely worth watching if you're a fan of dark humor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Silent kill,"My rating 4/5 I sometimes wonder what actually makes a movie boring or interesting. Is it the script, story or the pure performance by the actors? Or is it the overall mood of the movie? How come some fast phased action movies are so boring and some slow phased dramas are truly interesting? I guess there is no single answer. But 'In Bruges' makes me rethink these things.'In Bruges' is about 2 hit men (Ray and Ken) who go in to hiding and waiting for the next big job in Belgium at the tourist city of Bruges. The plot unfolds the emotional difficulties which they have to tackle whilst conquering the differences between themselves in order to be prepared for the upcoming job. And a certain regret which starts to drawback Ray from everything. While Ken calls Bruges a paradise Ray find the city to be boring and uneventful (Shithall in his own words) until he met with some local beauty. (I won't be telling the rest of the story spoiling the thriller part so don't push me) 'In Bruges' in many ways remind me of 'The American'. Of course The American was made recently and In Bruges was earlier so I think the recent movie must have had a mild inspiration there. Especially the story line including professional hit men and the wonderful sets in the small cities of Europe gives me some similarities. 'In Bruges' show some breath taking mid evil architecture quite impressively while giving several background info on them as well.The most entertaining part of the whole movie is the story. Yes there are crime and twists but more than that there are feelings, pain and emotion which drives it strong. When it comes to performance Colin Farrell (Ray) just melts his character right in to the viewer's hearts. Don't think you will ever get the feeling to forgive an assassin like you would want it to be for Ray.Overall the movie is quite slow. For the first 40 minutes there is nothing much at all other than the two guys roaming the city and talking about their differences. But that nicely creates a base for the next half of the movie which has more drama and action. Sometimes there is sudden unexpected gore which you may not get used to it until the last scene.Overall 'In Bruges' is a gem in between the monotonous vastly scattered pebbles.Read more review of mine at www.flickshout.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Fine, subtle comedy","I love Focus Features. They have really become a trademark for fine little quality movies. ""In Bruges"" is yet another one of those. I wouldn't have expected too much from a Colin Ferrell movie, but Ferrell is as great as the movie itself.""No movie classic has ever been made in Bruges"", a character explains at one point and that can be seen as a bit of a cocky announcement that ""In Bruges"" was going to be the first movie to change that. While writer/director Martin McDonagh didn't deliver a full on classic, ""In Bruges"" is bound to become connected to that beautiful fairy tale-town for quite a while.While cast, script, direction and score are all very pleasing, it's the ending where McDonagh takes some wrong turns. Suddenly the plot becomes implausible, characters motivations are unbelievable and mindless chase sequences take over. It's not enough to ruin the movie, but it keeps ""In Bruges"" from becoming a genuine masterpiece. Having said that, McDonagh's film is still this year's first really memorable and original sleeper. Way to go, Focus Features!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I wanted to like this...,"Hmm...This film had received such a lot of acclaim, I really wanted to follow suit and love it too.No doubt, it has some quotable gaffs - and the roguish Guy Richie-esquire characters certainly entertain - but I didn't even begin to engage in what turned out to be a thoroughly lukewarm bit of storytelling. The thing is, 'In Bruges' really WANTS to have charm. And it desperately wants to bear the chicness of finer British classics. I feel it fails on both accounts.Give it a rent if you're bored one night. But don't expect to emerge bedazzled, as some would have you believe.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Bruges, it's in Belgium","Over the years the genre of Dark Comedy has provided some of funniest films and television around, from Dr. Strangelove, Pulp Fiction, Family Guy, South Park, etc In Bruges can easily be classified as excellent addition to the genre.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are to two hit men who are sent to the city of Bruges after a hit goes badly wrong. They are meant to prose as tourists as their await for instructions from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). They do this despite Ray hating the city; but he finds someone for entertainment in the form of Chloë (Clémence Poésy). Ray attempts to seduce the young woman and ends up going through a number of bouts of violence in the process. But in the midst of the fun and games Ken is given an impossible choice by Harry whilst in the city which if he doesn't do it his life is forfeit.In Bruges is the first film from Martin McDonagh who is best known as a playwright in Ireland: but well, he has a talent as a director and screenwriter. In Bruges is funny throughout and whilst it does edge towards being offensive at times, McDonagh uses this to his advantages. McDonagh writes an excellent script with great, witty dialogue, funny jokes, a bit of violence slapstick and a simple but effective and believable story. His talent as a director also is shown, allowing for comedy and violence but also there are moments of real drama, darkness and character development. There is an event that couldn't be done in a Hollywood and McDonagh does shock the audience with it. McDonagh's pacing is quick and for a first time director he has some excellent shots from funny fight scenes to a more touching small moment with Colin Farrell lying in bed and cries out a single tear.There is an excellent cast in the film. Colin Farrell before this film had a reputation as a bad boy and his acting career seemed to be on the slide to poor action and indie films. But with In Bruges he was able to bounce back and proved that he is a talented actor, having excellent comedic timing and able to show he can also be a serious actor with his role. This is the best film he has ever done. Ralph Fiennes was very funny and effective as the foul-mouth Cockney gangster with a short temper. This is a very different role for the man and excellent in the film. Brendan Gleeson too was very good in the film and with Colin Farrell a very funny double. Clémence Poésy's role wasn't as developed as the other characters but she was decent. Jordan Prentice was very funny as a bigoted dwarf American actor making a film in the city.Basically an outrageously funny film throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Blockbuster from Bruges....,"""In Bruges"". When the title first struck our ears, I couldn't believe it. They were gonna film a British movie in my home town? I was astonished. Who would want to film a movie in our little city? Martin McDonagh, it seemed. We were all so very excited. It was very rare for a Flemish city to be picked as a location for a blockbuster movie.My work was in the hart of the city so I passed the set almost every day and I even did some extra work on it. By then we had also heard that Colin Farrel, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes would be in it and we were all thrilled to welcome them. Girls from local schools were saying they got Colin's phone number, girls who said they had a drink with Colin and he tried to seduce them, saying they'd met Brendan and Ralph in the street... it was everyday talk. I didn't believe much of it until I met them myself. They were just about to film the outside scene at the Belfry tower, and as I passed I just waved and... Brendan and Ralph waved back. Me and my stupid head went to them and asked ""How's filming' going?"" and to my utter amazement they just answered politely ""Very well thanks, although it is rather cold"".I recently saw the full version of the film and it is great to see how good it was. They really did a great job on making Bruges look enchanting, but in fact it always does. I think that they didn't have a lot of work to 'make' it beautiful. It already is. The script was great and the casting sublime. If you haven't seen it yet, go out to the cinema or buy the DVD. You won't regret. Not after you've seen our wonderful city and the splendid acting performances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Darkly funny and poignant film,"This movie has multiple genres; there's philosophical drama, dark comedy, action, and partial surrealism, and they're all handled rather well. The acting is fantastic from all, with Colin Farrel's hitman with a childish temper and sense of humor carrying most of the comedy and Brendan Gleeson's lofty minded hitman grounding the emotional side of the proceedings. The two of them balance each other out and are able to handle all the material excellently. Ralph Fiennes showing up late in the film pulls off sinister very well and makes the last half hour highly suspenseful yet still somehow funny. Unlike Taika Waiti, whose latest film I was fairly apathetic towards, Martin McDonagh strikes the balance between comedy in tense situations and moments of genuine pathos unlike most others, a talent he shares with his brother John Michael, whose film Calvary is one of my favorites of the entire 2010s. The brothers both have a talent for dialogue that, though filled to the brim with foul language, still manages to drop some lines that are both witty and wise to be remembered. The themes of guilt, revenge, religion, honor, friendship, and reconciliation are present in all of their films, and this one manages to include all those and still have a shootout. The location is beautiful, and this film could just be an advertisement for the city of Bruges, but the actual meat of the story is worked very capably and the setting is adopted into the story, rather than just merely being a backdrop. There is some seedy material that I think could have been done without and still had just as good a story, so I will rate it slightly lower than I might have otherwise, but I found it better than McDonagh's Banshees of Innisherin, even if it's not quite as good as his brother's Calvary.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
one of the darkest comedies ever!,"This film is a black comedy that is painfully funny.The dialogue is witty, clever and downright hilarious. A different kind of role for Collin Farrel which he performs charismatically. For my money, Brendan Gleeson steals the show, in this film he is both a gentle and warm father figure as well as a hysterical best friend. Ralph Fiennes' is very funny as a London gangster, a role that he should be playing more of.The only reason it doesn't get 10/10 is because the changes of tone are way too quick and some of the smaller roles disappear when we want to see more of them.What we have here is one of the darkest comedies ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Perfect,"I just watched In Bruges again after a gap of maybe two years. It gets better every time I see it as I always see something new in the story, the acting ... everything.Brendan Gleeson, in particular, is a consummate actor and, in my humble opinion, deserved to have won every award he has ever been nominated for. This was certainly an Oscar-worthy performance from Brendan, and close to that from the other key actors too.Yes, it's violent and visceral and there's a lot of swearing, but it's the language we might expect from characters like these. Not for the kids or the faint-hearted then, but everyone else should go see this masterclass in jet black comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good fun... But with a dark side...,"This is, again, a film I have seen before and, again, I took more out of it on a second viewing. This one seems to cover all the bases; drama, romance, comedy, thrills; it's got the lot to varying degrees. The first time I saw it, it was the comedy that stood out; this time I was more struck by the drama of it. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take a tour of Bruges while I write the next paragraph).Two hit men, Ray and Ken have been sent to lie low in Bruges (Belgium, for those that don't know where it is) by their boss, Harry, after a bungled hit. They check into their hotel only to find, to their dismay, that they will be sharing a room. This does not go down well, but it's near Christmas and everywhere is fully booked. The two men are complete opposites, Ken is quite cultured and is happy to go sightseeing in the medieval city. Ray, on the other hand, is much younger and would be happier spending his time in a bar. Ken insists they do some culture and Ray acts like a bored teenager. That is until he discovers a film crew who have a dwarf in the cast, he is fascinated with Jimmy. There he also meets the mysterious Chloe, who he invites out on a date. That evening Harry calls and tells Ken the real purpose for their visit. I will leave my summary here so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.I think the Bruges tourist board will be very happy with this film; the medieval architecture comes across beautifully. The cinematography is great and the setting adds real atmosphere. Great performances all round, particularly from; Colin Farrell as Ray, Brendan Gleeson as Ken and Ralph Fiennes as Harry, all were excellent. Honourable mentions also go to; Clémence Poésy as Chloe and Jordan Prentice as Jimmy, both were very good.As I said at the beginning, there is a lot of comedy in this film, it's mainly in the things Ray says and does. Few films make me laugh out loud, but this one did in more than a couple of places. The drama comes mainly in the final third and I found it didn't quite have the impact it might have done. I guess the comedy reduced the force of the dramatic conclusion, although by then the comedy is very, very dark. The ending, I felt, was a little bit of a let-down, I expected something much bigger. But over all, a very enjoyable film with some laughs, excellent cinematography and some great performances Recommended.My score: 8.1/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Great film, pure and simple","After the Oscar success of Six Shooter, and a great reputation as a play write, much was expected of Martin McDonagh's first feature film. He duly delivers with In Bruges, a fantastic film with commercial appeal that renews faith in British film.The story is simple, and on the surface may draw groans from people sick to death of British cinema's never-ending obsession with gangster films: two Irish criminals must lay low in Bruges for two weeks while the 'heat' from a bungled hit in London passes. As they wait on a phone call from their boss, one of the men is keen to explore this new town, making the most of his time there, while the other despairs at being in a place he compares to purgatory, failing to see the point in going round looking at buildings. All he wants to do is drink Belgian beer and wait it out. Meanwhile, in London, their boss (cockney gangster a la Don Logan) begins to reveal the real reason for sending them to this town...First of all, the location is master stroke. A picturesque town in Europe that not many will have heard of before, as the poster points out, below the title in brackets it says: (it's in Belgium). This is the first of many jokes delivered with aplomb. As for the acting and characters, at first i wasn't sure i was going to like Colin Farrel's character. He seemed ignorant, annoying and a little OTT, but he quickly grew on me, especially when his interest is finally sparked not by the prospect of sightseeing but instead by a midget on a film set. As more is revealed about his character, the more i liked him. As for Brendan Gleeson, who was also in Six Shooter, he is a very good actor, versatile and intelligent, he has a face that draws you in and keeps you comfortable. Ralph Fiennes as Harry, the boss with a clear code of ethics and conduct, is blatantly doing an impression of Don Logan from Sexy Beast, but he does a good job and by the end we find this is not only amusing but appropriate to the plot line. The other performance worthy of noting is that of Elizabeth Berrington, who plays the beautiful Dutch love interest for Colin Farrel. Her accent is convincing and her character is cheekily likable.The script is brilliant, full of jokes, satire and poignant moments. The story fizzes along and on reflection not a second of screen time seemed wasted. The plot ties everything in by the end, but refuses to end sympathetically. The final twenty minutes or so do become very dark, and those familiar with Six Shooter may not be surprised by this, or McDonagh's ability to retain the humour and believability despite the nasty things that occur. This is best demonstrated by the self-effacing humour as the film knowingly sends up previous gangster films whilst never really feeling too familiar.All in all, i went to see this expecting it to be good, and was happy to find it is better than that. The audience in the screening i attended also thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing all the way through and passing positive comments afterwards. I can't wait for Martin McDonagh's next film, it seems we Brits have another star director in the making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Masterpiece,"Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) go to Bruges to cool their heels and wait for a telephone call from Harry (Fiennes) because the last hit had gone really bad. Ray and Ken are assassins.Remember the old saying, what happens in Bruges, stays in Bruges? Hmmmmdidn't think so. Well, anyway, this is truly a good story masterfully told. All the cast are Oscar Worthy, but special attention must be paid to Colin Farrell. One day the powers that be will notice.For a while there I thought this was another Woody Allen movie - this time with humor -and humor abounds in here. However this is a serious drama that just happens to have some very good lines and, of course, acting. Timing is everything and it shows up in here all over the place. I cannot relate some of the good lines because some Language is associated with many of them.Oh, because I said Ray and Ken are assassins, please don't think this is another Bourne movie. No, this is rather slow, but very engaging. If truth be told, you will be sad to see it end.BTW, Bruges is in Belgium.Violence: Yes.

Superb,"I'm no critic so excuse me if my review is not as eloquent and insightful as some, but I do enjoy giving my views on films.In Bruges was a complete surprise to me. I didn't really expect to like it as much as I did. I hadn't heard much about the film before I watched it and found myself enjoying every minute of it.I have never been a big Colin Farrel fan but he was spot on in this film, he managed to balance the emotions of the character superbly between humour, and despair, agitation and excitement, innocence and guilt. He made the character interesting and believable. Brendan Gleeson wouldn't seem like an obvious choice to pair him up with but as they bounce Witticisms off each other the comedy is very funny. Ralp Fiennes cold icy character added another enjoyable dimension to the film.The dialog was excellent from start to finish. The sound track strangely, worked as well, it was almost haunting and combined with the medieval backdrop of Bruges created a good atmosphere.The ending was exciting and rewarding.Overall I think this is a superb film.Cheers",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very nearly top marks,"I absolutely adored 'In Bruges', that's pretty much it. I enjoyed it so much I'm finding it hard to write this review and give the film justice instead of just spewing out compliments.It was wonderfully crude, poignant and violent with lots of swearing and smutty jokes. The acting was excellent throughout, as well as the chemistry between Colin Farrell and Brendon Gleeson. The humour was wonderful and made me laugh out loud several times with pure glee, such as being blanked by an American dwarf and calling him a little c*nt.It was such a breath of fresh air and I would gladly give this film a 10, but reserve that score for those truly wonderful movies that stand the test of time. I pinched myself when I watched it for the first time, just wishing I could watch it afresh all over again, but sadly knowing the experience could never repeat. On second viewing I appreciated the film just as much, but a very small spark was missing, meaning that it isn't quite 10/10 material because, although wonderful, isn't quite brilliant and won't get better over the years.I was really entertained by this treat of a film that I enjoyed SO much.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Shocked at the positive reviews; trite and predictable,"OMG I am dumbfounded by all the glowing reviews. I think that I have to fault the script the most. Trite, formulaic, every ""ironic"" interaction was telegraphed to the viewer minutes ahead of time. When Colin Farrell's tough guy character is in the restaurant and has an interaction with an obnoxious weenie American, I've seen this exact scene so many times before... It was an agonizing 5 minutes as you sat through the predictable screen writing 101 set up moves culminating in the oh so ironic ""punch"" line. Painful. Colin Farrell's acting was way too forced and over-the-top for me, he seemed like he had to try way to hard, I found it distracting. Admittedly, the script and the directing are largely responsible here. Maybe I've seen too many movies, but this was just plain bad.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Fresh, funny and thoughtful - a great time at the movies","Black comedy is a difficult thing to do. Very often a balance between hilarity and depth cannot be struck to the point that the amount of comedy is negligible. ""In Bruges"", a story of murder, guilt, suicide and violent gun hands, faces this problem more than most. It is, therefore, a delight that this film is one of the funniest for years as well as being wonderfully dark, twisted and deep.The first thing to say is that this won't be for everyone. It is uncompromisingly violent, it, quite literally, doesn't pull any punches and it is filled to the brim with foul language. But, if you're not put off by any of this sort of thing, then this is highly recommended.It is vaguely reminiscent of ""Withnail and I"". It has three main characters who are all leading a fairly insane existence and who all find themselves in a place that they are alien to. It is also one of the most fantastically sweary films since ""Withnail"" but this is no rip-off. This is one of the most fearlessly fresh films for some years and this is largely thanks to Martin McDonagh.The script is magnificent. It may not provide much pay-off for its philosophising and it does at the end descend into a bloody shootout that is slightly over-cooked, but it is interesting in what it explores and extremely entertaining. It is the bizarre and brilliant humour that is the cornerstone of McDonagh's work. This is a comedy that pulls together witty, surrealist, observational, gross out and subtle, as well as distinctly unsubtle, visual comic techniques, with a heavy dose of character based gags to boot. The result is an onslaught of humour that is irresistible. McDonagh also brings an attractive and striking look to the film with an impressive visual style that promises much for his future work not just as a writer but also as a director.He is also blessed with a fine cast. Brendan Gleeson's quiet, restrained and likable performance is the standout, but a wonderful surprise is that the oft-ridiculed Colin Farrell almost steals the show with a brilliantly subtle and vulnerable turn. The pair work superbly whenever they're on screen together and they are handed a great deal of support. Poésy, as the love interest, is very good, as is Jordan Prentice playing the sardonic but flawed ""dwarf"" (to use the film's terminology). Ralph Fiennes obviously enjoys himself hugely here, given free-reign in a part that demands over-acting of the very highest calibre to display the insanity and menace of the character.The film ends in a marvellous moment of ambiguity having touched on many themes. Prejudice, life and death, guilt, forgiveness, justice, deontological ethics and the sanctity of life, are all there and McDonagh leaves it up to the audience to think about them. It all adds up to a great time at the cinema. Funny, thoughtful, entertaining, this blackest of black comedies is the genre nearing its very best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Gangster Pilgrim's Progress,"Many critics' reviews of In Bruges have given somewhat faint praise to the film for freshening up a bit the dying genre of the glib gangster flick. But this does an incredible disservice to such an insightful and thought-provoking and big film as In Bruges. And it is a very big film, the biggest I've seen in years - a film of big ideas, and by contrast a film just as adept at meditations on the innumerable small details of real life. Its a film as big as life, and not bound by any easy comparison to any single identifiable film genre. Its even bigger than real life, delving effortlessly past the smug external demeanor of a young hoodlum and into the dreams and nightmares of his tortured soul. This is simply Colin Farrell's greatest role that I am personally aware of. Previously I thought he was just some sort of brooding poser, not to mention poofter (is that the Brit term?) - some sort of marketing-generated icon for the gays and gals, complete with scruffy fashion and face growth and cute accent. But after this role his sins are forgiven and he is redeemed, like his character is in Bruges. He immediately gets Sean Connery stature in my book. (Brendan Gleason is terrific as well.)But as to a reexamination of the gangster ethos in general, here is something quite remarkable. The film makes us to truly understand how that world is inherently a world of authority, no different than any other government. And the men that occupy that world kill other men only because they deserve to be killed, at least in the estimation of the authorities of that world who are to be obeyed. However, things like killing children and suicide are morally unconscionable to them just like they are to most people. And the men of that world are in fact real people, that need to be redeemed and are in fact redeemable - not in some simplistic revival meeting kind of way, but via a path as complex as circuitous as the world they have voluntarily chosen to inhabit, but a path that is ultimately compelling and believable. (In the process though, some of them with the strictest moral codes do not find salvation.) This is in such marked contrast to previous films like the Godfather, in which the Catholic Church for example is just an elaborate prop and backdrop exploited by proud and callous men to bolster a false appearance of stability and respectability. (Consider Michael Corleone staring stone-faced through his infant son's christening while having all his enemies whacked.) In Bruges truly humanizes gangsters in a way that has simply never been accomplished before in any other film. Is this Romanticism or Realism. It feels like the latter.But what is remarkable is how that emotional realism is achieved in the context of a vivid psychological and cinematic dreamscape of Bruges, a place that is nevertheless quite real, a cloistered world existing in a modern one - oh well I could pile on some more metaphors, but its late. Great flick though. Really great. A lot greater than many brain-dead critics in the external reviews above give it credit for. So many great scenes - Farrell gazing out from the train as he leaves Bruges, at a dismal marsh-strewn landscape with overcast skies, a landscape reflecting the state of his own soul; the young boy accidentally killed while waiting for the priest, still clutching his hand-printed list of sins to confess: ""1) Being moody; 2)Being bad at maths; 3)Being too sad;"" And yet throughout the film the unforced humor that emerges time after time in spite of all this. Its a film of vast range and ambition, its such an inexplicable disservice to compare it to a self-conscious genre flick like Pulp Fiction. (Not to say Pulp Fiction is bad.) Maybe this film is better watched alone than in a drunken crowd at Sundance, I don't know. Four out of four stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Brilliant first movie of McDonagh,"Written and directed by McDonagh, it is his first feature movie; his ""Irish drama writer"" background shows throughout each scene, witty dialogues, black-humor, slightly melancholic yet full of action. I can't recall any movie that is this much literary, while also being a Tarantino-like ""homage to B action movies"".It's about two hit men, but they hardly seem to be inclined to any killing, and actually they hardly kill anyone during the entire movie. They are quite nice persons, with empathy, remorse, even some romantic sentiments - yes, the whole story is quite absurd, but endlessly entertaining. The actual plot hardly matters, every scene is worthy by itself, if only for the unsurpassable acting (C. Farrell, R. Fiennes, etc.). Not incidentally, the cinematography is also close to perfection.I gave it ""only"" 9/10 because there are some little clichés here and there, but it is a slight disappointment only in comparison to this otherwise very unique movie.If you have seen and enjoyed this movie, see also McDonagh's earlier short movie, ""Six Shooter"" (2005) (strange but fun), and definitely see his second feature movie, ""Seven Psychopaths"" (2012), which is quite similar to ""In Bruges"" in nature.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Much Better than I Expected,"Another case of failed marketing. The trailer for this film did nothing to interest me, but I finally saw it based on a glowing recommendation. I'm glad I did.The film is at times alternately laugh-out-loud funny and touchingly dramatic. Its success hinges greatly on the performance and chemistry of its two leads, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, and both do phenomenal jobs (especially Farrell) helped by a witty script by Martin McDonagh. It had a very ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" feel to it.Colin Farrell's role is an excellent departure from his usual characters, this one odd, hilarious, and almost child-like. I would love to see him (and Brendan Gleeson) score Oscar nominations for their performances in this film... but they won't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Outstanding Performances,","In Bruges is a great movie with a terrific story line,an outstanding cast,great characters,some very funny scenes and plenty of violence.Martin McDonagh does a great job with this movie as usual and Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleesons performances are incredibly good.If you enjoyed this movie,I would definitely recommend you see Martin McDonaghs most recent film,Seven Psychopaths,also starring Colin Farrell in the main role,you will definitely love it if you loved In Bruges.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Bruges in Belgium after an illegal job goes wrong.But Ray wants nothing more than to get away from Bruges.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
10/10,"Beautiful cinematography around beautiful Brugge, soundtrack perfectly suited to the ever-changing mood of the film, impeccable timing in impressive performances by ALL actors.I know I don't speak for everyone here, but this is filming perfection. Sceptical, comical, profound, chaotic and unpredictable, if I had to suggest you watch one more film before you die it would be this one. An exaggeration maybe, but this is a special one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A welcome surprise...,"In my opinion, Martin McDonagh's directorial debut can easily be classified as a resounding success. From the opening sequence, straight to the (almost too far-fetched) ending, IN BRUGES is full of energy and intrigue. The screenplay is quite brilliant, especially for the first 80-85 minutes or so, mixing elements of comedy, drama, and thriller in a quite enjoyable Motion Picture. The last 10-15 minutes, however, arguably seem rushed, as if McDonagh had almost felt as if he had written himself into the proverbial corner. Some of the events that occur here seem a bit too improbable (at least two such events come to mind) and out-of-touch with the deliberate pacing of the rest of the film. Nonetheless, the Academy saw it fit to nominate his work for Best Original Screenplay, and I personally applaud the nomination, despite the aforementioned flaws.I have always been a fan of Colin Farrell for his performances of unorthodox roles/characters, and this has to be one of his best portrayals in years. Brendan Gleeson is also fantastic as his more level-headed companion, and the synergy between the lead characters is quite awesome. Ralph Fiennes reprises another villainous role, and does so quite superbly. In all, the casting was excellent, as the characters manage to enhance the already brilliant screenplay. Moreover, the cinematography and score are very good, with the scenic shots of Bruges enhancing the overall atmosphere of the film.IN BRUGES is full of memorable scenes and lines, undoubtedly accentuated by the Irish tongues of Farrell and Gleeson. Worthy of multiple viewings. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 183. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A funny, and touching character drama","After a hit on a priest goes wrong Ray and Ken, the hit men involved, are sent to Bruges to hide out by their boss. While there, they get involved with a dwarf actor, a female drug dealer, and all the while Ray complains about Bruges....I don't want to reveal a lot of the plot here, but I have to say as a movie it's never what you expect. The script by writer/director Martin McDonagh is very funny in a politically incorrect way. McDonagh also directs well, getting good performances from Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes and especially Colin Farrell. This is probably his best performance yet. The rest of the cast are all good too, with a special mention to Jordan Prentice, who plays Jimmy the dwarf in the movie. His character takes a bit of a kicking via comments in the script, but he holds his own with the other actors in the movie.As I stated the movie is very funny, but it's not a comedy. Instead, it's more of a character piece, with every character well thought out in the movie, and most get their own little moments. However when Harry (Fiennes) shows up, it sets up the dramatic climax with a burst of action, which again McDonagh handles well. The climax of the movie is a little downbeat, but yet seems right for the movie.The city of Bruges takes takes a bit of beating in the script, but it looks a wonderful city, and gives some scenes a dream-like quality. It looks fantastic and a wonderful place to visit.As is the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
There's just something In Bruges you won't find anywhere else,"I found Myself compelled to write a review about this movie, if only to relive a little bit the experience. It starts slow, a bit over-dramatic, but it builds up into something powerful, something you can't and don't want to forget. It became one of my personal favourites the first time I watched it. The second time was as Good as the first, and I wanna watch again someday.There is Just something about this movie. There is a lot of very unique concepts like Drama mixed with midgets Humor, and climatic changes mixed with dark Humor. Carrying these concepts to the big screen is the perfect Cast that made me totally change my mind about Collin Farrell's value as an actor, and showcased Ralph Fiennes in a Godlike performance of the perfect antagonist you come to like way more than the protagonists.The Dialogue are perfect, and the story, while Balanced between simple and complex carries a punch that lands with power and precision. It's an instant favourite that I hope will become more and more know as the years pass by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.,"I'm not sure whether it was the fact I could relate to the dark Irish humour but I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious.As a girl, (not saying all girls feel like this!) but 'Anchorman', 'Borat' and 'Stepbrothers' just weren't doing it for me, but when I came across this movie I was in stitches; literally crying and laughing out loud.If you're browsing through IMDb trying to find a good comedy - look no further! If I could erase my movie memory and watch this again I would do so in a flash!It has witty comedy, beautiful cinematography and well, Colin Farrell. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
In(Bruges)credible,"""In Bruges"" was an absolute masterpiece. It's a dark, sentimental, and action-packed dream! The characters mixed perfectly together, and the plot was interesting the whole way through. I laughed throughout, and I was in tears too. I was browsing Netflix, just looking for a movie with my family, and picked this. I'm so glad we did! I loved this beyond words and enjoyed every second of it. 10 out of 10 is an understatement. ""In Bruges"" has to be one of the best movies i have seen. I recommend mature audiences only, at least parental guidance of course. There is coarse language, and a little bit of gory violence. There isn't too much sexual content, and there is a few moments showing the use of cocaine(snorting). Other than that, it's OK. If you're looking for a GREAT movie, watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
non-conventional thought provoking with no moral barriers,"in quick sentence regarding the plot, this is the story of a man finding it hard to live with himself. at core it is a story about redemption.it is unique in its artistic form, truly emotional and thought revolting.if you are looking for anti-hero characters search no more, you will certainly find those here. i give credits to Martin McDonagh for an excellent direction that combines art( in many forms and dialogs) with absolute reality as how it is perceived or interpreted. the feature contains many rude ""jokes"" and even racism, BUT towards making points that are entirely valid in order to reflect deep sadness or depression for example, rarely seen on the silver screen this days( as of not just going after your emotions as for you to think you ""like"" the movie , but instead for making sure that you will be able to analyze and reflect on your own personal thoughts on certain universal life related problems and/or possible solutions/interpretations).also i am sure that this movie will suffer tons of criticism but that is exactly what makes it special in a true sense; it teaches without preaching, and that alone, for me is a great achievement in being able to understand reality as being perceived from different points of view, other then my own.the above comments are intended for anyone watching the movie entirely; i say this because the introduction is quiet slow but has the point as in making the human mind relax first,as well as normalize the viewer and character's relations to each other. soon after the central character ""Ray"" will intrigue you enough at least to keep your attention and ask your own questions.however after about 30 minutes the plot reveals itself and the ""wachy"" scenes are more and more interesting. the park scene comes to mind as well as the hotel one involving ""hookers"" and racist ""midget"". situations were you can not be sure which sides has less ""evil"", something as ""you do not choose the sides, the sides choose you""...?i think that upholding skin color equality comes before upholding the ""height"" ones, feel free to disagree...also take the restaurant scene as well with the Canadian guy played by Zeljko Ivanek. as a Canadian myself, to me that scene is absolutely hilarious.(as regarding our ""wacky"" smoking ""regulations"" we have in Ontario at least.)as a matter a fact there are quiet a few takes on how north Americans and Europeans perceive each other.as a viewer you will be inclined to pick a side to the ""argument"" no matter what your ""common sense"" political correctness might ""dictate"".i was impressed with Colin Farrell performance here( note that Brendan Gleeson is great as well but the character is ""secondary""). note that i used to completely disliked this actor , considering him a ""porno"" face(where he actually started his career) and as well for such bad performances as in ""s.w.at"" or ""alexander""(where the plot really did not help his cause either). on ""miami vice"" i started thinking that i might had been wrong in my judgment, and after watching this one i realized i certainly been so indeed.Anna Madeley and Clémence Poésy's characters are very sweet and so much ""down to earth"" even if their good lucks enhance the visuals but undermine the conclusions...Ralph Fiennes as harry, the ""mob"" boss, has only a few scenes but very very entertaining ones! as a small example, seeing an Uzi submachine gun on the merchandise table;""an Uzi? i am not from south central Los fu... Angeles.i did not come here to kill 20 black 10-year-olds in a fu... drive-by.i want a normal gun for a normal person"" as about how normal his character is remains open for interpretation))).from the very first scene i noticed that the soundtrack contributes greatly towards an excellent mood defining aspect. while somehow too ""standard"" for its score choices in this feature's genre, it is very efficient in creating an intense ""calm"" mood in general, required for rational thinking, based and in accordance with what the visual shows to the viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
