Depp and Pacino in terrific movie,"For some reason a Johnny Depp movie is always interesting. Whether it is a biopic about Ed Wood, a dark fairy tale about a man with scissors instead of hands, a movie about the greatest lover the world has ever known or a adventurous story about pirates, Depp's performance alone makes it worth seeing. Here he plays FBI-agent Joe Pistone who goes undercover using the name Donnie Brasco. He becomes a wiseguy with the help of Lefty (Al Pacino), who is sort of a loser wiseguy who desperately needs to be a mentor because most of his mafia family members look down on him. Donnie comes as a gift from heaven and it does not take long before Lefty trusts Donnie completely. The problem for FBI-agent Donnie is that he's starting to like Lefty as well.The movie is a gangster movie but has its focus on the relationship between Lefty and Donnie and sometimes on other relationships. Donnie, or Joe, is married to Maggie (Anne Heche) who he hardly sees. He can not exactly tell her what he is doing and sometimes stays away for a couple of weeks. She pretends she is a widow to deal with it. We also learn about the relationships in the mafia family, including new boss Sonny (Michael Madsen).The fact that this movie is more about the people and their relationships than about the events is a good thing. Sure movies like 'Goodfellas' are terrific but to see something a little different from time to time is nice as well. If you make a movie about people and their emotions you need to have some good performers to make the scenes believable. I already mentioned Depp but of course we have Pacino here as well. His Lefty is a memorable character and it is Pacino who makes sure that happens, but the fact that Depp is as good and especially believable as heavyweight Pacino says something. Of course we have Madsen who was probably the only right actor for the macho mobster Sonny.Director Mike Newell seems to be a strange choice for this sometimes very violent and bloody story since he directed the terrific but sweet 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Fortunately it turns out he is the right man for this material, probably because its real subject is not gangsters but, like I said before, the relationships between the characters. 'Donnie Brasco' has enough to offer for people who like the gangster-genre, but even if you are normally not a big fan there is still a chance you might like it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
one scene really gives us a leg up on everything,"On one level, ""Donnie Brasco"" might just look like another mafia movie. But it's not. It tells the story of FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), who in the late 1970s was hired to infiltrate the mafia. So, he got acquainted with hit-man Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero (Al Pacino). But lo and behold, Joe got too much into the mafia lifestyle, to the point where it dominated his life and kept him from his family. And no one ended up with a very good reward at the end.Both Depp and Pacino are about as intense as we expect them to be, with good support from Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Anne Heche and Zeljko Ivanek. With his hair all greased back, Depp looks like the ultimate mafioso. I should identify that there are two scenes that will probably make your skin crawl: the leg scene, and what they do to the Japanese waiter.But don't get me wrong. This is a really good movie. It's certainly a less glamorized view of mafia life than most of Al Pacino's movies, and Johnny Depp was certainly showing the same flair for acting that he has brought to the screen for the past 16 years. Very well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gangster movie No. 1,"In a world filled with overheated, and frequently overpraised, gangster movies, it seems to me that Mike Newell's 'Donnie Brasco', the story of a cop who goes undercover to infiltrate the mob, is arguably overlooked. Based on real life events, it contains great performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino, a complex but coherent plot, addresses universal themes (divided loyalties, the evolution of human relationships and behaviour) and the ending is genuinely moving. Perhaps it's not fast-paced enough for devotees of the genre; more likely it ""fails"" this audience for its very success in portraying the mafia as fundamentally pathetic, whereas most gangster pictures at least partly buy into the glamorous myth. But for me, this a superior film to Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', with a faint note of very black comedy that sounds behind the slaughter. Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"An absorbing, well made gangster movie.","Mike Newell is the weirdest choice for director of a Mafia drama, but he actually makes a terrific fist of it, delivering one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are all in top form in front of the camera, too.Depp plays undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone in this intriguing true story. Pistone is trying to infiltrate his way into a mob family in order to gather evidence against them. He assumes the identity of ""Donnie Brasco"" and slowly but surely earns the love and trust of an old-pro hit-man named Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino). As the months go by, Pistone's marriage begins to fall apart as he is away from his wife (Heche) pretty much all the time. The line between his real life and his undercover life blurs together and he finds himself dangerously close to being seduced by the violent Mob lifestyle.Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary film in many ways. As already mentioned, the performances are note-perfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured; the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic; the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed. It's such a powerful picture, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats, whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco, that's just what you'll find yourself doing.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A deeply moving and beautiful movie.,"I read movie magazines regulary and I came across a review for ""Donnie Brasco"". I read it and thought ""I would like to see that"". It isn't really a well known film and I didn't remember it coming out in the cinema. So there I saw it, in my local video rental store, near the bottom shelf and just one copy. I rented it and I watched it. And I have to say it is one of the finest movies I had ever seen. It has drama, comedy, sadness and violence and continues to entertain the viewer until the opening of the end credits.The beauty of the film is that although Pacino plays a member of the mob you end up with sympathy with him due to his loyalty to Donnie (Depp). Pacino plays Lefty well. The movie is very funny in parts and sad in others. Lefty is a very funny character and is hard not to like. Michael Madsen is my favourite actor and although you don't see enough of Sonny Black in contrast to his importance in the book, what you do see of him is enjoyable. Although the film ends differently to that in the book it shows the workings of the mafia well. A splendid over-looked movie with a great cast and an atmosphere that drags you in. Yet you have to read the brilliant book to get the full story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Fergeddaboudid!""","For a movie that's only three years old Donnie Brasco isn't something people talk about all that much. Not exactly setting the box office alight, it's further proof that great pictures don't always translate into great financial concerns.Maybe it's the nondescript title - ""Donnie Brasco"" is hardly awe-inspiring and gives little indication of what the film is about. It turns out Donnie is the undercover name for Joe Pistone (Depp), a FBI agent investigating the Mafia. He makes a connection with ""Lefty"" (Pacino), which, while his initial integration into the group seems to lack conviction, soon builds up a watchable father-son relationship. Criticisms of the film - such as the forced nature of Pistone's behaviour becoming absorbed into the Mafia mindset - are largely irrelevant as this is a ""based on a true story"" outing.Engrossing and eminently watchable, with first-rate lead performances and able back-up from Michael Madsen, this is an overlooked and extremely worthwhile film. The only complaint? Depp's first scenes, wearing the most fake-looking moustache in the history of the movies. But it detracts little from what is a highly skilled picture. So Fergeddaboudid!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Superb mafia drama. Deeper, and rings truer than most.","First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most. Its cinematography may not have the moody, noirish atmosphere that makes The Godfather so appealing, but despite its slick Hollywood look, it seems to attain such penetrating truth (this, perhaps, has a little to do with its being based on a book by the real life main character). The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent, and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one. The performances are absolutely superb. Particularly the two men who the story centres on, Joe Pistone, a.k.a Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, going for realism in this role, is incredible. It begins and ends with a closeup of his eyes - this movie would be nothing without him) and mafia man ""Lefty"" (Pacino, who gives us one of his finest characterisations - best bit, his close-up after Donnie is asked to shake hands by a certain character on a certain boat). The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay (again, credit to the real-life source material). Recurring catch-phrases make it easy for us to get to know characters, and wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance, and make it ring true: like Lefty's smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out, and the portrait of Lefty, the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran, as a vulnerable, often emotional man.Deserves at least four stars. Recommended to anyone (except, obviously kids, for a few scenes unsuitable to them).",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Biggest Mutt In The History Of The Mafia,"With only one real scene of violence and mayhem in the film, Donnie Brasco relies far more on character development in a story of two men and the planned betrayal of one by another in the line of duty.Johnny Depp plays real life FBI undercover agent Joe Pistone who infiltrates the Bonano crime family through the good offices of Lefty Ruggiero, a small time Mafia button man played by Al Pacino. During the five years undercover, Pistone who used the alias of Donnie Brasco was responsible for about 200 federal indictments because of the work he did. It took a terrible strain on him and his family as the film so aptly demonstrates.It must have been like old home week for Johnny Depp who made his acting bones playing a youthful undercover cop in the television series 21 Jump Street. But the difference between Officer Tom Hanson going undercover for a couple of weeks at some high school and agent Pistone living and working with the wise guys for five years afraid of being found out is the difference between Donald Duck and Donald Trump.Depp's performance as Pistone/Brasco is conveyed as much by body language and closeups as with dialog. He'd like very much to return to his wife and three daughters and live a normal life, but the demands of the job make it impossible. According to Wikipedia's article on Pistone he was uniquely qualified for his undercover assignment having lived and grown up among wise guys in New Jersey. He was familiar with all the Mafia culture and could blend in easily. The strain shows on him in his scenes with wife Anne Heche, only someone with a real gift for acting could make those scenes so real.Depp is matched by Al Pacino as the luckless Lefty Ruggiero. In the Mafia code he vouches for Depp and if Depp betrays trust in any way, Pacino's marked for death.Lefty Ruggiero is a hired killer with as he boasts 27 contract kills to his credit. Yet he's also a family man with a lot of problems as is Depp. Even though the man is in fact evil, Pacino does make him a likable sort. It's why Depp is dreading the day he's out from undercover because it means certain death for a man who's grown to be his friend.Except when the crew that Depp and Pacino are part of do ambush a rival group before in fact they do it to them, Donnie Brasco is a fairly non violent film for a gangster story. Donnie Brasco emphasizes character development and a good script as opposed to bloody mayhem.I think you'll like the story about a man who turned a friend into the biggest mutt in the history of the Mafia.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Donnie Brasco,"Donnie Brasco is an unusual gangster film. It is directed by Brit Mike Newell whose filmography is as diverse as his fellow countryman, Stephen Frears.Based on true facts. Johnny Depp plays Joseph Pistone a cop who has gone deep cover to infiltrate the mob.Going under the name Donnie Brasco. He has befriended fading hitman Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino.) He has done 26 hits but gets constantly passed over for promotion and he and his comrades have to make money by robbing parking meters.Lefty becomes a mentor for Donnie and vouches for him to his boss Sonny Black (Michael Madsen.) Who in turn is answerable to his boss who is in prison.Pistone is in so deep, he soon begins to assimilate the mannerisms of gangster life which he has infiltrated for two years. This has not gone unnoticed on his police bosses and especially his wife and family, who he sees irregularly.Donnie Brasco is a character piece of the lower end of gangster life. Those that do not rise too far from the Mean Streets.Lefty has a dream of sailing away in a boat and leaving his life behind. He just cannot afford to. Donnie seems to have had a genuine bond with Lefty.For Pacino, this is a chance to be subtle rather than chew the scenery. Depp is at his best with Pacino but the scenes with his family tend to be a weakness.Overall despite some sudden scenes of violence. It lacks that touch of a Coppola or Scorsese or DePalma that stops the movie from being an epic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of the most underrated Cop/Mob film ever made!,"Having read the book, the story of Joseph Pistone easily could have been made into two films with creative leeway, and giving more in depth look on how he infiltrated la Cosa-Nostra to the point where Lefty approaches him.
I feel the uncut version fills in certain aspects that clarify other scenes in the theatrical release.
Two years prior to the Sopranos this gave you a real look into low level made guys, in terms of dress speech and personalities..Not some fantasized version as depicted in The Godfather, and not high earning mob associates who weren't ""members"" in Goodfellas.
Per the book and documentaries his infiltration was key in understanding the mafia structure so that the Feds could optimize the way they'd utilize RICO statutes and wiretapping.
The acting was phenomenal but didn't really get into some huge scams that as an associate Donnie met with high level capo regimes, a few bosses especially in Milwaukee and Florida, most notably the Heroin/Pizza ring, Vending machines, and truck hijacking and Union connections.
Pacino deserved an Oscar as did Jony Depp for there performance. Ignoring the few scenes with scams and violence and a criminal montage the movie creates an internal conflict and what amounts to a bromance, while providing a look at the different levels of sociopathic behavior and presentation amongst mafia members in the late 70s when the Commission was running the entire Northeast.
Knowing the story, and how well this movie was executed by the director of 3 weddings and a funeral...in the hands of Tarantino, or Scorsese this could have bin a trilogy or 2 part saga...while not leaving out what was emphasized in the movie.
E.G. after a year of becoming acknowledged as a ""legitimate"" associate there were members of Colombo and Bonnano families that tried to recruit him. And we saw frustration and helplessness as an agent, but not the fear and paranoia he had to experience magnified more than any ""legitimate"" associate...a wrong question, talking to the wrong person, showing that he can be a psychotic by knowing the rules.
I loved the film but it was again primarily focused on Donnie Brosco's juggling his wife, the FBI, and staying in character...it didn't go into his accomplishments things he saw and big people he came in touch with not just in the Bonnano Family.
Kudos to Michael Madison as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Has Its Moments But Could Have Been Better,"This is based on a true story about a FBI agent who went undercover in the mob . But there's a couple problems with this type of tale .1 ) You find yourself comparing it with other true life mob tales like GOODFELLAS2 ) Almost all of the audience tension should revolve around the cop coming close to getting his cover blownIt's interesting to note that the production of this film was held back due to the success of GOODFELLAS . Good idea because despite its own merits DONNIE BRASCO would have been viewed as a poor relation to the classic Scorsese mob flick . But even so you do find yourself comparing the two movies of which this one is the lesser . It's mainly due to the fact that GOODFELLAS opens with a sickening execution and never lets up on the shocks while DONNIE BRASCO pulls its feet very slowly . There's a lot of bad language but that's mainly due to their being a large number of talkative scenes with very little action until the second half of the movie with many of the talky scenes revolving around Donnie's home lifeAs for "" the undercover cop is going to get his cover blown "" subplot I was reminded of other movies like the classic WHITE HEAT and the little known Brit thriller ID and again this movie pales slightly in comparison with Donnie having to come up with a smart move to keep his identity secret only one time . Of course being a true story I shouldn't criticise too much since the producers were probably aware of this and didn't want to embellish the integrity of the factsI did give this seven out of ten which means the positives outweigh the negatives. This is the type of movie that is almost entirely carried by the cast . Pacino once again plays a gangster but he's not some psychotic mafia don here he's more of a middle ranking gangster who loses his status to a young turk and plays his character in a far more subtle manner than what we're used to . Johnny Depp is convincing enough ( He should since the movie revolves around Donnie ) and Michael Madsen is very good , again his playing is far more subtle than what might be expected . The violent scenes despite taking a long time to come are as brutal and as memorable as anything you'd see in a Scorsese movieAll in all DONNIE BRASCO is worthy of your time but if it'd been about twenty minutes shorter with most of the edited out scenes having involved Donnie's domestic friction this might have actually have been a classic true life gangster film",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Absorbing, Understated Mafia Drama Due to the Genre's Most Popular Hits","This is an absorbing film based on a true story about how Joe Pistone, an FBI agent, infiltrated the mafia in the 1970s in New York City.It is the first modern era film that is based on this kind of infiltration. Since Donnie Brasco, many movies have used this same formula using an undercover agent to partake in organized crime takedowns, but it was really Donnie Brasco that started, or at least rejuvenated, this form of the genre.The only reason I can think that it is only a 7.7 on IMDB is probably because this mafia genre has incredibly high expectations for it with the likes of The Godfather(s), Goodfellas, and even Heat. It doesn't pack the punch that those movies have and is more subdued in its delivery, but the pacing is impeccable and there is barely a moment in the entire runtime that is even a momentary letdown, which is rare. Donnie Brasco goes in a different direction than these films, focusing distinctly on the impact the job has on Joe Pistone's marriage, as well as the relationship he unionizes with ""Lefty"", in a groundbreaking role by Al Pacino, who plays an over-the-hill, stagnated, and somewhat desperate, made mafia member who feels unappreciated and disrespected to a level that deep down inside he wants out of it.Not only are the performances all solid throughout, particularly from Pacino, Ann Hesche, Michael Madsen, and Depp, but the writing is excellent and the musical score is emotionally stunning. Anyone who is a fan of the genre or classic movies in general will definitely not regret watching Donnie Brasco, a top 25 movie here. It's a 9/10, but I'm giving it a 10/10 since compared with what the average movie is today or in the past twenty years, Donnie Brasco is way above them in heart, originality, execution, and acting talent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Fuggedaboutid""","Mike Newell's 'Donnie Brasco' (1997) is a beloved gangster/mobster film about the real-life story of FBI undercover agent Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp) infiltrating the mob and befriending the gangster Lefty (Al Pacino).Here we have two great actors both in their primes, Al Pacino (in his late prime) and Johnny Depp!
Al Pacino's prime started in the '70s with films like 'The Godfather' (1972), 'Serpico' (1973), 'The Godfather: Part II' (1974) and 'Dog Day Afternoon' (1975).
The '80s were big for Al Pacino mainly thanks to one film only and that's obviously 'Scarface' (1983).
Finally Al Pacino was definitely in quite a few high caliber movies in the '90s which I view as his ""late prime"" with films like 'The Godfather: Part III' (1990), 'Scent of a Woman' (1992), 'Carlito's Way' (1993), 'Heat' (1995), 'Donnie Brasco' (1997), 'The Devil's Advocate' (1997) and 'The Insider' (1999). This was for the people who would dispute my argument and say that Pacino wasn't in his prime in the '90s anymore.
I think I don't need to do the listing for Johnny Depp as well since his prime was undoubtedly in the '90s and the 2000s!'Donnie Brasco' is a really fascinating mobster movie. This film really relies on its actors' performances. If the performances didn't work, this entire film wouldn't either. I also love how this film explains the lifestyle of a gangster. It tells us the things we didn't know from the other mobster movies and that is truly great. The fact that it teaches us new things despite the many gangster movies that preceded this one!Johnny Depp is such a skilled actor. He knew exactly how to play an FBI undercover agent basically a gangster in this case. The small nuances in his face expressions give the viewer so much information!
Al Pacino has played three types of gangsters throughout his career.
He played Don Michael Corleone in 'The Godfather' trilogy, a cold, yet calm member of the mafia.
Then he went on with Tony Montana in 'Scarface' (1983), a gangster who has a mind of his own and has no problem killing people who he has an issue with. He is much more aggressive and vulgar.
Finally we have Pacino playing Lefty in 'Donnie Brasco', a gangster who has been in the game for a very long time. At times he wishes to leave the gangster business because he doesn't see a future for himself there anymore. He has lost all hope to go up in rank!
Before I wrap this up, I would like to commend Robert Miano for his portrayal of Sonny Red. He genuinely sounds like Michael Franzese, a former 'made' member of the Colombo organized crime family!Additionally I love that this film has some really emotional scenes that are beautifully accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack making the entire experience all the more impactful!Since this is a mobster film, it would be a really missed opportunity if I didn't compare it to others in its genre.
In my opinion 'Donnie Brasco' beats films like 'The Departed' (2006) and probably even 'Mean Streets' (1973), however it comes to films like 'Goodfellas' (1990), 'Casino' (1995) and 'The Irishman' (2019), the film definitely falls short (at least a little bit)!As phenomenal as the film overall is, I cannot help but feel a little bit let down, perhaps I feel that way since it doesn't have a very satisfying and enjoyable ending! To be fair though this was the real story that actually happened supposedly!Overall, 'Donnie Brasco' is an iconic and beloved mobster picture with a lot of meaning behind it! It has some truly terrific performances as well as an emotional story accompanied by a really good soundtrack! On top of that, the film is also very rewatchable. I would like to conclude my review with: ""Fuggedaboutid""! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Depp & Pacino Save This ....Average Movie,"Donnie Brascoe is one of those movies that should have been much better than it turned out to be.

Mike Newells direction needed to be more taught...and crisp. If one of the definitions of a great movie is...you can watch it multiple times....then this is far from being a great movie.

A good gangster film with strong emotional under currents,"In the late 1970's, FBI agent Joe Pistone poses as jewel expert Donnie Brasco to win the trust of ageing mob middleman Lefty Ruggiero.  As time passes Donnie gets tighter and tighter into the mob, rising up when boss Sonny Black gets bumped up.  While Donnie puts his life at risk, his real life crumbles as he never sees his wife or children.  As he moves upwards, his friend Lefty is bypassed time and time again.  As Donnie gets deeper, the FBI start to worry and want to extract him - something that cannot be done without exposing himself and condemning Lefty to death.Now that Pirates of the Caribean has made him a bankable star as well as a good actor I decided to dig out some of my old Depp videos and watch them. I have been a Depp fan since the mid-90's when I saw Arizona Dream, Ed Wood and Don Juan all in a period of 6 months -I realised then that this was not only a very talented guy but also one who seemed happy to do whatever interested him rather than whatever was going to make money.  This film is in a well known and fairly reliable genre - the Italian American gangster movie but has the strength that it is an engaging true story.  The plot follows Joe as he gets in deeper, is suspected, gets involved in battles between bosses and eventually starts to lose himself and forget what side he is actually on.  Even though this is a true story, it still basically goes where we expect mob films to go, but it manages to rise above the clichés by having some very good characters and emotional themes.The whole gangster thing works and is gripping, but it is the relationship dynamics between Joe and Lefty that made it more interesting.  The element of going `native' when undercover has been done plenty of times, but it is the combination of this being fact and Depp's great performance that makes it work well here; we feel for Joe a great deal.  On the flipside the film also allows us to feel for the mob, or at least one of them.  The majority of the mobsters are the usual stereotypes but Lefty is written with a great deal of sympathy - he is a middleman, taking the risks, doing the dirt but always passed over and having to beg money to keep his bosses happy. These are tragic characters and the film is not the slightly glamorous gangster lifestyle that Pacino has experienced in his Godfather roles.  These two characters are well written and it is their subplots that makes the film better than the central plot (which itself is also very good).Depp is good and his performance is solid even if it doesn't really rank up their with his best - he lacks his usual flair but he gives the material it's dues.  Pacino is of course, wonderful.  His character is a far cry from his Godfather work and he manages to bring such pathos to Lefty that it is impossible not to feel for him.  The support cast may not have as much in the way of character but they all do well in their roles.  Madsen, Kirby, Ivanek, Heche, Miano and others all give good support, but it is Pacino and Depp's film - which is a good thing.Overall, the fact that this is a true story makes it more interesting but, while I was watching it I wasn't really thinking about it and was just enjoying the gangster film itself.  The basic story is a well worn one but is still delivery well by Newell (who was a very unusual choice for director), but it is the emotion threads involving Joe and Lefty that make the film much more than just another gangster film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Calvin Klein model infiltrates the mafia? fuhgeddaboutit!,"This is a fascinating film, but I felt that it was unforgivably (and unforgettably) marred by Johnnie Depp's extreme comeliness. His acting was great, but c'mon! He has the skin of a model--not a single facial flaw?! He doesn't even have crow's feet or visible pores! Devoid of the leathery skin so characteristic of the true gangsters, whose excessive use of alcohol no doubt contributes to the premature dehydration of their skin, and whose deeds weigh heavily enough on their conscience to cause deeply furrowed brows, Depp looks as though he has spent his life at a health spa drinking mineral water! Really, too much! When I watched the documentary included on the DVD, I found that, sure enough, the true Joe Pistone actually looks as though he could possibly be a gangster. That was how he succeeded in feigning fraternity with Lefty for six years. Johnnie Depp? Don't think so. Totally implausible. Invraisemblable. A major casting flaw in an otherwise excellent film.The story is a genuine tragedy, no doubt. And Al Pacino did a wonderful job as always--though I did note that in a couple of scenes he was empirically distinguishable from Rickie Roma in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. I guess that's okay, though, since Roma was corrupt in his own sort of way. In other scenes, I saw the protag from SCENT OF A WOMAN. I guess that makes sense, too, however, since Lefty was aging and full of regrets as well.Definitely worth seeing and very thought-provoking, but it takes a real effort to suspend disbelief when it comes to Depp's role. Again, not a criticism of his acting, but of the casting and/or make-up crew. I am confident that his image could have been roughed up, but for some inscrutable reason, this was not done.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
These aren't very nice folks!,"""Donnie Brasco"" is a film inspired by the lengthy undercover work done by FBI agent Joe Pistone. It was incredibly dangerous work, as he infiltrated the mob in New York and could easily have been killed.The film follows Donnie (Johnny Depp) from the beginning of his friendship with Lefty (Al Pacino) to becoming a trusted man working for Sonny (Michael Madsen)...until eventually the assignment was terminated and arrests were made.Like any mob film of the era, this is NOT a movie to show your kids, your mother or Father O'Reilly if he stops by for a visit! While not as violent and repellent as some mobster films, it ain't kids' stuff and you should think twice about watching it because of this.Technically speaking it's a very good film with some nice performances and decent writing. My only complaint is that Pistone felt the film was 'about 85% right' according to IMDB....and I'd love to know where the 15% comes into it! Overall, one of Al Pacino's and Johnny Depp's better films...but not for the faint hearted.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Not bad, not great.","""Donnie Brasco"" tells of an FBI agent (Depp) who infiltrates a NYC mob crew where his allegiance is tested by his growing affection for his aging wiseguy mentor (Pacino) to the dismay of his wife (Heche). The film is chock full of stereotypes with the same old character actor faces we've seen playing mob types before and lacks the grit or edge one would expect of a crime flick based on a true story. The film's matter-of-fact approach to life in the mob keeps emotions in tow with little stretching required of the players and provides a sort of ""business as usual"" backdrop for the real crux of the story, the waxing relationship between Depp and Pacino and the waning relationship between Depp and Heche. The result is moderately captivating 2 hour film with respectable marks from critics and public which should make a worthwhile small screen diversion for crime buffs.

It's got the right flavor, but it's missing the fizz.This movie is almost like a parody of the mafia. I mean, how many times are we supposed to hear a character say ""fuggedaboutit"" before we roll our eyes? At one point, Depp explains this cliche mafia phrase to his pals at the FBI.The biggest problem, then, is that the writing is painfully mediocre. The characters are poorly written and not properly cast. Donnie (Depp) is dull and flat and boyish, more suited to a lesser role like a fixer or a cleaner than an FBI informant. Leftie (Pacino) is too weak and dopey to warrant a leading role (I mean, the name says it all). He is a peon with nothing to his name, living in some ramshackle apartment and borrowing a hundred dollars here and there from Donnie. And Sonny Black (I don't know the actor's name) is more a henchman than a mob boss.Second, and partly as a result of the first problem, none of the characters are sympathetic. As a viewer, I didn't much care what happened to any of them, and thus the relationships lack the sort of emotion and believability that is required to make a great movie. This is especially true of the father-son-like relationship between Lefty and Donnie. For one, not enough effort or time is spent trying to develop that relationship: Lefty meets Donnie in the bar, they beat up a guy who gives Leftie a ""fugazi"" diamond ring, and suddenly they're inseparable. Throughout, Lefty says the right words, telling Donnie at one point that he loves him, that he would throw a hand grenade into every store on the street for him, but it's just unconvincing. Donnie's job as an FBI informant turns him into an absent father whose marriage is falling apart. The woman who plays his wife does the best she can with the script, but don't get me started on his three kids. They are utterly lifeless, and Donnie's attempts to be a good dad - sneaking into their rooms to say good night, or talking with them over breakfast - falls totally flat.The movie only begins to get interesting in the latter third. We FINALLY see some violence (I thought this was a rated R gangster movie?). And there are scenes that almost succeed in building suspense.The cinematography and score are neat and tight, and I did chuckle a few times at the mafia humor. The writing and acting are mediocre and a bit goofy, but passable enough. For these reasons I almost gave it 7 stars. But it's just not that good.And so 6-out-of-10 stars it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Al Pacino's Best Movie,"Yes, I am going to make the bold claim that this is his best work. ""Are you talking about the same Al Pacino that did Scarface, Heat, AND the Godfather movies"" you ask. Yes, yes, and let me explain myself. First of all, I want to add that I LOVE Pacino's work. He has such a commanding presence on screen and nobody in cinematic history can scream as well as him (though Gene Hackman is damn good). He can scare the hell out of you with just one crazed look in his eye and he never gives a flat performance (well, except in Revolution).Having said that, I think Pacino is incredible in this flick because his character is so understated. While his work often consists of playing flamboyant, over-the-top, and almost cartoonish figures(especially in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate), this film is a change of pace for him. Sure, he's still playing a mobster, but he's not as psychotic as usual, and for once, you get to see the inner struggles of a crook who deep down has a heart of gold (despite all of the murders). Pacino is perfect as Lefty, an aging crimical who wants out of the mob lifestyle, but doesn't know how to do it. Though you see the fast and fun world of mobsters in flicks like Goodfellas, this film gives you a sense that the mob life isn't that glamorous.Along with Pacino's acting, Johnny Depp is delectable as Joe Pistone (Donnie Brasco) because you can see his inner torment as well. He knows that he's been assigned to infiltrate the New York mob scene, but he develops such a close bond with Lefty that it's almost hard to bring him down. A very real, human relationship permeates between the two that is very moving. I like how the characters are always joking about being a ""wise guy,"" as it provides some light chuckles, and it also shows that in order to live this lifestyle, you've gotta talk tough and act tough (as if I would know what that's like).The supporting cast is particularly noteworthy. Bruno Kirby plays a great weasel, Anne Heche is wonderful as Pistone's neurotic wife (you can understand her suffering, what with being married to an FBI special agent) and Michael Madsen is reliable, once again, as a mobster (honestly, does this guy do anything besides gangster or sci-fi flicks?). Every time I watch this movie I am breathless afterwards. The acting is wonderful, the music is superb, and frankly, I can't believe this stuff actually happened. Then again, I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much of it is true.Overall, this movie gets 10 out of 10. I'm shocked it doesn't get more recognition, especially with such prolific actors as Pacino and Depp leading the way. This is a different kind of mob movie, as it shows a more somber side to this way of life, and I recommend it unequivocally.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Over-the-top gangster movie  perfectly interpreted by two superstars and masterfully realized,"Interesting and thought-provoking flick film that had a great importance of wide range on subsequent films and TV series as the ¨Sopranos¨ . Powerful portrait of an undercover agent along with the rise and fall of a gangster extraordinarily performed by Johnny Depp and Al Pacino respectively . This is one of the greatest mobster movies and a high watchable story ; being an expertly directed film by Mike Newell and made Johnny Depp a superstar . An FBI undercover agent named Pistone infiltrates the mob and finds himself identifying more with the mafia life to the expense of his regular one . Using the name Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp) , he befriends a 'made' mafioso Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero (it is an amalgam of the real ""Lefty"" played by Al Pacino and the real ""Sonny Black"" Napolitano performed by Michael Madsen) . Brasco becomes tight as the group goes about collecting cash for 'the bosses' . A deep dilemma is afforded to Donnie, who knows if he walks away from the mobster family , Lefty will be the one killed . Brasco is married and has three children but he is away for months at a time eventually leading to his wife (Anna Heche) asking for a divorce . The mission forces him to virtually leave his family , living among the ¨wise guys¨ , as he turns more and more part of the Mob group.Excellent and top-of-the-range mobster movie contains top-notch performances , pretentious familiar drama , thrills , fast-paced , action , being richly narrated and including an emotive final . Although also packs strong scenes , violence and profanities , as the word 'fuck' is used 185 times . Fresh and intelligent screenplay by Paul Attanasio, based on real N.Y.C's Italian Mafia families , including interesting characterizations taken from Joseph Pistone's memoir . Johnny Depp's sensational performance , he met with the actual Joseph D. Pistone a number of times to gain knowledge and expertise for the role , he also took gun firing lessons from the FBI . Top-drawer acting by Al Pacino as a low-level hoodlum who becomes Depp his protégé . Secondary cast is frankly excellent as Michael Madsen , Zeljko Ivanek , Robert Miano , James Russo , Zack Grenier , and brief interventions by then unknown Paul Giamatti , Tim Blake Nelson and almost extra Gretchen Moll . Special mention to Bruno Kirby as Nicky , when the project was in its first stages, Joe Pesci was the first and main choice for Nicky , but after the release of Goodfellas, the idea gradually faded . At various points Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Andy Garcia were all previously attached to star ; Stephen Frears to direct ; however getting direction the British Mike Newell . Atmospheric and evocative cinematography by Peter Soba , despite the fact that this was filmed in Super 35, ""Filmed in Panavision"" is listed in the end credits . Emotive as well as thrilling musical score by Patrick Doyle . The motion picture was very well directed by Mike Newell (Prince of Persia , 4 weddings and a funeral , Mona Lisa smile)¨Donnie Brasco¨ , rating : 7,5 . Well worth watching , above average ; the picture will appeal to gangster genre buffs and Johnny Depp/Al Pacino fans .",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Johnny Depp is not believable in this movie.,"There is something sad, indeed pathetic, watching actors playing racketeers. Even more pathetic is the portrayal of a police officer actually infiltrating a gang without being found out by the gangsters. Asking the audience to empathize with a gangster is a tall order. Okay, gangsters are people too and have their good sides but to ask the audience to believe that an undercover police officer and informant can actually develop some kind of fondness for the target of his investigation is stretching things a bit far. Johnny Depp was woefully miscast for the role of the undercover officer. There is no way that Mr. Depp's character as played by Mr. Depp would not have been quickly found out. He just does not come across as a tough guy which is what he would have to have been in a world populated by tough guys. His character is too polished and stands out like a proverbial sore thumb. Al Pacino gives a far more credible performance as one of the tough guys. Indeed, he should have played Brasco. In Stalag 17 the informant was the soldier who everyone trusted. Why? Because he fit right in with all the other soldiers. The same cannot be said for Donnie Brasco in this movie who is so obviously not a gangster that it's almost laughable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Pulled me right in,"The unlikely friendship between an aging mobster and the cop that's trying to bring down the family.And in filling those roles, Al Pacino and Johnny Depp are superb; the whole fanciful (yet true) story rides on their chemistry, and they deliver, no question. It's a film that (believe it or not) asks you to sympathize with the mob; which isn't really all that hard with how callous the FBI is.I loved seeing Pacino as the devoted foot soldier, seemingly always overlooked for promotion; he makes it easy to root for this guy. Equal praise for Depp, whose concern for his elder is evident. This is a trope that's been done before (the cop that loses his way) but he infuses this role with compassion, and it makes the mob material that much more entertaining (also suspenseful). Case in point, his trying to explain ""fuhgeddaboudit"" to his fellow agents. It's a nice scene, unusually heartwarming, and it was a high point for me.I guess I didn't expect to be so moved by this film (especially the quietly devastating ending), but as mob movies go, this is top-tier, most definitely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Unusual gangster story works very well,"At once a worthy and intelligent gangster tale, with less emphasis on extreme violence and melodrama than previous offerings in the genre. This is a character-led drama which draws excellent performances from both Johnny Depp and Al Pacino as the cop and seasoned criminal who become unlikely pals during the course of the film. The supporting players are also good - particularly Michael Madsen, on hand to play yet another sociopath - but it's Depp and Pacino who the film belongs to. Depp gives an ambitious, multi-layered performance of a cop torn between his duties and his loyalty for his new friend, while Pacino is surprisingly restrained and different to his normal persona.Of course, there are still the typical gangster trappings, such as the dismemberment of a corpse in a basement cellar and the systematic beating of a Japanese waiter in some toilets, but this is a film more about people than anybody else. As the inevitable conclusion draws closer, the suspense level rises to an unbearable level and there's a powerful, upsetting conclusion to prepare for. A gripping, involving piece of mature entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Good, off-beat, mob-themed buddy-film","FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone (Johnny Depp) infiltrates the New York mob by posing as a jewel thief named Donny Brasco and befriending low-level wise-guy Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero (Al Pacino). Depp is very good portraying the agent as the lines between cop and mobster begin to blur as he gets drawn deeper and deeper into the violent criminal underworld. Pacino is also very good as a discontented, aging mobster who feels sidelined, and much of the film is about the awkward friendship that develops between the two men despite Lefty's suspicions and Brasco's knowledge that Lefty will likely be 'whacked' for unwittingly facilitating the FBI operation. The film is amusing at times, especially the scenes where an exasperated Lefty explains mob etiquette and proper wise-guy behaviour to the neophyte 'good fellow'. The rest of the cast is good and, refreshingly, the film depicts mob life as somewhat less glamorous than other similarly themed films. Like most Hollywood 'biopics', some artistic license was taken and the film is far from a 'history lesson' (notably, the hit on Sonny Red was nothing like the scene in the film). Good, entertaining gangster film with a somewhat different feel from the ubiquitous Scorsese films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Only good for....,"I got bored watching this movie once and decided to give it a try again to watch it the whole way through. This movie was really only good for Johnny Depp's performance and character.

There may have been one or two scenes with something suspenseful happening with the gang but it wasn't enough to get me invested in the story more.

A Passable Movie,"With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man ""Lefty Ruggiero"". Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent ""Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone"") and Michael Madsen (""Sonny Black"") also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche (""Maggie Pistone"") was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Very good...,"""Donnie Brasco"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the story of an FBI agent who infiltrates the mob. His life changes a lot and he has to fight crime from inside without letting his other life come in front.I enjoyed this movie very much because it was based on real events and the plot was very interesting since it contained plenty of suspense. The direction which was made by Mike Newell was very good and he created a mysterious atmosphere that was combined very well with action. The interpretations of both Al Pacino who played as Lefty and Johnny Depp who played as Donnie Brasco were simply outstanding and their combination worked very well.

Among the best written movies in the mobster genre,"Johnny Depp and the rest of this production about FBI's undercover operation to infiltrate the Bonanno crime family is exquisitely stylish-looking in its pre-millennial 1970s nostalgia. The picture is like a postcard for slick hair, squeaking leather jackets, and big collared shirts, worn by tough-talking guys who more often than not talk past one another and resolve any misunderstandings with the omni-meaning phrase ""Forget about it!"" Al Pacino plays Lefty Ruggiero, a constantly overlooked, semi-important cog in the wheel. He strikes up a friendship with undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone (Depp), who poses as the seemingly loyal and trustworthy jewel thief Donnie Brasco, and gradually Lefty introduces him into the family. The script by Paul Attanasio (Quiz Show), based on Mr. Pistone's own autobiography, is among the best written in the mobster genre. It details the organization's combined complexity and banality with clarity and fervour. You get sucked into this world, not because it's so frigging interesting, but because you start caring for these people. They're all more or less small, insecure boys acting tough. And there is a deeply human side to everything they do. In the midst of Mike Newell's slickly produced, handsomely photographed film - arguably his magnum opus - there is a moving, constantly fascinating and nuanced story about friendship, loyality and distrust. And Al Pacino and Johnny Depp create dynamite playing off of each other. They both give close to career-best performances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

He's a good actor, but I suppose being a fan of the Sopranos has spoiled me for good, authentic casting.In no way does Depp look Italian, or even old enough to be this knock around jewel thief. He looks like a college kid. Someone with a bit more edge, Italian ancestry and age would have been a better fit. The casting of Sonny Black was off as well. It was hard to buy him as a Mafia capo. Some liberties were taken with the truth because Kings Court was in Pasco County, north of Tampa, not Miami. And yes, there were tensions in Pistone's marriage but it was overplayed for the screen.

An impressive mob movie,"This film is centred on undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone. Posing as a jewel thief named Donnie Brascoe he gains the confidence of Lefty Ruggiero, a hitman working for one of the New York Mafia families. The two gradually become friends and Lefty explains the ways of the mob to him; it isn't long before Pistone is associating with more senior members of the family. As this is going on Lefty starts to feel bitter as his loyalty to the family goes unrewarded and others are promoted ahead of him. The undercover work threatens Pistone's marriage and his superiors fear that he is becoming his assumed persona.I really enjoyed this film; while it is ostensibly about an undercover operation against the mob it is just as much a character driven film about Pistone's genuine friendship with Lefty; a friendship that will get the latter killed if Pistone's true identity is revealed. The scenes where the two of them just talk is a delight; Al Pacino and Johnny Depp hand a fine chemistry as Lefty and Pistone respectively. The rest of the cast is solid too. The film doesn't dwell on the violence of the mob but neither does it shy away from it; especially in a scene when one group of mobsters is wiped out by another. The story is gripping and told in a way that makes the mobsters sympathetic even though their crimes aren't whitewashed. It certainly doesn't glamorise the lives of the mobsters; they struggle to make the money demanded by their seniors and rarely seem to enjoy themselves. The '70s atmosphere is captured brilliantly; it would be easy to believe it was actually made then if one didn't know otherwise.

Good film overall,"Gangster movies reach far and extensively throughout cinema these days. The genre goes back a long ways, and has shifted its tone and changed its course many times throughout cinema history. Gangster movies can stretch from some of the best movies the world has ever seen, to some of the worst. There are many that are must see films, and then there are those that aren't worth bothering with. Donnie Brasco is one of the ones worth watching.Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Edward Scissorhands) plays FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone who is on a secret undercover mission to gather information on the Mafia under the alias Donnie Brasco. He is clever, sly, and also short tempered. All these play an important role in the development in his character, as well as the story. Donnie first meets and quickly befriends Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero, one of the boss' right hand men. Because of this friendship, Donnie Brasco quickly gets his foot in the door and begins working his way up the mafia ladder. Yet, it isn't long until he becomes too engulfed in his alter ego, and he watches as the operation, as well as his family life, crumble around him.Donnie Brasco is a movie filled with intelligent and fast paced dialog, with characters that are all very intriguing and equally important to the progression of the story. With the kind of cast line-up that Donnie Brasco advertises, you'd expect nothing less than superb. And that is what you get. The fantastic big name stars deliver a very believable look into the darker side of mafia life. The chemistry between Depp and Pacino is very convincing, as well as riveting and exciting. Every exchange between the two will have you wanting more. Watching two great actors such as Depp and Pacino is a delicious treat to the eyes and ears, especially with hearty and fulfilling dialog to carry their characters. I think I've made it clear that the character driven aspect of Donnie Brasco is nothing short of brilliant.Before I continue I should make note that Donnie Brasco is based on a true story. The key word in this description is always ""based."" When a movie is based on a true story it is expected that the truth will be stretched and dramatized for cinematic effect. However, I felt that this was only slightly true for Donnie Brasco. It seems that the movie didn't deviate much from the actual events, and this leads to a large chunk of the film simply being mob men doing mob things. Of course it all builds up and plays into the climax of the film, but I found myself losing interest towards the middle of the film. The way the film ends requires a lot of events to happen to get to that point, and some of these events aren't as thrilling as one might expect. Donnie Brasco seems to slow down and lose its focus in the middle, only to pick up again towards the end.I also had a problem with the story of Donnie Brasco's home life, where he is Joe Pistone. Because of his extremely secretive job, Pistone must keep many secrets from his wife and children for their own protection. While this side story ends up playing an important role in the film, I thought these scenes seemed out of place and possibly could have been worked in better. The storyline within these scenes themselves is very important and obviously very necessary. There is also the ending. The climax of the film is fantastic and will take you by surprise, but the very ending of the film is very abrupt and makes you feel like you might have missed something. It could possibly require a second viewing to fully understand what happened, but I'm not sure yet.From a character standpoint Donnie Brasco is excellent. The characters are great and their dialog greater. It is a story that keeps you interested, yet also leaves something to be desired. Overall Donnie Brasco is well worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The story about friendship and betrayal,"I disagree with those who say that this movie is good only because of Al Pacino and Johnny Depp. Of course they made this film better, but what I liked the most about this film was the story and direction. Al Pacino get less of the show in this movie, though every time he was on screen, he was brilliant. Johnny Depp did a great job, as always, but like I said this movie isn't good only because Al Pacino and Johnny Depp was in it. Carlito's Way had Al Pacino and Sean Penn, both of them did well but the movie still wasn't that good because of the weak plot. This movie had some touching dramatic moments and also some intense moments (since it's a story about undercover cop).

Not as good as I had hoped but still a fine film,"I had heard a lot about ""Donnie Brasco"" and thought it would be really great. First of all it stars two of the best actors of all time - Pacino and the underrated, truly wonderful character actor Johnny Depp who has struggled throughout his entire career turning down big-budget roles in order to separate himself from the ""pretty boys."" His role here is convincing - but somehow it left me feeling a bit unimpressed overall.Pacino, however, is really good and totally cast against type. Seeing the trailer, reading about the film, viewing the DVD cover, I just _knew_ it was going to be another one of Pacino's recent cocky, yelling roles (e.g. Devil's Advocate). However he really portrays his character well, and I was surprised to see him playing a loser versus the Mafia kingpin I had expected. I thought Pacino's character was a Mafia don or something, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that he's actually a lowlife in this film and Michael Madsen plays the kingpin.Unfortunately the film itself left me a bit underwhelmed. It's nowhere near as good, heavy or memorable as ""GoodFellas,"" which is sort of unfortunate as they're so often compared on Internet forums (just take a look at IMDb!). They're really not in the same league as far as I'm concerned and although ""Donnie Brasco"" is a fine film with two good performances, it overall just left me wanting more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Donnie Brasco the new Godfather? Fuhgeddaboudit.,"A great cast including 3 of my personal favourite actors (Depp, Madsen, and Pacino) made my expectations of this film high. Other positive attention from people, critics, and not least the Oscars led me to expect a gangster film to rival The Godfather for the first time since Goodfellas. However, this it did not do. Although the acting wasn't bad, the script made it impossible for their characters to be taken seriously. One clichéd attempt at recreating the aforementioned films after another made this tedious and cringe-worthy to watch - especially in light of the resumes of the cast. The fact that the film was based on a true story does give it credibility, and doubtless it may be a faithful version of the actual events considering the involvement of Pistone himself in the production. However, this does not excuse the fact that we are presented with one mob stereotype after another - regardless of how close to reality these stereotypes are. It may have worked as a tongue-in-cheek film along the lines of Wiseguys, but as a serious, emotionally affecting gangster film it fails. If you want a ""How To.."" guide in being a stereotypical Hollywood-style gangster, this is the film for you. If you're a fan of Depp, Madsen, Pacino, the gangster genre and good films as a whole - DON'T see this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Not simply a shoot them up gangster movie with gratuitous graphical content. A film with depth and moral questions but carried by tension and enjoyable characters,I'm not the biggest fan of gangster type movies. They tend to be full of cliche and stereotype in my opinion and rely on graphic content for entertainment and therefore are often thin of depth. But this was one of the better films of such ilk that I have seen. It presents a really interesting relationship and moral questions about who is right and wrong and when justice is necessary and to what extent etc. Its not just your bad guys shooting loads of s**t and the cops on their tails. Al Pacino's character was especially endearing and memorable. Johnny Depp did a good job as the somewhat conflicted cop.

Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are probably one of the greatest pairs EVER!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Depp, Madsen and Pacino... How Can This Possibly Go Wrong?","Donnie Brasco is the true (or at least mostly true) story of FBI agent Joseph Pistone undercover in the Bonanno crime family in the early 1980s. Exactly what you expect to happen in a mafia family does happen.At first, the film was nothing special... the fact it was ""real"" meant that it had some of the more sensational things I have seen in other mob movies missing. But, this is made up for in the second half when Brasco gets to the higher ranks. So, if you are bored at first... wait it out.Al Pacino is golden as always. He simply can do no wrong. Sure, you think ""Gigli"" sucked (and you are not alone in thinking this) but I will tell you that he was the crown jewel of that film (even more than my man Christopher Walken). In this film, he is a little more washed up than in other roles, but still very menacing in his own way.Johnny Depp? Sure, he has made a mistake or two (I am still not sold on ""Secret Window"" or some of his later work with Tim Burton), but this is not one of them. Not only is he fantastic as Brasco, his acting is convincing enough that I might not even have recognized him as Depp if I was not aware of the fact. Well played, Mr. Depp.Michael Madsen, a godsend. ""Trail of a Killer"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" are both Madsen goldmines, and this is another... ""Kill Bill"" a little less so. Ignore ""Free Willy"", it is films like this that Madsen really shines in.Worth a watch if you like gangster films or historic films... or both, I guess. Quite a delightful piece of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
That final Lefty scene,"The movie is touching for the realistic view it portrays of life in the mob, but I think the most touching part is when Pacino´s character, Lefty, is called by his bosses in his last appearance in the film. He knows it´s time to get off the bus, we know his fate, however, we didn´t know how sure he was of his departure and how truly resigned he was.Seeing Pacino remove his neck chain, his watch, and his wallet after kissing his helpless and unsuspicious wife is a refreshing reminder that challenging plots and admirable performance are still alive. Well, it´s Pacino after all.Depp also did an excellent job. The rigidity of his facial gestures all along the movie, especially upon realizing the boss likes him during the boat ride, is remarkable.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A worthwhile gangster flick but ultimately second rate,"""Donnie Brasco"" tells the true story of how FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in an operation that lasted six years. He is tutored in the ways of mafia life by long-time thug 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Al Pacino) and soon finds that his professional life is putting great strains on his personal life.As you might expect, several liberties are taken with the actual events. In some cases these tweaks give the film a manufactured feel but for the most part a sense of realism is retained.The cast is pretty good with Al Pacino giving the best performance as a world-weary mobster. Johnny Depp is solid as always and Anne Heche holds her own in the scenes they share. The various mobsters seem mostly authentic but the only real standout is Bruno Kirby.On a technical basis, the film is well constructed. Mike Newell's direction is workmanlike and suits the picture well. The score and soundtrack also uphold the atmosphere without being obtrusive.I recommend this movie to those who like gangster films and/or crime dramas. It may be second-rate when compared to the likes of ""GoodFellas"" & ""The Godfather"" but it's still worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Great movie!!,"An incredible mob movie which is based on a true story. Director Mike Newell does an excellent job behind the screen but what's on the screen is even better.

This is a powerful movie that should be viewed by any mob movie fan or just a movie fan in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An introspective contribution to the crime genre.,"'Donnie Brasco' makes a worthwhile contribution to the Mob genre. While it may not sit on the pantheon alongside 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas', it bridges a frequently overlooked dichotomy of lawmen and lawbreakers, dividing the viewer's loyalties. (This theme was built upon a decade later in 'American Gangster', although the line between good and evil was drawn more starkly in Ridley Scott's film.) Al Pacino delivers a refreshingly reserved performance as 'Lefty', an ageing gangster living in a pitiful way. The story of how he takes Johnny Depp's 'Donnie Brasco' (the pseudonym of an undercover FBI agent) under his wing, willingly jeopardising his own position, unfolds very enjoyably. We soon find (I did, at least) that the intricacies of Mob life are of secondary interest; even the precarious life of 'Donnie', our protagonist, takes a backseat to the plight of 'Lefty'. However, Depp's character is not uninteresting, simply less sympathetic. The man better known for portraying pirates and fantasy eccentrics plays the lead role with unlikely ease, and the transformation of 'Donnie' from a law-keeping man of integrity to a confidant of killers is paced very finely. Mike Newell's biographical crime film is considerably more contemplative than most other titles in the genre, and my 8/10 rating comes easily.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Absolute great acting but...,"Absolute great acting but unfortunately very lame storytelling and quite plain dialogues.Al Pacino does an incredible job, getting away from his typically hard strong powerfull boss characterising in a very detailled and credible fashion an aging lowcast criminal. Also Johnny Depp acting is fine, but all the side characters are so dull. No atmosphere, no sparks in the story... Almost no background issues, about the time, the mafia, history... Just telling themselves ""mafiosi"" the whole time doesnt make a mafia-movie...
All in all a lost opportunity, this could have been much better.If you like undercover-movies watch ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002,Alan Mak).",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A True Disappointment,"I read Joe Pistone's wonderful book from cover to cover in three days, which detailed every moment, every emotion, every amazing event from his mind-blowing six-year stint with the mafia. Now, obviously a film cannot include everything the book can, but at least select the good parts!! Donnie's relationship with Sonny Black and the way it develops would have been a very welcome addition for one.Johnny Depp delivers a solid and convincing performance, but I was less than impressed by Al Pacino who gives an uneven and frankly (by his standards) a sub-par outing, ditto for Michael Madsen. Anne Heche's emotion-filled and strong role is the main highlight for me.My advice would be please read the book, first if you haven't seen this film, and if you have watched it, please read the book so you can appreciate the full extent of Agent Joseph D. Pistone's amazing work.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Goes beyond being a movie about loyal gangsters and murderers,"Though there are ample amount of movies based on Mobsters and the Mafia led organized crime only very few that actually is mention worthy. As we all know while Godfather remains as the undisputed godfather of modern mob movies, the list gladly follows by movies like Goodfellas (1990), Scarface (1983), Heat (1995) and The Departed (2006). And Donnie Brasco is another fine jewel that so powerful and intense in revealing the underworld life of mobsters and their painfully loyal and ruthless culture. And it's based on the true character Donnie Brasco (Joseph Pistone in real) who was an undercover FBI agent who spent 6 long years with the mob (1975 -81) that ultimately came very closely to losing his natural life in the name of duty.FBI agent Pistone (Johnny Depp) goes undercover as Donnie Brasco making connections with the aging hit man Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Al Pacino). After building trust with Lefty he manages to move in to big leagues and participate in mob activities and gather valuable information. But at the same time due to the work pressure and the overwhelming amount of crime he witness his perception towards certain things goes through a dramatic change. While Pistones wife and kids misses their man of the house he deeply engulfs in the mob and struggles to strike a balance.One strong reason why Donnie Brasco sinks right in to the hearts of the viewers is that it has the right flavor and mix of crime and emotional drama. While it is entirely the solely expected mob crime movie it has a much unexpected value of feelings. Especially towards the end of the movie viewers get a heavy load of it and it fuels reaching a solid ending. The positive chemistry between the main leads Depp and Pacino is another winner. Both of them have big movies and scores under their belts and the director uses them to cleverly influence the viewers. While Pacino is a household name for mob movies I recall Depp appears seldom in them and another strong one being Public Enemies back in 2009. In this role Depp depicts an emotionless face but underneath he finely portrays the ambition and at the same time the fear which he hides inside.The majority of the movie runs on crime but does not show crime as such. However there is one scene which is brutal and overly gruesome for even the hardest of crime movie fans. But through that scene the director gives a clear message to the viewer about the filthy reality of the mob and what Donnie has to deal while performing his duty. And no crime and mob movie is completed without a gang murder. But Donnie Brasco goes beyond being a movie about loyal gangsters and murderers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of the best,"I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I've seen it I've come to like it *more*than the previous time - which is fairly incredible. I definitely liked it well enough the first time, but upon the third viewing I became convinced: this isn't just a good, solid movie - it's one of the greatest of all time.Why? Well, for me, I'd say that ""Donnie Brasco"" is the movie that ""Goodfellas"" wasn't.  I don't actually get what the big fuss is over ""Goodfellas"" (which I realize, for many people, disqualifies my opinion right there, but here goes) - it's objective to the point of not taking any kind of stance at all on its characters or its situations. And even at that, in comparison with ""Donnie"" it actually *does* glamorize mobsters' lives: they are all the masters of their little world, and are entitled to the best of everything, even in prison.  By contrast, ""Donnie"" shows the cheap and petty underside of mob life: a bunch of frustrated grunts, hanging out in the local grease joint, hatching schemes to make any kind of buck in order to pay off their bosses. It's sad and pathetic - and the attempts of Pacino's character to puff himself up (as well as the life he leads) into some kind of mythic significance is just unutterably sad. It's the ""Death of a Salesman"" of mob movies.And that in itself would be quite enough. But in fact, it's also something else, something equally gripping and profound. It's maybe the best ""undercover cop"" movie I've ever seen, as well.  That is, not only does it gives us a good inside view of the actual mechanics and legwork involved (wearing a wire, reporting to superiors, etc.) but also the effect that staying perpetually ""in character"" can have on the undercover cop's personal sense of self. Johnny Depp's character here is torn between his two separate identities: that of Joe Pistone, upstanding cop and family man, and the slimy and amoral ""Donnie Brasco"" that he is forced to live out every day as. His loyalty also becomes torn between his superiors, who stand loftily and sanctimoniously above him, and the everyday mob characters that he spends his time with and comes to feel a closeness for - particularly Lefty (Pacino). The relationship the movie builds between these two men is one of the strongest and most tender (while still understated) that I've ever seen in any film. And the conflict that it brings about in Donnie is made very real and poignant to the audience.Also helping to make Donnie's dilemma effective are the scenes between he and his wife, played (perfectly) by Anne Heche. I bring this up because there might be a tendency to view these scenes as filler, since they take us away from the main action, and are pretty touchy-feely to boot (the quality of writing in them, I'll admit, is not as consistently high as the other scenes in the movie - though never less than competent). However,  I find them just as necessary and vital to the film as all the mafia stuff: those scenes add incalculably to the composite picture of Johnny Depp's character, and how it is being pulled this way and that by the call of duty and the pull of his heart and conscience.A FINAL NOTE: Concerning Al Pacino's performance here; it's been lauded as one of his best, but I'm not so sure. The CHARACTER of Lefty is definitely one of the greatest he has ever been handed, but there's not much subtlety to his portrayal, i.e. it's of the hambone, ""Hoo-Ha"" variety that has become his stock in trade (""Sea of Love"" being the last time he created a fully three dimensional person on screen). However, what's affecting and poignant is how the film *uses* that portrayal: we're so used to seeing Pacino as the big boss, the head honcho - where his bluster is justified by his position - that to flip the formula on its head, and show him as the lowliest of the bottom feeders, yet still maintaining the same bluster, is tremendously jarring, in a sad kind of way. It's as if we're seeing the character of Lefty say to himself: ""I'm a nobody, but maybe if I puff up enough and carry myself more like Al Pacino does in the movies, I can become a somebody."" In this situation, is it the actor who's creating the magic, or the filmmakers' canny *use* of the actor, with all of his associations? I'm inclined to think the latter, but ultimately it doesn't matter: the bottom line is, Lefty Ruggiero is one of the greatest characters in all of film, and his story will break your heart.A great, great movie. I'm sure I'll revisit it many more times through the years.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
There's a mole inside the mob.,"A man is what he is; not what he becomes. An intense story based on the novel by Joseph Pistone nicknamed Donnie Brasco. Brasco(Johnny Depp)is taken under the wing of an aging mobster(Al Pacino)not knowing that he is an undercover FBI agent. Brasco has infiltrated the mob long enough he starts to weigh the thoughts of his mafia persona against his own personal and professional life. Depp and Pacino are excellent and lead a very apt cast that features Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, Anne Heche and Rocco Sisto. Very strong language with vivid violence.

Should have been nominated,"Donnie Brasco was simply one of the best films of 1997 and should have been nominated for best picture.  Being released in February of that year didn't make it easy for the voters to remember it, but make no mistake, it was easily one of the five best movies of 1997.  The relationship that is portrayed between Donnie and Lefty is one of the most beautiful friendships ever constructed on screen (perhaps because it was taken from a true story), and the inevitable action that is taken by Donnie in the end is painfully sad.  Pacino and Depp have a chemistry that is magnificent and easily compares to some of the best pairings in cinematic history.  I only hope we'll be fortunate enough to see them again sometime in another movie. Donnie Brasco shows the more tender side of the organized crime world (don't get me wrong, it shows plenty of the ruthlessness too), the concept of ""honor among thieves"" if you will.  You realize that even though these mobsters might appear to be scum on the outside, they do have hearts and they do have feelings.  The scene where Lefty is waiting outside the hospital room where his son is, and Donnie comes in is a very good example of this.  After a little conversation between the two, Lefty simply looks at Brasco and says ""I love you Donnie.""  It's scenes like this (as well as the scene at the end) that are so moving, you begin to realize just how powerful movies can be.  This one reaches down inside and really makes you feel, and it really makes you think.  It's simply one of the most unique, and beautifully crafted mob movies ever made, as well as one of the best films of 1997.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Good Look At Behind The Scenes Life In The Mob,"""Donnie Brasco"" is the name assigned to an undercover FBI agent who's assigned the task of infiltrating the New York mafia and ends up getting farther than anyone ever thought he would manage. Johnny Depp was quite good in the role - one of the few ""straight roles"" that I've seen him in, as opposed to the quirky style of character he usually seems to play. Depp had to play his character in two different settings - one as Brasco, the young mobster seeking to work his way up through the mob, and then as FBI agent Joe Pistone, who finds his mob life overtaking his personal life, to the point at which his marriage and family almost break apart under the strain. It was a fine piece of work by Depp, showing the character becoming almost overtaken by his mob persona, and steadily rising within the family to a level not even the FBI expected.Al Pacino was the perfect partner for Depp in this. I don't think anyone could play the role of ""Lefty"" - a ""middle management"" mob type as well as Pacino. Lefty is a frustrated mobster, unable to advance in spite of many years of service, who recruits Brasco and then finds himself overtaken by the young newcomer to the ""family."" Pacino was completely believable in the role, as you would expect from such an accomplished actor. Depp and Pacino were teamed with a pretty solid supporting cast, the most notable of them being probably Anne Heche as Joe's long- suffering wife Maggie.The biggest weakness in this was probably some poor pacing and structure in the first hour or so. It didn't seem to be fitting together all that well, and it actually seemed to start too abruptly, with Lefty trying to sell Brasco a diamond. How did Brasco get into that position in the first place? I wondered that all the way through. How did his undercover work begin? There also seemed to be a number of points at which Brasco should have been found out, but wasn't. Those points aside, though, this was a very entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Crime does not pay the little guy,"A portrayal of how crime does not pay the little guy.

Solid but middling Mafia movie,"This gangster film is based on a true story that occurred in the late 70's. An undercover FBI agent goes under the moniker of Donnie Brasco, a jewel expert from New York. He soon finds favour with an aging mob hit-man called Lefty Ruggiero. Under his wing, he discovers the ways of the Mafia. The older man sees Donnie as someone he can trust and who he can help with his street wisdom. Donnie, in turn, finds himself slowly turning into the gangster he is pretending to be.On the surface this is another mafia movie but it's more about the relationship between the two protagonists than anything else. As Donnie rises in the mob, Lefty is left behind; while the FBI agent has to deal with the knowledge that if he is successful in his objective he is effectively putting a death sentence on his friend. So the themes of loyalty and betrayal are strong. At the same time both men experience marriage difficulties on account of their lifestyles, so this operates as a domestic family drama too, as well as a look at the small details of mob life. Johnny Depp is okay in the title role but in the main he is surprisingly bland and uninteresting; Al Pacino on the other hand, is very good as a beaten down unglamourous gangster, who is a far less assured character than the ones he plays in most of his other starring roles in crime films. The movie as a whole is a solid but not upper bracket addition to the Italian American crime film sub-genre. Although, it's true life origins do give it something extra.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Different Take on the Mob Movie, Blending Police Procedural","This was a movie that I'm not entirely sure how I got turned on to. My guess is that my buddy Craig, who I watched The Godfather and Scarface with, probably told me that this was the next one we should check out. Al Pacino is my favorite actor of all time. This is an older role for him. What also adds to this is the fact that we're combining the mob movie with undercover federal agents. My recent rewatch was due to my wife, Jaime, and I doing our podcast - Depp Dive: A Depper Look at Johnny's Feature Filmography.What I was alluding to is that we have Joseph Pistone posing as Donnie Brasco. He's undercover and has been working on this for two years. The job was only supposed to last three months, so this is straining his relationship with his wife, Maggie (Anne Heche). They also have three daughters, complicating it further. He can get in with Lefty (Pacino), over a diamond ring that Donnie claims to be fake. This leads him to meet the likes of Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), Sonny Red (Robert Miano) and others. It gets more dangerous, the deeper he gets and blurs the lines of who is real, Joseph or Donnie.Now as I've been saying, this is an interesting blend of mob movie with police procedural. Also being based on true events makes this even crazier to me. I'm sure there are things that have changed and altered to make this more interesting to watch, but just knowing that someone got in as deep as they did while undercover is great. I also think that this gives an interesting look at being in the mafia, how they operated and how dangerous it could be, especially if someone above you suspects something. They don't necessarily have to be correct in what they think. Donnie brings up how this is run like the military. He's not completely wrong, but blindly following orders is a definite similarity.I'd also say that the acting here is great. What I've come to realize going through Depp's films, he tends to be in movies with a strong cast around him. This is him taking a backseat though to Pacino, even though Depp is playing the titular character. There is the aspect that Lefty keeps getting passed over. Donnie would be another one to do that as Sonny Black gives insight as to why that is happening. Lefty is fiercely loyal, but he's also getting older and just lacks something to make him rise higher. He's an asset still though. I don't want to overshadow that. Pacino and Depp are great as the two leads. Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Miano and the rest of the mob guys are on point. They feel real. Madsen has something about him that he could snap at any time which makes his character terrifying. I'd say that Zeljko Ivanek, Gerry Becker, Rocco Sisto and the other federal agents are good as well.Someone that I've purposely left out until now is Heche. Her along with the three daughters are interesting here. Joseph is neglecting them. It is wearing Maggie thin. This humanizes his character. It takes her asking him why he hates her that he finally shows vulnerability. I think that is needed, because he is so hardened throughout. He can't falter or his life is on the line. His family too. I just think this adds a needed dimension.All that is left to say is that this is a good movie. I like building tension here seeing how Donnie isn't truly all in with the guys he spends most of his time with. Him getting caught is part of that. Being as deep as he is, it seems like Joseph is fading and there would only then be Donnie. The cinematography is good to capture that vibe as well as the era that it is set. We have limited effects, but it also isn't that type of movie. The soundtrack also fit what was needed there. If you like crime movies, I'd recommend this one. It is different from others in this subgenre as I've said, blending mob with procedural. Being based on a true story also adds another element as well.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I believe Charlie Sheens done this before,"If I hadn't seen the biker flik - I would have given this a higher rating. But its five years on, Madsens still in it, and the idea of a cop infiltrating a group of misfits, conditioned to do his duty at the same time as mingle with the criminal element, and then adjust to the new identity, is an age old storyline Yeah there are the greats in the film, yeah the main actors do their best to follow a script based on a true story, yeah there's an element of action and horror that keeps the audience watching to the end. But the portrayed story of this is soooo close to Chasing the Shadow, that I would have thought that anyone trying it again five years down the line would have adapted it accordingly for real originality (if you can make U571 or The Patriot, then anything is possible to make an original storyline appeal to the masses).I do like Pacino and Depp in a lot of productions, but this one has the elements of bringing them together because, well, they had to appeal to the young and older audience to make a blockbuster.Go have a look at the 1992 one with Mr Sheen, its more in line with a true story (it doesn't have sawing people into pieces though), and it works better for me as its got the reality of dealing with two ends of the legal spectrum.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A Strong, Slick Film Taken from True Events","A slick, structured piece of filmography, testimony to the great Italian Mafia genre proving one of the greatest film released of the 90s.An undercover FBI agent infiltrates one of the five crime families in New York and rises through the ranks quickly in order to bring it down for good.Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are the magical duo that combine to make the film's greatness. The two cool customers provide a comical tone to what is a thrilling script from Joseph D Pistone, Paul Attanasio and Richard Woodley. Al Pacino enjoyed the film's mob slang, which Attanasio purposely implemented into the dialect by listening to Pistone's old wire taps, the 81-year-old actor was intitially set to play the protagonist before he was given supporting, he reached by requesting Depp to play his partner, a decision thoroughly justified through the picture's instant success.Most film fans will immerse theme selves in the deep realms of the Italian crime life, feeling passionate towards the regime and well-versed in what is an untouched reality of many's existence, the world itself is one which feels fiction but is heavily influenced by true events, much like Donnie Brasco which is a tale inspired by Pistone's breathtaking undercover story that that 82-year-old is still able to recollect today.A gripping story of fine margins makes for a nail-biting watch though one that will engross its audience into wanting to see the events unfold further.An incredible cast portraying an even better narrative, which drives the film to legendary status.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great but could have been even better.,A well made and generally accurate recreate of the remarkable penetration by undercover cop Joe Pistone of the American mafia in the 1970s.Although considerable artistic licence has been taken with the the characters of the two main mob protagonists where Ruggeiro becomes the main focus of Brasco's friendship when in reality it was Sonny Black who he became closest too aside from that it stays fairly faithful to true events.I did think however that there were missed opportunities for really ramping up the tension on those incidents in Brasco's undercover life when he was very near being rumbled by the gangsters. Instead these seemed generally downplayed.But that's a small criticism and overall this is one of my favourite gangster films of any kind.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Not A Job For Me,"If I learned anything from ""Donnie Brasco"" is that it's not easy or wise to be an undercover agent and have a family. Well, I learned that and that there's no way I could do it. Day one they'd ask me why I was sweating so much and I'd have to just run.Joseph Pistone went deep undercover as Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp) to infiltrate a New York City mob. He was brought in by a man named Lefty (Al Pacino) and from there he moved up the ranks. ""Donnie Brasco"" did more than just show the inner workings of the mafia (we were already aware of that from countless other movies), he showed the stress, strain, and danger of infiltrating the mafia as an undercover FBI agent.""Donnie Brasco"" had a measured pace to it. This is not an action flick, nor is it one in which our protagonist performs impossible stunts. It is intense because it's grounded. Everyday Pistone was in that world was a day he could lose his life, and in effect he was losing his life. He was in character so much he was truly becoming Donnie Brasco and perilously close to losing his family. This was a welcome change from movies such as ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas.""

"Donnie Brasco is based on a true story and stays true to those words, its writing is superb and the film itself is memorable","The film is written by Paul Attanasio but based on autobiographical book by Joseph D. Pistone or as many know him by, Donnie Brasco. Johnny Depp plays the FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s, no one could play the role better than him. The legend, Al Pacino plays the other main role, Lefty Ruggiero. Mike Newell directed the movie and throughout the movie you get to see how talented he really is, his direction and visual storytelling is perfect.
I think the writers and director did a phenomenal job with making Joseph a great Protagonist as he has two identities to think about and it hurts his relationship with his wife, but the relationship he has with Lefty as Donnie is a great friendship. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job catching the many struggles his character have.If you're looking for a fast paced and action packed movie, this isn't it. But what you get by watching this film is well written and realistic characters with entertaining and meaningful dialogue with lots of character development. The storytelling is perfect, the director captures the script in a way that captures the viewers, it's easy to immerse yourself into this gangster movie as the film we are watching is a realistic one. On top of that there's also some very good cinematography and camera work.This was my second time watching this movie, it's a memorable experience and an incredible story.

I don't care what people say - it's Pacino who cheapens this movie.The first 2 are self explanatory, and plenty in the 5-7 star reviews say the same, so I know I'm not alone.But people act like Pacino was great, and I have to disagree.I remember when this movie came out.I loved gangster movies.I couldn't stand Pacino in this then, and I still can't when watching it now.But everyone else is great.It's not just how the character is written - it's how he's portrayed.I'm from the block.He doesn't play Lefty as a real OG.He plays Lefty as an old timer who's a wanna be.The annoying guy talking all the time, who you find out was a punk when he was young.I know in the story Lefty is supposedly a real gangster, but Pacino acts out the character like an 'all talk old guy'.People who don't notice must have never been street.Think about all the other gangster movies you've watched - and how the old timers acted.They're cold. Quiet. Exact. They don't act like blowhards, who need to borrow a bill. Lol

A movie not for everyone,"Recently I've been watching movies from a list named ""Movies you need to watch"" or something like that. And I noticed that a lot of gangster, mafia related ones are listed there.
Because of the list, I've seen quite a few of them. And every single one has just blurred into a single movie. This one isn't an exception.
It's a mafia movie. Nothing special, in my opinion. Although I'm not a fan for these types of movies. Everything shown in it was average. The ending was pretty neat, but nothing else.
This is a short review, but for gangster movie fans out there - you will like it. For others - prepare yourself for 2 hours and 27 minutes of ""meh""-ness.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Pretty good, it makes it to the top 5 of best mob movies","I just saw a couple users on IMDb call this movie either the number one Mafia movie or like in their top three. Um, not sure if I would go that far to say that, but still Donnie Brasco was a great movie and made a very decent biography about the under cover detective who soon changed his thoughts on being in the mafia. I have to say that I had my doubts at first because of Johnny Depp.Please, don't get me wrong, Johnny is one of my favorite actors in the world, but him playing an Italian? He blew me away and made me truly believe that he was Donnie Brasco. I couldn't believe that he could be such a good mobster/detective. He and Pacino worked so well off each other and I think a lot of people automatically noticed and that's what made this movie work. Donnie and his wife just broke my heart, I felt so bad for her. She was so badly mistreated by Donnie and he even scarred me when you could tell he was starting to become one of the Mafia.Donnie Brasco is a good film I would recommend, and like I said, it's in the top 5 mob movies, so please don't expect the best. Don't take that as an insult to the movie, I just don't think any mob movie could beat Goodfellas, Casino, or The Godfather.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Not as intense as I hoped but still has good performances,"FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) goes undercover to infiltrate the mob as Donnie Brasco. Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Al Pacino) is a wearied survivor mob soldier who takes in the street smart Brasco under his wing. As their boss Sonny Black (Michael Madsen) rise up, Pistone is there to gather the evidence as his marriage to Maggie (Anne Heche) suffers. Ruggiero dreams of getting away from the untrustworthy Black.This is base on a true story, and with two of the greatest talents around, I hoped for better. I hoped for better intensity. It has the era, the mannerism, and the style. Pacino is giving a slightly different take on the wise guy. Depp is stepping up. The performances are spot on. It's great that it's a true story. But the movie basically shows all its cards early on. I would probably consider not revealing the FBI undercover story or have their bosses push them harder. Something is needed to drive up the tension. The movie just doesn't translate the danger onto the screen. Director Mike Newell really needs to amp up every cinematic opportunity to represent danger. For example, Donnie finds a picture of their Miami boat in a magazine on the plane. A more compelling scene would have somebody almost picking up the same magazine or even pick up that magazine. True or not, the director needs to pump up the tension.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
not your average mobster movie,"I have no particular interest in mobsters or their movies, but I make an exception for ""Donnie Brasco.""  I'm a sucker for true stories, and this is one of the wildest ones out there; I can hardly believe that an FBI agent so effectively infiltrated the mob, but apparently he did, and it makes for great drama.There's a bit of everything in this movie.  We see Agent Pistone's developing relationship with hit-man Lefty (played to perfection by a hilarious Pacino), his domestic troubles, and his struggle to stay connected with the FBI as his fellow agents keep letting him down.  There's even a lion thrown in the mix for good measure; can you beat that?Although there are mobster trappings all over this movie, it's essentially a compelling story of friendship and betrayal that would work even without the guns and slang and seedy New York locales.  Unlike so many other movies, it doesn't rely on criminals being intrinsically fascinating; it makes them fascinating with genuine character development.

A Not So Great Mafia Film,"Donnie Brasco stars Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, and Michael Madsen and takes place in 1978 New York and would be categorized under the Mafia genre.The film is about an undercover cop, played by Depp, and his work taking out the Mafia in New York. The film starts out with Donnie Brasco (Depp) at a jeweler and how he is looking at a made man in the mafia, Lefty (Pacino), and Lefty takes him under his wing after one meeting and no background info on Brasco. Brasco then becomes Lefty's right hand man and the two of the work under Sonny Black (Madsen) and do all the usual mafia things. The main struggle of the film is how Brasco has to keep in his undercover while having a family at home and he grows very attached to Lefty as well. This film is a Mafia film with a stronger police part than in other Mafia films such as The Godfather or Goodfellas which is what makes it unique.The Directing in this film was poor for two main reasons. Reason #1 is that as a viewer I felt no attachment to any of the characters. I never cared that Donnie Brasco's normal life was falling apart due to his career, I never cared that his life was in danger due to his career, I never really cared about his career. Nor did I care about how Lefty wasn't being taken seriously anymore and was passed up for promotion. Reason #2 why I thought the direction was poor is because these men are in the Mafia they are powerful men and the direction did nothing to show that it just made them look like a normal person which in my opinion was a mistake. If this movie was better directed it could of easily been considered a great film.The acting in this film was decent, the best performance being by Depp. This is his biggest early role in his career that he did not work with Tim Burton and he proved here he can act well without being such an odd character which I truly enjoyed. But again as I said in the previous paragraph I felt no connection to him which is not entirely his fault but still. Pacino I thought was not very good in this film he always seemed on the same emotional level and just was sad, really I thought nothing special. Madsen I thought was very good in this film as Sonny Black. He did great portraying himself as a tough, impulsive Mafia boss and every time he was on the screen was extremely enjoyable. Now was he as good as he was in Reservoir Dogs, no. But still he is an actor that I wish I could see more of.The score of this film I thought was inappropriate. It sounded like music that would be used in a drama, not a Mafia film and this often distracted me and annoyed me. I really thought this was a mistake.My overall reaction to this film is that it is not very good, a strong 5/10 I would say. It had potential to be much better in my opinion. I'm not going to tell you to stay away from this film because it is pretty well reviewed I would recommend this film to those who enjoy Mafia films, just go in knowing that this is no Goodfellas or The Godfather.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
elegy for a hit-man,"This film was critically well-received when first released, and almost developed a cult following. But it had two historical problems going for it - it reminded too many people of ""The Goodfellas"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". (In the DVD add-on featurette, they admit that production on the film was held up out of fear of comparisons with ""Goodfellas"".) As to comparisons with ""Goodfellas"": I think Donnie Brasco works well as a complimentary film to Scorcese's undeniable powerhouse mob film. Since both are true stories, I have a suspicion that many of the characters in the two films are based on the same real people, so we get to see them from two different perspectives.As to comparisons with ""Reservoir Dogs"": It is well to remember that Tarantino's film is itself derivative of Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"". In fact, the 'undercover cop in the mob"" film has become almost a separate genre in Hong Kong, the most recent hit in the tradition being ""Infernal Affairs"", remade by Scorcese as ""The Departed""; the point being that Hong Kong pretty much set the bench-mark for this type of film, and so American films working the same material can't help but use elements originally developed by the Chinese.As to the film itself: It relies very heavily on the performances of Depp and Pacino, and fortunately, they are brilliant. The final conversation between their characters is tense because Pacino plays it so straight, and his character talks in such clipped, abbreviated sentences, we can no longer read him any better than Depp's character can. (A lot of the film's tension derives from the announced fact that when the mob decides to give you a bullet-ridden retirement, it always sends your best friend to do it.) There are weaknesses in the film, principally in the script. the narrative threads leading to certain events are left unclear and unresolved; and certain connections screaming to be made are left unnoticed.But Depp and Pacino are a winning team, largely because they operate with the same idea of what it means to develop character as an actor. We know they're them, so to speak, Depp and Pacino; but they're also equally Donnie and Lefty.A tense, occasionally amusing, and ultimately very sad elegy for an over-the-hill hit-man with no cards left to play.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Brass, Brassiest, Brasco","A more gritty look at New York mafia life than we are used to meets an idiotic domestic storyline we've seen all too often. During the mid 1970s FBI Agent Joe Pistone(Depp) successfully infiltrated Sonny Black's Brooklyn arm of the Bonnano family by winning the trust of aging hit-man Lefty Ruggierio(Pacino). While the film starts out very promising with the bonding of Pacino and Depp and some good nuts and bolts gangster action, the whole thing soon becomes trivialized and ultimately destroyed by a pointless domestic storyline that keeps eating away at the main narrative like termites, before consuming it utterly in the final reels. An unromantic take on Mob life is a refreshing departure from what we are usually fed. Very matter of fact and business-like killings, and penny ante heists more accurately reflect the day to day life of a wise guy if this is movie is accurate. Depp and Pacino might be said to red line the NY accent, but they don't. Born bred NYers talk like this and worse. But its Anne Heche or her character which makes an otherwise interesting enjoyable movie sorta unwatchable. The whole notion of Depp battling a rocky marriage while performing an undercover sting operation should be left for the soap operas and bad TV crime shows.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Donnie Brosco,"This movie was recommended to me and I saw it because of that.It is based on a true story of a FBI undercover agent Donnie Brasco (Johny Depp) who infiltrates the underworld and mafia by taking into confidence a second in-command Benjamin ""Lefty"" (Al Pacino). The trust both of them build in each other pushes Donnie to a point of being a mafia himself and associating in many crimes the gang commits. There is a power struggle of their team leader Sonny Black (Michael Madsen) who over-throws their rival gang and senior boss to become a leader. It is in the end that they realize Donnie is an undercover agent, which leads to them killing Benjamin. There is a parallel plot running of problems faced by Donnie Brasco in his family life due to the kind of job he is handling.The movie reminded me a lot of Departed. Surely a part of Departed story is lifted from Donnie Brasco with additional angle of undercover mafia in police is added.But Donnie Brasco excels solely on its story and screenplay. It is honest, tight and gripping. One remains glued to the seat till the very end. Al Pacino performs the role of Lefty with such a punch and marvelous acting that puts him in the top bracket of best Hollywood actors. Johny Depp is good, but this was not his best performance.The Director Mike Newell (who took almost 30 years to make his first movie after his debut as TV director) does a very good job in direction.The story had drama and thrill in it. There were only two shooting or violent scenes in the whole movie yet one felt on the seat at every moment. That was the difference between good cinema and today's violent cinema that is sadly considered good.It shows that one can depict a mafia story with all the thrills and chills even without showing crude violence and shootings.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Touching Gangster Story,"Donnie Brasco (1997)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A different type of Mafia movie centers on the relationship between an undercover FBI agent (Johnny Depp) and the older, somewhat ordinary gangster (Al Pacino) who never really was special enough to move up in the ranks. DONNIE BRASCO isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly an intense, highly entertaining and at times thought-provoking film that manages to have many strong points. There's no question that the strongest is the relationship between the two men and this is perfectly brought to life thanks to the terrific performances by the two leads. By this point in his career Pacino could play a gangster in his sleep but the character of Lefty is certainly something very different than what we've seen from him in the past. The most noticeable thing is that this guy is pretty much a sad loser. There's really nothing special about him and I really loved the low quality that Pacino brings to him. There's just a certain sadness that floats around this guy and Pacino simply nails the role. Depp is just as impressive as the undercover agent who quickly finds himself becoming like the men he's spying on. The relationship and chemistry between the two actors is simply wonderful and certainly carries the picture. There's also strong support from the likes of Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby and Anne Heche. What I enjoyed most outside the performances was the fact that the movie also has a good sense of humor. There are some very intense moments scattered throughout the picture and especially the constant fear of one of the two leads getting killed but there are also some clever bits of comedy thrown in. The late 70's and early 80's setting is also perfectly captured by director Mike Newell who also manages to keep the film moving at a very good pace. With so many gangster movies out there it's sometimes hard to find one that gives us a new and fresh look at the subject. DONNIE BRASCO does that and it's certainly one worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A very unique story with two brilliant performances.,"Very entertaining with some of the finest performances of the 90s. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are such a dangerously grand combination and they are both so dynamic throughout. They both completely amazed me, notably Depp who I didn't expect such a strong, emotional performance from. He usually goes for charisma in his work, which I love, but he really displayed such emotional strength in this. The story itself is phenomenal. The most brutally honest portrayal of the life of a gangster ever created. I definitely wasn't expecting a scene like Johnny Depp cutting a guy's foot off more realistically and years before Saw become such a crave for it's brutality. Anne Heche was also surprisingly great in the best ""semi-abandoned wife of an undercover cop who is trying to care for her kids while desperately missing her husband"" role that appears in every film dealing with an undercover cop. She brought real authenticity and sympathy to the role, which I've never seen before.I also thought that the film took a very interesting look into what happens when an undercover becomes too attached to one of the men he's trying to commit. The best scene of the film comes when Joe is in the garage talking to his wife and he is painfully describing that he can't reveal himself as a rat because if he does Lefty, who he has come to love as a father figure, will die for it. He's stuck in such a bind because if he doesn't reveal himself, and stays undercover, he will drive his family away until he loses them. But, if he reveals himself, he is putting the gun in Lefty's mouth and pulling the trigger. It's one of the best acted scenes I've ever witnessed, and Depp makes his emotional pain so palpable in the best acted scene of his career. I really loved this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Over time, Donnie takes over Joe, as he finds it harder to leave the mafia life behind when visiting his beautiful wife Maggie(played by Anne Heche) and his inevitable exposure weighs heavily on his mind, and the fate that will befall Lefty as a result...

Meh drama story takes too long to develop interest,"Donnie Brasco didn't work for me. This drama story should work better on paper, but, on screen, I felt disappointed by the lack of action. Most of the onscreen play is character development, mainly the relationship between Donnie and Lefty, which we know will play a big part towards the end, however this development is fast paced and a bit corky. Donnie Brasco is more like a Donnie Plank, and Lefty is, well, Corky, funny for the wrong reasons.Action-wise, nothing really happens. You get some cuts that show Donnie is doing the work of recording mob interactions, but we are missing the danger of these operations. Up until the middle point, we got one assassination and nothing else, not even playing a big role other than develop the Sonny Black character, showing he is mean and relentless, too far-fetched.

Donnie Brasco - Review,"Quite a nice mafia movie. Johnny Depp is a perfect actor for this kind of role and he sure did deliver here alongside the legend himself Al Pacino. Great, great chemistry between them by the way, was enjoying myself when these two were on the screen together, brilliant duo. That's basically the whole point of the movie, the bond between the two is explored in a very entertaining and intriguing way and I liked it a lot. The feel of the conflict in the main character, that he's a spy and also a policeman, I felt that and it was very good. Al Pacino is a great example of how you have to trait the character you're playing - the attention to detail, which he provides here, is mesmerizingly great and I will always love him as an actor, especially in this kind of movie, when he plays this sigma male, he's just too good at it, wow, what an actor.

"Gritty, dark, powerful mob drama","I saw ""Donnie Brasco"" years ago and recently watched it again. Excellent, pleasingly subtle performances from Johnny Depp, Al Pacino and Michael Madsden make this movie well worth your time. The storyline--FBI agent Joe Pistone's undercover journey into the dark, violent world of the Bonnano crime family and how he develops a close bond with mobster Ben ""Lefty"" Ruggiero that leaves him guilt-ridden about his deception (albeit in a quest to stop organized criminal activity)--keeps you fairly riveted throughout a long-ish movie. His stint as a fake jewel fencer named ""Donnie Brasco"" continues for years as his relationship with his long-suffering wife and kids in the suburbs is stretched to the limit. While there are plenty of details that seem like mob movie cliches at this point (although Pistone was a close advisor to the movie's production and said that what was shown was highly accurate), one thing that struck me about ""Donnie Brasco"" that distinguishes it from other films in this genre was that it does not glamorize the Mafia culture or violent crime. These seem like desperate men constantly pressured to produce revenue for their superiors, and their world seems grubby, tense and unappealing. Pacino's Lefty is bitter, an ill, aging man depressed by broken promises and dead ends in his life who dreams of breaking free, although he knows that is impossible. A very different character from Michael Corleone, the wizard-like Mafia don at the pinnacle of power who manipulates the men around him like chess pieces. Lefty knows he is a pawn. He smells doom and you can smell it too.Depp's Pistone/Brasco internalizes his guilt and horror, and you can see it eat away at him as he interacts with his real family in brief visits that are heart-wrenching or with his FBI contacts. You see his horror when he witnesses the violence of the gang's crimes, and this movie does not turn the violence into opera or comedy as other films in this genre have done--it is messy and awkward. Victims suffer. The camera doesn't spare you that experience. That aspect of this film impressed me the most. Interesting that the director was Mike Newell of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""!!Michael Madsden's portrayal of Sonny Black is terrific -- he is truly menacing in his quiet moments. The rest of the supporting players do a fine job. Watch for two young actors in one scene in bit parts, Tim Blake Nelson and Paul Giammati, years before they became famous. Definitely watch ""Donnie Brasco"" if you are interested in true crime, the Mafia or tense character dramas. It captures a grubby, gritty, bleak corner of American life so well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good but sometimes superficial,"This film has the luck to be based on a thrilling story, but the latter is unfortunately manipulated to emotional extremes. The family conflicts with scenes like the daughter's first communion are extremely annoying and boring to me. A waste of celluloid. From all the characters, there is only one interpersonal relationship that works. The good news is that it's the one between the two leads. The very last Pacino scene was quite strong. Al is his usual overacting self, especially in the beginning of the movie, where there's no need for emotions. Johnny Depp is acceptable, even if he's not perfectly cast. But the moustache is ridiculous. In general, there is an obvious effort to give a 70's feel (and I don't mean just the costumes and the premises, but even the way the scenes are shot), maybe trying to capitalize on the success of this genre at the time. It's not bad, it just doesn't give the extra boost the director thought it would.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
More gangster stuff. Not unique or special enough for me,"I simply have no desire to continue exploring the world of organized crime. I'm sure if someone found a new or interesting way of tackling the subject my mind could be changed, but Donnie Brasco didn't feel all that new or interesting. I will grant that it has a bit more to like because there was an undercover man in their midst, but even he wasn't a pleasant person. Whenever watching movies with gangsters I struggle because I don't care about anyone, and in this case I had someone I wanted to care about, but he is constantly acting like a jerk as he gets sucked in deeper. Maybe his wife should have been the protagonist, at least I could sympathize with her. I think in the story structure we're supposed to feel bad for Al Pacino's character, but he seems like such a bumbling loser that it's hard to root for him to come out on top.I can say that the one part of Donnie Brasco I liked is the fact that it de-glamorizes organized crime. Most movies of this type show the gangsters living the high life, eating at the best restaurants, drowning in expensive jewelry and clothes, as if crime not only pays but it pays 10 times as much as anything else. But in Donnie Brasco we have guys literally beating a parking meter with a sledge hammer to steal enough change to make a quota for their bosses. It's a nice change of pace. The other part of the film that I could appreciate was the tension they were able to create by making us fear Johnny Depp's character would be discovered. There were a couple of scenes where it felt like he was on the verge of being caught, and I was engaged at those moments. Otherwise, Donnie Brasco felt like more of the same when it came to gangster movies. It didn't have enough special qualities to set it apart and make it the extremely rare movie I actually liked in this genre.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This ain't no fugazy,"Donnie Brasco, what more can you say about it.. i have seen this movie a dozen times and i still notice things i didn't saw before... the humor in the film is outstanding.. its all so normal just like when you are chilling with your friends making yokes and do your thing that's what makes this film so brilliant.. people say they don't look like gangsters.. you all watched to many gangster movies.. when you walk on the streets you don't see gangsters but there still there.. this movie is natural and thats also why not many people know about it.. i don't care if its in the top 10 top 100 or in the top 1000 best movies.. its in my top 10.. go watch the movie and look for the small things.. the way that Al Pacino and Johnny Depp show why they are on of the best actors in the world.. the first scene were Al Pacino walks into the bar and sits next to Depp is overwhelming!!! that scene and the scene of Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in True Romance are one of best scenes wrote... fuggedaboutit Donnie Brasco 9",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The movie then consists of how Pistone is or isn't able to face the mob life and keep his own life at the same time. The movie is not brilliant. Good but not between the best of its sort.

Wiseguys,"Thank you Brooklyn 99 for making me a little more aware of this one. This definitely wasn't what I was expecting though. I didn't look into this at all, went in cold, didn't even realize Depp was in it till he popped up on screen. Depp and Pacino do a fine job here and really convey the struggles these two characters through as they traverse the precarious world of the mob from opposing angles.Problem is, this starts off really clunky to me. There's so much exposition and explaining and characters that don't feel like they've fully developed or come together.Fortunately, once we get passed that opening speed bump, this gets very interesting. The relationships, the struggles, the psychology of it all is fascinating to watch. So much so that by the time we reach the crescendo it is absolutely riveting.If not for that opening, this would be stellar, but that opening act really drove me nuts. It also doesn't help that, in a lot of ways, The Departed is the same movie and it just did it better. It leaves Donnie Branco feeling above average and yet falling well short of what it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This is . One of the best movies of all time.,"This movie, has more more meaning to it than any movie I have ever watched. It's about Depp, struggling to balance his family and career. Yet, while doing his Job, Al Pacino pledges his loyalty and basically adopts him as a son. I do not want to go any further as I am an advocate against spoiling plot in movies. I do not normally like actors playing similar roles to ones they have done in the past, but Al Pacino is less of a mob boss, and more of a compassionate step father trying to find meaning in his life. Depp, is trying to balance everything; Trust, Loyalty , family, friends, career . What must one do, to balance everything? Most people would sacrifice everything for their family. But what happens if your career, friends, adopt YOU as THEIR family. Do you abandon them?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Wow,"The movie is a gangster movie but has its focus on the relationship between Lefty and Donnie and sometimes on other relationships. Donnie, or Joe, is married to Maggie (Anne Heche) who he hardly sees. He can not exactly tell her what he is doing and sometimes stays away for a couple of weeks. She pretends she is a widow to deal with it. We also learn about the relationships in the mafia family, including new boss Sonny (Michael Madsen).The fact that this movie is more about the people and their relationships than about the events is a good thing. Sure movies like 'Goodfellas' are terrific but to see something a little different from time to time is nice as well. If you make a movie about people and their emotions you need to have some good performers to make the scenes believable. I already mentioned Depp but of course we have Pacino here as well. His Lefty is a memorable character and it is Pacino who makes sure that happens, but the fact that Depp is as good and especially believable as heavyweight Pacino says something. Of course we have Madsen who was probably the only right actor for the macho mobster Sonny.Director Mike Newell seems to be a strange choice for this sometimes very violent and bloody story since he directed the terrific but sweet 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Fortunately it turns out he is the right man for this material, probably because its real subject is not gangsters but, like I said before, the relationships between the characters. 'Donnie Brasco' has enough to offer for people who like the gangster-genre, but even if you are normally not a big fan there is still a chance you might like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gritty and upsetting,"For many years after I watched Donnie Brasco, I longed for the type of technology that could extract the film from my brain. Fortunately, years have passed since, and unfortunately, other more disturbing movies have taken its place in my mind as movies I wish I'd never seen. If you're a sensitive person who gets seriously upset by gritty, upsetting true crime stories, don't watch Donnie Brasco, no matter how famous you think it is.As a young film student, I was pressured into watching this movie by my male peers. This is a very masculine film, with no redeeming qualities for female viewers. It's the true story of an undercover FBI agent, played by Johnny Depp, who gets so immersed in his assignment that he loses touch of who he really is. His assignment is to join the mafia and get close to head mafioso Al Pacino, and while it's understandable that Al is magnetic and alluring, the audience is constantly aware that this is a true story. The killings and the choices and the danger are real, unlike many ""gangster pictures"" that glorify street violence. To me, that made all the difference in the world. One might say that the film, and all the people involved, must have been excellent for me to have such a negative reaction. Frankly, I don't care. There was no purpose in this ""exposé"" for me; I can't wage a one-woman campaign against mob violence, nor do I have the opportunity to stop anyone in my environment from joining such a crowd. It was merely upsetting, and I wish I'd never watched it.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Forget about it,"Donnie Brasco is a good different-kind of mafia movie. Doesn't rely on violence of violent scenes but on character development, relationship and interactions so you can understand the gruesome and horror in the mafia without having to see it.

It's dramatical, dark but that one scene where Depp's character explains the whole ""Forget about it"" meaning had me laughing. Great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An acting masterclass,"The most incredible assets about 'Donnie Brasco' are the knee deep perfect performances by Johnny Depp and Al Pacino as Donnie and Lefty respectively.
The film is a terrifyingly authentic film about the lack of unity among mafia gangs and the kinda lengths such gang members would dare to go in order to protect themselves even if that protection is shielded by cold blooded murder.
Donnie played by Johnny Depp is seen to be stuck in an emotional crisis because he starts believing that he gets Lefty to go on a self destructive path.
The film also plays out well to portray the difficulties faced by an undercover agent and the dilemma he faces when leading two separate lives and the challenges he faces on deciding where to draw the line between his personal life and professional life and therefore, in this context the movie also pays homage to all dedicated undercover agents including the real Joseph Pistone who carried out their jobs with so much emotional heft.
Lefty played by Al Pacino while being intensely inhuman and senseless at times is portrayed as the closest to being human of all the mafia members.
specially, the emotionally tender scene where he cries out for his son in a coma gave a strain of humanity to Lefty's character.
The movie also is supported by great supporting performances.
That all being said if you are the kinda person who is patient with this kind of FBI based movie which is less toned when it comes to action/shooting sequences but manages to keep the grip of momentum throughout the flow of the plot, this movie is a must watch.
I'm going with 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Relating with the mafia,"As an undercover officer, staying in disguise often entails becoming one of the criminals. Donnie Brasco offers this unique perspective, and sheds light on the relatable aspects of life in the mafia as he appears to be more criminal than cop.This movie was excellent. Enthralling viewers from the beginning with a view of the daily life in the mob to how operations work; this film is truly a testament to good cinema since it reveals a part of crime life that many people seem not to understand. From holidays to heists, this movie captures the essence of what it means to be a mafioso, and how one is affected from an emotional and physical standpoint.The casting in Donnie Brasco is terrific. With Al Pacino once again delivering as a patron and Johnny Depp playing the protégé, the pair in crime manage to grab viewers' hearts all the while committing murders and other foul acts.

4) The relationship between Pacino and Depp, and the turmoil within each character, are masterfully doneNEGATIVES:1) Watching the film for the first time in 2021, I definitely felt it was dated
2) The film also suffers for me due to the fact that I have seen countless mob films prior to seeing this which all share very similar themes: Godfather, Goodfellas, Public Enemies, Black Mass, The Irishman to name just a few

"give these humps another drink, it's all they're good for","I really like this because it's so pitiful: not just - in fact not so much - Lefty's fate, but the wiseguys' whole way of life. It's pathetic: they know nothing, they can't talk properly ('punch of salt'), they're not even doing that well; it's not just that they spend their time hanging around in bars bashing parking meters open with hammers for a handful of change - they can't really imagine anything better.It's a far cry from the glamorised picture we get in Godfather and Goodfellas. In those films you might fear the hoods but you'd like to be them, or at least be friends with them. Who would want to be like this lot? So shabby and useless are they that it's actually funny. At the same time a subtle performance by Pacino wins your sympathy for Lefty, without evading the violence just under the surface. Johnny Depp is fine, but he doesn't have much to do except turn up (very much like the character).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Its a very good movie but not perfect,"To start, the pace of the movie and the acting (specially Al Pacino, Depp and Madsen) for me were very good. It is one of the movies that will leave you wanting to know what is going to happen next as Depp (Donnie Brasco) starts to get himself deeper and deeper in the mafia life leaving his own family on the sidelines. However, this movie has its flaws. Although the writing is very good there are some moments that leave you thinking why the mob did not investigate Donnie Brasco deeper before getting him involved w them? I mean, they could have very well just followed this guy to find out he had a family living right there not too far away. This is a true story so Im sure the mob did do their research at the time but this is not shown in the movie. I just do think they could have explored that a little more.
Also the duality of Depp's character is great and will leave you wondering. I mean this guy was neglecting his own family to serve his country but also starting to like some of the people in the mob (Lefty, Al Pacino's character) to the extent that he couldnt leave anymore or this guy would be killed. It's interesting and it did make a great movie in the end. Although its not perfect, I enjoyed it and definitely recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Great acting by two legends,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**""I'm not becoming like them...I am them""Tonight's movie review is the true story crime drama Donnie Brasco (1997), set in the 70's where legend Al Pacino plays Lefty, an aging gangster who has ambitions to be a leader. One day he befriends a young jeweler, Donnie Brasco played by the ever versatile Johnny Depp. Soon we see Lefty mentoring Donnie the ways of a wiseguy and we can see a father and son like relationship happening. What Lefty doesn't know is that Donnie is FBI agent John Pistone who infiltrates the mob operations in Brooklyn. Soon loyalties are questioned and testedWowwww what an amazing movie and both Pacino and Depp work great together onscreen, its a match made in acting heaven. Playing off each other in a subtle way brings this dynamite performance by allowing us seeing both wit and humour while also the ability to see the different faces of both characters - violence and loyalty. Can one person be trusted throughout the film and throughout the flick I was on the seat asking is he or isn't he? Pacino's cooking scene with Depp and the very first scene in the movie - fuggedaaaboudittt. The onscreen chemistry just blends through and takes the movie to different levels both on an emotional level and a larger than life level.Even the other actors are great including Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby and James Russo - in particular when all three debate whether a Cadillac is the ultimate car with Pacino while Depp's character is observing them in the coffee shop during the very first opening of the film. Simple and effective filmmaking and performances by all the actors. A great shoutout to Anne Heche who plays Donnie's wife who needs to deal with her husband's dangerous occupation. It nearly destroys their marriage. Great chemistry between the two and Heche's performance is sold and strong. You see the love she has for a man who is trying to do what he believes is right without understanding the turmoil his job is bringing to his wife and his family. Heche's performance can be demonstrated when she shows her pain towards the end of the film in particular trying to fight for the man she married rather than the wise guy hes slowly becoming.The movie doesn't feel like a recycled gangster film - it has the unique freshness to it. However it does play on too much on its dramatic core rather than hitting at the thriller/suspense angles of the lifestyle of an undercover FBI agent such as looking behind his shoulder all the time especially when reporting to the FBI of the information gathered. This does have positives such as the Japanese restaurant scene - greatly performed. If there was something similar to this, maybe in a more subtle way it would have elevated the movie in a different level. Having said that, its a rich narrative film which has many different themes and you see how Depp transforms his character into losing himself slowly into his new identity due to the friendship he has made. Powerful performances, overall 8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good enough, but let down by length","I was looking forward to seeing Donnie Brasco as I'm a fan of 'mafia type' films.  This, however, fell short of my expectations for a few reasons, but then again, I did like some themes and ambitious storytelling techniques in the film.My main faulting with Donnie Brasco is that some parts of it seemed rather rushed to me, which resulted in an element of unintentional confusion. Screenwriter Paul Attansio has ambitiously tried to converge several strands of the story into the film, probably trying to achieve all the elements of the book.  These strands include not only Joseph Pistone/Donnie Brasco's (expertly portrayed by Johnny Depp) undercover work in the Mafia but also the effect his profession has on his home life and the current events in the Mafia.  While this would work well with more explanation, it seems that some parts, especially Pistone's home life, were too rushed and too big jumps were made in the plot.Some people may be deceived into thinking that Pistone's increasing devotion to the Mafia is because he feels at home or accepted within the organisation but I think that it is much more to do with the theme of friendship, more specifically his friendship with 'Leftie' (Al Pacino on fine form).  The look on Pistone's face when his mafia 'buddies' are beating the hell out of the Japanese waiter is clear evidence to me that he does not want to be a part of it. Friendship is usually a common theme in films of this genre, but it is conveyed in fine detail in the film, showing that despite the obvious, the friendship between the two protagonists is not betrayed.The character of Pistone/Brasco is developed wonderfully from an FBI agent pretending to be a jewel expert, to actually temporarily becoming part of the Mafia, and back again.  The in depth insight into the character is one of the film's strongest points undoubtedly, almost it's saving grace.However, the themes and characters do not make up for some of the gaps in the storyline which I observed on a first viewing, and so this film never does excel the tag of just 'good'6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Another Overrated Mess,"I'm not sure how such an incredible true story can be made into such a bad film. Right out of the gate the viewer is asked to stretch the limits of his suspension of reality. One second Pacino sees some guy (Depp) sitting at the bar and almost immediately he takes him into his confidence and starts engaging in illegal activities. I never know it was so darn easy for an undercover cop to get into the confidence of his target. Silly scenes and cliche dialogue runs it's course in this eye rolling not so gritty film about a stupid mid-level gangster. The opening sequence about the diamond is so lame I would understand if you didn't watch beyond there. I almost stopped it myself, as you knew the rest of the movie was going to remain entrenched in the same vein of mediocrity. It's typical Hollywood by the numbers drama full of ridiculous scenarios and failed attempts at tension. Not believable in the least. As usual here it has a 2-2.5 star higher rating than it deserves. Big budget and big names does not equal a well constructed movie, and at this point in his career Pacino was proving that again and again. He wasn't even that great a gangster in Godfather 2 if you think about it. At least his performance here wasn't that flatline, but it still lacked the credibility to push this beyond the category of the mundane. There's not even a supporting cast member that stands out. Gritty city street scenes and tolerable music is about all it has going for it. For two such charismatic actors to hand in such a mundane offering is astounding.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Gripping Tale of Loyalty and Betrayal,"Donnie Brasco (1997), directed by Mike Newell, is a riveting and emotionally charged crime drama based on the true story of FBI agent Joseph Pistone's infiltration of the mob. The film is as much about human relationships as it is about organized crime, offering a nuanced and deeply personal exploration of trust, identity, and moral ambiguity.Johnny Depp delivers a restrained and compelling performance as Pistone, operating undercover as Donnie Brasco. His transformation from dedicated agent to someone torn between his duties and his connection to the mob is portrayed with remarkable depth. Al Pacino shines as Lefty Ruggiero, a weary, low-level mobster whose vulnerability and loyalty make him a tragic figure. Pacino's performance is subtle and poignant, showcasing a different side of the actor's range.The film excels in its authenticity, capturing the gritty, unglamorous reality of mob life. Its tension builds steadily, driven by a script that focuses on character development over action. Newell's direction allows the complex dynamics between Donnie and Lefty to take center stage, making their relationship the emotional core of the story.The muted cinematography and understated score enhance the film's somber tone, emphasizing the moral weight of Pistone's mission.Donnie Brasco is more than a mob movie; it's a powerful exploration of the human cost of deception and loyalty. With stellar performances and a deeply affecting story, it's a standout entry in the genre and a must-watch for fans of character-driven dramas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"if this is your family,then this is your family","Loosely based on the story of real-life FBI agent Joe Pistone Donnie Brasco tells the story of how Pistone(Johnny Depp) Wins the trust of Bonanno crime family hitman Lefty Ruggiero(Al Pacino). Over time Donnie becomes deeper entangled with the family, as he starts to develop a strong friendship with Lefty, and his relationship with his family crumbles and quite possibly his duties. Donnie Brasco is one of the gangster films that stands out if quite possibly underrated compared to other films of the sub-genres. It is not a film that follows a lot of the traditional cliches for these types of films. Where everybody is on top and it all partying and murder and betrayal. Though there's betrayal Donnie Brasco is a Gangster story that is more Character-driven as opposed to Violence and action. Except for a few scenes the, movie's very dialogue-driven rightfully keeps the focus between Brasco and Lefty. Of course, without saying, both Depp and Pacino give great performances you buy their relationship even at the beginning it does feel like they skip a section. In the beginning, Pacino pretty much trusts him right away and takes him under his wing. However, despite that, as the story progresses they both change in ways.

One of the great mob movies!,"Donnie Brasco is a mob movie based on the true story of FBI Special Agent Joe Pistone, played by Johnny Depp, and the New York mafia group he infiltrated in the late 1970's. This isn't your typical gangster film. Donnie Brasco has a softer touch and the emotional undercurrent that is sparse in its predecessors is what makes this movie one of the best 90's dramas. Joe Pistone poses as Donnie Brasco, an orphan jeweller that's been taken under the wing of Benjamin 'lefty' Ruggiero, a down on his luck street hustler with ""26 hits under my belt"" who has become disillusioned with the mafia institution he's given his life too. This is a raw look at the gritty working class life of a mob crew that scrap and fight for every cent they can muster. There's very little glitz and glamour within this mob and the daily hustle of making a buck wears thin on the gang and even more so on Donnie and his over the hill mentor Lefty. As impressive as Johnny Depp is, this is Al Pacino's film, the master bringing a lifetime of experience and wisdom to his role. Director Mike Newell's mafia entry is very respectable, he manages to hold his own against the likes of Coppola, Scorsese and De Palma as directors who have mastered this genre before him. Donnie Brasco gives the audience a glimpse of blue collar crime within the mob that's rarely been seen in a movie before or since.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A hard and gritty story of deception with strong performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.,"Donnie Brasco is based on the 1988 non-fiction book ""Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia"" by Joseph D. Pistone. It was directed by Mike Newell and starring Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, and Anne Heche in pivotal roles.Donnie Brasco is a story of two men, who grow up to love each other within the framework of teacher student relationship, It got nothing to do with sex, It was the need of the hour, the survival mode for both the characters.
It's a subtle film based on human emotions.
Donnie Brasco is a world of friendship, trust and deception, It got nothing to do with violence and mafia though it was the primarily theme of this film. Whenever you try to look a list of greatest mob films, I bet you, you'll never find this film in the leagues of GOD FELLAS or other cinema which covers the mafia as a tough world and according to some viewers Gangsters got nothing to do with emotions and relationships so, this fact extracted Donnie Brasco from their list.When it comes to the acting part it has two Juggernauts from two different generations of american artists collided in a world of organized crime and from their collision started a ripple of deceptions and produced a fine mafia thriller.I like the way, Al Pacino shifts his gears of emotions. His joy when he entrusted Donnie (Depp),despair when he found about his son and his cancer, gore when he killed his fellow gang member, violence when they tried to dumped three dead bodies and with his usual credit he take you away far from reality in the last 10 minutes of the film, I mean you're just blown away with his act, tear treasure.Pacino was equally responded by the emptiness of Johnny Depp. He was young, handsome, bold and wearier. If I've to choose between from Sean Penn from Carlito's Way I would like to go with Depp he was flawless as Donnie Brasco.The supporting cast was equally great.Mike Newell's direction was dense and moving, the way he captured the backstabbing, deception, violence, and particularly emotion of mafia world was terrific. His character development was stark and sensational.The cinematography was brilliant and the Music score was also good.Last Word:Donnie Brasco is one of the finest mafia thrillers of recent times, It has a hard and gritty story of deception with strong performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Deep/Depp inside,"After Pirates of the Caribbean, many have gotten the impression that Johnny Depp can be pigeonhold and just do the one thing. There are many movies that prove different - even though his character here has to walk a fine line (at least at first) on being borderline naive. Even without knowing the true and real story behind this, you feel what is happening.Which is almost a shame, because it makes you feel you are way superior than Al Pacinos Lefty character. Of course that is not entirely true. At his height, Lefty would not have been as vulnerable. But with everything going on, he is open and susceptible. The friends he has, they are no fun, which the opening dialog shows clearly. And while he loves his family, his son is a burden to him. So a surrogate son, a pupil of sorts is more than welcome.That being said, it is not like he does not take some precautions. He does check, but not deep enough. Which is also a testament to the charisma of Depp. This real story is quite mesmerizing as are the actors involved. While often times I feel like only Tarantino can get the best out of Michael Madsen, this movie proves me wrong. He is top notch here, going face to face with Pacino and Depp - not backing down or giving the impression he is inferior to them.Great acting, great background, but also things that many might consider cliches. Depps wife and personal life, how he is affected and influenced, how his job takes toll on him. But if you can switch that cynic mode off and enjoy the movie for what it is, there is a lot that will give you pleasure - in a good way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Another Gansgter Film,"An FBI agent goes undercover with the mob in New York City, endangering his life while collecting evidence to expose the mafia. This is another in a seemingly endless series of movies based on true stories about the mafia. And most of them star either Pacino or De Niro. In this case it is Pacino, doing his usual crime boss shtick. Despite the claims about being based on a true story, it is hard to believe that a fresh-faced cop like Depp would be able to fool so many hardened criminals. While well enough made, it really does have a sense of Deja Vu. Not only that, but as seems to be standard practice with these kinds of films, it goes on far too long.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Different Kind Of Mafia Movie,"It may not be as good as ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Godfather,"" but this is an extremely underrated gangster film, and it has one of Al Pacino's best performances. He plays Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero, a sad old wiseguy who has been passed up for promotion in the organization again and again. Pacino is so good in this film. He perfectly captures the resentment and disappointment of a man who just wants to be respected. He's always broke, lives in a sorta shabby apartment, and is treated with scorn by some of the other gangsters.Lefty doesn't have the best judgment, which is part of why his life has turned out the way it has. His biggest mistake is to befriend ""Don The Jeweler,"" whose alias is Donnie Brasco, but who is actually an undercover FBI agent named Joe Pistone. The film is based on the real Joe Pistone's story, and Johnny Depp plays him in the movie.This film is not like other gangster films. It is slow-moving, melancholy, and does not glamorize mob life at all. We see Lefty after 30 plus years and the life has been sucked out of him. There is not a whole lot of violence in the film, although there are one or two scenes that are pretty gruesome. One really cool thing about the movie is that it gives you an insider's view of the daily minutiae of mob life. There are some neat scenes of Lefty explaining to Donnie how to act like a wiseguy, how to dress, how wiseguys carry their money in a roll and not a wallet, etc.""Donnie Brasco"" does have a few negative aspects. Some of the scenes between Donnie/Joe and his wife are the same old clichés, and the film becomes less compelling toward the end. Still, it's well worth watching for the brooding drama and the terrific performance by Pacino.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

One look can be deadly !,"There are already 282 reviews for the film Donnie Brasco. So what is there that is new that I can tell you about it ? Well, I agree that is is a great, entertaining film about the Mafia. I agree that there is much that is very different than most run of the mill gangster films, such as feeding hamburgers to a zoo animal in the back seat of a Cadillac. VERY amusing. And supposedly TRUE. I agree that the actors Pacino, Depp, Madsen, and the rest of the cast turned in excellent performances. So what can I add to that ? I would like to commend the work of Robert Miano who portrays Sonny Red in the film. One look from him would terrify me as it did those under his thumb.

"Donnie Brasco: Brass, Brassiest, Brasco","The first time I watched Donnie Brasco, I did so with a bit of trepidation. The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama.The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld.The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character.Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention. So, if you haven't seen it and you're up for a crime drama, I can recommend Donnie Brasco without reservations. My rating is 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Donnie Brasco (1997),"Directed by Mike Newell. Starring Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Michael Madsen, Anne Heche, Bruno Kirby, Zeljko Ivanek, James Russo, Gerry Becker, Rocco Sisto, Robert Miano, Brain Tarantina. (R)Aging, low-rung Mafia hitman Lefty (Pacino) befriends and vouches for fellow hood Donnie Brasco (Depp), bringing him into his criminal family alongside capo Madsen, completely unaware that Donnie is actually an undercover fed named Joe Pistone. Based on Pistone's memoir, screenwriter Paul Attanasio and director Newell do a commendable job of taking a lot of familiar crime film elements and giving them a fresh perspective and vitality; we've seen a lot of these types before, but Lefty's sad-eyed insight is what counts. Joe's sketchy family life is undernourished--his long-suffering wife (Heche) gripes a lot about being on the verge of leaving him, and it's never clear why she doesn't--which only serves to show that his new ""adopted"" family is the one dominating his life, especially his deep bond with Lefty. Driven by the two great lead performances: Depp's abstinence from his trademark quirks for an honest portrayal, troubled and anxious while finding his loyalties and behavior torn between two extremes, and Pacino's furtive angles on brotherly love and the deep melancholy instilled in a man who brags about having a name that everyone in all five boroughs knows, yet is treated like a knockaround guy by his mob superiors.

Donnie Brasco,"Due to his long term Collaboration with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp name is mostly highlighted next to films which bare the Disney indent. However he has acted in films targeted at a older demographical group and Donnie Brasco is one of those films.One word of advice, if your expecting a full blown Mafia film then this film will upset you. We follow the true story of a FBI agent who for Six years, is thrown in the deep end of the Mafia , participating as a undercover cop. The pairing of Depp and Pacino is fantastic with Pacino as always being top dog. However, if your thinking his character Lefty is at the calibre of Michael Corleone or Tony Montano, they you would be very mistaken. Instead, we witness a man whom looking over his shoulder 24/7, afraid of being whacked. A man who has pipe dreams like the rest of us. Despite his Mafia history, you engaged in some sort of supportive connection with Pacino character and hope at the end that things will work out fine for him.With his one liners and old dog's tales, He steals the show. Depp with him only helps the pairing to be even more enjoyable. It still has the night clubs and the 70's soundtrack. There the rare Drug deal but overall, the film focuses on Brasco's partnership with Lefty and his struggle to balance his family life with his job. A very good film",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A must for any lovers of gangster films!,"Donnie Brasco provides a great glimpse into the ins and outs of mafia life, and does so from a very interesting perspective. We track the internal politics, workings, and terminology of mafia life through the eyes of the eponymous Donnie and Al Pacino's 'Lefty'. What I loved most about this film was that it isn't an in your face gangster film, full of violence and shock factor moments. Its much more of a study of the wise guy life in a way, similar to Goodfellas in some respects (although nowhere near as good to be clear!).The real triumph of the film comes with Depp and Pacino. The two of them work really well together on screen, and the relationship between the two characters, watching this develop, was the highlight for me. The performances were fantastic, particularly from Pacino. For my shame I've seen very few Pacino performances, but really enjoyed his performance here. It had so many different layers to it, and it always felt very real. Depp was equally good, with this being a reminder that he really is a talented actor outside of more ostentatious character roles (Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka etc). He was a complex enough character to intrigue the audience, but no complex enough to become annoying and unwatchable. I always felt like we could get behind him. The supporting cast were all solid, but it really is all about Pacino and Depp, who rightfully steal the show.The script was so sharp in places, with some great injections of humour. I particularly loved the scenes where Pacino was describing the wise guy life to Depp and teaching him the ways of the mob. They were very Scorsese esc and were yet another highlight of the film for me.As well as all of the above the overall plot is great, very gripping and interesting. Its truly remarkable that it was based on a real story.I would have scored Donnie Brasco higher, but felt that there were a few lulls in parts, and the pacing and structure could have been a bit tighter. Overall a very strong gangster film which at its best parts can certainly hold its own against some of the gangster classics out there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A tough movie,"This is the story of a New York Mafia gang and some of its members viewed from the inside, plus the story of a FBI agent who manages to infiltrate himself in the gang through the good offices of a petty member of it whose role is performed by Al Pacino in which was maybe the best performance of his career. There is of course a lot of bloodshed since the lives of those men are torn between to kill or be killed. It's also a story about human nature featured by the strange friendship that arises between the infiltrated agent(who has sometimes to behave like one of the so called ""wise men"" of the Mafia gang) and the member who acts as his ""protector"" and also featured by the familiar problems of these two prominent characters;for the infiltrated agent (performed by Johnny Depp) because he has got to stay out of home for long periods which annoys his wife very much and even puts his marriage at risk; for the petty Mafia member because he has severe problems with his son who is a drug addict. The second half of the movie is somewhat weaker than the first one since it's more about the conspiracies of the gang and the ensuing gunfights and killings than about the psychological analysis of characters shown through their actions and words. Anyway it's still a good movie, well directed and well acted by everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Wow! Subtle and Strong,"For me, crime films have no middle ground. They're either great or they're a waste of time. This film is unexpectedly great.

It's one part of the endearment of this film and how I won't ""Fogettaboutit!"" anytime soon.The film stars Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, a pair I never knew I wanted, Johnny being the undercover cop and Al Pacino as the gangster who's overseeing him. Johnny Depp plays a serious role, which I have never gotten to see, and it suits him perfectly- felt like Leo at times. He's always on edge about his lifestyle and how the mafia is closing its grip on his reality. That's what is striking about this movie; it's a crime drama with more emphasis on ""drama"" than actual crime. It does have all the underbelly tropes but instead of focusing on them it puts its entire focus on the psyche of Johnny Depp's titular character, Donnie. Mike Newell clearly tried to include the familiar Scorsese-isms, but they feel ""fine"" and rather derivative. Those sequences are short and are necessary to understanding Donnie's involvement so they don't feel unwelcome either.The music by Patrick Doyle is suitable if a bit over-dramatic. The main theme is really the only motif present and it's repetitive almost to an extreme but isn't annoying at all. It's a fine score but not one that I would listen to on repeat. Maybe once is all.The way the film is shot is super competent and stylized in such a way to where the audience is given the perspective of Donnie almost through the entire movie but as if we are observing him under the guise of being FBI agents. Many scenes will cut away to a camera lens to give the impression that Donnie is always being watched- this changes at a turning point in the film.Donnie Brasco is a gangster flick that focuses more on a gang's interactions rather than violence.

I mean a real physical resemblance, which he doesn't normally have at all. And what can you say about another masterful performance by Al Pacino. Lefty's pathos oozed right off the screen. His misplaced paternalism toward Brasco was perfect, teaching him the ropes about Mafiosi ways, like the difference between introducing someone as ""a friend of mine"" as opposed to ""a friend of ours"".

It is worth it.,"I really like films involving gangsters or the mafia, and this is just another good film on the subject. It's not the best, nor the worst, but it does what it promises and does everything it needs to do elegantly and correctly. It is based on the action of federal agent Joe Pistone, who spent six years undercover in one of the five most important families of the New York Mafia, with high risks to his life and great sacrifice to his family relationship. And considering the elegant and judicious way in which the plot emulates, with some rigor, what happened to this police officer, I can only consider that the script is to be congratulated, as is the writing of the dialogues, full of slang of the American mobsters.The photography is quite beautiful, with excellent use of color and light throughout the film. The sets, filming locations and props manage to immediately transport us to that world of risk and illegality where mob operate. I especially liked Lefty's extravagant costume, as a way of visually expressing his most impactful personality characteristics, such as vanity, exacerbated egocentrism, megalomania and lack of elegance. I still have to praise the soundtrack, discreet but effective, and the excellent editing work.The film works largely thanks to two huge dramatic performances delivered by Al Pacino and Johnny Depp. They played radically different characters that correspond to real people, and both were incredible in reproducing and interpreting their respective roles. Personally, I think this is one of Depp's best serious films, and by serious I mean the films in which he wasn't asked to play some kind of bizarre character from someone's dreams or nightmares.

Astounding and different,"I sat down to watch ""Donnie Brasco"" with the idea of a typical mafia movie in mind. When the movies was over, I decided that it wasn't exactly what you would label as, ""A typical mafia movie,"" because there is a whole side of the movie that involves, more than any Mafia movie does, a lot of sentimentality.The plot is pretty basic and it is based on a true story. It's about an undercover agent for the FBI, Donnie Brasco, who joins the mafia in order to find information about it and completely infiltrate it. (Johnny Depp plays the undercover agent.) Donnie is practically adopted by Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), who is a lower-class Mafia man. Lefty guides Donnie through the New York gangster scene and they develop a very strong relationship. But as Donnie loses himself in his job, he becomes distant to his wife and kids. (The wife is played by Anne Heche). This causes problems with the family. Donnie turns into a confused, guilty, lost man as he goes on to mix his professional and personal life up and create one hell of a mess.The story itself, I found very interesting. Then there's the perfectly chosen cast.Quite frankly, there's nothing negative I can say about either Johnny Depp or Al Pacino in this movie. I've already decided that Johnny Depp is a generally a splendid actor (though a little too underplayed/subtle if that makes any sense at all), but I think that he did an exceptionally good job on this movie. I don't recall ever seeing him in a gangster movie, but he was in this one and he really captured the role and created a masterpiece of a character.As for Al Pacino, he is most definitely on my Top 10 list of favorite actors, no doubt about that. And this movie only makes me think even more of him, so you can imagine how good he was. After having seen Donnie Brasco, I thought for the 100th time to myself, ""Al is untouchable."" The way he talks, walks, acts, laughs and moves with the other actors is simply astounding. He really makes you feel for him, which he hadn't been able to do since his classic performance in the ""Godfather Pt. II"".Then comes Anne Heche. She used to be very popular around the '90s, and I was wondering what had happened to her. Well, now I know what happened to her. People got sick of Anne Heche. Her roles are never exceptionally challenging, and although she played a very believable role in this movie, her character wasn't a very powerful one. Many would disagree with me, but the whole concept of a wife scolding her husband every two scenes simply bored me and therefore the character became banal in my eyes. So although Heche did a good job in playing Donnie's wife, I'm not going to give her a standing ovation because she mostly annoyed me.All in all, I would probably give this movie a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Al Pacino and Johnny Deep make a great team- A solid crime film,"Donnie Brasco was a good crime film. It centers on a cop named Joseph D. Pistone who goes undercover known as Donnie Brasco and works with his older partner, Lefty and the mob but suddenly gets hooked with the mob life while working on the job. Donnie Brasco was a very touching movie actually and the ending left you pretty sad. Al Pacino and Johnny Depp were a great team and Pacino put up one of his best performances he has ever done. The character study of Donnie Brasco was just phenomenal and how the story went on was really gripping. Donnie Brasco was a solid crime film that is pretty enjoyable. I recommend it to crime fans.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Mob Movie,"It was not until 2009 that I saw this film and I'm not entirely sure how or why I never watched it, or really knew what it was about, until then. I say that because I really enjoy this type of film and I especially love Al Pacino.But anyways, I thought that this movie was very nicely done. The plot was solid and the characters were all really great. When movies on an interesting subject like this and done very well, it makes me want to learn more about said subject. So after watching this film, I spent a lot of time researching mob life and the ""five families"" on Wikipedia. I only note that because I think that it says a lot about how this movie really interested me.It was really neat to see Johnny Depp in a serious role once again. He's a talented actor and very versatile, but I am very sick of him as Willy Wonka, Jack Sparrow, and coming soon as the Mad Hatter. Michael Madson and the rest of the cast were very good as well.I did not like this film quite as well as Goodfellas, but that is not taking anything away from this. I would recommend both if you're interested in mob movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Another way to look at ""mafia movies""","We all have seen those great movies about the organised crime and the cosa nostra, I mean movies like ""The Godfather"" by F.F.Coppola or ""The Goodfellas"" by M. Scorsese. Donnie Brasco gives us just the opposite way to look at these sort of movies. It is just a masterpiece of directing actors and performances and above all, a particular, brilliant performance for Al Pacino. His talent here is so clear on the screen that it is impossible to miss it. I also appreciate the brilliant score and the way it is used (very cleverly) in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Not Pacino's best performance - but damn close.,"Another reviewer has said it is Pacino's best. I can understand why. Here he turns down the volume and we can hear every note. Its a beautiful, subtle performance.I feel sorry for Depp. In any other film with any other actor it would've been his film but unfortunately Pacino steals every scene his in.Lefty (Pacino) is a small-time hood forever being passed over. Donnie Brasco (Depp) is the undercover FBI agent who Pacino befriends and vouches for to his ultimate doom. Every scene with Pacino in should be watched by every aspiring film actor (and most established ones!) to see how its done. If this sounds like a love-letter to Pacino at the expense of the rest of the cast well it is. And the supporting cast are perfect as well - Heche as Brasco's suffering wife, Madsen as Pacino's boss, Bruno Kirby as one of the gang. I could list every one.Also credit must go to the director Mike Newell for making me forgive him for Hugh Grant's career with this film.Some people say this is too similar to ""Goodfellas"" and indeed the release was delayed and the casting changed due to that Scorsese classic. But I say ""Donnie Brasco"" is the anti-Goodfellas - the wiseguys here are a bit too low rent/nickel and dime. And Pacino gives us the anti-Godfather. And when films are this good there's room for both in this world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Superb,"I find this film fascinating. The viewer watches the transformation of an ordinary person. Donnie joins the mob as a suburban outsider, and becomes so entrenched with his undercover persona that he becomes one of them. His wife resents him, the bosses start to trust him. He becomes more violent and the line between his previous existence and his mob life becomes more and more blurred as he is given more responsiblity and trust. A superb film. Johnny Depp is incredible and sadly overlooked by the misguided Academy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Goodfellas with a plot.,"An FBI undercover agent infiltrates the mob.Starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.Written by Joseph D Pistone (Book), Richard Woodley (Book) and Paul Attanasio (Screenplay).Directed by Mike Newell.This is the second mob movie I've seen in a row and it's basically Goodfellas with a plot.It perhaps lacks the overall polish and cinematography of Goodfellas but it makes up for it by having more plot and emotion. I didn't get to know each of the characters as much but that's probably because this is a shorter movie and based more on the relationship between the two leads as opposed to the the mob in general.Al Pacino and Johnny Depp give good lead performances and their dynamic works well. It's my third Al Pacino film and probably my favourite. Likewise I've seen a few Johnny Depp films and this is the best performance I've seen. It's another side to him and it proves what a versatile actor he is as well as having the looks. And that's something you don't always see.I still don't think Mob movies are really my thing but I'm enjoying catching a few and I have another one lined up. If anything I've learned a few things I didn't know before if the mob ever comes up in a pub quiz!Just like Goodfellas this gets an 8 out of 10 but for different reasons. On a side note I was surprised to see who the director of this was considering the previous things he has directed. That's a weird one but he has done a good job.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Overlooked Gritty Jewel from 1997,"Slick, highly engaging mob movie about an aging gangster (Al Pacino) who takes a young recruit (Johnny Depp) under his wing, not knowing that he's an undercover FBI agent sent to infiltrate the crime organization.This is one of the most overlooked films from the year of its release (1997), perhaps because it fell under the shadow of another, and admittedly better, crime thriller, ""L.A. Confidential."" But this movie deserves some attention of its own, thanks largely to the two terrific central performances of Pacino and Depp. It's also adeptly directed by Mike Newell, whose biggest claim to fame up to that point was directing the break out hit romance ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""

"What Goodfellas has in style, Donnie Brasco has in substance","While lacking the polish and pizzazz of Scorsese's classic, Donnie Brasco deals with the psychological and emotional consequences of the Mafia life more realistically and poignantly than any other film has.While I think the 90s Gotti film also did a good job of exploring the humanity of the mob, I feel the effort was muddied with sentimentality. I believe the Sopranos went too far in the other direction, sinking to bleak cynicism and gratuity as the series progressed. Donnie Brasco strikes a perfect balance in this regard. Its characters are not men of honour but nonetheless, we watch them grapple with feelings of doubt, regret, and genuine loyalty, even in a business where none of these are useful or even safe to feel.The role of Lefty is played so well, forgetabouitit. This might just be one of Pacino's greatest. Depp, impressively, holds his own as FBI mole Donnie. How can you not love Michael Madsen, and he was a fantastic choice to play the crew's charming but hair-trigger capo Sonny Black.

See Johnny Depp be Italian!,"Donnie Brasco, Mob/Cop-DramaIn Johnny Depp's versatile repertoire, this stands as his Mobster movie. And like everything else he's done, it's done almost perfectly.Donnie Brasco is based on a true story of an undercover FBI agent to who goes uncommonly deep into mafia circles to, of course, gather evidence of wrongdoings of in the world of organized crime. The film co-stars Al Pacino and Michael Madsen as mobsters who take a liking to Depp's Brasco, and eventually lead him deeper into mafia circles, doings, and evils. Anne Heche plays Depp's relatively angry wife.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--Obviously, as any film with Johnny Depp, the acting is very good. Pacino and Madsen roll along as convincing as ever in their roles as mobsters. Like they were born to play only these kind of parts.--Excellent cinematography and very nice atmosphere.--The brief gore we have is fantastic.--A lot of snazzy rules discussed in detail about the underworld of Italian mobsters and their lingo.--Excellent costumes. The story takes place in the late 70's, and the wardrobe and scenery is quite accurate.--Giant 70's Cadillacs. What's not to like about that?--Brilliant character depth and development, especially from Depp and Pacino's characters.--Nice action sequences.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The music, aside from the Disco, is quite good.--Occasionally, the pacing of the story seems a bit odd. This doesn't hurt the film, and won't be obvious to everyone, but to me, there seemed to be some ""off"" moments.--Over two hours running time.--Anne Heche must be going through menopause or something. One second she's happy, the next she's crazy, the next she's p*ssed off. Her acting was quite good, but her character was occasionally annoying. It worked to emphasize the growing problems in her relationship as Depp's wife.The Bad:--For some people, the pacing and length will be a turn-off. Some may become gradually disinterested in the film as it progresses.--Aside from that, there isn't a whole lot to dislike here.The Ugly:--Tons of Disco! Once again, what the hell was wrong with people in the 70's??Memorable Scene:--Hard to pick just one. I'll go with any time Depp's character slips over that line between undercover FBI agent and Mobster. For instance in the Japanese restaurant.Acting: 9/10 , Story: 9/10 , Atmosphere: 8/10 , Cinematography: 9/10 , Character Development: 10/10 , Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 (very minor, but good) , Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 (brief breast shots only) , Violence: 6/10 (relatively brief, but very entertaining) , Gore: 1/10 (extremely brief, good quality) , Dialog: 9/10 (fagghettaboutit) , Music: 7/10 , Direction: 9/10Cheesiness: 1/10 , Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 9/10Overall, I'd have to recommend this, especially to Johnny Depp fans, and fans of Mafia/Mobster movies.

Humanising the Mafia.,"After the hip, razzle dazzle glamorising of the Mafia that was 'Goodfellas', Donnie Brasco is a breath of fresh air.  While watching Donnie Brasco I was so appreciative of the realism that the characters have to them, this is what stood out to me most in comparison with other mob films.This feeling is summed up beautifully early on in the film when we see Lefty (Pacino) sitting in front of the TV, watching a nature program, in an ill-fitting red tracksuit, in a 'lived in' looking chair.  This simple and brief moment has the effect of humanising Lefty.  He isn't the larger than life figure that 'wiseguys' are usually depicted as in film, but a real person, who does the normal banal things that all people do in their lives.The believable characters are not the only fine thing about this film however.  Donnie Brasco is as close to perfectly executed as any film you will see from 1997.  Not a minute is wasted in the slowly unraveling story. Every scene is worthy and important.  The performances are rock solid. With this Depp has graduated to the top grade of leading men, which is quite an achievement for one still so young. Pacino too is superb, offering his best performance in years as the tragic Lefty.  The overlooked Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are both fine in support.I have little hesitation saying that this is the best mafia film since 'The Godfather Part II'.  Its realism and moving characters place it a notch above the tragically hip 'Goodfellas'.10/10 - The best film of 1997.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Pacino can't be better than this,"Here comes, one more of Al Pacino's brilliant acts.Donnie Brasco delves more into Pacino's and Depp's inner talents.It shows from Pacino being emotional to Depp being gritty.I never knew Johnny Depp could have acted to be a mobster.Well,Pacino we all now when he delivers,everything just stays hit.And Donnie Brasco is a classic hit thanks to some memorable performances.Based on true events,brilliantly adapted with a fitting screenplay and an all perfect casting to go with.Well directed with certain emotional moments to just leave the audience numb.Some scenes are violent and gruesome as well.Just fitting the righteous purpose of this gangster film.This is just no ordinary gangster film.When you have seen Pacino with a purpose in Godfather,with greed in Scarface,with charisma in Scent of a women,with honesty in Carlitos Way,you will be not be far from seeing him with trust and hope in this movie.Still my Pacino's favorite film remains Carlitos Way.But i am sure,the more i see this again....this just keeps on rising among the ranks of best rated Pacino's movie for me.But trust me like Lefty trusted Donnie,Pacino can't be better than this or can he?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An Absolute Experience,"One of very few movies based on true mafia stories to not be twisted and changed by Hollywood shenanigans. A tad off-beat for those looking for the classic Al Pacino crime/action move, that said it is truly a great film inspired by a story that you can't take your eyes off. Scenes are shot wonderfully and it has some of the best acting I've ever seen. Although it is becoming dated it is still a near-perfectly executed film. Johnny Depp as Donnie Brasco is a perfect fit. The emotion that this film gives is unmatched, from the scenes at Donnie's house to the scenes in the Miami tavern. This film is truly a best in the mafia category.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Another scary mafia told tale,"Just watching the end, where Joe Pistone aka. Donnie Brasco, received a big cheque, ones in sizes you can't cash at banks, to the value of 500 hundred dollars, and a medal of commendation, what he went through, prefore, those years of undercover work, leads you to ask ""Is it all worth it?"" My opinion. No. Because it was his quality of family life, and normal life that suffered. I had heard the real Joe Pistone, tell quite a terrifying tale, which had him in another room, where two mafia guys were fifty fifty about him, and were having a discussion on whether to whack him, where Joe heard the whole tale. Now, put yourself in this situation, you can imagine. Depp, plays the real life Pistone, again to polished perfection, who went undercover as Don the jeweler, and was taken in by Lefty, (a feared mafia man, who becomes a pathetic pussy later on, as his status deteriorates, where Sonny (Michael Madsen, doing what he does best, smiling and looking intimidating with those mannerisms, we love) one of Lefty's gang, replaced him. It's really hard to rate Madsen's performance in this. The other two of Lefty's mob are played by Bruno Kirby and James Russo. Russo really surprised me actually. He's hasn't done work this good for a long time. Pacino as Lefty is just another masterpiece of a performance. I mean, what else can I say? He really carved out this real life character so deep, especially playing the pitiable part well, where Donnie seems to be his real only friend. Anne Heche is great as Depp's suffering wife, and is sexy too, as well as being a great actress. Violence wise, it's only violent when it needs to be, but when it happens, when the blood sprays, it's strong. In particular I'm taking about one scene, before human dismemberment, takes place. This is very smartly modified, as the visuals could of been much worse. Here's just another well told mafia tale, with great acting and writing. In contrast, bits of this one I familiarize with the current Black Mass, with Depp on the other end of the law. But what you really get out of this film, is how scary going over cover is, and Lefty's mob aren't idiots. Check out Pacino's remark about cooks, and his shock revelation, concerning his ill heath in the nether region.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A mobster classic of all times,"This is an exceptionally good thriller on organized crime because it is based on a true story and actual Pistone acted as an advisor in the production.

A brilliant addition to the gangster genre,"Donnie Brasco (1997) is a movie that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows an undercover agent who becomes close friends with a made man who desires to climb the ladder within the mob but is constantly overlooked. The made man unknowingly helps the agent get deeper and deeper into the mob and eventually becomes jealous, making it hard for the agent to keep his cover. Can the agent do his job without ruining the made man's aspirations?This movie is directed by Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) and stars Al Pacino (Heat), Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow), Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dog), Zeljko Ivanek (Argo), Gretchen Mol (3:10 to Yuma) and Anne Heche (Wag the Dog).This storyline is so compelling to watch unfold even if you know how it has to end from the beginning. The acting by Depp and Pacino is amazing and Depp is super slick with his mannerism, dialogue and actions. A truly captivating performance. Pacino is an easy character to root for, feel sorry for, but understand he's getting his just desserts. The circumstances in this are fascinating and the basement scene is unbelievable, as is the fight at the club in Miami. Once they get to Miami you can feel things getting heavier and heavier. The conclusion is magnificent, subtle but also makes your stomach drop.Overall, this is a brilliant addition to the gangster genre that's an absolute must see.

A complex friendship between criminal and undercover,"The mafia film ""Donnie Brasco"" at first does not seem to fit in the oeuvre of director Mike Newell. Apart from the fact that it is a film with an all American cast and a British director, I didn't associate the crime genre with a director I mainly knew from the relation comedy ""Four weddings and a funeral"" (1994).Nevertheless ""Donnie Brasco"" is a good film that really contributes something to the mafia genre. This is in no small measure attributable to the two lead actors Al Pacino and Johnny Depp. Al Pacino (Lefty) plays an aging mafia member who's career has slowed down and who didn't climb the hierarchy as high as he thinks he was intitled to. Johnny Depp (Donnie) plays an FBI agent infiltrating the mafia.Often the problem with infiltration in the mafia is that the undercover agent succumbs for a life of luxury and women. In ""Donnie Brasco"" however the relationship between Donnie and Lefty is the centerpiece of the movie. Unsatisfied with his (criminal) career Lefty is all too eager to become the menor of the young Donnie. Initially Donnie is happy with this entrance to the criminal circuit. However, as he starts to like Lefty, the thought that the inescapable discovey that he was a cop after all (after his job is done) might cost Lefty his life is haunting him more and more.Compared to this complex relationship the others are sketched superficially at most. For example how difficult it is to combine the job of undercover with a normal family life. Real unprofessional and hard to believe (at least I hope so) is the scene in which a colleague cop is greeting Donnie at an airport and in so doing threatens to embarrass Donnie in the eyes of his criminal friends.The film has a couple of remarkable scenes. One is a conversation in which Lefty shows suspicions that Donnie is an undercover. In the subsequent conversation he draws however no conclusions. His suspicions remain floating in the air so te speak. Near the end Lefty put al his valuables in a drawer and leaves this drawer open when leaving home for an appointment. Apparently this experienced mafioso anticipates the outcome of the meeting. This scene would be a perfect ending scene.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good and realistic. Depp and Pacino shines.,"Donnie BrascoJoe Pistone is an undercover agent for the FBI, his code name is ""Donnie Brasco"", Joe manages to hook up with a small time who vouches him into the mafia, while he's doing his work he is building a solid relationship with ""Lefty"", the guy who vouced him. While he is working he sees the life of the mafia take him over while his ""real life"" with his wife falls apart.This movie in it's style is very intelligent, it describes something that has been seen before, but in a different angle, which i think is good. It's a very realistic movie that gives a good portrait of how the mafia works. But most importantly for the movie is the new angle of the whole mob environment, because we all know pretty much how this works now, through so many legengady movies, from Godfather to Casino. While most of the other movies gives a detailed portrait of the rise and fall, this movie focuses one two thing for two different character, in Pacino's case we see the constant struggle for rising in the grades. In Depp's case we see a great detailed portrait of life as an undercover agent, and what problems it brings, also on the home front.Depp and Pacino works really good together, and i'm gonna be honest, i'm a big fan of Depp, and he does indeed once again show me why, this man is so talented, and the way he absorbs his character and gives them a bit of himself is really amazing, he once again does an amazing job here. Pacino is playing his perfect role, the mob, how many times has he done this sort of role now? I think it's many times, but he works very well in them, his whole attitude just makes him seem like a very realistic mob guy.The directing in the movie is basically a standard job, i think many could have done a better job, the direction doesn't feel very deep, there aren't really any things there are noticed. Something i think makes a great director is when you can watch the movie and spot who made it because he uses personal phrases in it. This could have been directed by anybody, it's the acting that kicks this movie alive, together with a good storyline.For a sum up, i must say i liked this movie a lot, maybe i liked it better because i found the particular subject interesting, but either way. It is a good movie, and it is well done, especially the brilliant cast brings good light to a good story. A story that shows a different angle of the mob side, in a very brilliant way.

Instant Classic,"Well where to start...this is my first review and i specially made this account to wrtie one for this movie..... one of the best Alpacinos movies and undoubtedly the best movie of Johhny Deps whole life... This movie touched my heart, The Acting,the direction,the dialougues everything was mind boggling....The story grabs your soul inside the movie and ties u hard and you cannt leave ur place obviously because its not one of those fully action packed fast paced movies that u see everyday. So relax before start watching it. The relation between donnie and lefty is definitely very emotional and i think there are very less movies that have touched my heart this much before... I recommend it very strongly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Tense, gritty, well acted","Donnie Brasco is a film that grabs you from the start and doesn't let go. It's a gritty, tension-filled dive into the world of undercover work, where loyalty is a double-edged sword and the lines between right and wrong blur dangerously. What really makes Donnie Brasco shine is the performances. Johnny Depp delivers one of his finest roles as Joe Pistone, the FBI agent who goes undercover as Donnie Brasco. He perfectly captures the internal conflict of a man who's in too deep, torn between his duty and the genuine bond he forms with the very people he's supposed to betray. Opposite him, Al Pacino is exceptional as Lefty Ruggiero, a weary, low-level mobster who takes Donnie under his wing. Pacino brings a vulnerability to Lefty that's both heartbreaking and compelling, making the inevitable betrayal feel all the more tragic.The film's pacing is spot-on, building tension gradually without ever feeling rushed. Director Mike Newell does a fantastic job of immersing you in the world of the mob, with its unspoken codes of honor and the constant threat of violence lurking beneath the surface. The authenticity of the setting, the dialogue, and the relationships give the film a raw, lived-in feel that pulls you deeper into its world.The dynamic between Depp and Pacino is the film's beating heart, and it's what elevates Donnie Brasco above many other crime dramas. Their relationship is nuanced and complex, with moments of genuine warmth mixed with the ever-present sense of impending doom. It's a masterclass in character development, showing how the two men, despite their vastly different lives, find a connection that neither expected.But Donnie Brasco isn't without its flaws. At times, the film can feel a bit slow, particularly in its middle act, where the tension dips slightly before ramping up again. Some might find the lack of high-octane action sequences a bit underwhelming, especially if they're expecting the more explosive elements common in mob movies. However, for me, the film's deliberate pacing is a strength, allowing the story to breathe and the characters to fully develop.Another minor criticism is that the supporting characters, while well-acted, don't always get as much attention as they deserve. With such strong leads, it's understandable, but a bit more depth in the surrounding cast could have added even more layers to the story.Despite these small issues, Donnie Brasco is a powerful, emotional, and incredibly well-crafted film that offers a unique perspective on the mob genre. It's a story about loyalty, identity, and the cost of living a lie, told with authenticity and heart. Depp and Pacino's performances alone make it worth watching, but the film's quiet intensity and poignant moments are what truly make it memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
superb,"Definitely a movie that bears rewatching, Donnie Brasco, is - as the consensus of opinion here says - among the top rank of mob films, right up there with the Godfather epic, and certainly superior to the cheap, flashy and overrated ""Goodfellas"". I would say the character development and moral ambiguity in this movie is even more well-developed than in the Coppola movies. To repeat yet again what has been noted below many times, the venerable Al Pacino is at his best and Johnny Depp shows his chops as one of our best young actors, and the way they work together is one of the most superb instances of screen chemistry. Multi-faceted, gritty, realistic, touching, suspenseful - this movie is not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Terrific Entertainment!,"Loosely based on the real-life events of Joseph D. Pistone, an FBI agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family, one of the Mafia's Five Families based in New York City during the 1970s, 'Donnie Brasco' comes out a winner cinematically. In short, it's Terrific Entertainment!'Donnie Brasco' is crisply written, sharply directed, fantastically acted & stylishly edited. It brings a true-story on celluloid, most convincingly. The film begins superbly and culminates interestingly.The characters work, the sequences are believable & the execution to the entire material, is spot-on. Paul Attanasio's Screenplay is crispy. Mike Newell's Direction is razor-sharp, while The Editing is stylish. Cinematography, also, deserves a mention.Performance-Wise: Al Pacino is unbeatable. The Acting Giant performs fabulously from scene A to Z. Johnny Depp as Donnie Brasco, is exceptional. With this performance, Depp, proves how versatile he can be, given the right opportunity. Anne Heche is first-rate. Michael Madsen is excellent. Bruno Kirby is another topper. James Russo & Gerry Becker are good, as well. Others lend perfect support.On the whole, 'Donnie Brasco' is winner all the way. It gets almost everything right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A skillful exploration of the psychology of the mafia,"Donnie Brasco is based on the true story of Joe Pistone, an FBI agent who infiltrates the mafia in the late 1970s. Johnny Depp is excellent as the titular character, displaying a rare vulnerability as he anguishes with the decisions he makes, and finds himself sympathising with the mafioso he spends time with.However, this film is as much about Lefty Ruggerio, played expertly by Al Pacino, as it is about Donnie Brasco. Lefty is an almost man in the mafia, and under Pacino's command the film explores the psychological aspects of being a career criminal, and the paranoia and mistrust that exists within the underworld.When compared to most mafia films, Donnie Brasco isn't violent, instead spending its run time exploring the character and humanity that exists within even the most despicable of criminals. This isn't a flawless film, but it's well worth a watch, and even if you're not usually a fan of crime dramas you might find yourself enjoying this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A first-class Mafia thriller that is also much true than others of same storyline!!!!,"This drama about an undercover cop who learns the hidden dangers of working his way inside the mob was based on a true story. Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart, his son is a junkie, and his health is failing, which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia (and killing 26 people) with little to show for it. But in Donnie, Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime; however, the longer he plays the role of the gangster, the more Joe Pistone finds himself becoming Donnie Brasco in his increasingly rare off hours; it drives a wedge between himself and his wife (Anne Heche) and children, and Joe realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly, Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend, and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates, he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself. The supporting cast includes Michael Madsen as Sonny, Lefty's boss, and Bruno Kirby as Nicky, one of Sonny's henchmen. The real-life Joe Pistone today lives under an assumed name with a 500,000-dollar contract on his life still in effect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good film, great Pacino & Depp","This film should have stature a little closer to Good Fellas"" than I feel it currently enjoys.  Mike Newall gets the wise guy tone right and some of this seems a precursor to 'The Sopranos'.  This is a great film of true tragedy with great performances by two star actors along with a deep supporting cast.  Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, and Anne Hesche along with Paul Giamatti are all teriffic. If you haven't given this a close viewing you should.

Johnny Depp at the top of his game,"A good actor is one who we forget is on the screen seeing the character rather than the performer. Johnny Depp seems to achieve this often in his career and once again we are treated to an outstanding performance in Donnie Brasco. Depp plays FBI Agent Joe Pistone who goes undercover to infiltrate a New york mob family. Hollywood has been there done that with this subject matter many times over but this film has a feel that is different than most of those over the top productions. Joe Pistone becomes his alter ego Donnie Brasco, blurring the line between his job and reality. This is an intricate character study not a film full of flying bullets and cheesy bravado. Depp and Al Pacino both give Oscar worthy efforts as you see the fondness develop between their characters over the course of the story making the inevitable ending that much tougher for Pistone to deal with.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

absolutely brilliant. surpasses Goodfellas (in my opinion) but not denying the brilliance of Goodfellas.,"Donnie is a brilliant film from start to finish. Al and Depp have great chemistry. Wonderful script, realistic/brilliant acting. Not just a movie about an undercover FBI agent infiltrating the mob. It's also about love, honour, betrayal, deceit (as you might have suggested from the plot), power, danger and suspense. Donnie Brasco is a must see, no, a MUST HAVE. It's been definitely underrated (on the IMDb). One of my favourite films. If I could mention anything that I found disappointing about the film, I would say that i felt that the ending could have been slightly longer and a little more revealing (that's just my opinion, maybe I was just enjoying the film so much I didn't want it to end).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Slicker than Goodfellas,"Goodfellas is still the undisputed gangster movie by which all standards are set, but DB is altogether slicker,even more brutal.  Depp is superb but is still outacted at every turn by a docile and almost dopey Pacino.  Pacino's calm makes his acts of violence seem much worse than they are (although the pool table scene is still pretty hard stuff.)  Overall I would have to reccommend the film to anyone who has even a passing interest in gangster movies and even those that dont will find something here as the film has humour, loyalty, betrayal and violence.  I dont say this often but this really is a must see movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Overlooked '90's gangster movie.,"Lets face it, all of the best gangster movies were all made before the '90's. That however doesn't mean that some good gangster movie are stopped being made. ""Donnie Brasco"" is such a good movie, that's a typical gangster movie with most of the usual ingredients, with as an extra touch some drama added to it.Perhaps that the movie tries to be a bit too dramatic at times. Some moments feel too forced and fabricated, just to enhances the movie its dramatic moments. It's just not always interesting and distracts from the movie its main plot. Still lot of things work out, such as the growing sympathy, from Donnie Brasco/Joseph D. 'Joe' Pistone for the small time gangster Lefty, who has never really made it- and gets drawn into the gangster-life. But lots of things also don't. Such as the whole plot with Pistone's wife and children.The main story is good and compelling. Its all the more interesting since its a true story. Its a typical gangster movie story that is solidly written, with all of the much needed ingredients and characters in it. Genre fans will most definitely be not disappointed with this movie.Al Pacino is as great as you would expect from him, in a this sort of movie. Johnny Depp also suits his role well. James Madesen also plays a rather big role in the movie but I don't know, he sort of feels out of place in a this sort of gangster movie. Works for Tarantino movies but just not the 'Scorsese type' of movies, so to speak. Further more the movie also has Paul Giamatti and Tim Blake Nelson in small roles, before they were really known.Too bad that at the time of its release this movie never really got the praise it deserved. The people mostly ignored the movie, myself included. Luckily now more and more people start to 'rediscover' this movie and are given it the praise it deserves. For ""Donnie Brasco"" is a well made gangster movie, that perhaps was made at the wrong time, when the gangster genre was already presumed death and dried up. It's the same reason why ""Casino"" failed. Who knows, if this movie was made in the '70's, people might regard it as a classic by now.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A very good mafia film,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and Al Pacino's performance was exceptional. Depp's performance was satisfactory but below par. He should not have been cast in this type of movie. Depp is not a ""gangster"" type and made his role in the film somewhat unbelievable. Joe Pesce would have been much better cast in that role.The film is loosely based on the true story of an FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco. But what bothered me the most throughout the film was that this crime family was portrayed as so stupid that it let a nobody, outsider into the family and then, almost, made him a made-man. Absurd! That seriously bothered me as Italian Organized Crime members are usually much smarter than that. But as this was loosely based on true events, I researched what really happened. I found that the mere notion that such an embarrassing breach could occur in the Family that it got the Bonannos kicked out of the Five Family ruling hierarchy. Good as there's no cure for stupid.The other thing I learned which made me very happy is that Al Pacino's character did not get whacked, as we were led to believe.The last thing that is yet unresolved is that the family has not found and whacked Donnie Brasco. What he did to the Family cannot be tolerated.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great gangster movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Donnie Brasco"" (1997) is a sure killer gangster movie. It features great performances from all involved, especially as expected by two leads, but supporting actors do a great job as well. It tells a real story, and that is why this movie is so powerful. I won't go into details, but plot here is much more then in other gangster movies because it is real, well most of it. It is impossible to imagine what one might feel when every single minute in his job could have been his last - now that's a job for which successful accomplishment a watch a 500$ paycheck looks like a sucker punch in a face and below to say the least.Overall, ""Donnie Brasco"" is superbly involving and great gangster movie.

A Gangster drama with a heart,"Mike Newell's ""Donnie Brasco"" is what I call a Gangster drama with a heart!This movie is not so much about gangster violence as it is about personal conflicts and inner frustrations of the two lead characters of the story.Based on a true story, ""Donnie Brasco"" is about the real life ""Operation Donnie Brasco"" carried out by the FBI, in which Agent Joseph Pistone went undercover as a Jewel thief expert for infiltrating the Bonanno Crime Family in New York during the late 70s.Johnny Depp stars as Joseph Pistone who goes undercover as Donnie Brasco and befriends Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero (Al Pacino). Lefty is an aging, low-level mob hit-man who is not doing very good on the personal front. He does not seem to be financially well off and has a son who's a drug addict. And as is clear from the film's proceedings, he is an underdog in the family, inspite of having as many as 26 hits in his long mafia history. He seems to have remained where he is, and keeps getting stepped over. In his conversations with Donnie he keeps venting out these grievances and Donnie acts as the good listener.Donnie, on the other hand, has problems of his own, trying to strike a balance between his family life and his demanding job. Anne Heche plays the Mrs. Pistone who is having a difficult time taking care of their three little daughters without their father around. What adds to her woes is the fact that her husband disappears for days together and does not divulge the details of his job to her.From time to time, Donnie keeps providing his FBI fellow-men all the information he can about Lefty and the rest of the crew including Sonny Black (Michael Madsen). The story develops so forth.As a gangster film, ""Donnie Brasco"" does not succeed as well as some other films out there which excel in quality. However, as a character drama centering around the two lead characters, Lefty and Pistone, it certainly delivers.Johnny Depp delivers a knock-out performance as Joseph Pistone. He is simply great! He breathes so much life into the character that you can actually see his gradual transformation into a mobster when he begins to walk and talk like them, as his wife rightly puts in one key scene ""you are becoming like them""! If only he did more meaningful roles like these than all those comic book fantasy characters he plays in those countless Tim Burton films (""Ed Wood"" is an exception, of course!)As for Al Pacino, it is very heartbreaking to see him as a failed gangster for once. This is the man who you've seen in numerous films as the angry, dominating, ruthless gangster who always has things his way. But ""Donnie Brasco"" is quite an exception. Here, he is the loser, who knows he is one and is constantly talking about being stepped over and sidelined all the time by others younger than him. He is tired of getting stuck at the same position inspite of a 30 year old life in the mafia and a commendable number of 'hits' under his belt.Quite a few notable scenes in which Pacino is simply fabulous..one that comes to mind is the scene in which Sonny Black gets promoted or ""upped"" as they call it. Pacino's reaction is so natural and convincing, it instantly makes you empathize with him. Plenty of such moments and episodes in this film prove that Pacino delivers one of his finest acting performances in this film.As for the supporting cast: Quite nice, all of them. Michael Madsen is great, but we are so used to seeing him in gangster roles that it doesn't quite come off as anything different. Anne Heche does a pretty decent job as the frustrated wife of the busy FBI agent.Patrick Doyle's original score is superb and melancholic and suits the mood of the film.Paul Attanasio's screenplay based on Pistone's book ""Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia"" is pretty good, but one can't help but think that it certainly leaves a little to be desired.Mike Newell directs well and pulls off a genre he had never attempted, pretty successfully.""Donnie Brasco"" is a fine film which succeeds more as a character drama than as a gangster flick. Absolutely ""fuh-get about it""! ;)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Disturbing Drama,"I didn't know much about ""Donnie Brasco"" when I watched it, and I really didn't know what to expect.  What I got, however, was an intense, unnerving drama dealing with one's man struggle to cope with two different lives.First of all, the direction of Mike Newell and the cinematography of Peter Sova were breathtaking.  They manage to keep the atmosphere dark, yet with glimpses of light as if to show the hopefulness in even the worst circumstances.  The acting is also incredible, with Johnny Depp even, in my opinion, out-acting Al Pacino.  Also, Patrick Doyle does an excellent job with the score, similar to the direction and cinematography in its tones. The best thing about the movie, though, is the brilliant way in which it shows the effect an undercover job can have on one's family, one's marriage, and even one's friendships.The only complaint I have is against the director that I just recently praised.  The pacing at the beginning of the movie fails to satisfy.  It starts and stops, until finally, after the first 20 or 30 minutes it decides where it's going and follows the right path to near perfection.Final Grade: A.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A surprisingly compelling adaptation of a true story,"I had somewhat high hopes for this movie, but ended up amazed at how scene after scene turned out to be totally engrossing. Johnny Depp was mesmerizing and Al Pacino gave perhaps the most understated performance of his career. I've recently seen Goodfellas, and comparisons are unavoidable; they're both masterpieces but have very different characters. Goodfellas is vintage Scorsese; if there was a film he was born to make, this was it. Donnie Brasco, on the other hand, tells the by-now-familiar story of the tensions felt by the FBI Mafia infiltrator: the fear that his cover will be blown, the sense of abandonment by his family as they cope with his absence, and, most of all, a sense of identification with the group he is trying to send to prison. We've seen this before: Wiseguy (the TV series) played similar tunes (even having a central mobster named Sonny). More recently, The Sopranos tells as part of its sheaf of stories that of a mobster rat. I'm not as crazy about Michael Madsen's performance as other reviewers have been, and Ann Heche as Mrs. Pistone didn't do much for me. But the decidedly unglamorous portrayal of mobster life as lived by Lefty (Pacino's character) was wonderfully nuanced and detailed: his taste in clothes, his character's essential stupidity (cross-played with an almost animal instinct that doesn't always serve him well), and his tragic grief at his son's fate don't have any false notes in them.I could, by now, get sick of Mafia flicks. After awhile, they rely on the same stereotypes of no trust, sudden violence, borderline or downright psychopathic personalities, and power games. But the performances and constant state of tension in this one made it very rewarding.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Donnie Brasco: A true FBI story,"When a book is being adapted on the big screen, or the little screen, the director does his or her own version onto the screen. The Donnie Brasco film is somewhat 97% Hollywood and only 3% of the book. Although no film adapted from a book is 100% of the book since it often has a lot of information. But the information in this one is mixed and not always the truth. So when people see a film based on a true story, they think everything that happened in the film was real. That's why I think it's always better to read the book first before seeing the movie.Besides all this, the film had a heart to it and a good motive. Though not as accurate as Goodfellas, it portrayed in an effective way the ways of the Mafia. The acting by Al Pacino, Johnny Depp and Michael Madsen was VERY good. I also liked the relationship between Lefty (Pacino)and Donnie (Depp). It had also despite the differences, the same feel as the book; Dangerous conversations, situations and relationships - that all lead to the collision of the mob.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Movie with even better Performances,"This is in my opinion one of the most under-rated movies of all time. It's certainly up there with the best 'ganster/mafia' films.Some may say that it strays too much away from the 'real life' story it was based on, but I look at it as a stand alone movie and judge it as a movie in it's own right - and it is one of my favourites as a result.***********Minor spoilers below*********************** Johnny Depp is great as 'Donnie', and Pacino is also great as the pathetic 'Lefty'. The real beauty of this movie is the relationship between these 2 characters, some great chemistry between Pacino and Depp produces some very believable and poignant moments in the movie.I felt a great deal of sympathy for 'Lefty' as he sees his protégé overtake him and his ambitions within the mafia ranks, and also for 'Donnie' who sees his under-cover alter-ego strangle his 'real world' family self....you can feel the stress him and his family are under.This movie does not glamorise the underworld (ala Goodfellas), it concentrates more on the mafia 'low-lifes' - as a result feels so much more Real to me.*************spoilers end******************************** Worth watching if you want to see a slightly different take on the mafia, and for the performances of Depp and Pacino.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mob Movie with Human Drama,"As a fan of this film I recently read the book, I was surprised out how inaccurate the movie adaptation was, but it didn't bother me as I felt (and still feel) that this was one of the best mob movies the 90s had to offer.Mob movie it may be, but at the root of it is real human drama. The sacrifices made by Joe Pistone, his dedication to his job and his courage, in light of what it was doing to his family, what it could do to him. But it is the relationship between Joe (alias Donnie Brasco) and his Mafia counterpart, Lefty that really drive the story. It certainly does help that they are played by two of the greatest actors of their respective generations.Al Pacino delivers one of his best performances in years, as the likable, quirky gangster Lefty. A character as ruthless as some of his other gangster parts (Tony Montana, Michael Corleone), but surrounded with real warmth and a slight air of tragedy (not too dissimilar from Carlito Brigante).Depp is also on top form. He subsequently delivered very accurate performances of real-lifers Hunter S. Thompson / Raoul Duke and George Jung, right down to their most subtle mannerisms. I can only assume the same level of authenticity, bearing in mind the amount of time he spent with the real Pistone. Either way it's a solid performance, and he delivers the difficult part of a double-life convincingly.The supporting cast all do their job well with Bruno ""Young Clemenza"" Kirby as the Joe Pesci-alike (in name, too) Nicky Santora, and Anne Heche turning in a solid performance as the troubled housewife. Michael Madsen in a tailor-made likable tough guy role: an offer you can't refuse. Unfortunately these characters aren't developed nearly as well as they are in the book, with more emphasis on the Donnie and Lefty relationship. However with its slick pace, I find this a minor critique.There are parts from the book that would've worked really well in the movie, but I am very happy with what we've got. A well-executed, entertaining, interesting and heart-felt adaptation which, executes the principles of the true story excellently, even without the chronology. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Am I Brasco Or Pistone,"Newell helms one of the best crime dramas based on true events in recent memory. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast deliver superlative performances. Depp and Pacino in particular are superb and command the screen. The plot revolves around undercover FBI Agent Joe Pistone who infiltrates one of the major New York mafia families. He lives life as Donnie Brasco. While undercover Brasco develops a relationship with mafia hit man ""Lefty"" Ruggiero in order to get deeper within the organization. Soon enough Brasco and Lefty develop a real life friendship. This ultimately puts Brasco in a life and death choice between doing his job or honoring his friendship. The plot is gritty, intense, violent, captivating, insightful, duplicitous and has a cathartic ending. This film is outstanding in scrutinizing the lines that get blurred between friendship and justice when a human being is forced to live two separate identities. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. My favorite scene is when Lefty is telling his wife he is heading out To meet someone and he leaves all his jewelry behind. To this day you'll hear fans quote lines such as, ""I never said you were a rat. You's my best friend"". This is a a timeless classic and one of the very best in it's genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
the most likable gangster ever.,"It is important to remember that in probably every gangster film, from the Public Enemy to Goodfellas, the anti- heroes are hugely likable characters who we easily gain empathy more. Al Pacino as Lefty is so convincing as an ignored foot soldier and world weary gangster, it is easy to see why joe/donnie likes him so much.  It continually amazes me that in the 90's, Pacino just by the gestures,postures, and voices he employed in his characterisations seemed to jump between ages. As frank slade he seemed like a washed up blind man, who to get out bed was a strain, whilst in the same year, as Carlito he seemed twenty years younger.Donnie Brasco is another fine example of this. At times he seems as old as your grandad but always somehow manages to mix menace with pathos and humour. Donnie Brasco- the last great gangster movie.It not as magnificent as the godfather or as epic as Casino, but in it's portrayal of the insidous nature of the 'life'on even straight shooters like Depp it is unrivaled. Definitely an 8.5",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Pacino Should Have Been Nominated,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Donnie (1997)I can not fault anything in this movie. It's just short of perfect for me!! I revisit this at least once a year, sometimes more. It has it all, a great soundtrack scenes with the tension racked up to the maximum, violence and moments of unexpected humour.The acting here is superb. You expect it from Pacino who is on familiar ground. But Depp absolutely nails it in this movie. He was always great back then, and here is no exception. Michael Madsen does not disappoint and neither does Bruno Kirby, James Russo or Anne Heche.If Donnie Brasco belongs to any actor, though, it's Al Pacino. Long before he was a loud, screaming caricature of himself Pacino was in top form here, and should have been nominated for an Oscar!! His final scene is all the more heartbreaking for the feeling he brings it. It's an exit that does justice to both the actor and the role. I think it's some of Pacino's best acting and it is without dialogue.This was the highest crowd I had seen at a Johnny Depp movie at the time. and it was still only half full.Donnie Brasco was the first Depp movie since Benny & Joon in 1993 (6 movies in 4 years) to make back its budget at the domestic box office. As it grossed $41 million at the domestic box office to end the year the 54th highest grossing movie of the year and become Depp's third-biggest grosser.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
AWESOME,That is the only way to describe it. I loved this movie. It shows an interesting take on undercover agent Joe Pistone a.k.a Donnie Brasco. Not only does it show how he progresses in the mafia it shows his personal life as it deteriarates.

"Another mafia movie? Yes, and a whole lot more.","Another mafia movie? Yes, and a whole lot more. Directed by Mike Newell and based on the real life account of FBI agent Joseph Pistone, Donnie Brasco is able to transcend it's crime drama label by examining the age old battle between good and evil from a different angle. The outcome is pretty blurry.Johnny Depp plays Joe Pistone aliased ""Donnie Brasco"" who is infiltrating the 1970's New York City mafia. His main vessel into the goings-on of the mob is Benny Ruggiero a.k.a ""Lefty"", an unindemnified aging mafia underling played by Al Pacino. Pistone must earn the trust of Ruggiero in order to gain entry into the group and eventually incriminate him and his mob superiors. However, this proves more difficult as the goals of Donnie Brasco blur when Ruggiero's character emerges as a good but tragically flawed man, victimized by his own simplicity and plagued by a history that determines his future. Pistone understands that the consequence of his disclosure of evidence and unveiling of identity will result in Ruggiero, Pistone's voucher, being ""sent for"", mafia speak for a meeting where the invited is killed. Pistone develops a deep heartache for his friend making his job all the more harder. Meanwhile changes in the crime family ranks result in unforeseen circumstances. As Pistone's undercover duties grow more complicated, real life family demands remain, testing his marriage. But underlying throughout the film is his growing guilt over the hit that would be placed on Ruggiero when ""Donnie Brasco"" is revealed to the mob as Special Agent Joe Pistone.Rarely do you find a film with so many layers beautifully acted by all, supporting cast included. The dialogue between Pacino and Depp is unforgettable with a full range of humor and drama that will have you remembering entire conversations word for word. The overall production is unintentional, appropriately realistic and inventively devoid of over-stylized techniques making it a true original. Unfortunately, Donnie Brasco is often overlooked when we think of the great mafia inspired crime-dramas. The only reason I can find for this unfair exclusion is that this film appropriately bleeds realism, not romanticism. For this reason I think some viewers are left with a sour taste in their mouths having had the all powerful image of the American mobster examined under a more critical microscope. Donnie Brasco goes beyond stereotypes to reveal men in their totality and in doing so finds it's own unique place in the mafia film genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A good film to watch when bored,"I watched this somewhere in lock down and I must say it was a suspenseful and captivating watch. Although at some parts I found I could predict minor events, the movie overall was a fantastic watch. Speaking from bias, having one of the main characters played by Johnny Depp increased my rating. He is an amazing actor and has contributed to this movie's overall greatness. I enjoyed the subtle twists here and there, and I also enjoyed the overall plot. The movie definitely would go into my 'mafia' category and is a great cinematic version of the 'gangster life' scenario. This is a good film to reference if you are a writer looking for a semi-realistic slice into the drug world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Mafia story,"The following review is an extract from the book ""Mafia films - a guide"", which is now available on Amazon. This book is very interesting not only for gangster movie lovers, but also for people who like to read about real Mafia history and facts, as the real events in which some of the movies are based are also analyzed.""The film is based on real events, and tells the story of FBI agent Joseph Pistone; the first to infiltrate one of the five powerful Mafia families in New York. In the late 1970s, as he tells in his autobiographical book, Pistone was given the mission of breaking into the city's Mafia circles (...) . Pistone, of Italian background, was familiar with the lifestyle of the mafiosi who controlled the New York underworld. He too was a tough guy who spoke and moved like them, who knew very well their mentality and their way of doing things. That's why his superiors thought he would be the ideal agent for such a job, an infiltration task that aimed to hit the Mafia from the inside with a forcefulness never seen before.(...) Big would also be Pistone's conflicts with his wife Maggie. She and her daughters could hardly be seen by the agent during the time of the infiltration, for obvious security reasons. Over the months, Maggie would notice a change in her husband's personality; who, in her opinion, was playing the role of a mafioso ""too"" well...All this can be seen in the film, which is quite true to the real story - as Pistone himself has admitted. The former undercover agent, now in the witness protection program, worked as a consultant during the making of the film.""Donnie Brasco"" came to theaters in 1997, almost 20 years after the events shown in the film. The truth is that already in 1991 there was a project to bring Pistone's infiltration of the Bonanno family to the big screen, but it was postponed - especially because shortly before, in 1990, Martin Scorsese's famous and successful ""Goodfellas"", another film about the Mafia based also on real events, had come out. In the 1991 ""Donnie Brasco"", it was not Johnny Depp but Tom Cruise who was to play the main character; but Al Pacino was already the actor who would play Lefty Ruggiero.Al Pacino plays a brilliant role playing the haggard and frustrated gangster. He constantly feels displaced within the family. He, who has always ""worked hard"" for the clan, considers it unfair that it is always others who rise in the hierarchy. This can be seen very well in the sequence of the yacht, when Lefty goes very excited towards the Florida Mafia boss to greet him, but this one ignores him and only wants to know where ""Sonny Black"" is.While most of what we see in the film happened in real life, screenwriter Paul Attanasio and director Mike Newell took some artistic license by slightly changing some aspects of the story. For example, the Japanese restaurant scene is completely invented. On the other hand, the film suggests that the closest gangster to Pistone/Brasco (Johnny Depp) within the Mafia was Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), when in fact the agent's closest contacts were with Sonny Black (Michael Madsen). Tony Mirra, who introduced Pistone to the Bonanno family, doesn't appear at all in the whole film - and that's a pity, because his volatile and psychopathic character (very well described in the book) could have make the movie even greater: Joe Pesci would have been the perfect candidate to play him.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great gangster/crime drama,"When I heard about the main actors in this film, I was already sure that it had to be good; with names like Al Pacino and Michael Madsen, you can't go totally wrong. Johnny Depp is also pretty good, in some films, this definitely being one of them. I have to admit, not having seen too many good gangster films, I was very excited to see this, considering the great names in the cast, and the promising commercials I saw for it. It was really a great movie; the whole atmosphere of the gangster world, organized crime, was perfectly captured in the movie. The ""wiseguys"" acted, talked and moved like gangsters. The plot is very interesting and captivating, and it moves along at a great pace, considering the length of the movie. It keeps your interest for the duration of the film, as it develops almost constantly. The actors all do terrific jobs, especially the three main actors. The characters are well-written and their actions are entirely credible. The cinematography is pretty good, especially when depicting violence, as it really has the effect on you that the director obviously wanted it to. All in all, a great movie about the mob and the whole environment, but it could have been slightly better. You know too little of the gangsters' intentions and motivations, which makes it too difficult to relate to anyone else than Johnny Depp's character, and his wife's character. I recommend this to anyone who's interested in the environment of the world of organized crime, who likes dramas. I also recommend it to any fans of Depp, Pacino or Madsen. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Great addition to mob film catalog,"Based on real people and events, Donnie Brasco covers territory that I've not seen covered in other mob films. It examines the price that gets paid by those working undercover as well as their families. While unflinching in portraying the brutality of the mob, the film weaves a thread of sympathy into the fabric of mafia life and suggests that what motivates mobsters isn't always money, power or savage instinct. As much as possible, Donnie Brasco humanizes its mafia subjects without excusing their brutal acts and reveals the fundamental trap of gang life.Pacino and Depp are truly masterful in their performances. I watched the film once again last night, and it's just a pleasure to watch them work. I can't imagine any other pair of actors approaching the verity they bring to the screen. I highly recommend Donnie Brasco.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
donnie brasco,"Good Mafia pic that is lifted into the realm of near greatness every time Al Pacino is onscreen, which is no surprise, since Pacino is a great actor and great actors tend to elevate the films they're in. His performance as Lefty is one of the best studies of thwarted ambition and smoldering resentment that you will see in a movie. With his schlumpy, defeated body language and sad, weary, angry tones Pacino gives us a study of mid life failure that is so moving that we tend to forget that Lefty is a violent sociopath and instead sympathize with him as a guy who has frittered his life away by playing second, no make that third, banana to more dynamic figures. Indeed, that is what makes the scene where he empties his pockets into a drawer before going to his death so devastating, namely that you can see how little his life has amounted to. Just a wallet, set of keys, ironic cross and handkerchief.If I have exalted Pacino above the rest of the cast it is not because the rest are mediocre or bad. Indeed, there is not a poor performance in the bunch, for which versatile director Mike Newell, adept at both action and character driven drama, should take credit. Especially fine are Michael Madsen as yet another hothead named Sonny and Bruno Kirby as his none too bright sidekick. As for Johnny Depp, he is solid as the title character but in his scenes with Pacino, by far the best in the film, it's not Depp who leads. And in the scenes where Depp does lead, like the ones that chronicle his marital and family problems, I found myself waiting, impatiently, for Lefty. B plus.PS...Good early Paul Giamatti turn as an FBI tech guy with an interest in Mafia semantics.PSS...Good screenplay by ""Homicide"" scenarist Paul Attanasio.

"If you know your Godfathers and Goodfellas, you'll like this.","If you are genned up on your Godafathers and Goodfellas, you'll feel on familiar territory with Mike Newell's 'Donnie Brasco'. Based on true events, and indeed the book of Joseph Pistone, our lead character, the film is a very good gangster story that not only examines the life of a 'wiseguy' but also explores the futility and once again, the ultimate destruction and downfall that seems to befall everyone who signs up to the life. Al Pacino is truly great as 'Lefty', so much so, that it's hard not to feel compassion for his character, before remembering, 'this guy is a murderous sociopath'. Johnny Depp is good as Pistone, and there are moments of real tension between the two main characters. Ultimately, this film is about betrayal, friendship and what really matters in life.

"Long, complex and truly fascinating; most things that could go right, do go right.","The film Donnie Brasco turned out to be so much more than I expected it to be. I assumed it would be some sort of gangster, mafia, 'Goodfellas' type film that had a reasonably light atmosphere and that had two good lead actors (Depp and Pacino) delivering a witty script in an amusing manner. In a way I was incorrect to assume this as even though it started off as what I expected it to be, it then slowly and fascinatingly turned into a more complex, emotionally driven character relations story within a gang of criminals. What also surprised me was that this was based on a true story.The film actually started out like I thought it would; it being reasonably light hearted early on with groups of men sitting around in a man's world laughing and joking over nothing in particular as well as containing upbeat music from the era that even I had heard before. This was counteracted with the two lead characters of 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Pacino) and Donnie Brasco himself (Depp) (who is attempting to go undercover and infiltrate this small gang of mafia hoodlums) merely standing around; talking and acting 'hard' for the opening thirty minutes or so attempting to prove a point over one another that they're the dominant character. Interestingly, Brasco stamps his authority in the relationship by, in fact, beating up one of Lefty's accomplices whom owes him money  from then on in, every thing's fine between the two.What's also interesting about the two characters is their respective situations. Both men are struggling with their domestic situations and consequently, their lives are falling away from them slightly. Brasco's job is starting to conflict with his secret domestic life and Lefty's role within the gang slips away from him slowly but surely as the film wares respectively on.What Donnie Brasco actually consists of is a two and a half hour marathon of fantastic character build up through dialogue and interaction as each gang member dips in and out of the two leads' lives. Trust, respect and interaction playing a big part in a lot of it and this is extremely well put through thanks to a memorable scene in the foyer of a Japanese sushi restaurant. The constant fact we know the truth about Brasco and his links to the authorities plays a major part in actual suspense that builds up on certain occasions; be it the said restaurant scene or whenever Brasco seems to be on the phone for too long.Although some scenes do seem like they drag on a little aimlessly and may lack the punch, atmosphere and actual content; other scenes come along at pleasingly paced times and it's these that definitely have the spark required for true edge of the seat viewing. With a good cast, good soundtrack, wonderful story, a truly fantastic character study as well as an ending that left me as empty as it did fulfilled, Donnie Brasco's story is one that everyone should sit through.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
True story is a blessing and a curse,"There have been a lot of great gangster movies over the years. It's probably not far from being the most consistent of all the sub-genres. I'd always meant to get around to seeing 'Donnie Brasco' and I finally did. It's a pretty solid film.This being a true story is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it's very cool that this actually happened and when you're watching it that fact adds another layer to the film. On the other hand, it being a true story sort of hampers the film-making process a little. It feels safer than other gangster movies I've seen, because they're trying not to stomp all over the actual events. And that's a shame because with a few alterations to the ending of this story it could've been something truly special.The best thing about this movie though is just seeing two actors at the top of their game going at it. How there were no Oscar nominations is beyond me. This was a good one. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"A good, meaningful film about the mafia in the 1970s","While the early to mid 90's had a slew of mafia films, 'Donnie Brasco' stands out. With its rich screenplay and strong performances, 'Donnie Brasco' is a good film that ultimately is more about the friendship between two people rather than the mafia.Joseph D. Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an excellent FBI agent who goes undercover in the 1970s New York mob as diamond salesman Donnie Brasco. His lead man is Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), an aging and somewhat of a lowlife gangster who sees his chance for redemption in ""Donnie"". Pistone's wife, Maggie (Ann Heche) doesn't know much about her husband's career and soon their marriage begins to get rocky as he spends more and more time undercover, eventually seemingly one of the mafia's own. Also playing a central role in the story is Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), an up and coming gangster who seems to be getting more respect than Lefty. As the plot develops, Pistone loses himself in the role of Brasco and forms a true bond with Lefty. To his knowledge, and to the knowledge of his fellow mafia members Donnie is a trustworthy gentleman, and the friendship between Lefty and Donnie only increases. Lefty is clearly a degenerate, he constantly mumbles and complains about the poor treatment he gets from mafia chieftain Sonny Red (Robert Maino), and also is constantly asking people for money. He forms a true friendship with Donnie as he tries to gain some altitude back, and as he sees Black getting higher and higher than he does. Soon, the situation begins to escalate as the FBI begins to close in on Pistone's case, and Pistone must make a difficult decision about Lefty who he has formed the true bond with.Paul Attanasiano (Quiz Kids) based his screenplay on the novel of the same name by the real life Pistone and Richard Wooley. While the novel is a clear autobiography of sorts, the film has no narration. Instead the narrative is made clear by Attanasiano's script as he blends the life of Pistone and of Brasco, two separate characters who eventually become one. His screenplay is dynamite. Many mafia films showcase tough guy dialog, but in the instance of 'Donnie Brasco' this dialog serves a higher purpose. The conversations and the actions between Lefty and Donnie form a true relationship, despite their opposite professions. There are also some magnetic scenes of drama and brutal violence, especially at a Japanese bar when Donnie doesn't want to take his shoe off. While some background characters may seem like the typical mafia lowlifes, the simple characterization of Lefty and Donnie is pure magic. Mike Newell, who's previous list of credits include the comedy 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' brings appropriate direction to the film. This film is not necessarily about the mafia at a certain time like 'Goodfellas' or 'The Godfather' is, but rather more of a relationship film, showing the way two men come together despite their circumstances. Also very worthy of mention is talented composer Patrick Doyle's musical score, which adds to the emotional effect of many scenes. The performances by Pacino and Depp, as usual, are fantastic. Pacino is given a real chance to shine as the aging Lefty, a man unlike his charismatic character in 'The Godfather' series. Depp once again displays his ability to simply submerge himself completely in a role, and as an added bonus the character acts, adding on layers.'Donnie Brasco' is a good film. The fresh screenplay, strong acting, and sharp direction makes it very worthy of mention. While it at times gets too slow, or the story sometimes loses focus, it still is a very worthy film of watching.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Solid Maffia Movie!,"Finally, after 10 years, I watched Donnie Brasco. And that was the kind of experiment where you ask yourself ""shit! How can it be that I didn't heard of this movie before??"" To resume, Donnie Brasco tells the (true!)story of a special FBI agent, Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), who infiltrated the New York Maffia at the end of the 70s. He becomes friends with Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), who let him slip into wheels of the organization around Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), lately with the rank of chief of Brooklyn. Ruggiero and Pistone (under the name of Donnie Brasco) become close whereas the group leaves to collect money for the boss. During all this time, Pistone collects evidences, photographs and audio tapes. But his investigation becomes more than that, whereas it also put in danger his marriage, his family life, his safety and his own life. As he makes his place in the Maffia group, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to freely communicate with the outside world, until he even has to cut its bond with the FBI during weeks whereas the Maffia suspect a rat in the organization. But the true dilemma to Pistone is that if he leaves his character and the Maffia, Ruggiero will be punished for letting Pistone coming in and helping him to integrate the organization One of the best Maffia movies I saw, Donnie Brasco was in nomination for the Best screenplay Oscar in 1998. Also, one of the best Al Pacino performances. And, according to the ""making of"" featurette included on the DVD, Johnny Depp really discussed with Joe Pistone and tempted to imitate not only his actions, but also his attitude, his step, his way of expressing himself and his nonchalance. Michael Madsen is also really brilliant in the role of Sonny Black. All the gangster activities are fascinating and we really want to know how they will find the rat.Really excellent, very good suspense, brilliant performances by the actors It is just really strong!

Pacino a true chameleon,"Al Pacino is probably one of the best actors ever.  In movies like Donnie Brasco, Scarface, Godfather Trilogy, etc. he doesn't seem all that much the same.  In Scarface he is totally believable as a Cuban, just the same as an Italian-American in The Godfather movies, and a middle level gangster in Brasco.  In most of his movies he is the star but that doesn't change the fact that he is first and foremost a character actor instead of a movie star who just basically plays himself every single movie.  Plus movie stars are afraid of taking roles where they end up being a bad guy, scared of being disliked by the fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Top echelon gangster movie,"Based on the true life of one Joe Pistone, played in this movie by Johnny Depp, an FBI agent who infiltrated two New York mafia families in the 70s, pioneering the whole concept of deep undercover work for modern law enforcement.It's also a genuinely good gangster film. It shares similarities with Goodfellas in depicting the lure of gangster life. FBI had long resisted placing agents undercover for prolonged periods of time because they feared they would become corrupted. And that's at the center in this film. Pistone, or Donnie Brasco, which is his assumed name, has to constantly struggle with maintaining his identity, his values, when every day he is surrounded by these men of wealth, power and charisma, all telling him that he's a great guy and that if he just sticks to his guns, one day he will be made.Also a beautifully acted film. One of Depp's best performances, no doubt, but the true star of the film has to be Al Pacino as Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero, who becomes sort of a mentor figure for Pistone and also the one to pull him deeper under. Truly, this part couldn't be played by anyone else. When Pacino talks about gangster life, about gangster values, you buy it. You don't even hesitate. And that's what makes this film work.Donnie Brasco is not quite The Godfathers or Goodfellas - although it's the next best thing - but if you've ever wanted to see a gangster story told at least partially from the point of view of the police, this right here is your ticket.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An excellent existential work that is well worth the time.,"One of Pacino's finest performances and one of the best of the mobster genre.

This is no small matter to the adult viewer who reflects on it.  But please, do not read the book first because your experience will likely suffer.  The film must be viewed in its own light, independent of the book, because they are truly different stories with different purposes. Highly recommended for adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"You know what we do when we find that rat, right, Lefty?","Joe Pistone is an undercover FBI agent assigned to infiltrate the mob as Donnie Brasco. Making friends with Lefty Ruggiero, both men soon strike up a warm father and son like relationship. A relationship that as longs as it runs for, is likely to get them, or someone they love, killed.Directed by Mike Newell and starring Johnny Depp {Brasco} and Al Pacino {Lefty}, Donnie Brasco is adapted from the true story novel written by Pistone himself called My Undercover Life In The Mafia. Choosing not to go the operatic Scorsese way with a Mafia topic, Newell instead goes for a sort of grim realism, something that in an oxymoron way makes this one of the freshest ""Gangster"" pictures of the modern era.Tho this is very much an actors piece {both Depp and Pacino deliver royally good and complimentary performances}, the credit to Brasco's quality should probably go to Paul Attanasio and his screenplay. Choosing to make it a tight character study over violent bravado histrionics, Attanasio's adaption could never stand charge of glamorising the thugs. Sure there's violence, and the usual array of wise-guy nastiness dots its way throughout the piece. But it's the central relationship between Donnie and Lefty, that coupled with the strain evident on Pistone's home life, that keeps the film afloat.Of course there is the obvious problem of knowing that our intrepid undercover agent could pull out at any time, so in that where does Newell and Attanasio gain their tension and sense of danger from? We know Pistone lives, he wrote the book and told the tale, so with a slight trick of the hand, the makers make us wonder who else is going to be in the pain zone here. And this includes Lefty since his bond {and vouching for} with Brasco is tender, perhaps even sad? Thus lifting him away from your stereotypical movie gangster. Perhaps Pistone's family will suffer? The marriage is crumbling as Donnie goes deeper, is there a sting in the tail coming there? And on it goes, we may just be following these two guys on their path to reckoning {the film does suffer when they are not together on screen}, but the tension and wondering is palpable in the extreme.With a fine supporting cast of Michael Madsen, James Russo, Brunno Kirby and the badly formed Anne Heche, the film is served well in the acting department. But you can forget about any sort of exhilaration here, this is a cold tale told with skill and acted accordingly. Hmm, I wonder what Marty made of it? 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
DONNIE BRASCO holds up in the post-Sopranos world.,"What was most striking re-watching DONNIE BRASCO at the end of the '00's, is how ahead of the Sopranos curve it was, particularly in terms of depicting the degrading day-to-day of a mobster. Sure, we've spent the better part of this decade watching Paulie Walnuts and Christopher Moltisanti struggle with the banal/evil duties of the family soldier, but Pacino's Lefty is avant garde of the whole Satriale's gang.Two years before Tony took his crown, British director Newell came at the central issues of Los Sopranos – duty, alienation, and betrayal – with a calculated remove that an American shooter weaned on Scorsese and Coppola might not have been able to pull off. Witness a scene in which a very young-looking Paul Giamatti, playing an FBI surveillance technician, prods ""Donnie"" on the definitions of ""fuggedaboutit"" (a term that found new life as a t-shirt slogan during the Sopranos' heyday.) Newell, an outsider himself – and a bit of a chameleon, as established filmmakers go – succeeded in making a film that remains fascinating twelve years on, because it asks questions of Mafia culture, rather than revel in, or glorify it.READ THE REST OF MY REVIEW (AND MORE) AT STEVENSPIELBLOG.COM ...-Greg",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A Meaningful Mobster Thriller,"""Donnie Brasco"" is the true story of an FBI agent(Johnny Depp) whose job is to gradually infiltrate a lower, yet still quite dangerous, rung of the New York City mob in the 70s.  Masquerading around as ""Donnie Brasco, the Jeweler"", he gets the attention of Lefty(Al Pacino), a veteran mobster who knows he'll never get ahead in the mob again, and subconsciously wants to mentor a mob foreigner to bring purpose back into his life.  Lefty is enamored with Donnie, and isn't afraid to ""vouch"" for him to bring Donnie into his circle of the mob.  Soon Donnie becomes like another son to Lefty, and gradually gets to know his friends, including the ambitious Sonny Black(Michael Madsden).  Unfortunately his time on the job doesn't leave much for his wife Maggie(Ann Heche), who is tired of never having a husband around to support raising three children.  Furthermore, as he spends more and more time with Lefty's gang, Donnie proportionally loses his old identity and actually becomes ""Donnie Brasco"".  Saying more about the film would be time-consuming and wrong, since I only feel like I should give the basic meat of this very intriguing story and let anyone who hasn't seen it experience it for itself.The acting in this film is of the highest caliber.  Al Pacino, of course, gives an unbelievable performance as Lefty, able to elicit a lot of sympathy and empathy from the viewer despite the viewer's knowledge of his ""26 hits"". It's clear that if his Lefty wasn't in the mob, he'd be your very admirable old next door neighbor, telling you stories and capturing your attention. From what I have read of reviews, people seem to be downplaying Johnny Depp's acting abilities.  I thought he did an amazing job, as the transformation from his real identity Joe to the cool Donnie Brasco is very visible and intriguing.  We know that he finds a lot more truth and meaning in the hectic and real mob life than in the impersonal bureaucratic FBI. When he says to his wife late in the film ""I can't breathe anymore"", we know exactly what he means: Joe is almost faded away, and Donnie the Quintessential Gangster's lifestyle is his own.  Also not to be written off is Micheal Madsden, who also did a tremendous job in Reservoir Dogs.  Hey Micheal, why'd you waste your time with Free Willy and not take Quentin Tarantino up on his offer to play THE Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction???A lot of people have written that this film forces a 70s vibe, but I don't think so at all.  Maybe I was too busy noticing Lefty's defeatist stare when he sees buddy Sonny shaking hands with ""The Boss"" he so wanted to please- scenes like that made the film for me, and they're sprinkled throughout to create a very well-done picture.  It does have some flaws, however.  The family scenes could have been a lot better done, and I have the feeling that a lot more about the mob could have been explained.  Oh well, I can't even express how much value I got out of this film, as I got it for free from the library.  Please take the time to watch it- it's an excellent glimpse of the life I think we all sometimes desire to live, and also an exploration of the great loving relationship of Lefty and Donnie.Rating: Highly Recommended, 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Forget about it.,"Well I have looked up on some of the documentaries on Joseph Pistone aka. Donnie Brasco to see if it's interesting to know what happened in real life in the book of Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia. The actual film itself is loosely based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone aka. Donnie Brasco played by the famous Johnny Depp himself. Donnie Brasco revealed to be Joseph D. Pistone who is an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated the Mafia Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s. He befriends with Lefty Ruggiero played by Al Pacino who vouches for him. He gave him his trust and loved him like a son but he doesn't know his real identity. Al Pacino and Johnny Depp have good chemistry together and they both played good characters along with the other casts like Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, and Anne Heche. The line ""Forget about it"" is a line that has been said multiple times and I don't know how many times they're been saying that. If I don't know how many times they said ""Forget about it"" just ""Forget about it"". So out of all the gangster films out there, this one is one of the deeper ones (if not the most deeper film).

Gripping,"This movie is entertaining from beginning to end in the description of life in the Mafia, and the risks FBI agent Joe Pistone (Depp) faced to infiltrate. This great story of friendship is solid in every aspect.  The direction is superb, the script is great and the acting is great by all.Al Pacino is great as usual as Lefty Ruggiero, and Michael Madsen and Bruno Kirby are entertaining to watch as well, but I think it is Johnny Depp who surprisingly out does them all.  His performance is outstanding which is especially great considering he was acting with one of the all time greats in Pacino.  Depp was totally believable and he was able to display a lot of emotion just in facial expressions.A great movie.  9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"An Excellent, More Small-Scale Mob Drama","A smaller-scale, more intimate story than many mob-related films, this is a film of grace notes, subtlety and nuanced observation. There's much here about eyes - characters often seem to be introduced by close-ups on the eyes, and throughout it's a film that has us question how we see ourselves and others, which for the two characters at the heart of the drama is the snare that captures them both in very different ways. The cast is good throughout - special mention for the excellent Anne Heche as the wife of Johnny Depp's undercover cop, a role that's more fleshed out than many equivalents in other films, and a result really allows her to shine. If the film's subtlety is its strength it may also be its flaw - the emotional impact of the last 30 minutes or so is dampened without the more operatic tenor of many mafia stories.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
not a Johnny Bravo movie. my mistake.,"As a fan of the animated series ""Johnny Bravo,"" I was excited to watch ""Donnie Brasco,"" thinking it was a live-action adaptation of the cartoon. However, I soon realized that this was not the case.""Donnie Brasco"" is a crime drama film that tells the story of an undercover FBI agent, Joe Pistone (played by Johnny Depp), who infiltrates the Mafia and becomes close with one of its members, Lefty Ruggiero (played by Al Pacino).Although the movie wasn't what I was expecting, I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed with the acting performances. Depp and Pacino were both incredible in their roles, and I found myself engrossed in their characters' struggles.The film also had a great sense of tension and danger, as Pistone had to constantly balance his loyalty to the FBI with his growing relationship with the Mafia. The climax was particularly intense and kept me on the edge of my seat.Overall, while I was disappointed that ""Donnie Brasco"" was not a live-action version of ""Johnny Bravo,"" I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The performances were outstanding, and the story was both gripping and emotional. If you're a fan of crime dramas, I highly recommend giving this one a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Johnny Depp Steals The Show!!,"When you have two seasoned actors who have given legendary performances over the course of their careers, you are guaranteed to have a stellar movie. In Donnie Brasco, we have Johnny Depp and Al Pacino in the leading roles that is based on the real-life Johnny Pistone, an undercover FBI agent who infiltrates the mafia in order to gain evidence that lead to their arrests.It is a typical mafia movie that is inspired by Goodfellas. We get to see the human side of these horrible people. Johnny Depp is unbelievably good as he is laconic yet assertive and someone who always has the sense of control. A truly mesmerizing performance that must be one of the best seen in modern cinema. Al Pacino plays a real life gangster Lefty. Pacino plays his role with his usual flair and propensity to scream.The story is quite fulfilling and shows the effects that a person leading a double life has. It does not intend to show Johnny Pistone as a hero but as a regular person who is devoted to his job.Donnie Brasco is a must-watch due to its chillingly realistic depiction of the ruthless mafia.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Interesting movie that should have been longer,"What I remember most from this film (well, I saw it just yesterday, but...) is the superb performance from Al Pacino as Lefty. And Johnny Depp was also great.The film itself is a very interesting and well-made ""gangster"" movie, based upon a true story. It is engrossing and I wanted it to be perhaps a half hour longer -- it had a storyline that was so interesting that it could easily have been longer without me getting bored. Usually, I think the movies should be a half hour shorter. So, really good and well-made film by director Mike Newell.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A strong character movie,"I went into this movie being a tad sceptical- primarily about Depp and Pacino's chemistry. It was already Pacino's post-prime era and I've always had some concern about Depp's performances in serious movies. However, i was gladly surprised because, let's be straightforward, this movie had me absolutely on the edge of my seat. One of the best mafia movies of the 90's (and there many of them), and one that is based on a true story. A really amazing story, one that deserved to be retold on the big screen. To begin with, cinematography is quite good and enjoying to watch. Mike Newell shows he deserves much more respect in Hollywood. The movie never gets boring. 70's atmosphere is recreated perfectly, cars, dressing, music, setup, it launches you back to that era with ease.Being based on a true story, the movie portrays mob life very precisely, unlike some other flicks we've seen over the years. The entire hierarchy, gangster life, their behaviour, simplicity of their conversations, the ""being made"" thing, it's both interesting and serious at the same time. One of the best things is that the movie shows how dangerous Joseph Pistone's task was. The movie had to be realistic in every aspect, and you will see, near the end, (no spoiler) how much gore and violence there is. Nothing is avoided, chopped heads, rivers of blood, everything is there. That goes to show how serious the movie is, despite being easy and comedic at moments (especially the Florida part). The performances are outstanding. Pacino- lovable gangster. You can identify with his character very much. He plays him in a very specific way, and brings out just the right emotions in the viewer. But, nothing less is expected from the legend. Depp- awesome. I don't know much about the real Joseph Pistone, but i'm sure i don't need to because this is one of Johnny's best performances. Michael Madsen is perfectly cast, too. However, i have a complaint about Anne Heche- while i have nothing against her acting skills in particular, i think she is wrongfully cast. Her chemistry with Depp could have been better. Another little thing that bothers me is the ending, which somewhat deviates from the real story and has left me a bit confused. However, that is nothing to harm this amazing movie which i will definitely be watching again. A real gem that deserves more recognition. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Depp and Pacino have great chemistry in their screen relationship,"It's a gangster film set in the late 1970s and early 1980s in New York City and Miami, Florida. It follows the relationship between an undercover FBI agent and a lower-level Mafia hitman.Joe Pistone/Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp) is the undercover FBI agent who poses as someone who handles stolen jewelry. He gets to know an aging, lower-level Mafia ""spoke in a wheel"" hitman known as Lefty (Al Pacino). Joe's wife, Maggie (Anne Heche), tries to hold her family together, which includes three young daughters, despite Joe's long absences and sometimes erratic behavior.The film follows the deepening relationship between Joe/Donnie and Lefty. A break between them occurs when Lefty's boss, Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), takes over Donnie as part of the power jockeying in the Mafia world. The internal Mafia family relationships seem more fragile in this film than in most gangster movies. After a particularly violent blowup within the Mafia, the FBI finally pulls Joe/Donnie out.There's a lot in common with other well-known gangster movies, including ""wise guys"" and Mafia-speak in arguments. Depp and Pacino have great chemistry in their screen relationship. Pacino is outstanding in his portrayal of an aging, tired cipher in the gang forced to look over his shoulder constantly. Anne Heche is excellent as the feisty wife fighting for her family. Most of the other gang members and FBI agents fit film stereotypes. Occasionally the script has some rough edges.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Better Than Most Mafia Films; Donnie Brasco,"I've seen every major Mafia film and dozens of minor ones. Most of them are just stereotypes, but entertaining to view. This one is much deeper than that. Its just short of The Godfather 1 and 2, but just as good as Goodfellas, Casino, and one or two others. Pacino is right on and this is Depp's best film of his career. I have panned him several times, but not for this performance; its very good. The supporting cast is outstanding; especially Kirby and the wife of Brasco. How insulting was the FBI to the real Pistone? You will have to see for yourself. The film will hold your attention from beginning to end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Starts vague, ends up being good.","At first I couldn't wrap my head around why this movie has a rating over 7 - it seemed as it was made by someone who wanted to make a mobster movie but hasn't ever watched one - just had someone vaguely tell him what's the point of them and the style they're presented in. At first I was of course how clean Johnny Depp looked - he sure didn't have a gangster vibe onto him. Apart from the small things - which there are many, it was laughable how poorly the whole getting Donnie into the mob thing was executed. A made guy hears about some guy with connections and instantly goes into business with him. After a few days he's all about putting his life on the line for him. It was just too rushed and it felt like anybody could simply join the mob by appearing at a cafe they reside in. When the Donnie - Lefty relationship thickened is when it got interesting. However, the movie goes quite a bit until that part comes. So I believe the last 30mins of the film are better than the 1hr30min before. The ending makes up for everything. All in all, worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of the mobster genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
underrated,"A great movie that probably doesn't get its due because of inevitable comparisons to Goodfellas (few movies match up against that competition).The added element here, of course, is the FBI infiltration by Pistone, played by Johhny Depp. This was the first Depp movie that made me sit up and take notice of him other than as a ""young"" star. He's actually playing two characters within the movie. FBI agent Pistone and wiseguy Donnie. What I like about the performance is that he does a great job as Pistone acting as Donnie, making you believe you could have fooled all these wary, paranoid wiseguys.Pacino as Lefty is another fantastic performance in what is now of the most powerful bodies of work by a male film actor. Compare this sad jamoke to his opposite on the spectrum of Mafia movie characters, Michael Corleone, and you have to remind yourself that it's the same actor playing both parts.The supporting case is superb, especially Michael Madsen and Anne Heche.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"I wish they didn't ""forget"" about the ending.","One of the best mafia movies among so many great films, but has a few flaws that could have been easily dealt with. Along the lines of scarface and goodfellas (although goodfellas is better), this film is about the rise and fall of a small time hood, with a twist. Good story, great acting, great dialogue, lots of humor (the burial of Lefty on the beach, not in a ""hit"", its funny), a good sum of drama, though the ending could have been more dramatic if we knew what happened to Lefty, but they didn't tell us. I guess,according to hearing the gunshot, we are to assume he was whacked, i just wish they would have told us. Also they could have gone more into the relationship that forms between Donnie and Lefty to make the film whole.

"Good cars, good clothes, good music...","While Johnny and Al are one of my all-time favourite actors, I was up to see this movie. It was just what I expected, an interesting story about an secret FBI agent(Johnny Depp) that was living a so called ""double-life"", as a though and cruel gangster with Benny(Al Pacino) and as a family father in a depressive relationship with his wife. Anyway, this movie got many interesting details that makes me like this movie more. First of all, the fantastic cars that they use in the movie! I mean, who does'nt like a 78' Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham? I liked it very much that they used almost one type of cars; the cadillacs(except for the terrific Mercedes-Benz and some other vehicles)... And then we got Al Pacinos clothes... Man, they´re really something... And the third point is the funny music. Comparing classical music with such songs like ""Disco inferno""(The Trammps) and ""One way or another""(Blondie) is a funny thing that makes the hole movie better.Finally, I think that all the actors are doing a great job, especially Al Pacino, Johnny Depp and Michael Madsen.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A wise guy's always right even when he's wrong, he's right.","Donnie Brasco is one of the last true old school style gangster films. I think it's more a gangster film than a cop drama. And it definitely has some kind of Godfather-Goodfellas aura. Tough mobsters making their everyday living. Only with this small exception that Donnie Brasco doesn't praise the violence and criminal lifestyle like The Godfather. All I knew about Donnie Brasco the movie that it was very acclaimed film with great cast from director I hadn't heard anything of. I can't say that Donnie Brasco is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen but it's definitely darn good movie.And Donnie Brasco has everything that one darn good movie needs: great story and screenplay, good directing and absolutely terrific cast. As much as I enjoy everything Al Pacino does, I have to say that Lefty is his best performance alongside Don Corleone (The Godfather) and Vincent Hanna (Heat). There is some depth in his performance. A beaten and disappointed man after all those years serving the family with the commitment and still being a running dog. He was tough man seen a lot in his life and at the same time he was a bit naive.Johnny Depp was enthralling as always. And his performance as Donnie/Joe definitely belongs into the list of his greatest.Michael Madsen is always good to see in a good movie. Unfortunately, it seems like this was one of his last good performances in his career (last ones are in Kill Bill and Sin City).Soundtrack is other thing I liked a lot. Original score that reminded bit Nino Rota's The Godfather score was mixed with the 70's disco. Very cool actually.Donnie Brasco is film that I would recommend. It's smooth and thrilling and you don't realize where those two and half hours gone. And it probably stays as Mike Newell's best film.8,4 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A great movie, but in need of a better ending","just watching this movie a total of ten minutes ago, i was actually surprised at how great it was. looking at the IMDb rating of 7.6 it really needs to go up. the story is based around an FBi agent (Joe pistone) played by johnny depp. he is drug into the new york mob wars and is set for investigation. the FBI sends him to a notorious, but less skilled mobster, (Ben a.k.a ""Lefty"" Ruggerio) played by Al pacino. further and further Joe is drug into the mob, until he seems to desert is wife and three children so he can please Lefty, because they gain a close relationship. The story shows the transformation of Joe, and as well as his relationship with Lefty. he soon forgets the FBI but in the end can not lose them. It shows the trials and tribulations of Joe, as he goes through the decisions of leaving his family and job and becoming a full time mobster. Depp and Pacinos performance in this movie was spectacular, i would like to see more of the two men together in the future. The characters are played skillfully and you actually think its really happening, and then it ends, which really ticked me off. i wanted to see what happened to LEfty, weather he dies or lives in the movie version. so there you have it i give it 9.5 stars, just needs a better ending",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Goodfellas Jr.,"It's the 70s in New York and Donnie Brasco, a young jewels experts, gets pulled into the mafia by an ageing gangster named Lefty. Donnie is introduced to people, given responsibilities, allowed in the know about the rules of the crime family, all that jazz. But not everyone is as they seem and soon inner quarrelling threatens the integrity of the family.Watching this film feels slightly weird if you've seen Goodfellas, like I have. Because they're eerily similar in their portrayal of mafia. Like scene for scene similar. There's talk about made men, my friend versus our friend, all that stuff. They even exchange wads of cash for Christmas, just like in Goodfellas. I get that that is actually how the mafia just might work, but it's still weird how much stuff is pulled from that movie. Because the stories are not all that similar at all. Goodfellas is about mafia from the point of view of mafia, whereas this is about infiltration, examining the mafia from the point of view of an intruder.And it's a good movie all around. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are both powerhouse actors, despite this being relatively early on in Depp's career. The story is interesting, the gangster world created is even more interesting and it just has style to it. Goodfellas perhaps portrayed the lure of mafia better, but this allows us to see the ugly underbelly of that.All in all worth a watch for all gangster movie fans.

All I get is a lion?,"I was so glad when Johnny Depp did this movie. It was his first role where he played a grown man who acts like an adult. That doesn't mean that he doesn't have some moments of bad behavior. It's about an FBI agent who went undercover by joining a gang. He became close with some of the criminals and worked with them for years. This was based on a true memoir, and one difference from the real life story is how the man, whose real name was Joe Pistone, was affected by life in the mob.

Another Spoke in the Wheel,"""Posing as jewel broker Donnie Brasco, FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone (Johnny Depp) is granted entrance into the violent mob family of aging hit-man Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino). When his personal and professional lives collide, Pistone jeopardizes his marriage, his job, his life, and, ultimately, the gangster mentor he has come to respect and admire,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. The film is ""based on a true story,"" and begins its action in November 1978.The old ""lawman infiltrating the gangsters"" storyline is really nothing new; but, Mike Newell's direction, and the great characterizations, are so good, you should become engrossed. Mr. Newell and writer Paul Attanasio focus on the relationship between young, upwardly mobile agent Depp and middle-aged Mafia middleman Pacino. Though there is, at least, one stomach churning (and vomit inducing) scene, ""Donnie Brasco"" is mostly a character study.Depp is excellent as the young man who both poses as, and becomes ""Donnie Brasco""; you can see the ""Joe"" character succumb to, and struggle against, possession by the ""Donnie"" disguise. Pacino is also excellent; he struggles with his age, receding position in the ""family"", and realization he may have made the mistake of his life (in trusting Depp).The relationship between Depp and Pacino is, perhaps, a little too vague. In my opinion, Depp sees Pacino's ""Lefty"" as a life he may have had, if luck and life had been different; and, Pacino sees Depp's ""Donnie"" as the failed promise of his lost youth. Depp and Pacino are award-worthy; and, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are supporting standouts. Ms. Heche's role, as Depp's increasingly neglected wife, is especially important. She explains her distance well, ""I pretend I'm a widow.""******** Donnie Brasco (2/28/97) Mike Newell ~ Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche, Michael Madsen",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gangster film directed by Mike Newell,"In 1997, two of the screen's greatest actors, Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, got together and made the true story of undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone, whose alias was ""Donnie Brasco,"" which is the film's title.It's not a movie you hear a lot about, as it probably got lost among the plethora of post-Godfather mob films. However, it's well above average for the cast and characterizations.Pistone risks everything to get in with the mob, attaching himself to Lefty (Al Pacino). Lefty isn't a big boss - he's a middleman, the one who takes all the risks and continually is passed over for promotion.Lefty takes Donnie under his wing, teaches him the lingo, how to dress, etc. All the while, Donnie is meeting his FBI boss for coffee and passing him information.As Donnie gets in deeper and deeper, his harried wife (Anne Heche), who rarely sees him, becomes disgusted. He is constantly disappointing his children.Soon he begins to identify with the mob, even speaking like them, more than he identifies with the FBI. And he realizes that once he comes out of the mob, Lefty, who brought him in and with whom he has a bond, will be murdered.Pacino and Depp are extraordinary together and give fantastic performances. Pacino isn't the powerful don as Michael Corleone was; he's a worker bee who takes orders. One feels sorry for where his life has gone.Depp's Joe is badly treated by the FBI - his frustration, anger, and confusion over his own feelings are apparent. They both elevate this film.Anne Heche does a terrific job as Joe's unhappy wife, who adores him nevertheless, and Michael Madsen is great as a big boss with more temper than brains.Mike Newell directs ""Donnie Brasco"" well, showing us the mean, depressing streets of New York, and the violence and stress of mob life, where your best friend can be the one who takes you out.It's not a glamorized picture of either the Mafia or the FBI. In fact, the two organizations have a lot in common. They're both lousy to their employees.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A great movie; fuggedabouit,"Hollywood has produced a number of classic gangster pictures, but this is unique because it shows the nickel-and-dime guys at work, and how sad it is that some of them think they have it so great.  In the relationship between Donnie and Lefty, it also brings in a DEATH OF A SALESMAN tone, which is also well done.  Pacino, of course, has a good history with the gangster, having played Michael Corleone, and here, he brings the same ability and restraint to someone 180 degrees from Corleone.  You may hate what Lefty does, but you won't be able to stop thinking about him.  And Depp matches Pacino point for point in this, his first real adult role.

"Donnie Brasco is a well-acted crime drama, but the predictable story line offers few surprises.","We've all seen The Godfather, Scareface and Goodfellas, so who needs Donnie? Johnny Depp headlines as Joe Piscone, an undercover FBI agent, who infiltrates a mob family using the name Brasco. His voucher is Lefty (Al Pacino), a third-rate gangster who has never climbed very far up the corporate ladder. Let's face it--Lefty will never make Senior VP in Bonnano Inc. Pacino plays it conservatively and actually manages to generate some feeling for this hit-man loser who lives vicariously through his protege/surrogate son. We can see the inevitable conflict coming a mile off, as the younger man becomes emotionally involved with his mentor, the revelation of Donnie's true identity growing ever more imminent. Robert Miano is the tough older godfather, Sonny Red, and Michael Madsen is a tough up-and-coming boss, Sonny Black. Black and Red? Those names don't sound Sicilian. Anne Heche has the thankless role of Donnie's ever-complaining wife, and Bruno Kirby is the Joe Pesci wannabe. Betrayal and loyalty are the conflicting themes scrutinized, but Donnie Brasco fails to make a wrenching impression. Mike Newell, a marvelous and intelligent director, goes a little soft here.

She answers God, etc. etc. It's a small dialogue, but actually I believe Depp thought he was God at that moment. The answers from his daughter are great if you follow that theory.Pacino reminded me of Dustin Hoffman in Midnight Cowboy. Loser till theend.

Fogetaboudit,"A mafia movie either makes for a stud or a dud.  To make a classic mafia film work, there has to be a great chemistry between the cast.  There is no doubt about the chemistry when Al Pacino and Jonney Depp are involved in the film `Donnie Brasco.'  Al Pacino plays the character Benjamin `Lefty' Ruggerio.  Lefty has been in the business for quite sometime, but still hasn't been recognized for the respect that he feels he deserves.  Depp plays Donnie Brasco, a young eager man trying to make his way into the mob. The twist comes as Brasco is a FBI agent named Joseph Pistone, who is collecting evidence to take down a New York mob organization.The main story line for this movie is a student/teacher relationship. Pacino's character takes `Brasco' in under his wing.  When a new person is introduced in the mafia, the person who brought him in has to take full responsibility for all the actions committed by the new gangsta.  So, Lefty takes a chance on Brasco, and introduces him to his boys.  I found it interesting and funny when Lefty explains to Brasco, `When I introduce you, I'll say this is a friend of mine that means your good.  If I say this is a friend of ours that means your dead.'  From day one, Lefty plays as a mentor towards Brasco.  He watches his every move to make sure his new boy on the job acts real gansta.  Lefty even tells him to shave his mustache off and start wearing suits, because that's what `real Mafioso men' wear. Everything is going as planned for Brasco.  He is gathering all the information needed to bring this mob down, and on top of all of that, he is the new hit man whom everyone can't stop talking about. Then the unexpected happened.  Brasco character was starting to grow attached to his new life, and he was leaving his wife and children behind.  He knew that if he blew his cover, Lefty would have to take the heat for it, and the other mobstas would kill him for bringing a rat into the group.  Brasco couldn't betray someone who he looked to as a father figure.  His marriage was falling apart, and he was growing accustomed to the Mafioso ways.  The only thing that could set him on the right tract is his family and other co-workers. Does he do it? Does he betray the only man he has known to be anywhere close to a father? This movie is based on a true story.  It is filled with suspense and drama that keep my eyes peeled to the TV set.  This movie is a good example of life, respect, and honor.  Some critics have mentioned that Donnie Brasco didn't get the attention it deserved as a film.  This film is Oscar material, but didn't get the acclaim for it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is an Al Pacino fan, and knows what a good mob movie is all about.  If viewers don't like the blood and gore of a mafia hit, FOGETABOUDIT!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This is the Johnny Depp movie I cried most,"Though I think Al Pacino is no doubt the best actor in this movie, Johnny Depp's performance is very good too. The scene which makes me heartache and touching is that when Al Pacino saw the picture of FBI agent Depp but does not believe he is. Pacino is really a great actor and he outshines everyone in this movie. But actually, I'm a Depp fans, so I want to talk more about Depp. In this movie I can sense the agony of Pistone, his love towards his wife,children,and his friendship towards Al Pacino. I cried a lot at the end of the movie. In China there is another gangster movie which won a lot of praise. But compared to this I found this one is more moving. Maybe Depp's character is very suitable for him to play in this movie. I saw a father who loves his wife and children. I saw a dedicated friend who cares so much about Al Pacino. I saw a great irony and agony when I saw the 500 dollar check juxtaposed with the sound of gunshot....I saw an FBI agent who got so stressed-up and nearly be driven crazy. Well done Johnny Depp. You've successfully conveyed all the feelings in this movie.I love watching your movies.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Excellent! Depp and Pacino are a great lead cast,"Johnny Depp plays FBI agent Joe Pistone. He assumes the identidy of Donnie Brasco and goes undercover in the mafia in the 1970's. the evidence he gathers will hit the mafia organization hard, but life for Joe gets severely complicated when he starts to befriend Lefty, (Pacino, excellent as always) who brought him into his criminal life.a very interesting film that displays the tallents of everyone involved. this one definately belongs on the shelves of the gangster fan. ****",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Slick like a made-man's hair,"Donnie Brasco is certainly an entertaining film. I has that depth that, sadly, many films seem to lack. All the actors come together nicely and gel well, however it is Al Pacino who steals the show.Playing a low-down mafia odd-job man, he sees his final chance to make an impact on the mob world. You really do feel for Pacino throughout the film. He longs to be a 'made-man'- a successful mafioso, but seems to be stuck low down on the ladder. His character is strangely pathetic- aging, and with a drug addict son. Even though he is a trouble making, gun toting, man hitting scumbag, you want him to be successful in what he does. A moral conflict without any doubt.Just a short review then, but don't think that the film couldn't have had a long one. You really should see this film, if just for Al Pacino's character. I've heard more than one person get in a flap about historical inaccuracies, but for the average person (ie. you and me), don't worry. Very entertaining and thought provoking, and a worthy 8/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Excellent film, superb acting","Donnie Brasco is one of my favorite films. The true life FBI story proved to be very captivating and the performances were excellent. Pacino should have secured an Oscar for his brilliant character role of 'Lefty' who is struggling to move ahead in the mob. I was also impressed with Johhny Depp's successful development of the Joe Pistone character who goes from a normal guy to a foul mouthed mobster. I've always thought that Depp, although not in a league near Pacino, is one of the most under-rated screen actors and this film is one of his better works. I thought the movie had a fresh and more sensitive approach to the mafia life, and the fact that it was a true story made it even better-of course taking into consideration the seriousness of the real life situations and consequences. It's a work of true art that brings depth back to the mafia genre.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of Depp's best performances,"Johnny Depp is my idol, and my favourite Johnny Depp film is Donnie Brasco. It reinforced my belief that Depp can't be `typecast', that every one of his performances is unique. The on-screen chemistry between him and Pacino is amazing, and even though it is more focused on the relationship between Donnie (Depp) and Lefty (Pacino) than portraying life in the mob, it is, in my opinion, the finest mafia film since the Godfather part II.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Forget about it"" - A worthy watch","Jonny Depp played Donnie fantastically, this coupled with the legend, Al Pacino (playing Lefty), were a perfect duo for this movie.Overall this is a good gangster movie with an interesting storyline set in the 80s. The movie explores the characters mafia and personal lives', with some cool scenes in both New York and Florida.However, I thought that the movie could have been bolstered with more 'action', and I also thought that the ending was fairly abrupt, i.e I felt as though they could have gotten slightly more out of the storyline they took so long to thoroughly establish. Kapish.7/10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
cool.  but the gangster genre has been really tired since godfather 2,"I really liked this movie.  Johnny Depp is wonderful.  I have loved him since 21 jumpstreet.  Al Pacino overacted in several scenes, but he is the coolest gangster (circa Godfather).  I really liked the way he could change from a gangster under control (godfather) to a two-bit hood(brasco).  very convincing.  kirby and pacino are very convincing together, especially here and in godfather part 2. see this movie, it is very touching in parts.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A undercover cop (Depp) deals with turning in his friend (Pacino) and trying to survive the gangster life at the hands of the new crew leader (Michael Madsen),"This film featured an all-star cast including Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, and Michael Madsen. But it leaves you wanting more. I expected to see a good gangster flick that dealt with the gangster life in the late 70's. Instead, I saw 2 hours of Depp and Pacino saying ""fuggehtaboudit"" over and over and over. Depp, as always, give a great performance as the undercover cop battling his own demons within. Pacino, however, isn't up to par. He is depicted as a ""good"" gangster with a family and who can't seem to catch a break, being ""passed over"". In the end, he is out shined by Madsen, who gives his usual bad ass, monotoned voice performance. Madsen, playing Sonny Black, plays a member of a crew who works his way up to become the head of the crime family. This would have made a much more entertaining plot, rather than the whole love/hate thing going on with Depp and Pacino. Overall, not a horrible movie. If you like Depp, Pacino, or Madsen, and are a fan of gangster/cop films, you should be entertained for the films 2 hour running time.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Intense Mob Thriller.,"Infiltration of the mob by a young FBI agent (Johnny Depp) leads to fireworks in this impressive little film from 1997. Depp gets immersed way too deep and the mafia knows that someone is not who he appears to be. The strong relationship between Depp and criminal Al Pacino is at the heart of this smart motion picture that works due to a clever Oscar-nominated screenplay and top-flight performances by the key players involved. Based on actual events ""Donnie Brasco"" is one of the more impressive films of 1997. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Superb,"Donnie Brasco is in the same league as Goodfellas; a modern classic. Moving, violent, funny and with some great quotable lines, this is a must see for all fans of Al Pacino, or Mafia films, or simply great cinema. Johnny Depp does a career best turn as the FBI agent that gets involved too deep.  Michael Madsen is quietly brilliant as Pacino's mob boss.  Worth watching simply to see Pacino wearing a tracksuit and watching nature programs on the T.V.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Excellent!,This was a great film and a gripping story. This must be Mike Newell's proudest achievement. Some people criticise it for being a 'buddy movie' but I think it is a realistic account of undercover cop work. Pacino is the perfect victim 'even a dog gets a warm piece of the sidewalk'. Depp is excellent and so are Madsen and Kirby. The film went into the inevitable but deceitful forging of a friendship between Lefty and Donnie. A classic!,,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Wow! GRIPPING!,"Now, there have been a lot of mob movies, but along with Godfather, Godfather II, A Bronx Tale, and Goodfellas, this is one of the five best mob movies ever made. Johnny Depp takes a shot at what I'd call ""normal acting"" and does great. Al Pacino takes the same look as a tough mobster, but in this, we see his soft side. He is just so powerful in that last scene, when he is being called for by Sonny Black.Only thing it's missing: Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci9/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Entertaining, yet disappointing","A very entertaining film to say the least, with strong performances from Pacino and Depp.  Depp continues to impress me with his ability to take on various roles, unlike Madsen who is very one-dimensional.  However I can't help but feel he will prove me very wrong someday.  Having read the book, Pacino is just too good in his portrayal of Lefty.  In this role he deserved an Oscar nomination at the very least instead of the Best Adapted Screenplay nomination (Sorry Paul)!  How on earth did that happen?  There are so many inconsistencies (story-line, characters) with the book it's very disappointing.  The movie does not do justice to the book; at least it should have been a mini-series.  Then again that's probably why the cover says 'Based on a True Story'.....  My recommendation, if you liked the movie, read the book, you will love it!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Superb Casting,"The main interest in Donnie Brasco is the characters and their relationships, as the film questions the hypocrisy of the mob's supposed principles of honour and respect. Pacino's character draws sympathy in a way that an old family dog might. One of his most subtle yet impressive performances as an ageing mobster. This is supported well by Johnny Depp as the protagonist. As the undercover cop in an operation to infiltrate the mob, we follow Depp's character in his descent into mob life. Depp proves his versatility once again; this is a straighter role than you might expect, but he does it as convincingly as he has done any other role. The support cast is less memorable, though Michael Madsen is typically edgy as the psycho-gangster. Director Mike Newell handles the pace comfortably, gently shifting from low to high tension. I would mark this as one of the most enjoyable films of the gangster genre, as stereotypes are largely ignored in favour of a more unexpected portrayal of gangster life.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good, solid mob effort from Mike Newell","Inevitably compared to Goodfellas, Mike Newell's 1997 effort, Donnie Brasco is just as good as Scorcese's film in many regards. The performances, including Johnny Depp as the title character and Al Pacino as his wretched wise guy pal, are flawless, with Depp great as the undercover FBI agent and Pacino in excellent form as Benjamin Lefty' Ruggiero. A less romanticised, more low-key look at mob life, Donnie Brasco follows Special Agent Joseph Piston, known to the mafia as Donnie Brasco, a friend of Lefty's who, unbeknownst to his mob friends, is collecting enough evidence to put them all away for many years. Too late, Lefty and his colleagues realise they've been had. Also coming to an overdue realisation is Joseph/Donnie who, too late, recognises his genuine affection for down and out Lefty and the predicament he's placed him in by befriending him. There are some justifications as to the Goodfellas comparisons, however: Bruno Kirby's Nicky sounds eerily like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito, even encompassing a similar kind of character. Moreover, the gaudy excess of Goodfellas is also on display Donnie Brasco, with the similar period setting and plot points (the bringing down of the mafia). However, the comparisons should probably end there, as they are two different films. In one of the funnier moments of the film (albeit, darkly humourous), Lefty (Pacino) laments to Donnie about being left out of the hit on their boss. This kind of tragicomedy also makes Pacino's character the more sympathetic of the two, I think. Lefty's greatest dream is to board a boat and escape his way of life. Although he underplays his role, Pacino still manages to overshadow every scene he's in. As a true story, it's also pretty fascinating; with the closing credits, we learn that the real Joseph Pistone, through his undercover work, ensured that 200 indictments and 100 convictions brought against the mob. An achievement for Pistonejust like the film is for Newell. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This is a terrific movie.,"This excellent movie gives us another look at  the evil yet fascinating life of mobsters. ""Donnie Brasco"" shows us the mafia from the perspective of the title character, a perspective that changes as the film progresses; from the outside at first, then a slow u-turn to an insider's view. Pacino is superb in one of his few mob roles (the Godfather films may have typecast Al). I haven't seen Depp before, except in ""Edward Scissorhands."" He is a fine actor in this role, although he does seem a bit young to be the father of three children. The supporting cast is believable, particularly Bruno Kirby. I rate this movie favorably with some of the best in the genre (GoodFellas, Miller's Crossing, Mean Streets",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Depp and Pacino make a Dynamic Duo,"DONNIE BRASCO (1997) ***1/2 Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, Anne Heche, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Zeljko Ivanek, Paul Giamatti.  Excellent true-life story  account of FBI agent Joe Pistone (aka Donnie Brasco, portrayed superbly by Depp) who infiltrated the Mob in the early 1970s by hooking up with world-weary father figure/hitman Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino in a sterling turn) who confides in him all he needs to be wiseguy with the stakes getting higher the closer they get.  Gritty, surprisingly funny script by Paul Attanasio and Mike Newell's smart easy going direction breathes fresh life into an otherwise been-there-done-that genre.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Frighteningly True Story,"I thought this was a great movie.  It's the true story of an FBI Agent working undercover in the Mafia.  The acting is great and very believable...""Forget about it!""  If you're into movies about Mobsters, I'd highly recommend this one.One thing that bothered me:  This took place in 1978 and they kept using touch tone pay-phones...I remember using rotary pay-phones well into the eighties.
